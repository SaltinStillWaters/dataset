Transcript for: Intro to Precalculus (Precalculus - College Algebra 1)
hey everybody welcome to the professor Leonard series on precalculus so since this is the first video I want to let you know what's gonna happen in this series so you know what to expect and you know how to progress through it so what precalculus is in most courses is kind of a combination of two classes we combined College Algebra and we combine trigonometry and both of those are incredibly incredibly important to your study in calculus a lot of teachers self included kind of say you take calculus to finally fail algebra essay than a joking matter because by the time you get there you should know your stuff you'll be fine with it but really there's some truth to that that people kind of make it through algebra don't really retain it sorry to make it through trigonometry but don't retain it and then calculus is very difficult when that happens so what I'm going to intend to do in this this series is to teach you college algebra and trigonometry so pre calculus in such a way that it sticks with you in such a way that you could transition right to calculus one and have a very very good chance of success so that's that's my goal for this so what you're gonna see in the video titles is you're gonna see the topic that we're covering you're gonna see precalculus which is the whole course in one kind of main idea a group together and then you can see whether this is a college algebra or a trigonometry concept in the filming we're gonna film college algebra first so all of the videos up until about 2/3 of the way through precalculus is going to be college algebra then we'll transition to trigonometry so it'll be a very clear kind of stop and start of those two subjects you need both you need both the college algebra and the trigonometry to be successful in calculus so whether you're taking precalculus or you're just taking college algebra or you're just taking trigonometry these will work for you as I'm going through it I want to kind of almost warn you that I'm not going to take a lot of background information for granted so when you see me review you're going to get a lot of that through this so I'm going to be explaining concepts that perhaps you should know but I'm not going to take for granted the fact that you do and so I'm going to be explaining what a function in its most basic form because these fundamental concepts as you're moving forward are extremely important to get perfectly right there can be no misconceptions with this stuff as we're moving forward otherwise you're you're sort of building information on a false premise and so if you build all this knowledge on something that's not really sturdy it's gonna collapse eventually so I'm gonna make sure that our foundation is super solid as we go through at this point you should have some beginning algebra you should have intermediate algebra sort of down I will be refreshing that that's what I was just talking about about kind of reviewing materials to go through but other than that you guys would be fine it's gonna be super fun it's gonna be a great course I just want to explain to you a little bit about how it's going so when you step into this college ultra first trigonometry those two things make up precalculus and absolutely necessary for success in calculus ones so I hope you enjoy the videos I'm enjoying making them and so we'll see you soon you 

Transcript for: Introduction to Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 2)
welcome to the start a pre-calculus or college algebra if you're in one of those two classes or you just want to study this to get ready for calculus which is awesome this is going to give you a lot of background information on what makes calculus possible and the math behind doing a lot of the calculus that you might have been exposed to or have forgotten frankly because we all forget things and that's okay that's what this course is intended to do is to teach it to you in a way that you remember or remediate you in a way that you can understand so to start off with pre-calc or college algebra we need to understand what we're going to be dealing with um so the the whole premise of this this class is that we're going to be dealing with functions almost exclusively in in college algebra and therefore pre-calculus so we're going to discuss in this video what a function is what makes a function a function how to determine whether something is a function and then we'll start exploring how to uh how to evaluate functions how to find the domain and the range of functions in in another couple videos so let's start with that most basic question if we're going to be dealing with functions what what in the world is a function and mathematically it's it's really kind of a our most simple sort of an idea that we can graph a function is something it's this relationship that takes one input and just Maps it mathematically to one output that's it you plug in one number you get one number out that's all a function really means now I always tell my students students face to face that some sometimes we know just enough information to make it sort of dangerous and we sort of um project other things onto a definition I'm not talking about one toone functions and we're going to explore that a little bit but keep this in mind that a function it's most basic sense and a one toone function are different things um so when we say a function don't add to this definition it's just a relationship that Maps one input to one output that's it so we plug in one number we get out one number now when we when we're talking about this when we're talking about our inputs and our outputs we're talking about functions for this course our inputs are almost exclusively x x values and our outputs are almost exclusively y values or F ofx the function that's based on that X we're going to talk a little bit about the independent variable and we'll talk about the dependent variable as we move on so so in this the the vocabulary that I want to get you to know is function what that means what are inputs and what are outputs what is the domain in the range and then this idea of independent and dependent variables so what we've learned right now is that a function is a very basic relationship it takes one number in it gives you one number or one thing one input in and one output out so our inputs are almost always X values they can be different but typically X's while our outputs are y values or F ofx values and we'll talk about that notation in just a bit I guess the biggest note that I want to get to get across right here that you that sticks with you is this right here in a function relationship a functional relationship an input never gives more than one output so if we uh if we start plugging in numbers and we go all right well let's um let's plug in the number four and sometimes this relationship gives you seven and sometimes it gives you -2 it'd be very hard for us to graph that because it wouldn't be Dependable um the the output wouldn't depend on the input the same way every time it' be really really difficult to to graph and to deal with it'd be difficult to count on that so can we do we have um these nonf functions that we can graph yeah we do typically we use parametric equations or some other idea to graph them sometimes different coordinates like polar coordinates which we learn about in like a calculus 2 level class but for right now in order for us to graph things well and easily we need functions we need it so that one input gives you one output and an input never gives you more than one output so long story made real short if you plug in One X you better only get out one y or one output one F ofx value so um a couple notation issues that we're going to deal with number one we typically see functions as either y or F ofx so when you see them when you see y equals something in terms of X or f ofx equals something in terms of X they mean the same thing they both stand for this function notation now we want to talk a little bit about what x means what that is and what Y is or what f ofx is so when you see that variable X that input value whether it's X or something else the thing that you're plugging into that input it's called your independent variable so in our case when it says y equals some function of X or when we're talking about a function of X that X right there that's what we're inputting that X variable that's an independent variable your input is always your independent variable why what's that what's that mean well independent is kind of like what we want to be we want to be independent people we want to make our own choices we want to self-actualize we want to determine what we're going to do we want to plug in our own stuff and that's what the independent variable gets to do so we get to plug into the independent variable we say I can put anything I want that makes sense we'll talk about domain the things you can plug in in just a little bit but but really we choose the independent variable first and then the output the Y the dependent variable well it depends on what we've chosen you don't pick your output and then find the input that works for that not typically typically we choose our x value we choose what we want to plug in we choose our in our input we choose our independent variable X and then our output is based on that so when we look at our functions Y is in terms of X or a function that's based on whatever this variable is that's your independent variable so in our case right here what we're talking about our input values our X values our inputed independent variable is X so X we call that our independent variable because you get to choose it now once you've chosen or once it's been chosen for you once you've plugged that in put an input or evaluated for that X variable for your independent variable whatever that is that input the function is going to turn something out the function is going to take that one value and it's going to give you one value out we call that value either the Y value or we call it an A F ofx value or a g of X or whatever the function is we call it that value so y or if we're using function notation F ofx I'm pause right here for a second please extrapolate from this if your function's name isn't F if it's like G or H that's still an output value so if we have a function with a different name and we're going to talk about why we have different names for functions in just a little while this lesson is just to get your your feet wet on what functions are that's why it's introduction um but extrapolate from this so y values and F ofx values they mean the same thing but if our function is a different name we might use G of X or h of x h of X depending on what that function is named um right there that might give you a clue as to why we have function notation because if everything's called why it'd be like everyone in the world be call being called Jim you go hey Jim and everyone goes yeah you go ah shoot man we need different names that's one reason why we have function notation so you can call one function f and one function G and one function H or whatever so back to this if x is our independent variable that you're plugging numbers into and your function is churning out an output that's either y or a function name of X depending on your independent variable this depends so this is this is um this is not a chosen value this is what you're given your one output dependent on what you just plugged in so this one you choose this one you don't that's why it's called the dependent variable now what's nice about this is together they make up an ordered pair so when you deal with a function and and you plug in a number and you get something out well well wait a minute our input values are X's our output values are y or F ofx and this is going to give us an ordered pair something that we can graph almost all of this class I'm going to relate back to graphing and show you that this makes sense graphically so when we're moving forward we know right now hopefully that from what I said before that we're going to be graphing functions and without a functional relationship one gives you one output it's very difficult to graph so I've already covered the Bas like hey we need functions cuz we can really only graph functions right now so what what's that allow us to do if you have a function relationship your independent variable your X your input is going to be the first piece of information on an ordered pairs it's going to be that first thing that horizontal axis whatever that is X or t something your output is either y or we could have X comma some function notation those are going to be the two standardly accepted um ordered pairs that we get input output it's all that relates to it so just a little 10-second recap to make sure you got it one input gives you one output in a function if that's not the case you don't have a function an input never gives you more than one output in a function relationship how we write it is either y equals something with x's in it or f ofx equals something with x's in it something with an independent variable something you get to pick to choose in uh to put in there and then your function gives you one output we call the in X our independent variable and y or F ofx the dependent variable because it depends on what you've just chosen let's go through one quick example to make sure that you're you're really seeing it that you're seeing what a function does so you might have a job maybe you don't have a job a lot of our jobs in society work on hours so the hours that you put in determines the pay that you get out you guys know that so if you work more hours you typically hopefully um get more pay well in this case I want you to think right now that what what are your inputs and what is your output do you input $500 and then get to work 25 hours if that's true come work for me I got a great job for you all right you pay me 500 bucks I'll let you work 25 hours it doesn't work that way you put in the time you get out the money so you put in 25 hours you get out something so I want to make a little relationship here and we're going to determine whether this is a function or not so some guy works 25 hours and makes $500 another person Works 53 hours and only makes $310 at first glance you might be going well that's not that's not right well do people have different jobs are do you make the same rate as everybody else for doing different jobs well that's no even in the same job sometimes someone might have more seniority and make more money based on whatever whatever the pay structure is so don't be confused that this doesn't make sense because it can make sense like that someone else Works uh 30 hours and makes $490 and another person Works 40 hours and makes $490 what I want to do right now is number one again determine the inputs and the outputs and you have to do that first because what we're going to check next is does every input give you exactly one output so that's the only things you check here to make sure that you have a function don't add to that definition so first our inputs I mean we be thinking let's see what what what's Happening Here what are we doing first and then what are we getting out of it we're putting in our hours first our inputs are 25 53 30 and 40 in just a moment because there really should be no suspense in math because you're learning right so in just a moment we're going to call those inputs the set of values that we're inputting into a function we're going to call that the domain the stuff we get out of it is called our range so domain is a set of our inputs I'll Define that in a minute range is a set of our outputs so so one more time we're looking at what we do first to get out something later our inputs are what we're plugging in first our domain this set of X values right here are our inputs our outputs are 500 310 and 490 that's our range now here's the only thing you got to check to determine whether this thing is a function look at your input and see if it gives you one output so if I work 25 hours do I make one value of money yeah I make 500 bucks if I work 53 hours do I make one value of money yeah I make $310 if I work and remember these can be different people uh that's why they have different rates if I work 30 hours can I make one value of money yeah 490 if I work 40 hours or someone else reach 40 hours do they make one value of money yes 490 this right here is a function relationship please don't get confused with the one: one function like I said sometimes we know just enough to misinterpret things what a one: one function is is when you plug in one number and you get out one unique number so in this case this wouldn't be one: one because you get 490 twice as two different outputs that's not the same idea as being a non-function all the function needs is I plug in one number I get out what number I don't care if we get the same number out every single time we could plug in uh this like different inputs and get the same number on a horizontal line forever so you plug in five and get out 10 plug in seven and get out 10 plug in 50 and get out 10 plug in a million get out 10 so we can do that in function relationships it's okay in a function to get out the same number twice that's okay the only thing I promise the only thing is one input gives you one output this input one output this input one output this input one output this input one output didn't matter if they're the same think about maybe uh maybe you and somebody else if they're making different rates of money could this guy work 30 hours and make that much money sure could this guy work more and still make the same amount of money if they have different rates that makes perfect sense that's totally fine this guy's just making a little bit more money per hour than this person is is that making sense you stop right now and think if that makes sense that this is certainly a function one input is giving you one output so right now what we have that's a function relationship and our inputs are 25 53 30 and 40 our outputs are 500 310 490 and we're going to rename those in just a bit domain and range now I'm going to change it we're going to see if this is still a function so let's say that we do all of this we keep it exactly the same and I add one thing all right tell you what uh I'm going to do this right there and so this guy's pretty happy right he's working 25 hours he's getting 500 bucks that's dependable this guy's working 3 hours making $310 no problem this guy's working 40 hours getting $490 it's he knows what he's going to get imagine being this person and I'm not talking about overtime I'm talking about where your pay you you've you've not agreed to a pay rate change and so you work 30 hours and your boss comes to you and says hey great great deal man I'm going to give you $490 today you're like woo that's awesome and then uh the next day comes to you or the next week he comes to you tell you what you work 30 hours but um I just feel like giving you 300 $10 and you're like wait wait a minute what he's like I just feel like it and you're like I'm not I'm not really happy with that why well because you hadn't agreed upon rate right you agreed to work 30 hours to make that much money what if he just feel or she just feels like giving you that much money and what if you can't depend on it and you never know well that's not a very good working relationship is it because you don't know what you're going to get out for your work that's exactly what a function has a problem with if you have more than one output for the same input it doesn't know what you're going to get out of it it's the same exact thing it's working for you right the functions do some work it needs to know what you're getting out so this right here this is fine this is fine having two different inputs go the same output that's fine this right here having one input go to two different outputs that is a no-o that's a non-starter for a function we're not going to deal with that in this class right here but this is a this would be a problem this would need something to redefine the scenario um so to make it to make it right and so later on we can do that in higher classes right now you you might say well this is a condition like here you're making whatever per hour and here you're making something different per hour and it depends on the scenario but as it stands right now this would be a nonfunction so we have inputs we have outputs one input gives you one output no problem we kind of went through this and said when do functions happen what do they look like what's a nonfunction nonfunction is when this case is not met when one one input gives you more than one output that's a big problem for us so with functions we have what's called a domain and AR range our domain is a set of all the inputs or all the values that the independent variable can take and get a real number out let say that again for functions we're not talking about imaginary numbers right now we're not going to be graphing those on a a real coordinate plane okay so what we're talking about for the domain is the set of these things that give you one of these things out that's a real number in other words the domain is a set of all the inputs that you can have for a function so right here if we just want to relabel this domain the domain is going to be the set of the inputs it's just 25 53 30 and 40 that's what we're choosing to work that's the hours that we put in the range is the set of the outputs for our y's or the whatever dependent variable is in our case if we just want to relabel this range our outputs are the range so the range of numbers that we get is a 500 390 and sorry 310 490 that's what we're talking about when we have the the idea of a domain and range domain is just a set of inputs that you can put into the function and get a real number out when we start talking about imaginaries we're going to we're not going to be really talking about functions that are graphing for a while but for graphical functions things that we're functions that we're graphing here and we graph those on a real coordinate plane our inputs is called The Domain the outputs are called the range so inputs X's we gr jump those together jumble those together group those together in the domain idea and all the Y's or f ofx g ofx whatever your function is that's your range I hope that makes sense what we're going to do is we're come going to come back with a few examples I'm going to show you how to determine um when a relationship even an algebraic relationship represents a function and when it doesn't so we'll be back in just a second all right let's continue so I have a few examples on the board obviously and we're going to determine whether these relationships even algebraic are functions or not and there's some really easy ways to tell sometimes it's I'm going to make it so it's pretty obvious to you so you look at and go yeah that's that's not going to work the key here is that with functions one input gives you one output and not more than that let's look at these two first just get a feel for it so right now what I want to do is look at the relationship s and look at the relationship R and I want you I need you to be able to pick out all your inputs and all your outputs so when we're looking at s remember inputs values are X values are independent variable values so our inputs here are -21 0 and 1 do any of those repeat at all so -2 1 0 and 1 there's no repetition this can't I don't even care about the outputs not at all because right now checking functions is does one input give you one output if an input is not repeated Well it can't possibly have a different output so when I say ne -2 what's the output for that it's 16 there's no other case where it's not 161 gives us an output of four zero gives us an output of three one gives us an output of four every input gives us one output now our output values here the 16 4 3 and four oh wait yeah the four is repeated but that doesn't matter this would fail to be a one: one function but it's certainly a function there's it's just a very basic definition one input gives you one output if we're looking at something that just has a series of points then sorry a sequence of points then if our inputs are all different we can't possibly have the same input mapped to two outputs so for S this is certainly a function how about R think through it on your own so just a little bit think through I need you to be thinking about what the inputs are right now we should be checking those so in your head you should be reading through those inputs going okay it's this this this and this maybe look at the outputs read through those four outputs and determine what those are and then make a decision whether R represents a function or some other type of relationship you should be thinking of it in your head right now um when I look through this and I see -2 3 5 and -2 but wait a minute -2 here is ma to 5 -2 here is ma to six one input that's the same number is giving us two different outputs that's a problem this is certainly a nonfunction because of these points right here -25 and -26 now I've been asked the question before what if that was a five would it be a function it'd be very awkward to write the same point twice you you wouldn't see it but yeah that would be because this -25 and if this number was a five -2 would still give you five um so we we'd look at that a little bit but you're really not going to see that U the point here is that every input is not giving you just one output in these cases these ones are fine these two not so much this would be a non-function I hope that's making sense to you now unfortunately um we don't always get stuff like that we typically get functions that are in algebraic form naturally so man how in the world are we going to determine that well there's a couple ways to go through it and once we make it to this these two examples it's going to be pretty clear so here's the idea if one input is supposed to only give you one output you can start by just plugging in a number to your independent variable like X so if you take and plug in something like two7 * 2 is -14 + 5 is9 oh hey that's one number you can try that and that's a really good indicator um that you're going to be plugging in one number all the time and get one number out does it work all the time no it doesn't um because sometimes we can have nonf functions where certain inputs do only give us one output but others give us more than one so it's better to kind of understand what's going on here there's two things that you really look for and they're really the same thing but they come in two different forms number one if you look at these four examples these three are all solved for Y which looks pretty nice and that's the best way for us to determine whether we have a function or not so normally what we're going to do is choose to solve our algebraic equations for y and we'll have a much better shot of determining whether it's a function function so this one looks really good this one looks fine this one looks well at least it's Sol for y it looks like crap but it's at least they're Sol for y this one not so much so part of this is reviewing how to solve things for a variable um especially when we get to this one right there I really need you to focus on that one so when we're solving for a variable we're undoing the equation everything that's connected by addition subtraction first and then we're going to undo um anything that's multiplied or divided so we would do things like subtract 2x now it from both sides and we get -4 y on the right hand side -2x + 8 then to get rid of the -4 notice how it's connected by multiplication we're going to divide you just need to make sure that you divide every single term by4 when you're trying to undo things connected by addition subtraction you're trying to get zeros that's what we did here we subtracted 2x because we wanted to get zero why because 0us 4 y can give us that single term4 y completely eliminates a term when you're dividing or multiplying you're trying to get ones why because if I get4 /4 giving us 1 1 * y it's an identity that multiplicative identity of one is going to give us back the Y so we're going to be dividing by four actually -4 and we have to do it on all three terms so4 /4 that's POS 1 that's what we're looking for because 1 * Y is y when we adding or subtracting you're trying to make zeros in equations when you're multiplying or dividing you're trying to make positive ones on the right hand side there have some sign changes a negative over a negative is a positive that's going to be 12 x positive over negative is a negative so we think a negative term we're going to translate that to a minus- 2 so let's see we've subtracted 2x no problem we've / --4 that's going to give us POS 12x - 2 now all four of these equations are solved for why they're in what we we like it's not function notation because we don't have a name of a function but it's it's really close it's how we typically like to see functions written with the dependent variable equal to Something in terms of the independent variable y equals something in terms of X here's what we're really looking for we're looking for a notation issue that's going to cause us to have two inputs when we plug in one number this doesn't have it there's nothing there that's going to give us two numbers for everything we plug in there's nothing here even though that's a power two that's not what we're looking for if you plug in a number this and you square it isn't that just one number plug in like three well it's nine okay plug in negative3 notice you're switching inputs it's still positive 9 but that's two different inputs you just plugged in I'm not saying Plug in two numbers and get the same number out out I'm saying if you plug in one number is it giving you one number out and the answer is yes plug in any single number here whether it's three or3 or 7 or positive 84 I don't care it's going to give you one output are you seeing what I'm talking about plug in a number here gives you one thing plug in a number here gives you one thing there's no notation issues that's uniformally going to give you two outputs for every one input here the same thing you plug in one number you're going to get one number out there's nothing notation that's going to give you two outputs this right here that's a problem and in general man that's what you're looking for something like a plus and minus where when you plug in one number it's saying oh yeah figure all that stuff out yeah how how about zero uh let's see 3 minus 0 is three of 3 is like 1.7 something so this is a number oh and then I take the positive version and I take the negative version that's two outputs but I only plugged in one number this is what you're looking for a lot of the time to determine whether you have a function or not so function yes function yeah function yeah we solve for y to make sure it was easier to check yes function no this has a notation issue that's going to cause us to have more than one output for every one input that's the big deal here this is a non-function going pause right there why I have your attention don't miss this sometimes sometimes people like to not understand fully and misinterpret what I'm saying this with the square root is a function it's not the square root that uh that messes us up here it's the plus and minus in front of it so that the square root here the square root of three is the square root of three or if I plug in zero but the square root of three is square of three but then I take a plus and minus the positive negative that's the notation issue that we're talking about do you guys see the difference in that this is fine this is for sure a function plug in one number you're going to get one number it's the positive and negative that says for every choice you're making I'm taking a positive and I'm taking a negative from that this is the issues that we're generally looking for so everything here is all good except for this one this guy right here is the only nonfunction that we have and I hope that I've made that really clear for you that because of the plus and minus that's that's a thing that's that's a problem now think think about it think about right now when do you have to put that on your paper do you remember like when you're solving stuff um often times we'll have square roots given to us and if if a square roots given to us it's fine you don't put a plus and minus in front of arbitrarily you just take it for what it is but when you're solving stuff and you get down to here you go all right um I have y^2 = X and you go how how in the world do I get rid of a power two I'm trying to solve for y and you go oh yeah yeah I match the power to the root so a square power would need a square root and you put a square root around both sides because what you do to one side you have to do the other this is fantastic because a square root cancels a square power they're inverse functions that's a power two that's a root2 I get a y on the right hand side to get a square root of x and your teacher goes and I go no no you stab me in the heart my little black math heart is hurting right now because that's not right you see in order to maintain the idea that when you square a number whether it's positive or ative you get a positive number out of it we have to have a plus and minus in front of that square root so here's the idea what I always tell my students is is this when you're the one who puts the square root on the paper which stems from I'm solving something from a power two when you're the one who does that takes a square root on both sides you have to put the plus and minus long story short if the square root is given to you you don't need it if you're solving for a square root or solving something that's squared and you take a square root you have to put that plus and minus that's a big deal not for a cube root not for an odd root but for even Roots yes now can you can you extrapolate from that can you look through this these last three examples and think about when we're going to have a nonfunction or not so take a look at it remember what we're going to do we're going to look at these and go hey I have it solve for y oh this one I need to solve for y we're going to solve all of them for y and we're going to look at our result so think about it right now if you go through the process of solving this for y are you going to have to take a square root if the answer is yes then you're going to have to have a plus and minus and right there it's going to tell you yeah that's not a function right here when you solve for y are you going to have to take a square root and answer is no no there's no y squ there I'm not going to have to take a square root therefore I can't have a plus and minus that is going to be a function how about this one think through it for yourself and go through the process in your head of solving that for what when you get down to the end are you going to have to take a square root the answer is yeah I'm going to so if I'm going to have to take a square root on both sides I'm going to have a plus and minus that's not going to be a function let's go through and see that in action so when we're looking through it we're going all right man now now that I know about square roots and I know that when I take them I have a plus and minus which is yielding two outputs for every input this is probably not going to work now we're going to practice or fine so that you get good at solving for for a variable but we're going to subtract 2x^2 on both sides by the way the reason why we're doing this right now is to make certain that we're not making little bitty errors when we're solving things for instance we cannot take a square root right now without getting rid of that three in front of the y^ S don't do it I see it all the time as people try to take a square root it doesn't work because that power two is associated only with the Y and not with power three if there's no parenthesis and therefore you can't distribute that power two onto that coefficient so we divide by three and get something kind of awkward oh really who cares if it's a fraction we're just seeing if it's a function or not and we end with a there it is y^2 -23 x^2 + 13 is that solve for y no no solve for y means I have y by itself no powers no no coefficients no nothing around it so when we solve for y right now we're going to have to take a square root we have to match the power of the root we have to do it to both sides and as soon as you put a square root on your paper wasn't there before you're the one who did it you needed plus and minus you don't need it on both sides that's redundant because we we would have the ability to get both the positive negative whether we do it once or twice on the left hand side we need just y on the right hand side we have have a square root we have a whole bunch of garbage inside but right here this that's the problem this right there is telling us that we do not have a function it's not a function because every time we plug in one number it would automatically give us two out systematically that's the issue I hope that's making sense right now I think I'd like you to do this one on your own so if you can if you want to pause the video and try that give that a try right now so see if you can just look at and tell me it's not a function and then see algebraically what's going to happen when you solve that for y so I'm going to start it now but you should be pausing the video and trying that so for us we're going to subtract X2 no problem you could of course add 4 y^2 and subtract one that's the same thing we're trying to make zeros when you add or subtract so 0 - 4 y^2 is- 4 y^2 on the right hand side we have x^2 + 1 before we take that square oh wait square root I know I'm going to a plus and minus I know it's not a function right now but before we show that we're going to divide everything by4 when you divide we're trying to get pos1 on the side that we're trying to solve for our variable so4 over4 is pos1 POS 1 * y^2 gives us y^2 on the right hand side a negative / negative is a positive so you can write that as x^2 over 4 or/ 14 x^2 it really doesn't matter Min -4 so we're adding the negative now lastly we're going to take a square root on both sides because that's not solved for y so when we do that square root both sides the whole thing I have to do a plus and minus it's solve for y that's good but when we do it we have this this expression it's not a function this St statement that's not a function it's a relationship it will give you numbers when you plug something in won't it so if I plug in something like one okay this is a great example if I plug in one right now or if I plug in negative one do you see how it would only give me one output do you see that so if I plug in 1 1 2 is 1 1 over 4 is 4 1/4 - 1/4 is 0 it's okay to take the square root of 0o it's just 0o and plus and minus 0 well that wait a minute you can't have both positive and negative positive Z and negative Z doesn't make sense it's just zero this is the what I'm talking about how you can kind of get screwed up if you just pick a number to plug in because if I plug in the number one or even negative one 1 squ is one also then it's going to give me only one output and I might make the um the mistake that this is a function it's not it's systematically taking every other value besides that and giving you two outputs so don't fall into that trap that's why we talked about how you can check a lot of times by plugging a number in but really we want to understand not just go through some process and plug a number in but really understand what's going on that's a nonfunction because for almost every input it's going to give us two outputs lastly that even though it looks weird is going to be a function it doesn't have a y squ there's no square root up there uh with a plus and minus in front we're not going to get one but I want to go through the process of solving for y to set us up for for a couple things uh when we get to exponentials and when we get to solving inverses which is much much later we're going to have to solve this sort of stuff for a variable like y so one idea behind doing that when you have y's on multiple terms here's the thought process stick with this because this is a big deal okay what I need you to do is get all of your terms with Y on one side get all of your terms without y on the other side and that's set up right here this has a y this has a y and these two terms don't so out of the four terms the two that have y's are already grouped the two that don't are already grouped now why would we want to do that well if you group all the terms that have y's and all the terms that you don't have y's are on the other side of an equation you can Factor it so the idea behind solving for something when your variable you're looking for is on more than one term group your terms with that variable on one side and all the ones that don't have it on the other then factor that variable what factoring does it creates something that's being multiplied you remember that we divide out and create a multiplication problem so if we group our y's factor and then we can divide so we've already grouped our y's since they both have a y as a common factor we're going to factor it that gives us just X plus 2 we're removing that y by division and lastly because that's multiplied because that's what factoring does gives you stuff that's multiplied together by going through the process of division the opposite of distribution because that's multiplication we can divide both sides by x + 2 and get y = 3x -1/ x + 2 now you can try it plug in a couple numbers if you want to it's going to give you one number out but the main thing to notice is there's nothing awkward going on there's no there's no notation that's going to systematically give us more than one output for every input we plug in I hope that this has made sense for you I hope that right now in your head you have uh the following things down like you understand what a function is and you could tell me either algebraically with points or with even a real life relationship what what is a function what is not you need to be there you didn't know that there's some notation that systematically causes non functions um the last thing that I want you to do is be able to solve equations for a variable especially stuff where we might need to factor or take a square root with a plus and minus you should have sort of a decent idea of domain so we we need to kind of associate domain with inputs X values and range with outputs y values F ofx but I'm going to I'm going to explore that more in a couple videos so hope that makes sense hope you're doing well I'll see you for the next video 

Transcript for: How to Evaluate Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 3)
I welcome to another video in this video we're gonna continue talking about functions but not really just what they are how to evaluate them and we're gonna go past just the whole plug in a number we're going to see how to evaluate them for different expressions and sometimes we call that composition of functions so this is exactly what we're gonna be talking about later on in the class we say let's compose some functions but right now we're gonna look at it under the lens of composition so the main ideas I'm trying to get across to you is that evaluating a function takes a function and replaces the variable the independent variable with something else whether it's a number or another expression it just replaces it so we're gonna we're gonna what we're gonna do is we're going to take the variable open it up with a blank space we'll talk about that will plug in something into that and then we'll simplify also what I want to look at as we're coming through this is when are there times when there are some numbers that we can't plug in and you've chosen it and say I want to plug this in and then the function is less you because it deals with either an imaginary number or some sort of a discontinuity something that says I can't even get out of something out of here it's undefined so we're gonna look at that so I'm trying to open your eyes to how to evaluate how to do the same exact thing we're evaluating numbers or other expressions variables in them how to simplify those things and then also a little bit about domain we're gonna start exploring how the domain works the last example is really important the last example because this is a precalculus class write a college eldritch leads right into it anyway we're gonna look at something called a difference quotient and it's a very very important concept in the first part of the calculus one when we talk about the slope of a curve at a point the difference quotient when they take a limit of that it's what gives us that idea it's called derivative and you deal with it exclusively in calculus one almost exclusive they tell you this one so let's start looking at evaluation of functions before we go on to just plug in things in I want to tell you and show you why we have two different notations that represent the same thing so for instance y equals negative 7x plus 5 or f of x equals negative 7x plus 5 that's the same y equals 3 halves X minus 1 G of X equals three halves X minus one these two functions and likewise these two functions and they are functions notice no square root with weird plus and minuses know why swear nothing to solve for these are all functions these two functions and these two functions respectively represent the same exact thing the reason why we prefer to have function notation is is twofold number one it's so that we can distinguish it I think I made a joke about Jim in last video like if everyone's named Jim you say hey Jam if every function was named y it'd be very hard for me to distinguish between them now ignoring these that I use the same exact letters let's say that just look at this and say hey check out the function f f of X there's there's no ambiguity as what I'm talking about I am talking about that function or say look at the function H of X we're talking about that function or look at the function G of X we're talking about this function it names them by a name f or G or agent not a great name some one letter but it names them by a function and not only that it's more descriptive of what you're dealing with when you see a function letter - followed by a variable it's telling you what the independent variable is that you're looking at so this is hey there's gonna be a function I'm gonna identify it by this letter F and more than that it's gonna be dealing with a variable X so this is the variable I'm gonna look for the second reason and equally as important is that it's more expressive in what it lets you do when you evaluate so if I tell you plug in two you could all plug in two and say or let X equal two or evaluate the function for two so let's plug in two can i plug into here oh yeah clearly I can we get negative seven times two plus five and we would get y equals let's see negative seven seven or six negative 14 negative 14 plus five looks like native nine let me go great white was native night that's perfectly fine we plugged in number two we got on an answer or output negative nine we could plot that point to negative nine it's it's great but this function notation gives us a bit more you see and here's the whole thing we're gonna be doing so please watch us it's not trivial when I give you this notation F of two that f of two tells you exactly what to do I don't even need that phrase it says I want you to look at the function f got it I want you to look at what the variable is Oh X's okay cool and that's why there's X's over here and I want you to replace this X with 2 notice the notation the notation literally tells you what to do says in the function f replace your independent variable two here's the function f with an independent variable X it says I want you to replace that variable with two wherever you see it so it's more descriptive and what it wants us to do so this says hey I want you to replace the variable with 2 that's negative 7 times 2 plus 5 no problem it's the same exact math guys the same things we've done but it's describing it better and then it says hey when you plugged in the two you got out 9 it says here's your function I want to replace the variable with two no problem I replace the variable with 2 it showed me not only when I get out of it but also what I plugged in we sort of lose that over here so sorry boom you sort of lose it over here don't we so unless you read back and knew what you plugged in and you were just given this information you would not know what you plugged in you would not know your input this notation gives us both the input and it gives us the output and if you read it left to right it will give you your or impair as well so again the reason why we use this because we can talk about different folks on the same page and understand that the each have a name and they're not all just Y or Jim and also it's much more descriptive it tells you what your independent variable is it tells you what you can you they want you to plug in for it and then it tells you descriptively what you got out so this says I had an input of 2 I had an output of negative 9 and it's given us an ordered pair right there so those are reasons why we use function notation and because of those reasons it allows us to manipulate our evaluation a lot nicer it gives us a manner in which to do this so here's what we're going to do for the rest of these again what we're exploring is are there some numbers that don't work so some domain issues can we plug in things other than just numbers can be evaluate for other functions that's composition and yeah we can't and what's the best way to do that so we're going to take a look at that so it's let's consider H of X so say hey I got a function whose name is H I have an independent variable X and that's all we see all these X's over here that's the independent variable that we're going to evaluate we're gonna replace that and just like we replace this X with 2 we want to replace this X with whatever I tell you to do or whatever the the the book tells you to do or whatever whoever it's giving you this stuff is telling you what's do there's just me so this says I want you to look at this function and replace the X with negative 1 for the first problem or negative X for the second problem or X plus 1 for the third problem before we go any further it's really common for students to try to do all of this in their head I get it we don't spend a lot of time on it but man that leads to just a multitude of problems so I'm going to give you a really really clear way on how to write this verse two-step process how to write the function first so that you evaluate it properly please to follow this I promise it'll work better than just do it on your head what are we essentially gonna do yeah we're gonna put negative 1 here and here yeah we're gonna put negative X here and your X plus 1 here and here but the way that we do this in structure in your head I can help if we do the phone relay so whatever I know what I know and functions it that is that the variable is the only replaceable thing that we have and so if we want to replace it well maybe we start by giving it a blank space like like Taylor Swift right she's got a lot of blank spaces and I'll write your name so what we're gonna do is we're gonna replace that variable with just a blank space that allows us to plug something into u-men you know what that's the way math works anyway these variables are plug in a bull so if we take this negative 2x squared plus X minus 1 they say the negative 2 is not something I can ever change but my variable the thing that can vary is X and if I take that X and I say hey that's the only thing in this function that I can actually replace let's just let's keep it blank for now in your head right now I need this and this to be exactly the same thing for instance if you were to plug in the value 1 you would put it here and here if you were to plug in the value 1 you put in here and here and you would get exactly the same thing out does that make sense to you like if the variable is the one thing we plug in for that I can replace it for this plug in spot this blank space that we can write anything we want that's important now why do we use parentheses every time well parentheses maintain operations so like they maintain multiplication and maintain exponents they also maintain signs so we can plug in negative they maintain that for us so the first step when we're evaluating look at your function how do you even care what's here right now look at your function and replace your variables big blank space give it some sort of parent that it looks fresh replace it with a blank space so negative 2 got it X no blank spaces squared yes this stands for x squared and if we wanted to write all math as blank spaces instead of variables you could it just get really awkward so we kind of use a variable to represent a blank space that's what they mean they can take any value a blank space can take any value same stuff plus plus X now let's give that a blank spaces I'm going to plug in something for that minus 1 minus 1 that's a constant it can't change then what we do once we replace the variable with a blank space we're gonna look at what they want us to put in there it says right here says I want you to replace X so in your blank space put negative one and that's exactly what we're going to do so we put a negative one everywhere where we have that blank space and then we evaluate it just be careful okay just be careful when you're evaluating don't go so fast you're making mistakes follow the order of operations for instance we don't want to multiply here we want to exponent here so negative 1 squared is C positive 1 positive 1 times negative 2 is negative 2 plus negative 1 minus 1 negative 2 plus negative 1 so we did negative 1 squared is 1 1 times a 2 is negative 2 plus negative 1 minus 1 is negative 4 what I would like you to do is write that as an ordered pair we had an in point when you were given a real number input we're given negative 1 we got up negative 4 and that would be a point on that graph that's an upside-down parabola and that's gonna be one point on that graph so when we're evaluating you're just looking at you say okay I'm going to replace the variable with something it's telling me right here but the appropriate way to go through it is don't do it in your head it might be OK for negative 1 but when we get these expressions especially stuff like this it's really hard to get all of that down all at one time and not make mistakes on so are you seeing this as a valid method like just replace your variable with with a Taylor Swift blank space and then write the appropriate name in there in this case it was negative 1 why I want you to learn that is because it works for everything like ever so if I want to evaluate H for negative X I'm not even gonna look at the negative x don't let that confuse you don't let that ruin your your math day ok all this says is all this says is take your function H ok ignore the ignore the negative X for instance if I said I don't want you to plug in anything I mostly leave a blank completely blank whoa is a blank space and I could take this a safe I want negative two and I want an open spot for necks here's Mayo two here's an open spot for X plus another open spot for X minus one and all it's having to do is say now I'm gonna put whatever's here in here if there's nothing there that would be nothing there that's what the blank space comes from if it's negative X like you wanted then after creating a blank space for your variable we're gonna take whatever's here we're gonna plug it into the variable spot or the blank space in our function and lastly we're going to simplify as much as we can so wouldn't we simplify that again just like we squared negative 1 we would square negative x so negative x squared is negative x times negative x negative x name is a positive x times X is x squared so we get negative 2x squared plus negative x you need to know that when you're adding a negative it's that's the same definition of subtraction so negative 2 times x squared minus X minus 1 and that's exactly what this function evaluated for negative x would be why do we learn that who cares about negative x well in just a while probably 12 beads in just a little while we're going to be talking about even functions and odd functions what are those don't worry about it no but this is how you test for an even or odd function or neither if you plug in negative x and it gives you the same exact thing as your function you have an even function if you plug in negative x and it gives you every sign opposite as your function you have an odd function and it's a mix up of those things you have neither so if you want to look at it right now that's the same sign that's a different sign that's the same set up that's an either that's not even that's not odd that's how you determine it so that's what I want to be able to do that we want to be able to plug in negative x and test for either odd how about X plus 1 let's do that hey you know what you should try right now you should take your phone and when I'd love it if you could replace your variable with a blank space so don't worry about the X plus one don't even I don't care what that is right now whatever it is malignant I replace the variable with it like that's that's how evaluation works I've been with negative one I would have done if it's a zero I did it with negative X we do the same thing with X plus one it's one sort of creature that we're gonna put in there so don't worry about it right now create your blank space so we do negative two blank space squared plus blank space for a variable minus one this now represents exactly the same thing as H of X I just opened up my variable because the variable is the only thing you plug in a thing into anyway now I look back and say well what do you want me to plug in well I want you to replace the variable with X plus one so in that blank space we have X plus one this is going to take a bit more simplification than the previous ones because we're gonna have to distribute and so when we're doing this you know that's a bracelet when we're doing this you would square this first please for the look so don't give me x squared plus one begging you'd have to distribute this first and then you'd have to multiply by two and then we add X plus 1 and the minus one so I'm gonna deal with the X plus one squared first X plus one squared means X plus one times X plus one you cannot just give me x squared plus one it doesn't work this is x squared plus 2x plus one that's what this X plus one squared would do now if we take the native two times that so I've taken X plus one and squared it I figured out this expression I'm now taking that negative two plus X plus one minus one I would distribute this first that's negative 2x squared minus 4x minus or because I'm sorry minus two because we are distributing to all of those three terms plus X minus plus one there's no sign change there's nothing to distribute minus one then we can combine our like terms so that's negative 2x squared minus let's see there's no like terms of that I have a minus 4x and then plus X that's minus 3x I have a minus 2 a plus 1 and a minus 1 those are gone I get a minus 2 this is what this expression would be so H of X plus 1 works out to a different function it's a composition of functions and it would be exactly that that's what we mean by evaluating functions you can do put in numbers you can put in expressions you can put other functions it doesn't matter you can put in whatever mrs. finally face if you want to you put a smiley face in the variable spot it doesn't matter there is just symbols guys so keep that in mind I hope you're seeing the value of that blank space it will allow you to evaluate anything that you want even composition of functions what we're gonna do now is we're gonna move on I told you a little while ago that what I'd like you to see is not only how that that blank space for evaluating is really nice but I also want to start exploring something that we deal with in calculus and some things that would help you see domain issues as these two so I'm gonna move a little bit quicker because the the fundamental idea is the same we're replacing the variable with with a number or another function so let's let's give it a try I'm still gonna be looking at oh oh I haven't said this one true/false this is a non function because it has a square root this is a non function because it has a plus or minus yes that's a little bit so the square roots themselves are fine so we have some notation issue that would systematically give us two outfits for the input that we'd have a problem that right there's a function what I'm asking you to do here is take that function and replace the independent variable in two spots with five and then zero and then to X and then X plus 801 we're gonna learn some things about that let's start with the five so I'm taking my square root that can't change this says don't even worry about these things they're all going to look identical I'm going to replace the variable with some sort of a blank spot a blank space so that it allows me to plug in or add I wait so this says hey x squared minus 3x or something squared some some new value squared minus three times that same new value and it tells you right here what to plug in for that and that's five so when we evaluate f of X for five we've made our blank spot we've then looked at what that was it plugged in there twenty-five square root this group is going to be there five squared is 25 minus 40 is 10 this would actually give us an ordered pair we plugged in five we got out the square root of ten that's a point I hope you guys get the point this is something that's gonna be on the graph of that square root it is going to be there what about zero now we're starting to learn a little bit about what you can and can't do what about zero if we take the square root of x squared minus 3x that's a bunch of that and say I want you to evaluate that for zero so I want you to have some blank spaces something to plug in for so the same exact thing we just didn't notice all of these are gonna look identical it just depends on what you're plugging in keep that in mind I don't care what this function is you do it exactly the same way you're going to replace the variable the blank spot and plug in what I tell you or what the function is telling you here if it's gonna be zero so I'm going to plug in zero and zero and that says away then zero squared 0 minus 3 times 0 that's also true that's a zero is it okay to have the square root of zero is that okay the answer is yes the square root of zero is fine and we can prove that because the square root and the square are inverses in zeros square gives you zero then the square root of 0 is also 0 that's fine zero whereas 0 therefore the squared of 0 is is a valid that's a real number this would give you 0 and so in ordered pair would be 0 0 you plug in 0 you got on 0 that's gonna be actually the starting point of this graph or an end point of the graph that you want to call it that alright moving on I hope you feeling good about it try the next on your own try to take this right the function give yourself a blank spot and plug in that to X and simplify this good work for you to do for us rounder right now so I'm saying I don't really care what this is I don't care I just know that I'm gonna replace the variable with that thing so I'm going to create this open cavity this blank spot for me and I'm going to replace that X or that blank spot with whatever's in this parenthesis so here's 2 parentheses this says this is what you put inside that notice it's also input this news that's convenient so 2x + 2 X and when we simplify that like I think I told you at the start of our the introduction to that this series is that I'm going to try to do several things that I'm teaching you I'm gonna try to remediate when I'm trying to point out common mistakes one of those is that when we square expressions that are multiplied together we need to know that exponents do distribute but only across multiplication and division never addition subtraction that's true for all distribution distribution distribution of one mathematical operator is always distributed across something below it just one level below it so for instance exponents distribute across multiplication division well multiplication division distribute across addition subtraction that's what it works so yes we can distribute that it has to go to both the two and the X and you're done what that's done it's just evaluating this function for 2x or replace the variable 2x and simplified now why that why that this is the start of learning about something called the difference quotient I mentioned a little while ago that the difference quotient in math it looks a little different I'm gonna do one example but how it actually goes how hell goes and what you would do with it when you get to calculus one but this is the start of it so we need be really really proficient at evaluating X plus h in some sort of function now it can look really confusing the first time you see it and you go like that how would I do with that do I just add H at the end no imagine that this was anything else any other number like seven or 2x or whatever or not even there what would you do with it what would you do with your function if I said set this up so that whatever I put here you can put in your function you create a blank space just like what I'm showing you you create this something squared minus three times something you would give it an open door for your variables so that whatever I tell you you can then fill it in that would be a great way to do it so when I tell you if I want you to fill in X plus h you don't have a place for it you do X plus h and you do X plus h and we're good to go now it does look funny because there's more than it looks like there's more than one variable I will talk about in the difference quotient is and what we do with it later but it looks like there's two variables can you still simplify it I hope so I think so we should be able to we should be able to take this and square it X plus h times X plus h let's see that's x squared plus 2x age you can do it x times X is x squared X plus h x plus h bar sorry x times h x times h has two x times h plus h squared this right here is what I'm going to have for here so we just squared that we distributed it we combine some like terms - let's distribute that 3 3 X - 3 that right there is as far as we can go right now there's nothing else to do we're not going to do anything with that right now but it's good practice on being able to evaluate so keep that in mind it's super important going forward that you can replace a piece of your function your variables with another function like X plus h last one here's where we learn a little bit about domain have you tried it yet I hope you have at least thought about it try plugging in one or evaluating this function for one so take it and give it any blank space and - 3 times with makes nice and go alright yeah that's exactly what we've done every other time let's just plug in 1 now then you go 1 square is 1 1 minus 3 is native to is the square root of negative 2 possible it's a trick question is it possible yes is it possible over real numbers no and so how we're defining our domain right now our inputs that give us a real number output since that's not a real number we would say that 1 is a problem for us one's gonna be an issue because I can't plug it in and get a real number a graphical number out because we're talking about graphing functions that's a problem so right now in your head I'm trying to build something I'm trying to build that not every number is possible to plug in to every function we have these domain issues and in general we look for them in two spots one of them is going to be numbers that give you negatives inside square roots not cube roots that's fine but numbers that give you negative inside square roots are going to be problem embers they're outside the domain in general okay what do you want what do you want for square roots well we we have to have the inside of the square root 0 so we talked about this one or more 0 or positive and so we're going to start defining that notice what I'm not talking about please make a note here notices how the number one is a positive number it's not negative but when I plug it in it gives us a radicand the inside of the radical that is negative that becomes negative that's the problem so this is an issue right here so when we look for square roots we want numbers that make the inside positive this is a problem for us so this would be outside of our domain we can't plug in one this would be a non real number it's a magic number but we can't deal with that so I want to start thinking about that right now lastly for goodness sakes you should be doing that on your own you really should try these pause the video see if you can plug in 0 value for 0 or x squared or 5 or this is a little weird we'll talk about that one but at least the first three now I'm going to do it right now but you should be positive ok so G of 0 G of 0 says take this function of G of X replace the independent variable X with 0 so I'm going to give myself a blank space to do that I always use a parenthesis because it makes operations and it maintains a sign I never have to worry about it even here I'm using parenthesis we always do that and it says now that you've replace your variable with a blank space something to plug into I know what to plug in I can plug in a 0 2 times 0 is 0 plus 1 is 1 0 minus 5 is negative 5 so this gives us 1 over negative 5 or negative 1/5 that's perfectly fine you can write an ordered pair 0 comma negative 1/5 now is that in the domain is 0 in the domain is 0 a valid input for this function did it give you a real number output yeah negative 1/5 is fine that's a real number it's not imaginary it's not undefined it's something that we can plug in to get a number out how about x squared same exact idea we can take our function we can replace our variable with a blank space something that we can plug in 2 we now say hey I know one plug in it's telling you right here to replace your independent variable X your blank space with x squared it's really not even much to simplify here all I did was want you replaced that variable with something else and they even told you so when we replace that best to x squared plus 1 over x squared times 5 and you're done there's no simple there's no factoring you can do no canceling out for goodness sakes don't cancel out your x-squared you're done that's all that that's asking you for is to compose two functions to put one inside the variable of another that's it mm-hmm now five we start we go right I know how to do this I know I'm gonna take T PI function and replace my variables with something so I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a blank spot because that's what we do right that so we do we plug things in we replace our variable with that thing so we imagine that we replaced our variable we give a place to put that we plug in five because that's what it's telling us right here it says replace your variable with five and then we simplify and on the numerator we get a little tip so it's ten plus one yeah let it over zero let me go yeah that's that's zero right oh whoa hey God have you seen have you seen this before some of you may know them all of you probably have heard this at least but maybe don't understand why you can't divide by zero so I'm gonna take a moment and teach you this if you don't know it can you do zero divided by four well if we understand that the denominator of a fraction is what you cut something into so like imagine pizza can you cut a pizza into four slices sure you can there's a pizza with four slices can you then take zero of them yeah yeah it's called a diet you just don't eat the pizza it can you take zero out of four slices mm-hmm it's a diet how much pizza have you had you've had no pizza that's possible that makes sense now imagine it next one okay imagine this says you have no pizza no you're doing to have a slice this says there's nothing there and you can't imagine like my kids do like a fake pizza all day long right it's delicious so good no no this is there's no pizza and yet you're literally taking four slices this doesn't even make sense you can even draw a picture of that here's your picture there's nothing there and now take four of that how much have you don't have zero because you can't answer the question this says you have four of that okay that's what that's trying to get says no you don't have zero its dancers non zero because this question can't be answered this says you have nothing there and I need you to take four of that how much do you have you know I can't do it it's not even defined you've defined no pizza so when we get to something like this it's it's not a real number it's I think an imaginary number but it's undefined so when we start talking about the domain what we're looking for are the numbers that we can plug in that give us real numbers and defined numbers out so is five in the domain yes give us an out it's zero in the domain of that function yes it gave us a real number out is one in the domain of that function no it gave us a new real and imaginary number out is zero in the domain of this function sure is five in the domain of this function no because it's not even defined that the answer that outputs not even defined so this would be outside the domain one thing I want you to understand before we go any further what I've tried to show you is that you're going to deal with until we get to logarithms to issues with our domain number one is square roots we really have to make sure that the inside of the square root is always positive and then we plug in numbers that make that happen the second issue is with denominators we can never have an input that makes zero on our denominator those are the two problems that we need to address moving forward those are the two issues that when we talk about domain in the next video are gonna be really like neon sign saying you're gonna have problems here square roots and denominators and I promise you this if there are no square roots and there are no denominators your domain will be all real numbers in tele2 logins so all real numbers there's no square roots as no numbers square roots we're gonna have some problems do not we could have some false denominators we could have some problems there those are the issues we're gonna be looking for notice one more thing really quick is that you can't have zero on the denominator but plugging in zero could be fine notice I plugged it in it's not about Zero's about what you get out of it so that's about it as far as our our domain talking the last thing I think I've raised here is is this don't confuse this problem with affecting your input notice that this says I'm not affecting my input at all here are places a five here at plays an x-squared here a place of the zero I'm not changing my input at all what that means is to take your function and just put a negative in front of it that's all that does now you can move that negative around you can distribute it to a numerator or it's an honor but not both or you can leave it right in front of your function so either way going that I hope that makes sense I'm gonna come back with one example this is kind of an optional thing for you I would definitely watch it we're gonna talk about the difference quotient one time all right well we got one more example we're gonna talk about the difference quotient and it's something that yes I just felt different like it's subtraction there's the difference quotient like the division you oh man new math guys are really unoriginal because you can call things just what they are and it's right like a difference of squares has a difference in has two squares here is a difference quotient because it's got a difference and we're dividing that's that's what a difference quotient it's is this thing now I'm going to tell you what it's used for after we after we solve it and then I'm going to tell you what the H does because it's it's gonna be quite interesting so know I catch anyone we do know here's what this does what this does in calculus once you're learning calc one right now kind of this is this would be precalculus but the idea that this is going to yield is a count one idea here's what we're doing the function itself is an output value do you see it like f of X is an output value do you understand that and f of X plus h would be an output value of whatever this happens to be so I'm subtracting out the values and dividing by the change between X and X plus h that little bit eh what that does is if I divide Y values they change in Y by a change in X do you remember what that what that gives like from forgetting from beginning algebra if I take this distance and divide by this distance that's a rise that's a run the HIV that run here what this does is gives a relationship for the slope of a line really doesn't look like slope it is sloping output to minus output 1 over the change between our inputs and that's exactly what that would be this is a slope formula in calculus 1 what you do is you say what if the H gets really small like what if this distance gets closer together like really close together what's going to happen well this these points would get really close together and one of the theorems and calculus is that if you take a limit as this distance approaches zero then this formula approaches the slope of a curve at a line and instantaneous rate of change very fascinating but that's we're going through I'm going to stop there because I'm not really going to teach you calculus right now just watch that one I do but you're going to see this right off the bat and how to evaluate it is incredibly important I'm not joking I've taught calculus now for my 15th year of teaching and I see the most mistakes right here people do not know how to deal with that you are not going to be those people so how to deal with this f of X plus h man can you see why I gave that to you in the second to last example on the last less whiteboard examples that we had it's because you're going to use it so here's how to appropriately deal with this difference quotient number one you're going to figure out what f of X plus h is that's just a valuation you're gonna keep f of X it's right there totally told to you you're gonna put them in here with parentheses and simplify it as much as you can your main goal is to cancel out that age somehow so let's go through it not quickly but but with some understanding of what evaluation means so what I need you to do here is figure out f of X plus h first figure out f of X second and then jam them together in this difference quotient so here is f of X and from X plus h I'm leaving this blank on purpose because I need you to know that this is no different from any other evaluation we've done it says take your function give it a blank space so let's see I'm gonna replace the independent variable X with something I'm gonna replace this infinite variable X with something so I'm gonna give it a blank space to do that in your head right now this and this need to be the same this x squared plus one says something I can plug in two squared plus one this blank space says something I can plug in two squared plus one I just let that link to illustrate that you can do anything you want to plug in 7 here or five here what a needs you to plug in is X plus h so I'm replacing the variable X for that blank space with X plus h here's a function f I'm replacing X with X plus h you know most people do this this is going to happen I see it all time they'll say Oh f of X plus h is super easy it's just I'm going to take the function f and just add H to it I'm gonna take this and add H that is not what is going on that would be like saying I'm gonna take three plus one it's four right and say I'm gonna do three squared plus one plus one it doesn't make sense like take your three plug it in and add one to the end we're not adding the H to the end what this means to do is replace the variable with one other thing X plus h non-separable I hope that's making sense that what we're doing is we're replacing this X with X plus h so we gave it a blank space and we just put the exposition in blank space simplify this thing now not later do it right now so when we simplify X plus h squared see X plus h times X plus h we distribute we've already done it x squared plus X H plus X H and then H squared we wrap it up combine some like terms x squared here's one x times h here's another x times h and here's an x squared so I'm going to get two x times h plus h squared this is exactly what f of x plus h is and then plus one so be very careful we if we distributed this we have this part right here was the X plus h squared that we multiply the X plus h on special stage we distributed and then that plus one has to be there so this is this whole part and that plus was at the end we just distributed this to here and then added that one I hope that makes sense to you now the difference quotient really relies on two different entities and puts them together in a difference it says now look at your f of X plus h so I need your f of X plus h I need you to simplify it first so distribute it combine some like terms this piece comes first we already know it and then we subtract f of X but we know those two things f of X plus h after expense of the Pfizer right here and f of X is this piece right here all the difference quotient does it says I want you to take those two entities I want you to put them together so we have to have the f of X plus h simplified there whirring subtract f of X I can't stress enough how important that parenthesis is because what's going to happen is because you're subtracting this you're subtracting every term in that f of X it's going to change all science I see it all the time man I've done some really long time the biggest thing is number one people don't know what to do f of X was H number two they forget the parentheses because they don't think it's important it's super important so let's let's put together the first term calls from f of X plus h and that's this big thing so x squared plus 2xh plus h squared plus one that is f of x plus h that what that's what we got that's what we simplified that's what that represents - the next piece is f of X of tank f of X plus h done - done f of X oh wait and the VIX has already gotten done it's given to me you doesn't work for that it's just an x squared plus falling can you see how easy it would be to accidentally do this did you see how easy it is to do that do you know that that's going to that's kind of drive you nuts because the main goal here the main goal is to cancel that H in order to do it every term up here must disappear must cancel out with the exception of those terms that have age so what's going to happen we figure out f of X plus h we've done that simplify it we've done it we put f of X plus h minus f of X in parenthesis and then we simplify all of our terms without H should cancel then we're going to factor H and cancel the H let's look at it so there's nothing to distribute this is x squared plus 2xh plus h squared plus 1 minus x squared and look minus 1 but this says that once you subtract everything in here once you subtract the x squared I want you subtract the 1 all over H our X Squared's are gone that's wonderful our ones are gone oh it's wonderful 1 minus 1 all that's left is 2x h plus h squared over H completely admit it everything on the numerator every term up there has an H in it we can factor them and what we know all about simplifying so if anything is multiplied together and has a common factor you can simplify it H divided by H is 1 1 times 2x plus H is just 2x plus h and you know what in the world does that mean and this is a problem with teaching math sometimes in the way we do it we don't tell you what that means we just say just do it because it's gonna be good for you here's what that means and this is going to be absolutely fascinating to you I hope it is I really hope it is some of you are going to be taking this class just because it's required of you but you have to realize that this class is entailed to get people ready for calculus here's what this does if you've done this and I've already told you this represents a slope between two points right and the H is the distance horizontally between those two points if I do something called a limit which is a way that we get closer and closer to some number in math we go oh what a little closer a little closer what happens if I let that H become really close to 0 if I let that edge right here become really close to zero then 2x plus something really close to 0 it's just gonna go closer and closer to X okay who cares well when you consider that this function right here is a parabola upward nobody shifted up one looks like that this is that parabola and as that H it's really little this becomes 2x so this gets closer and closer to 2x what that tells you is that depending on the x value if this is the slope and the slope simplified all the way down to here then you can find the slope at any point on this curve what I think so or curves head slopes they do but they're instantaneous and at every point change and so at any point that you want let's say let's say at two one two that would be four right so five five i plug in x equals two let's see x equals two maybe four plus one is five right there I'm we're not to scare or anything I'm just doing this for fun at this point if I plug into having yeah the number five that's the point two five if this is the slope at x equals two so at the point 2 comma 5 will be equal to that will have a slope of two x where your x value is 2 so 2 one more time the point on the curve is 2 comma 5 the slope at that point at the instant on that curve is going to be just plug in the x value it's based on X it is the slope I told you that's it so it is a soap plug into it's going to be 4 and you know what if you put that up there I saw it with 4 over 1 1 and up four that's the exact slope of that curve at that specific point before that it's gonna be steeper after that Masumi sorry before that's gonna be shallower after that's gonna be steeper but if that one point it's gonna be so lovely exactly for that is what you're doing this for so that's why we learned some of these compositions that's why we learn the difference quotient because the calculus one you do this time time again I have to give you one caution it's that right now that was fairly mathematic but easy if it is not easy compared to some things that we can have if you try to do difference quotient with something like this it's gonna be really really really challenging so square roots make these really challenging and fractions make them really really challenging to fortunately we have a lot of stuff in calculus that you don't have to deal with that with but you might run into some examples when you're doing something known then that have that so they're a little challenging I just want to give you the before warning that this is possible this is what I would expect is for you to be able to understand what this means and be able to put f of X plus h which we have f of X which was given and then simplified so I hope that makes sense I hope I've Illustrated why you would use this and what what we're kind of driving towards so that's that's the idea hope makes sense I will see you for another video when we talk about domain and we talk about range in how to phone you 

Transcript for: Finding the Domain of Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 4)
hi welcome to another video in this video we're going to discuss domain and how to find it for functions that are defined over real numbers so let's get right to it the last video we sort of explored domain a little bit I gave you a definition for it we looked at what we can have for inputs they give us a real number output now right right now when we say that a real numbered output we can have functions that have outputs that are imaginary numbers or complex number to find over the complex but for things that we normally graph we're going to restrict this to functions that are defined over real numbers and that gives us a pretty clear definition of what domain means so let's check it out what the domain is for us is the set of inputs of a function so these numbers that I can plug in that give us a real number output something that's not imaginary and something that is defined so not the function divided by zero and that the function can handle and that's that's the later in the class when we talk about some functions it can't handle like negative numbers so we're gonna discuss that today we're gonna look for the two main problem areas that we're gonna focus on and then there's a third one that we get down the road so when we talk about domain you got to keep that in your head so the set of inputs that give us a defined real number output for a function there's two problem areas that we really look at now down the road when we start talking about logarithms and we're not quite there yet well we'll get there in a little while logarithms are gonna add one more sort of problem area that we have to consider it's not really a problem it's just something that we have to consider that hey there's some numbers that I am NOT able to plug into logarithms there's also some numbers that I can't plug into square roots or in general even roots or denominators so when we think about square roots and denominators something in our heads got it again we might have some issues with these things so let's explore those today we'll look at a few examples on how to find domain what to be thinking about and what not to get confused on so again one more time we got this thing called domain it's a set of inputs that give us a real number but for a function and for now there's two areas that we will look for later on we'll add logarithms to this but for right now we're going to really be concerned about square roots and we're gonna be concerned about denominators of fractions so in square roots if you remember this when you have a square root it can be zero that's what we explored in the last video when we evaluated and said hey can you plug in some number that gives you zero inside of a square root yes that's fine can you plug in some number that creates the inside negative the answer's no so when we see a square root in our head we think the inside has to be positive it's really optimistic function it's all going to be positive what that means is if we plug in numbers that make the inside the radicand of our square root that make that negative those are problem numbers so what I'll always like to tell students is that a square root is going to tell you what it wants to have so it's going to give you this this range of numbers as interval of numbers this domain of what numbers it wants to have a denominator when we think about that but denominator just says what it can't have it can't have numbers that make the denominator equal to zero so when we're filling this out square roots the inside must be positive it's telling you what numbers it wants to have it says give me these numbers so I can maintain my positive inside denominators well they're not they're not about positive we can have fractions that are positive or negative or zero on the numerator there's only one thing that we worry about with fractions it's that the denominator cannot be equal to zero and if we keep that in mind we'll have a much better shot of finding domain right now I just need to warn you students get these things confused a lot because they really they see it a couple times but they never really understand why it is that that you need these cases met and therefore they they confuse us and they see square roots and they go oh man I gotta I gotta set that equal to zero and then solve it no no that's not what we're talking about or they'll see a denominator and say oh I need that positive why that doesn't make sense so let's understand really what is going on here when you have a square root if you end up with a negative inside of that square root that's going to be an imaginary number and since we are talking about functions over real numbers that's a problem for us so how do we avoid real numbers is it by making it equal to zero well no no how do we avoid imaginary numbers and complex numbers is so how we avoid that instinct with real numbers is that we find numbers that when we plug it into the square root it keeps the inside of the square root zero or more in other words positive and zero so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a look at our square root and say okay that's a function I'm looking for the inputs they give us a real number output I'm gonna say I couldn't give a rip of this thing equals zero that's fine having a square root equals zero is okay so if we plugged in let's see like five fourths and we'd have five minus 4 times 5 fourths would be five minus five and give you zero that's totally fine but we can also have numbers that make it positive so we're not looking at the idea that let's set it equal to zero we're really thinking about what a square root needs to have what a square root needs to have it needs any numbers that are gonna keep this positive and so how we find it is really we take the inside of the square root and if you let it be what it wants to be the inside of your square root it wants to be positive it wants to be greater than 0 greater than zero and math is the way that we say positive we also know that we can have numbers that let it equal to zero equal zero so in general we set the inside of our square root greater than or equal to zero please don't ever set this thing equal to zero and solve it you're confusing a denominator idea with a square root idea now some teachers might have taught you to do that and say well then you got to go back and make it inequality that's really bad form because sometimes when we divide by negatives our inequality has to change I've seen a lot of students miss that so long certainly a real short there's two problem areas there's square roots and there's denominators for now later on going to add logarithms to that that list of domain issues we've got to deal with so for square roots we're trying to tell the domain what it needs to be to keep the in set of square root positive to find that we say well what does the inside want to be the inside wants to be greater than or equal to zero the inside wants to be positive let's find the range or interval of numbers it does that you know I mentioned to this to you in in the first couple videos that part of this this series is reviewing some concepts that we often forget one thing we often forget is that when we're solving inequalities there's one time when you have to reverse the inequality it's not when you add or subtract someone you get a negative it's when you multiply or divide by not even when you multiply or divide just when you multiply or divide by a negative number so when we're solving this and we subtract 5 and get a negative 5 that's totally fine we get a negative 4 X greater than equal to negative 5 there's no reason for us to reverse that inequality but as soon as we divide by that negative no matter what we get over here when we divide by negative that action reverses already quality so greater than equal to becomes less than or equal to notice something real quick if this had not been a negative we would not reverse that inequality even though we're getting a negative on the right-hand side that does not matter so dividing by the negative or multiplying by the negative which we see much more rarely we don't really see that a lot because of the way that we structure solving equations but if we divide by a negative negative 4 divided by negative 4 is X negative 5 divided by negative 4 is positive 5 fourths but because we divide it by a negative don't even have a positive number we are going to reverse that inequality and here's what this says to you if you really think about it internalise what's going on right now the square root wants to be positive the inside wants to be positive or greater than or equal to 0 so we say let's give it what it wants let's let it be grand equal to 0 let's solve it and when we solve it it says as long as you meet this condition here you're going to have numbers inside your square root that are positive that's what we want so with a square root maybe this makes more sense right now a square root tells you what it wants to have that denominator is going to tell us what it can't have so it's a different logic there and when we say hey the domain is this there's a few ways to write it before we go any further I want to make sure that you understand one one more thing about this notice that there are be a lot of negative numbers to satisfy this so X is less than five for the set means like well 1.25 and less than that so one would be a valid number here zero is fine you plug in 0 square root of Phi that's totally totally fine when you plug in one you get one screw one is one when you plug in negative one well five minus negative four would be nine square root of minus three so negative numbers are fine to plug in notice that we saw last video too that if you can plug in negatives into a square root that's okay as long as the result that you get inside of it is positive or at least zero so this includes a lot of negative numbers that's not the point of square roots you don't say a lot of plugging positives sometimes that doesn't work like if we plug in 10 10 is a positive number but 5 minus 20 well that's negative 15 sorry that would be 45 minus 40 that's negative 35 square root of negative 35 is an imaginary number we can't have that square roots tell you what it wants to be so it wants to be positive we solve it and then this right here is the interval of numbers that are going to give you a real number output for that function so because yeah it wants me this solve it down that's going to give you real numbers and that's exactly what the domain is for us the two ways to write this are you can write like this but more appropriate than that it's set builder notation it says I'm going to tell you that the set of numbers that works in my function or that the inputs will will give you a real number output are based on the independent variable X that vertical line is pronounced such that so X such that X is less than or equal to 5/4 and this right here gives you a set of numbers that works as inputs do you see it do you see that says hey if you replace your X such that X as anyone of any anything in this range of numbers so less than or equal to 5/4 it's going to be a positive number and we know the square roots of positive numbers are they okay those are all real numbers that's what we're talking about the other way that we can write this is with interval notation interval notations where we use those brackets in the parentheses we say well you know what if I had an interval of numbers with 5/4 it says X is less than that 5/4 that's this way because it has that equals I include the number 5/4 with a bracket and this says any number between negative infinity that's way over here to 5/4 this will be an input that's going to give me a real number output we always use parentheses for infinities because you can't actually obtain that number we always have these in order from left to right just like a number line is so we start small number and big number even if this is verse from that way we start 5/4 and end it positive infinity the equal sign determines whether we have a bracket or not that's got to make sense right now so inputs Manor domain we want square roots to be positive we solve it down um there's two ways right the domain the next one so that doesn't have any square roots but it certainly has a denominator this is the other place that we look we know that denominators can never have zero on the bottom or a fraction sorry fractions can have zero in the denominator we can't ever divide by zero and get a real number out that's an undefined situation so this really takes care of the two problems that we have number one well we can't deal with imaginaries number two we can't deal with undefined numbers in functions to graph them now that does determine some things about graphs but there's not going to be a point there that we can get out and that's what we're really that's that's really the point is that what does your output for all of these numbers well there's going to be some numbers where we don't have an output that's a real number or don't have an output that's even defined it's going to create a vertical asymptote for us when we get to graphing level later and talk about graphing a lot so when this happens when your denominator is equal to zero for some numbers it's going to create this thing called a vertical asymptote in logarithms and square roots it just says you you can't even get a number out it's not that it's undefined it's not even valid for this function so that that's a different story and that's why we handle them different again square root tell you what you want to have you want numbers that are positive so rule logarithms actually with denominators go I just can't have this equal to zero so when we approach it we think about it like well do I care if the numerator 0 you know what if the numerator is zero what that actually means is that so that's where if we have any x-intercepts it's gonna appear there where your numerator equals zero is your 10 ourselves your domain on the other hand is really only a one problem for fractions if your denominator equals zero so how we approach it we look at again you know what I'm gonna have problems if I set my denominator equal to zero that's gonna be a problem the one problem we can even have is if t cubed minus 16 t actually ends up being equal to zero so we're going to set this equal to zero understanding something about it that the numbers I get here are bad numbers there are numbers that I cannot use their numbers that will be outside the domain because they're going to create a zero on the bottom sort of idea that's an undefined value for an output so we can't include them and we'll deal with that in the domain right now so let's solve it whenever we're kind of reviewing what you can do whenever you have a power to power three expression that's equal to some numbers or some some equation here you might try to factor it so factoring says put your polynomial in order and it is our exponents are descending factor out a GCF so think about a number and/or a variable that divides all of your terms like t t divides both of these terms after that out alright well and then you keep going factoring something like a one-and-done sort of thing so we factor out the T no problem we have this can you factors T squared minus some number of answers always yes I know that we're taught that you can only factor these if that is a perfect square that's not true if this number is a perfect square it does make it easier and that you can factor this as t minus or the square root of sixteen and t plus the square root of 6 over and that's true but if that number is not 16 some people will take this and say i cannot factor that and that that's not true in this class so when typically when i teach like a intermediate algebra over the class before this I'll tell them that this is possible it's just that we probably have not covered square roots at that point once you covered square roots we didn't understand that this can represent that T squared minus 5 because if you square the square root of 5 you're going to get 5 well then if that's the case then we can factor it and that's perfectly acceptable in this class so if you have T squared minus some real number you're going to factor that moving on so once we once again this down so we looked at this we said there's no square roots that great so but I'm not thinking positive I'm thinking I know that with fractions my denominator cannot be zero so I'm setting it equal to zero understanding that what I get out of this are numbers that I'm going to exclude because those numbers these one two three values that are going to give us zero on the Donata they're they're bad numbers for our domain in that I will not be able to get a real number output so using the zero product property it says you got three factors they're equal to zero if any one of these factors equals zero it's going to create a true statement in that equation so T equals zero no problem T is zero and then if either these are I don't even care zero times whatever is going to give us zero if t minus four equals 0 or in other words if T equals four for this factor 0 I don't care what these are because 0 times any other two real numbers going to give a zero and lastly for the same reason T equals negative four all these things right here and you see it if I let these T values be evaluated in that function then this is going to be some number either 0 or 20 or negative 20 but for each of those three values my denominator is going to be zero that is not okay we can never divide a number by zero even zero over zero is an undefined value what that means is that you're going to have a hole in your function would be and that's that's that's going to be 30 videos from now 20 years from now that when we get a 0 over 0 idea it's factorable and cancelable you're going to get a hole so your function is going to be going along it's gonna get a hole and then continue that's what that number does for you the other two numbers these numbers you just can't plug in any of them you can't have a zero that's bad number denominator zero gotta kick that one out if T equals four at a uniform your numerator is gonna be some either positive or negative real number and your denominator is going to be zero that creates what's called a vertical asymptote what the fourth is a vertical asymptote a vertical asymptote happens when you have this wall like a force field and your function goes up to it and says up I can't I can't cross it I can't touch it it's like MC Hammer man doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo can't touch this that's what that vertical asymptote does it says your function cannot cross that Y what because at that value your function is not even defined there is no point at the value T equals 4 and likewise at the value T equals negative 4 now I don't know whether it's going to go to positive infinity or negative infinity but it's gonna go to one of them that's what these values do I know that's a lot of stuff in a short amount of time but there's so much to learn about our domain most of the time we just figure out a process and we go with it we never really get it and then later on it really keeps her but because you'll get into some other stuff where domains extremely important and frankly it kind of hasn't been until we get to like this level and further in calculus domain readily important what you can which you can't click in because sometimes we get answers and if we assume that domain is all real numbers we're going to be very very wrong so I'm gonna give you a little recap to make sure that we're okay even though it might seem a little basic right now it's super important to understand these two issues very very well so number one domain is a set of inputs that form now because we're talking about real numbers must give us a real number output that means square roots because they have the potential to give us imaginary numbers or a problem area for us to look at and denominators because they have the potential to create an undefined area sorry undefined number value are a problem for us to look at notice cube roots are fine you can have negatives in humans or v roots or 7/3 or odd roots even roots like square roots four through six years those are all going to have that same issue those will be problems we're gonna have domain issues there no there's a difference between square roots and denominators square roots we we solve these domains or we find these domains by letting this be greater than equal to zero because we think about it a square root needs to be this it needs to be greater than or equal to zero notice that needs to be it wants to be this this is the the definition of what makes a square root work over real numbers is set a greater than equal to zero it's going to give you an interval of numbers that is going to work for you that's going to create the inside positive it's going to give you a real number result output then now there's our backwards developers don't deter don't aren't given by what you want to have it's given by less you can't be so with a denominator it can't be zero so we said equal to zero and solve it down and say these things are not okay if I let those happen I'm gonna get some bad situations for us as far as the domain now graphically they do help us so we we need to use this to graph I already told you that's going to be a hole those two gonna be asymptotes if you have zero over zero that's a hole a little removable discontinuity something that's just a missing point these two things are vertical asymptotes we're gonna learn a lot about it but as far as domain is concerned those are problems that we must exclude notice this says what I can't have what I must have to make it work this is what I must not have to make it work do not confuse the two so for our domain we can say X not X why is that wrong why is X wrong remember that this first thing in set-builder notation is an independent variable so my variable changes I need to change that and say look for T's okay what can t be T can be all real numbers except for but or and and then we list our exclusions and we say you know we've got to exclude some values because they're gonna create some undefined results for us that's T equals 0 and T equals negative 4 and T equals positive for those three numbers are the only numbers in the world power 3 says we have at most three results our three says these three numbers are the only numbers in the world that they're going to create a denominator equals zero and therefore an undefined result for us in this function it doesn't matter about positive or negative it's a fraction they can be positive or negative don't confuse a square root with the denominator idea how we'd ahead man how we do this for the mineral notation is it's fairly ugly you see when you exclude one number how we do that in math how we do that with interval notation is we say all whole numbers would be this check it out all real numbers would be that's all real numbers from negative infinity to positive infinity no problem if we want to exclude values from that then we're going to insert 4 little exclusions well how do we do it we insert an exclusion by putting this order and saying you know what I can go from negative infinity all the way up to negative 4 but parentheses exclude values brackets include them parentheses exclude them so this would be like negative four point zero zero zero zero zeros zero zero zero zero for a long way there with one and say you have a negative force not included and then we start up again at negative four but a little bit more than that so this says hey go from negative infinity up to negative four but just before you get there now just after you've left negative four and that's what excludes this this point negative 4 then you can go all the way up to zero notice it's in order but you gotta exclude the zero and then you can go up to four but then you've got it excluded before but then you can continue on square roots give you an interval says what you can't have denominators say here's an interval and it says what you can't have done two different ways that's got to make sense before we go on any further so we need the idea of inputs this domain we need the idea that it's the set of values that's giving you a real number output and if you think about that it really should just follow directly that square roots want to be positive because negatives give you imaginary can't have those it's got to follow that denominators can't be equal to zero because if that happens we do something that's undefined we're going to come back with just a couple examples to be pretty quick going through and exploring these ideas a little more remember that later on we're gonna add one more scenario to this for this class and that's logarithms logarithms fall into the same category of square roots and that they the inside the argument wants to be positive so if you're dealing with that right now all we need to do with the inside of a logarithm is set it greater than zero it can't even equal zero so logarithms the inside has to be positive because of the way it comes from an exponential when I take a number to an exponent a positive number to an exponent I always get we always get positive numbers out of that and since our basis for Exponential's are positive or our output for Exponential's has to be positive and therefore input for logarithm since they're inverses have to also be positive so that's that's the other domain assuming we deal with it much later and I'll explain it thoroughly when we get there so I'll come back a little bit with two examples okay so I lied I said two and then three examples because I really want to deal with that one two we just talked a long time about what inputs are as far as our domain and that these inputs need to give you a a real number output for your your function and if that doesn't happen well then you're you got to exclude them somehow or tell tell the domain what it has to have in order to make this dysfunction work for you and we looked at two problem areas we looked at square roots and denominators and I said there's gonna be another one logarithms I'm gonna kind of hide it for now we're talked about later when we get to logarithms and really really explore those so what happens if your function doesn't have square roots and it doesn't have denominators and it doesn't have logarithms in it well then your domain is all real numbers for every polynomial that you have every polynomial with it without that's things without square roots that's things without fractional exponents there are radicals like square roots that's things without fractions where you have a variable on the denominator notice I don't mean fractions like this fractional coefficients like three bits that is not we're talking about talking about fractions where you have variables on the denominator you don't have square roots you don't have fractions on the denominator where variables on the denominator you don't have logarithms your domain is going to be any real number all real numbers so if you look at this ago hey no fractions at all no square roots no logarithms your domain is all real numbers so help me write that we can say X set to X is a real number or X such an X is all real numbers or X such that X is that's you can use a block letter R for all real numbers or we can say interval notation negative infinity to positive infinity that's another way that we can say all real numbers and what that says is plug in anything you're going to get a real number out and that's true for that function if we move on to something like this though man is nasty there's a lot of stuff going on there don't be confused when you see both fractions and square roots what we deal here is each of those issues independently so you don't have to put them all together we're going to on that one I'll show you it's a nice little little trick we can we can use but you don't have to do that we can think okay well I have a denominator and I have a square root let's think through both of those so let's do the denominator first what do you know about denominators well we know that denominators equaling 0 is a bad thing for us I could put in any number here for the denominator as far as the denominator is concerned as long as it does not equal 0 so when we do this when we see a de number it's telling you there's numbers that I can't be okay so there's numbers and I'm plugging in here that might be issues so we're gonna set this equal to 0 with the understanding that it's a denominator if it equals 0 I'm gonna have problems so when you add 4 and say hey that number for obviously is going to create a 0 on the denominator I mean care what's on the numerator right now if that not if this function we allow if we allow this function to have x equals 4 as an input we're gonna have an issue right here that's a problem issue so we say we must exclude 4 so setting the denominator equal to 0 not greater than or equal to equal to 0 says you're going to have some bad numbers here or numbers that you can't have your domain and that one of those numbers for now we look at our square root and we understand that something's switching we're not worried about 0 so much or worried about keeping it positive because we need real numbers oh yeah real defined numbers this would create an undefined number let's think about here I need values of x that keep this part of my square root greater than or equal to 0 they keep it positive or 0 well what's that going to be we solve it it's gonna give us a range of numbers some interval that's gonna keep the inside of my square root positive and that's what I need to have happen to get a real number out of that square root so if we add 15 we do not switch any quality ever when we're adding or subtracting and divide by 3 we do not switch the inequality unless we divide by a negative this says that as long as you have numbers greater than or equal to five you're going to keep the inside positive as long as you keep the inside positive you're going to get real numbers out of that square root and that's what we need do you see the difference between how we treat denominators and how we treat square roots you've got to see the difference one is about keeping it positive so that you get a real number the other one the denominators about not letting equals zero so you don't get something undefined and understanding that understanding that we need real numbers out that are defined is how we approach dealing with square roots and those fractions now we'll put this in a well we will put this in the domains all right set builder notation X such that and we're gonna put both these up there right X needs to be greater than even with 5 and X cannot equal 4 and we're done and your teachers probably to go think about this for a second and not that you're wrong all right not that you're wrong but that it's redundant look at how this says X needs to be greater than 5 and look at how that says X can't be 4 then you go all right so we know right we know that this has to happen we have to have that in order for this to even give us real numbers but then it goes oh yes but make sure you don't get a 4 in there isn't this already excluding the 4 so our X says you gotta be more than 5 and I said yeah but make sure you don't get a 4 oh well that's a redundant thing so we really would not have this X is not equal to 4 for this scenario we don't we don't need it that's a redundant no I'm gonna play around a little bit Oh what would happen what would happen if you know what I'll do this to our interval notation would be here's 5 here's greater than that so we'd go from 5 to infinity parenthesis on the infinity a bracket on the 5 because we can actually equal that value so this would be our two domains for this scenario now let's let's play around what if I made this not 15 but 12 well that's all friends if we end with hey in order to make that square root positive you need numbers bigger than or equal to 4 all right any numbers bigger than equal before is this now relevant absolutely because this says ID numbers that are greater than or equal to 4 and this one says you can't equal 4 now instead of writing this it's a little bit easier to write these together if we say that X cannot X has to be greater than equal to 4 and this one says X can't before then this is one way to say it but maybe more importantly or more appropriately we can say what if we just exclude that equal sign that says that X has to be greater than or equal before but not equal to 4 it just takes out that equals part of it and so what we get here is this this domain so X must be more than 4 or using a parentheses X must be more than 4 can be written in interval notation just like that ok last iteration of this let's change this to 9 so 9 9 9 3 3 3 what now is this one relevant yeah absolutely this says you need numbers that are greater than or equal to 3 to keep this thing happy and since 4 is now in that interval you need to express it separately and say I also can't have 4th that makes sense say hey you know what you need numbers more than 3 at least equal to 3 but make sure you exclude 4 because that number is gonna make this denominator not work for you that's what's happening here on interval notation we hits it's pretty awkward to show with interval notation we would say we do this because 4 is up here right before is this problem so we'd start at 3 with a bracket you can include the 3 and you need to we go up to 4 we'd say you know what you need to exclude that 4 but then after that you can keep going forever that's how we write that for interval notation man I hope this makes sense I hope you're seen the the ideas behind domain really producing for you understanding real numbers here being positive defined numbers here being not 0 and that is how we approach find a domain the last one I'm going to go through very quickly obviously we have the fraction we also have some square root so let's really think about it there's two issues right we know that the denominator has a square root in it we know that square roots want to be positive so when we write this you go let's talk with a square root first let's understand that in order for us to get real numbers I would have to have X minus 8 being greater than or equal to zero that's the square root I did just the square root of says it keep me positive or most deadly 0 so I want this to happen so that this guy's happy gives me non imaginary numbers 15 real numbers but it's on the denominator do now to say I get that you want to be greater than or equal to zero because your square root or I get that but remember denominators are not happy if they equals 0 so what if we just don't include the zero part of it now we've excluded the only value that can possibly make zero and that would be 8 so 8 minus 8 is 0 the square root of 0 is 0 so if we exclude the the 8 it would exclude that idea that hey I can be equal to 0 here then we're excluding the only number that's gonna let that denominator be 0 so we kind of put these ideas together sometimes and say cool but we know what we can't have that actually equals 0 so we're just gonna take that away from that inequality if we add a nothing changes as far as reversal equality we get X is greater than 8 that's our domain we can set this up with set builder notation we can say hey X is X is positive and more than 8 but it can't include the 8 so our interval notation says let's start at 8 with the parenthesis we cannot include it because that would make zero on the Danai gurira fraction and we go to infinity I hope that this has made sense there's only one more thing that I want to touch on sometimes you'll get some fractions like let's say 5 over x squared plus 1 and you go alright great can that dénouement let's think through it does it have any of the problem areas that we know could cause issues for us well it doesn't have any square roots it does have a denominator and so you go through the process and you go you know what I know that if denominators equals 0 I've got problems but then you think about it and go can that actually equal 0 and the answer is no not over real numbers and that's what we're talking about so I take any number of the world that's a real number and I square it which gives me a positive or at least 0 and then I add 1 to it there's no way it's going to equal 0 that's impossible positive numbers plus 1 can't equal 0 and so this says there's there's no solution to that no real number solution that's fine what that means is that there's no real solution that's gonna make your denominator equals 0 and there's no problem there's no domain problem here your domain would be all real numbers that even here I take the square root of that oh man and no square roots have to be positive so you think about this one say all right the square root of x squared plus 1 has to be greater than zero not equal to zero because it's on the bottom of fraction you go well what numbers are going to make this greater I can't solve that oh geez what do I do well if you square a number and add one is it always positive is it ever negative it's never negative it's always has to be positive or real numbers that's all that's all so it's telling you the domains are real numbers so sometimes we really just have to sit there and think about it a little bit and understand the ideas behind the square root and the denominator if you have something that cannot equal zero on the bottom of your fraction your domain is all real numbers if you have something in a square root that cannot be negative ever no matter what you plug in then your domain is all real numbers so I hope that you'll get this from time to time I hope that makes sense to you I hope also you understood my my comment about with fractions we're really only concerned where your denominator has variables in it so like X minus 2 over 4 that 4 is a constant it can never equal 0 on its own so your domain here would also be all real numbers we're gonna stop there we've explained what domain is again we've talked about how to find the square roots and with denominators and the interplay between those later on we'll talk about logarithms hope makes sense and we're gonna come back a little while with with how to how to find operations of functions and their domains so I'll see you for the next video on that you 

Transcript for: Operations of Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 5)
welcome to another video today we're going to explore operations of functions and when we talk about operations of functions I really want to focus on what happens with the domain most people can understand that you can add two functions subtract two functions multiply two functions and dividing functions not that hard but what happens if the domain is important you see sometimes math it looks like you can cancel out of the main problem you can never ever do that so when we talk about domain we jump right into it here when we talk about domain it's one of the most pessimistic attitudes that we have right so domain is like like the skeletons in the closet you can't ever get rid of them they're always there like it carries its baggage with it all the time so when we start to compose functions or add functions subtract punches multiply divide functions even if it looks like the domain of your result the resultant function it's getting better it's not what that means is that if we give two functions the first thing we do is find the domain for each of them this is very easy because I give you a nice one is the same and then if we add them subtract them multiply or divide them we are going to have both of those domain issues in every one of these cases and then what's even a little bit kind of worse about it is that we can even develop some new domain problems by doing these operations so that's what we're gonna be looking for in this video I'm going to show you how we can add subtract multiply divide functions will simplify them as much as we possibly can and then we'll discuss the domain so let's start right now whenever you're going to do operations with functions whether that's going to be addition subtraction will take you to division or if you're going to start composing functions the first step that we do is we find the domain from each of our functions individually now here they both got fractions and after watching last video you know about fractions you know that we're looking for inputs that give us a real number defined output which means for fractions denominators equaling zero or bad things we're going to set our denominator equal to zero understanding that when x equals positive 2/3 that's a problem for us and the same problem for both of these fractions I gave you the fractions like this with the same two numbers so that we can add them and subtract them easy easily I'm not trying to teach you that trying to teach you what happens with the domain here especially with this case so here our domain says you're good as long as X cannot equal 2/3 and sometimes we even abbreviate that say hey X such that X does not equal 2/3 X such that X does not equal 2/3 I'm implying that all real numbers work except for 2/3 because that would make my denominator equal to zero and that creates an undefined result for that particular input so that's going to make sense 2/3 as an input don't work because your outputs undefined now when we start adding functions together I need you to remember did you know that no matter what we get this right here is going to be the domain at least this right here is going to be in the domain of the resultant function we could get worse things from it but we can't ever get rid of these problems they stick with your functions forever no matter what you get now typically with addition subtraction and multiplication you're going to see the same domain problems come up again at the end so it's not such a big deal for those but for this one it is and we'll see why in a minute so f plus G of X if we add these functions together keep in mind that we need to comment in order to add fractions and we have that so we're just combining the numerators right now that looks like 6x plus 3 over 3x minus 2 yeah you can to factor the numerator but it's not going to help you simplify so I would leave it just like that because if we ever have to deal with later the first thing we're gonna do is probably distribute that numerator denominators should always be factored so not you should factor that now here we can't do it but that's something to think about and notice something your resultant function here has the same exact denominator obviously as what we started with that means that your domain is going to be the same even if these denominators had been different you would have found a common denominator once you have which means you'd have the same factors and those factors equaling zero would cause domain issues for you so if even if your denominators are different you'd find a common - number and these things would appear again whatever they are in that result so our domain says hey I'm going to be exactly like how you started the same thing st. and sorry I'm going to be exactly the same domain as what you started with for both of your functions combined whatever those are here they were the same they don't have to be that just be different denominators F - G of X is identical and except that we're subtracting but we're also going to see that when we subtract that 4x over 3x - 2 I have a 2 X minus a 4 keep in mind if I said more than one term I want to show parentheses I'd want to distribute that - because you'd be subtracting every part of that numerator and we should know that so minus 2x or negative 2x plus 3 over 3x minus 2 again there's no simplification that we do and we see that the domain that we had originally is going to be the same domain that we get when we subtract functions you know what if you think about it with multiplication think about what happens when you multiply fractions well you take the denominators and you multiply them together and they they basically become the new denominator for your fraction now if we simplify stuff we can accidentally start simplifying away one of those two main problems but if you think about what happens in the domain I'm gonna have one fraction with the problem in the denominator and another fraction in general problems denominator I'm going to multiply them that becomes my new denominator do you see how I'm just gonna keep combining my domain problems for addition and for subtraction and even for multiplication we're going to get the same domain here moved over to this that's gonna the same domain is what our result is is what we was sort of it so this 2x plus 3 over 3x minus 2 probably parentheses would be good here multiplying fractions says multiply your numerators we're going to distribute the 4x multiplier denominators we're not going to distribute at all your denominators shouldn't always be factored as much as possible so instead of distributing 3x minus 2 times 3x minus 2 we leave them factored for a variety of reasons one of them is because when we graph these things it's really nice and very appropriate to have your denominator factored it would create a vertical asymptote we haven't got there yet but I said that in last video it created a vertical asymptote at two two-thirds x equals two thirds this is this kind of force field you can't touch and then because that powers there because we're gonna have this group as 3 X minus 2 to the second power it's gonna tell some multiplicity of that we're gonna get to multiplicity later so we'll distribute numerators absolutely so that's going to be 8 x squared plus 12 X on the denominator leave your denominator factored so I don't care what these things are really the same or not you leave them as factors it's going to read help you with graphene I promise and we ever have to add fractions or simplify fractions or multiply them we can find LCD easier we can cancel out simplify easier we can do everything easier if we leave these factors now because we have 3x minus 2 times 2x minus 2 that's a repeated factor that's repeated multiplication that's an exponent that's how I want to see it and do you see that no matter what because you're going to keep these factors you're going to see the same exact denominators that you had here so the same exact domain issues that you had here those are going to repeat every year so our domain doesn't change our domain says yeah your domain for this is X's such that X cannot equal again 2/3 I want to reiterate this I know that I've been taught it to you but you know I teach at this point you know that what I'm trying to do is prepare your brains I'm giving you an advanced organizer for later on as to why you do this sometimes if you don't know why you do something it's really hard to accept that you have to we have to do this and leave it factored and write the exponent because later on this is going to give us a vertical asymptote on the graph at that value so a vertical line x equals a number is a verb 1 if X can't equal that vertical line well then you have something you can't touch can you do you don't you can you one of those you have something that you can't touch don't you well if you have something you can't touch then you have a vertical asymptote and that power says that you are going to be even even functions match up so we're going to look like this or look like this around the asymptotes that's why we leave it that way I'm going to flesh that out with you to a few more videos so a long story as short as I can make it domain is still really relevant for your functions we talk about it lots and lots moving forward find your domain first if you have to add subtract term old five functions you're going to get the same domain almost exclusively there are times when you don't but almost exclusive to get that if you divide not only you're going to get the same domain you could add some other issues to that that domain the domain problems you already have the key here though is that when you start dividing it's gonna look like you can cancel out some stuff it's gonna look like your domain doesn't have a problem anymore you still have the problem it's just hidden so I said this at the beginning and it's gonna make some sense as we go through but these issues this X can't equal 2/3 that issue because the resultant function starts here it is these things just wrapped up together because these are the those root if you will functions you can't have that 2/3 no matter what we get here I can promise you that our domain is going to exclude 2/3 from it it's not going to look that way it's gonna look like we cancelled out but it still has to be here so when we divide functions were really conscious of what goes on the numerator and what goes on the denominator says F divided by G so f is this 2x plus 3 over 3x minus 2 divided by you can even write a divided by sine if you want to 4x over 3x minus 2 now we know something about complex fractions we know that fraction divided by a fraction when we divide so fraction divided by fraction when we divide fractions we can reciprocate and multiply so instead of this will reciprocate the second fraction or the bottom fraction space all right so I have my first fraction a problem division says multiply by the reciprocal of the second fraction they go wait a minute well it's awesome because look boom oh I can cancel out my team I do my denominator I can cancel I'm one of those domain problems it certainly looks that way it certainly looks that way but because of where this came from because your original functions had a domain of negative 12 two-thirds is a bad number so X cannot equal 2/3 we actually write that down first we go through this and go right I know X can equal 2/3 and no matter what happens X can I equal 2/3 even if I serve Kansas about I know that where it came from the baggage that holds on to the skeleton in the closet that's you can't see anymore is you cannot allow this function equal 2/3 based on those root functions of functions we started with the other good news here is that you can add some problems to it so notice our resultant function then we have that 2x plus 3 over 4x and you think about your wait a minute wait that's a fraction with a different denomination and we know that dinars equaling zero are bad things so if we continue to go all right let's let's find that let's find the domain of this so well for X equaling zero wouldn't be good because that creates an undefined issue for an output and we know that the domain needs inputs you give us defined real numbers and I divide by 4 0 to PI over 4 is 0 you go okay yeah hey X equaling 0 would be not a great thing here we'd get 3 over zero that's undefined so I know that might exclude 0 if we ignore this and have that we do understand domain but we're forgetting to realize where the functions came from so when we go ahead and we do division how do properly assigned remain first when you start dividing make sure that you write that domain down you go okay whatever these are you're going to have it here no matter what and then we might even get additional domain restrictions that we have to add to that we have to exclude that from the domain so even though it looks like the the 3x minus 2 cancels out it does but the domain issue is still there based on where we came from I hope that makes sense we're gonna go ahead and do one more really quick one just to talk about square root to get that one more time and then we'll be done ok last one so we're gonna add these subtract these multiply these and divide these functions and we're focus on the domain so really if you want to stop this and go through here your first process should be this thing about find your domain first and then recognize that no matter what I do I'm gonna have these two domains in the result of every single one of these function operators and I might even add some to it so I'm going to have at least ones here and maybe add domain problems as we're doing these operations so let's let's go ahead let's do our do our domain oh man so we think about it last time we're gonna think about domain like this for a while so I look at the square root I think square roots are this idea that they wants to be positive so it tells you what it wants to be it says I want this inside this radicand to be positive or at least zero so we think about square roots and say I need real numbers here what makes it happen makes it happen if the inside is greater than equal to zero if not I get imaginary numbers that's an issue I subtract three and it says that I need X to be greater than or equal to negative three in order for this to give me real numbers out that is the domain of that function then we go to the denominators right here this function G of X say what about denominators in order for this input these inputs to give me a real number to find value out well it's not about negative or positive it's about defined values for fractions we know that if x equals zero I'm going to have my denominator let's give me an undefined value that's going to be a so any positive is fine here any negatives here fine here but we just cannot allow zero to be an input for that particular function so we're going to say that yeah X cannot equal 0 that needs to make sense before we go any further so when we look at square roots we think what's gonna give this or what inputs will make this function give us real number to find outlets for square roots you gotta keep me positive solve it and these are the numbers that keep it positive and give you real numbers out for fractions denominator cannot equal zero because if they do you get an undefined value so square root is positive denominators can t 0 these two domains are going to follow us for every single one of these and we might we might get some more restrictions out of it what can't happen even if you start canceling stuff out you are still going to have these so you never ever cancel the way domain restrictions so if you wanted to do this right now say hey what's my domain well I know that that's gonna happen no matter why I get here I know that because they never go away also do you do you realize that this is not they're relevant here we had a case last video where we didn't have to put this because it was it was included in that well or sorry it wasn't including that that interval since this says X can be any number bigger than negative 3 and 0 is in that interval we have to show explicitly the rate excluding it either this way or with interval notation which I showed in the last video what we can write it here to same thing and that might be a really good option for you to before even doing it is write down the domain it's not going to change the only thing is you might have to add some more to it that could be the case well let's go through adding subtracting multiplying dividing the first they're going to go very quickly so if we add these functions there's nothing to really combine so function says hey you're just gonna have that X plus three you're gonna add fine Rex and it's very clear to see that that's that's still the same exact domain or if you subtract them the same thing X plus three minus five Rex same exact domain or multiply them I probably put the 5x first because multiplications community if we can do that five over x times X plus three you can even make it one fraction five times X square root of x plus three over X and you see that we have the same exact domain is not going to change now the division we do have to be conscious of what's coming first because division is not commutative so we have to put the square root of x plus 3 on our numerator now we'd have to have 5 over X in the denominator wait a minute when we're when we're dividing fractions we multiply by the reciprocal so so this would be the same thing as the square root of x plus 3 times x over 5 times the reciprocal of 5 X so here's X so you can think about square root of x plus 3 over 1 square root of 3 over 1/5 X or x x over 5 you know this is fantastic I can simplify this just a little bit maybe put my X before that square root that's the resultant function of dividing F by G we divided square root by a fraction when you divide fractions you can multiply by the reciprocal no problem we would have X x squared vegetables 3 we'd have over 5 this is one of the reasons why that might be a really good option for you to do first do you see it do you see how the denominator changed for us the demanders said well there's no longer there's not an X there so if you were to just do this and then think about the domain you're probably gonna miss that don't miss that this is why the technique I'm giving you works really really well find the domains first if you want to write them down for every operation do that even for compositions that that sort of works really we take the domain of the inside function and the final function we combined it that way but for adding subtracting multiplying dividing you're always going to get the same to me no matter what because we started with that we don't add anything new huh because look at that the square root hasn't changed so so that's still the same domain that we had the X is gone it looks like that's gone the the problem for an x equals zero is gone but because of where it came from we have to retain it but our denominator cannot equal zero anymore that right there can't equal zero so we don't gain any new problems you still have the same old ones I hope that makes sense hope you understand this point that your domain does not change from your original functions when you're doing these operators you can only kind of make it worse if you divide so practice that and I hope that makes sense next time we're going to talk about some graphs of functions determining if if one inlet has to give you one output what that looks like graphically so we'll do something called the vertical line test you've probably heard about it but we'll explore why it makes sense we'll talk about even versus odd functions and in small things like that so have a great great day and I hope to see you in the next video you 

Transcript for: Using the Vertical Line Test (Precalculus - College Algebra 6)
hey there welcome to another video in this video we're gonna discuss the vertical line test it could be very very short you've probably heard of the vertical line test before if you haven't that's not a big deal I'll explain it very well I'm gonna focus more on the why it works than that how're you doing I'm explaining both of them but mostly the why it works that's how we retain things by understanding them so what is the vertical line test why does it work and how do you do it the vertical line test is a way that we check whether the graph of some sort of mathematical expression or equation is a function or not so when we when we look at a graph we should be able to determine immediately whether it's a function or whether it's not so how we do that is by understanding the interplay that functions have between inputs and outputs remember four functions one input gives you one an output that's it so what we're gonna focus on is why the vertical line test actually works in order to start we've gotta know that the input axis I'm not going to really talk about X's and Y's then put axis is the horizontal axis unless we switch that around then ordinal accesses is for inputs so with that in mind if this is the input axis and so the output axis when we pick a number to plug in on the input axis it's kind of a horizontal idea is if this was X you'd say all right exit equals 5 is here in x equals negative 4 is over here and we move horizontally to locate different inputs however for any given input the output will be somewhere above or below it that's why our output axis we call vertical because it has this idea that our outputs will be strung along somewhere along this direction above or below each individual input that's how the rectangular coordinate system works you go over to input and you up or down for your output we all know this because we can graph points at this point so if our input axis is horizontal and at every given input the output will be somewhere above or below this a vertical idea then all we have to do is go over to you give an input you go right here's my here's an input and we checked vertically how many outputs are given to us so we look above it is their input or sorry is their output above or below it is their an output below our idea is that if one input must give us one output and our inputs are somewhere along the horizontal line we're gonna go somewhere along the horizontal line we're going to pick a point and then we go right look above below it because if there's an output for that particular input it's going to appear vertically the output axis is vertical there for all of our outputs must be vertically given above or below that input and if we find one input great at that point that's a functional relationship if we find two outputs that's a problem that's given it's a non function for that input and that ruins the whole thing for today and this whole thing's not a function because right here see this at that point well we have two outputs for one input and we do this for the entire graph so that's why the vertical line test works it's based on the idea that for functions one inputs got to give you one output since inputs are located horizontally we pick a point on this horizontal axis anywhere that you want and once you pick a point basically we do for the whole axis once you pick a point on there then you look above and below because their outputs must be strung along vertically if we touch our graph at more than one point well then at that input you are getting two or more outputs that is a non function it's giving you more than one output for that single input we're gonna practice a few of them but that's basically the rundown here so take a look if there are our diagonal line our input axis horizontal has purposely not labeled these x and y because it doesn't really matter our input axis is horizontal or output axis is vertical we look at every point along our horizontal axis and think oh right well what's going on here what's where would our outputs be located at this point outputs would be vertical well if my outputs are vertical and I started crossing my graph right here that says hey there's an output for that given input isn't there that says if this input I would get that number out and this input I would get that number out and this I would get that number out because for every given input on the input axis our vertical axis where it touches the graph that would be our output are we touching the graph more than one time for any given one input I know that we touch the graph three times but that was for three different inputs that's fine and if we continue across the whole axis no matter what even here that's they the output is on the axis no problem and we look vertically and everywhere we touch the graph that is the output for the specific input that we've chosen every single time that we have checked an input and we do this across the whole axis we are getting one output right there that says that one inputs give us 1 output it's not touching the graph twice the vertical line test here says that that is a function what about the next one imagine some vertical lines imagine choosing and input here in here in here in here all the way down here and imagine vertical lines at every single one of those inputs those vertical lines are the outputs or the representation of where the output would be for that given input and where we hit the graph here and here here and here those are the outputs for those given inputs that we've chosen are we getting more than one point on a vertical line the vertical line represents outlets for that input so if we're getting more than one touching upper graph more than one point on a vertical line we would have a non function well I got invest that way in the up here well no we're not we're getting one point for this vertical line one point for that one one point for this one one point to that one there's never a case where we're getting two outputs for any given input this is a function that one graph the back what do you think that if you look at the alright taking input here great inputs are on the horizontal axis no problem and output would be somewhere along a vertical line the vertical axis is the output axis our outfits would be a vertical idea having chosen and input there you go all right well here's my output axis like here's where my outputs would be let's look at the graph there's output there there's an output there those are the two outputs on that vertical oh wait those are the two outputs on the vertical line for that input so I chose my input I looked at all the potential all the outputs that we have and we cross the graph twice same for that graph there are two given outputs for that one give an input right there you're done you stop and you say that's not a function because I put in one input I chose one point on the input axis I looked at vertically above and below it and it gave me two points out that's not in the function this one for sure as a function we can imagine some vertical lines of all these different inputs we think through and go you know what every vertical line you don't even have to draw them you can imagine them every vertical line that we think about is only going to have one time crossing that graph that means that every of though every one of those inputs that I chose for those vertical lines or every possible input on that horizontal axis is probably a better way to put it for every possible input on the horizontal axis and I imagine an infinite number of vertical lines there's never a case where a vertical line is going to have two outputs it's going to touch our graph twice that does not happen here this is a function because for every possible input I'm getting one output I don't let I need to backtrack per second is it okay to get no outputs for an input yeah and it can still be a function actually if we think about square roots and a square root looks like this even though these inputs over here are not defined for that square root they create imaginary numbers so when we plug in negatives instead into a square root we learn this in there's nothing there for real numbers so it doesn't show up graphically on a real coordinate plane this does not say that you don't have a function and this over here for every possible input we have one output that is also a function so don't I should have probably mentioned that when we get to there but don't let it be the casing man I'm not getting any inputs therefore it's not a function that's not the case the cases is this where you have inputs on your horizontal axis and you have something that's defined for your function so where your inputs give you an outputs there's only one that's the idea so where the inputs are giving you outputs there's only one output and not two so function yes function yes function now there's two function yes function note for this input or lots of them you're getting two outputs for that input you're done that's not a function lastly how about the vertical line test can a vertical line pass the vertical classic vertical line test can the vertical line pass a vertical line test well let's think about it what if I pick it in four over here are there any other inputs russer outputs for that input no that's fine if you are not worried about inputs not giving us outputs worried about where the inputs are giving us outputs they're giving us only one so we check all these hey there's there's no problem with any of these vertical lines but as soon as I get took that input right there and say hey what's the one output for that one input you go there's lots of outputs for that one input in fact every point of vertical is an output but that's a non function and I hope that makes sense to you I hope that that you're seeing the interplay between inputs and outputs on the vertical line test that we're checking inputs that's a horizontal idea so you locate one and you look above and below it for a now and if it has outputs there can only be one output from it so yes yes no that's a problem yes that's fine no that's a that's not fine I know that's not fine fruit of line does not pass through blind test here this is certainly a function so a square root says I'm not getting any outputs therefore the verb like this doesn't really apply but where I get outputs for my inputs there's only one output for every given input that's how the vertical line test works that's why it works and so we're going to be using that from time to time just to check to see whether we have functions or not or when we're graphing like especially piecewise functions to make sure that we're not actually accidentally overlapping or refs because that wouldn't be a function so I hope it makes sense I'll see you for the next video you 

Transcript for: Features of Graphs, Domain, Range (Precalculus - College Algebra 7)
hi welcome to another video hope you don't well he'll be rated for something we're going to talk about frequently which is which is graphs and right now in this video we're gonna learn about some features of graphs namely points domain and range so well this isn't gonna be a whole long exhaustive list of things we can do with graphs it's really nice to be able to start with health perhaps work and what what really is being asked because some of the terminology well it's not difficult to do can be a little confusing so we're gonna talk about how to find points in the graph what they mean when they're asking all of these questions we'll talk about domain and range quite a bit I'll also give you some very interesting examples where students get confused on why in the world the domain is this and what what that really means for a graph and it's very important to get what the domain is correct in your head so we'll talk about that a little bit we'll also talk about how to do this without a graph if you need to find this information without the actual picture of the function itself so that's the lesson for this video and then we'll continue next time Douglas more features so let's get right to it when we talk about graphs graphs of course or this this this this representation of every point that satisfies a function that you're given so we have an infinite number of points but sometimes what's going to be asked is well what about some specific points so what about F of 0 what in the world does that mean well what that is talking about when they're asking you F of 0 or F of negative 6 it says the functions the function itself is going to give you an output value we plug in a value we get an output out so input/output and it's the same what is the functions output value so the output of the function equals what when your input value is 0 in other words all this is really asking you to do is to complete a point so if we look at our graph and say what do you mean by complete a point if the input is 0 it's saying what's the output of the function given to your input is 0 its save complete this point here's your input of 0 find me the output so we look at our graphic ok here's my input my X is my input axis here's my input of 0 my output of my graph is 0 5 notice how the points given for you find it so this is saying complete this point really if your input is zero your output has to be five for this given function so this answer would be five you can just complete a point and that's what that's asking me to do same thing with F of negative six it says find me the outputs value the output of the function at an input of negative six so we go to our input axis our x-axis we go here's our negative six let's go up or down to where we meet the function let's find the point let's complete the point with an X in an input of negative six so here's negative six here's negative six negative three so really it's saying if you want to complete this point just find the point on the graph that has an x value of negative six and the output would be negative 3 that's what we're talking about here so really this is asking you to find points on the graph it says finding me the output when your input 0 find me the output when your inputs negative 6 find that functions output say complete the point with an x value observing suit respectively I'm kind of similar is this F of 3 so let's find f of 3 where that would be and just determine whether output is positive or negative so anytime they're talking about F of something f of X F of whatever it's an output idea so it's saying I want you to look at the y-value of whatever x value you're inputting so find me a point on the graph that has an output i started where the output is given by an input of 3 so in other words we're gonna go to the input value of 3 so f of 3 here's our x value of 3 find where the function is is it above or below well if we had to put a point on this graph where we would have three comma something an input value of 3 and then whatever output it'd be up here somewhere well it looks like it's about 4 it's not asking you whether it's for or not it's asking is the output value positive or negative and that's what the same it says given an input value of 3 what's the function doing what's its output is it positive or is it negative since we're above the x-axis all of these output values are positive this would just be positive for f of 8 we do the same thing we all right well tell me what the output is of what if our input is 8 functions is going to give us some sort of an output for the input of eight I'm gonna go to my x-axis for input at me and it's asking is that output value positive or negative well when we look at eight and says I want to I want to complete a point where we have eight comma something that's actually done for you here is eight comma negative three no way all right well I could actually feel that point and it's it's negative three it's given to me on that graph but what we're concerned about is the output value positive or negative is it above or below the x-axis well our Y values are all made of here so given an input of eight f of eight is asking you what's the output value for the input so basically complete the point in this case is just asking you is that output positive negative we're clearly negative hope that's making sense so far that's kind of the basics of how they ask you what points are on a graph they say find me the output value for it it just looks a little bit funny they're not asking specifically like that we can also do things like for what values of X is f of X equal to zero now here's what we really have to understand what the function notation means this says I want you to look for outputs of zero know that inputs of zero I'm not plugging in zero I'm not letting X equal zero don't have done that we know that if X is zero our outputs 5 we're done what this is saying is think differently think about every time where you have an output of zero so so really you could do this you could say I want to find points where my output is zero notice how points are set up points are always said X comma f of X and now I'm saying I want you to find me some points where this number over here is zero how many points do that well all of those points now I get this is important all of those points are going to be on the x axis all of those points are going to say hey here's an f of X of 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 here's an f of X of zero this whole force on the line represents points where your output would be zero and this is saying I want you to complete points what's your X when your output is zero it's same to find X intercepts this is just a way that they you do that so when they say find all the values where f of X is equal to zero same find all the values where your output is 0 find all the values on the x intercept on the x axis find all the values that are x-intercepts that's what that's a staple at this point well there's a there's a view we have negative 4 and output of 0 hey that's an x value 8 alpha 0 6 we're up at 0 and 10 where you're not concerned so for what X's is this output 0 for what X's do we have x-intercepts we'd say there's negative 4 6 and 10 those are the X values where we have an output of 0 on our graph so we have this negative 4 that's on the next axis that has an output of 0 at 6 and 10 you can write it like this me personally I really prefer to write points so I'd probably take this a little further and say well we have negative they don't specifically ask this let's say what for what it what x value is that I just like to make sure that my students know that those values are giving you X intercepts and X intercepts are the points on the graph they really are no we oftentimes just put X's and that's that's totally fine we all understand that x equals negative 4 is now an x intercept and say hey your output 0 on the x axis no problem x intercept and that's that's okay but I want to make sure you understand the our points so negative 4 0 6 0 10 0 or X intercepts on that graph where graph crosses the x axis okay I hope this making sense I hope you understand right now that really this is just asking you to complete a point where your X is 0 find the Y your X is negative 6 find a light or f of X Y or X is 3 is it is the output positive negative your X is 8 is the y night f of X value positive or negative this is different and this is saying now your Y value your f of X should I use zero find the X's that make that happen so we're at 0 over negative 4 0 ok 6 zero okay 10 we're thinking about differently how about the next one for what values is f of X greater than 0 this causes a lot of confusion in a lot of students because what students want to do is they want to follow this graph up and they go oh whoa I mean our we're greater than 0 zero and five obviously because this how that's how we're climbing when we understand functions what functions deal with the functions deal with almost exclusively the only one that doesn't really is range this idea of intervals on the x axis you see X is our independent variable X is what drives everything in our function so so when we think about that we think here's how this here's how this is really better awarded for what interval of your x-axis is your graph positive for what interval of your x-axis is your graph above the x-axis that's what this is asking so when we think about this you can't go this way you all right for what interval on the x-axis am i above it well let's think about it Aarthi is this range of your function or starting this I'll say piece is this piece of your function above the x-axis is it positive well no we know that the graph is above the x axis starting probably right here and ending right here and what we've just done is marked off the piece the interval of the x-axis where the function is positive that's exactly what is asking find me the x-values where your function is positive that's this interval of X's that's what that's asking you it says give me the piece of the x-axis where I'm above the X it's not it this way idea it's a x-axis idea almost everything we talked about is an x-axis idea we find x-intercepts y-intercept we got that but we have an X X interval here that says for the the interval of numbers between x equals negative 4 and x equals 6 my graph is going to be positive and we have two ways to write that so we're gonna say all right you know what one way I could write this for what X is is my my function positive well you already know how to find positive right you knew that at 3 we were positive at 8 we were negative this is saying fine to find a whole range of a whole interval of them so our interval from negative 4 to 6 is going to give me positive outputs way to write that is from negative 4 to 6 those are the values of exes right we said hey all this will range from negative 4 X is somewhere between here to 6 we're going to get positive outputs that's exactly the questions asking you the other way that we can write this is something called interval the notation yeah in my opinion it's not the best notation because it ends up looking a lot like points but it is one way that we can represent this and you need to know it so the other way that we can write this is hey you know what from if I want to write the X values from negative 4 to 6 I can also write it like this the interval of the x axis where we have positive outputs is from x equals negative 4 to x equals 6 but but not quite equal you see if we let this equal notice if we let this equal I'm really not positive at this point right there at that point I'm not positive not negative I'm 0 well that's not what this is asking you this is saying where is your graph strictly positive not equal to 0 or we would include the negative or we would include the 6 sometimes telling you it's saying I want you to be strictly positive and that says well I can't really include those X intercepts because add an x intercept I'm equal to 0 and I don't want to be equal to 0 I want to be positive so we can't include that for that reason we'd show this interval with what are called parentheses this represents the same exact thing that says hey the X values for which your function is positive is negative 4 and 6 but not including those two endpoints or negative 4 to 6 but not including those two endpoints to include them we use a bracket and I'll show you that when we talk about the domain okay how about the you should try this right now what about the function where's the function less than 0 oh you know what I missed one I'm sorry where's the function greater than 0 we have one interval I talked about that but there's also this other one right over here well yeah we're not we're not above the x-axis here that's that's below that's it that's outputs that are negative or above the x-axis or outputs are positive from negative 4 to 6 not between 6 and 10 but then from 10 to 11 we're also positive so the way we're gonna write that all right this all together is we have this we also have an interval right here from 10:00 to 11:00 this little interval not up and down flip x-axis wise we say the X values that are giving us positive outputs are also found from 10 to 11 so this is one way we can write it with with these inequality notation we can also say all right so interval notation we go negative 4 to 6 no problem and then we also go from 10 to 11 and that little you there is a union it's saying this interval combined with this or this interval or this interval are going to give you values that are positive our outputs are positive I hope that you stick with me here I hope that's making sense to your seeing the interplay between the X intervals and the outputs and we're always pretty much always talking about the X interval and we're talking about increasing and decreasing we're talking about we've done that yet we're talking about positive versus negative functions you're talking about domain we'll be getting that in a second all right now we're ready to go ahead and look at what what interval of x-axis is our function below 0 so same question only in reverse and you can probably see it right now you should be doing this we notice that our function is below the x-axis here and again over here what we're going to look at it is what interval of the x-axis gives us outputs that are negative what interval in x axis has my graph below the x-axis well that looks like it's from negative 6 to negative 4 same idea if we're an eye kind of figure if we're not above and we're not constant we're not at 0 then we're below so the intervals that we didn't just mark off for being above the x-axis probably are going to give us below that would be negative 6 to negative 4 now we can cause of it both ways so negative 6 to negative 4 give us an interval on the x-axis where we are negative also from 6 to 10 that gives us an interval on the x-axis where outputs are below the X or negative if we want to write interval notation really similar we're gonna do negative 6 to negative 4 we're gonna do parenthesis because again we're not equal to we're not saying less than or equal to we're saying it's strictly negative if I let the equals go I'd include those values but here I can't include the values negative 6 negative 4 6 or 10 because that would give us a zero and I'm saying I don't want to be equal to zero I want to be strictly less than that'll to be negative we'd also go from 6 to 10 and we show that with parentheses and are just strict inequalities there of of less then that's got to make sense we go any further we gotta understand how to find some points and how what they mean by that got to find positive and negative and what they mean by saying hey what's your output value when your X's substance notes we've got to really understand what this is about when they're saying f of X equals a number they're saying I want you to find X values that give me that yield that output value so this is saying I want to find X's when my output is zero no problem this is saying I want you to give me the interval of the x-axis where I am positive or the interval that x-axis where I'm negative it's not an up-and-down idea no we want that to be the case it's an interval of the X idea it's always from this X to this X all right moving on a little bit what the domain means and we talked about this in another video the domain is this idea what inputs I can plug in to a function and get an output well graphically what that means is what section of the x-axis does my graph cover what interval of the x-axis does my graph cover that is what the domain means so it's a very one-dimensional back and forth idea so domain says alright look at my function tell me the X tell me the entire interval the x-axis of this thing covers and we see it right away the interval is that this graph covers on the x axis so our domain our inputs are x x axis is our given axis says our graph covers what portion of that well it's from negative 6 to 11 that's the section of the x-axis from here to here and it covers all of this I think I just ruin that pen oh well so that is what the domain means says just give me the inputs what are English flexes well that means is that the one of the values are given me actual outputs all right well that would be a section or an interval of the x-axis that's giving me some sort of a graph in other words what's the graph cover the graph covers on the x-axis from negative 6 to 11 so we can write like this we have that X such that we remember the set builder notation X such that X is between negative 6 and 11 notice the difference here I use something that I didn't use over here over here was strict inequalities because we wanted to be less than zero we didn't want our function to equal zero or greater than zero as the case would be you know we're saying oh no no no give me every value of x that gives me an output well does negative six and does 11 give you an actual output yes and so we have to include those values that let me do that is there the less than or equal to and with a parenthesis are instead of a parenthesis with a bracket so when we're talking about domain and we have an actual physical point where we are ending we're gonna say I want to include that I want to make sure that my set notification has an equals saying yes this value is included in my domain in my cinnamon puts its give me an actual real number and output my graph is on those values so there or we can do interval notation say hey we're going between those values and including them that's what that bracket does range is the idea a little bit harder to do because we're because we can go back and forth looking at it vertically domains a little bit easier because looking at the x-axis saying hey you can really cover it at one point but with range it's a little little more challenging because we can cover part of the y-axis and cover it again we don't necessarily have to be a 1 one function X axis is just vertical line test passes this is a function every single vertical lines going across our graph one time no matter what like x equals three okay that's only one output value and so it's kind of easy to see hey this is this graph covers this part of my x axis range says tell me what tell me what section what interval of the y axis or f of x axis my graph covers my graph gives me outputs there so we're looking on both sides here figuring out what section of the Y does this graph cover I'm not I'm only going on the Y I've notice only on the domain I didn't go off of the x axis at all same thing with the range I cannot let my pen move off of this y axis so I'm looking what's my lowest value on the Y what what output does that cover well it covers down at negative 3 all of these outputs are covered somewhere it doesn't matter how many times they come I don't care that's what makes a little challenging is making sure you're covering it and then okay the highest value we're getting is 5 so the interval that we cover on the y axis is from negative 3 to 5 that is what the range means and we can use Y we can use f of X you'll see both you probably should use that f of X but I want to make sure I give that to you and we'd say all the output values can be found between negative 3 & 5 including those notice how we actually obtain a negative 3 we actually attained a 5 so we have to show that with that less than or equal to we also have to show that with brackets okay now how about x-intercepts well wait a minute x-intercepts x-intercepts are the function the function outputs would be zero the function outputs would be someone down here you've already done that when you find f of x equals zero you are finding x-intercepts if they exist so this is a redundant collection so we'd say hey where our functions value was 0 where output height with zero we'd be on the x-axis we already found that X is where that's the case so this is basic basically kind of reinforcing that hey you know these numbers over here yeah that's what you're finding so your x-intercepts are maybe 4 0 6 0 10 0 now can a function has more than one x-intercept and still be a function of past vertical line test of course can a function have more than one y-intercept and still be a function no that would fail the vertical line test that would fail the idea of a one input needs to give you exactly one output so your y intercept there needs to be only one of them if if there even exists one so the y intercept is where we cross the y axis we cross the y axis right here at 0 5 and that's what that's asking for notice how every single y intercept is going out an x value 0 of course yeah it's gotta be on the axis just like every y x-intercepts gonna have a y-value is 0 alright last couple here how many times does the y equal 2 line cross the graph well y equals 2 let's see y equals 2 here's here's the y axis here's here's 2 y equals 2 would be a constant so how many times that or is our line cross our graph I don't care where it crosses it's just asking how many times it crosses that would be 2 times that so that's asking you last one students get super confused about those ago I understand the x intercept idea yeah yeah if I said equals 0 I'm just find out where we cross the x axis but how I introduce that to you I said really think about this as you're trying to complete some points trying to complete a point where your output is zero finding the inputs I don't know the X find me the input when you're up at zero okay here's my output zero out to zero zero I'd have an input of negative four and input of six and the input of ten and that would give me my outputs of zero this is doing the same thing it's saying for what X does f of X equal three it's saying complete the point where your output is 3 every time we say f of X equals 3 is saying I want that output to be 3 so do we have some points where we have a three well let's see 3 is positive 3 is going to be above our x-axis somewhere so I'm looking above here looking for my Y value or f of X value 3 I'm saying oh wait a minute hey here's a y value 3 right there here's Y value 3 here's another Y value of 3 oh there's two points it's ok to have two points yeah sure it says for what X is business work it's okay to have more than one in our case this says negative two would give me an output of negative positive 3 and 4 would give me an output of 3 so I'm looking for the x value that's causing my function to have an output value 3 complete the point here's negative 2 and here is 4 if you didn't have these points listed it'd kind of be a guessing game unless you have a rectangular coordinate showing you this so we'd have to sort of guess where here's my here's my output of 3 and we go over and say my output of 3 has a Oh 8 input of 4 my output of 3 also has an input of negative 2 you'd have to do it that way last one you should be doing on your own give me give me some X values or complete the point that says I want the functions output this is an output of negative 3 so I'm gonna say looks like 2 points you should be finding those two points right now just think it may be thinking in your head there's two of them you say well what is mine what's an input value that's going to be giving me an output of negative 3 or find the input that gives me the output three here's a negative three we could go over we hit our graph here without points already listed for us or say an input value of eight is what's giving me the output this way an input value of negative six is what's give me the output we've completed that point input value maybe six I hope that's made sense that's a lot about graphing as far as what the points mean what they mean what would what it looks like to ask what a point is on a graph and that's what that's doing saying and finally an input if I give you an output over there finally the output if I give you an input completely those points we talked about what x-intercepts are what that looks like what it means when they're asking you f of X equals zero we also talked about domain and range so the section of the x-axis your graph covers that your main section of the y-axis your graph covers that's your range I'm gonna come back in just a second we'll talk about some sort of tricky problems that the domain and range will be more into that and I can ask you about points anymore and then I'll show you how to do this stuff without a graph all right let's get after it so on these four graphs were just going to be talking about domain we're talking about range just making sure that we really understand that it's a big deal so what the domain means is the the portion of section the interval of the x-axis that your graph covers so we're just looking into x-axis as you know very quickly what this says is that hey you know what if I look at my first graph the section of the x-axis is from here to here I don't care that it's PI and negative types of little little selectable strange for us but it's just a trig function we'll talk about that when we get to trigonometry no problem but our domain and that's huge to know what the domain is for trig functions is from negative PI to PI the interval of the x-axis that my graph covers is negative PI to PI now think am I going to be using equals and brackets or not well the points are included so I would say we have X's from negative PI including that value 2 pi interval notation just being negative PI to PI with brackets the the interval of the y-axis or F of x-axis that our graph is covering says well we have the smallest value of negative 1 and the largest value of 1 and we're covering everything in between there so for our range we'd have Y values such that we're going from negative 1 those are always in order to 1 including those values because those points actually exists there and the interval notation says from negative 1 to 1 a hell that's making sense the interval the x axis that our graph covers its domain interval the y axis our graph covers that's our range if we take a look at this one I'm going to do so next the interval of the x-axis that our graph covers some students get really confused the errors and go oh I'm going up I must follow this up think about the x axis only so if you think I can only move my pencil across this just one dimension not too dimensionally just one dimensionally how far will I eventually go well eventually my pencil is going to have covered everything in here so this whole section but it will cover everything this way and it will eventually cover everything this way notice this graph is continue it's shown to continue like this it will eventually though cover the entire x axis so because the domain is the interval of the input axis our x axis that our graph covers this graph will ultimately cover the entire x axis that needs to make sense to you so this is everything from negative infinity to positive infinity how we show that it's a X such that X is probably just all real numbers we could write all real numbers we could write negative infinity less than X less than infinity if you want if you do write that don't include the equals because we can't ever reach that infinite just as it goes forever basically don't include the equals we always have parenthesis we always have strictly less than 4 infinities or we simply put all real numbers now is the range going to cover sorry is this graph going to cover the entire range of our y-axis no no this is a horizontal asymptote and this is an exponential function I try to write e to the X for you you probably have seen that at some point but this is a at least an exponential function and it has a horizontal asymptote which means as it's coming from this way it came from being really really really really really close to zero and if you look at it going to the left it's gonna get really really really really really close to zero as we approach negative infinity but it never hits that zero so as far as the range is concerned we're not covering the entire y axis or basically covering from zero upward remember this is a one dimension idea x axis you can only go back and forth relax you can only go up and down so we're covering from zero but not including it and then to infinity so our Y values are Y such that Y is greater than or 0 is less than Y to infinity we can't include the zero because we never actually attain it we just get really really close to that that idea is super important for us to accurately find the domain of problems like these two with that open circle and what's that mean talk about that a second or from zero to infinity so the section of the x-axis that our graph covers domain we got that down y-axis is a range now when we do the problems like this they're a little funky because what that open circle means is that that point is missing we get right up to it it's called the removable discontinuity most of the time in calculus we call that this says yeah there's there's an endpoint here but this endpoint is missing so how in the world are we going to define our domain the section of our x-axis that our graph covers if we're missing a point well well let's look at it what section of the x-axis do we actually cover now I think we all agree well on the x-axis we're only going left and right one dimensionally it includes everything from here including that zero and then it goes all the way up to the four it includes things like 3.9 3.9 99 three point nine nine for a really long time it just doesn't include the for think about it that's very similar to what this did this would have values of like point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one as an output it just would never attain the zero how we show that is with parentheses we say it's really close but it never really gets there this is really close to four but it never really gets there all right it's gonna be a parentheses around the four it says that we get really close to it as close as you can get without touching it but we don't include the actual value so that's that point I mean so close it just it doesn't move before you don't stop the three you don't sell for three point nine that's not nearly close enough we go way closer and that's what the parentheses tells us it says that we're very close but we just do not include it's basically excluding one point just the endpoint so our domain here says two ways number one the section of the x-axis that our graph covers starts at zero and we include it there's an actual point there and it ends at four but we dis include it there is not a point at the four do you notice that the two inequalities were using them so yep we actually can attain the zero section x-axis has a point there and then we say well two four but not including that because at that for or we're missing the point don't don't miss the point so we're gonna be getting really really really close but that point is missing so the section xx that we're actually covering stops it gets really made actually doesn't really stop it gets really really really close to two for as close as possible without including it already interval notation says zero to four with a bracket around the zero because we do include it on the x-axis but not for the range is quite similar you probably can do this on your going as far as the range is concerned the section of the y-axis that we're covering is from zero to five so look at it this way so turn your head like that and we have another number line saying yep word we're gonna go and erase that we are including that zero sure that is an output value that we act attain but we don't really get an output of five so close to it input a form you almost get that output a five we almost get that we're so close four point nine nine but to show that we said the section of our y-axis that we actually cover is from zero including it but up to five okay and the last one maybe try it on your own I want you to think about what section of the x-axis your graph covers what section the y-axis where your graph ultimately cover as far as the x axis this graph has a this is like a logarithm this graph has a vertical asymptote so well it gets really close to zero does it ever actually touch x equals zero no that's domain isn't strictly on the x axis idea you just look at this graph say hey if I superimpose the graph on my x-axis is going to cover from here all the way up to here that's all we're doing at the end of the section of the x-axis your graphic covered is this section of the x-axis well that's from 0 to 7 but I can't include either to zero because they've never get I never get in I'm not allowed even to put it and put it in there there's no output from that zero and so that's not a valid input because it's not giving us an output for this graph also 7 I can't include the 7 because it's not a valid input that's giving us about an output it's not giving us an output so we can't include it saying you know what the domain is the domain is a set of inputs that are giving us outputs and zeros not giving us an output and 7 not is not giving us an output we can't include them so we're going to show that we disagree them or from 0 to 7 interval notation idea for the y-axis that range the section of the the y-axis at your graph covers this is going all the way down to negative infinity so we're going from negative all the way up to 12 but we don't include either one so we can't it says there's not an actual output at negative infinity because you can't ever get there there's not an actual output of 12 because that point is missing but we get really close and it's the two ways I can explain the thus getting their idea we don't include it so we have some y-values that are from negative infinity and we get almost to 12 that's what that means or we get to a valid output that's just before 12 but we can't include that as well it's not about an output for us and likewise for interval notation negative infinity I hope that's made sense I hope that graph I wanna be done with graphs or now hopefully agraphia understand the domain the range idea students get really confuse the domain of range they don't understand what it is because it's never talked to them very well like hey what domain is for a graph it's just the section of the x-axis that this is actually covering if you have if you have inputs that are not giving you outputs or not giving you valid outputs then you must not include them and we do that with a parenthesis lastly what if you don't have a graph can we still do some things if we don't have a graph yeah um it might not be as easy sometimes a little bit easier but let's go through and see if we can find some things that are similar what we've done such as making you find points can you find points where you have an output given on an input can you find the domain X intercepts and y intercepts so some of the big ideas here if I asked you for F of one remember what that means this is here's f of X F of an input value that I want your input value to be one okay so what I'm asking to do is complete the point where your input value is one that's what I'm asking if I plug in one if I evaluate for one well that's doing it this is finally an output value for X here's the formula for doing that find me an output value when X is 1 so 1 plus 2 is 3 1 minus 16 is 5 we have negative 3/5 in other words I'm just asking to complete a point just like we did from four graphs but instead of a graph a picture of the the function I'm giving you the actual formulaic algebraic way to manipulate that so you plug in 1 you get an output you complete the point now this product hardest one what if I say now I don't want you to find an output given an input this says I want you to find me an input notice what that is it says your your inputs give you your total output so it says the output of a function here's my function for my input values of X here's I want you to find me to output one of the info values one we plugged in 1 it says I want you to find me oh wait I want you to have an output of 2 find me the inputs I don't know my ex I'm looking for my input value when my output is 2 look at the way that your function is designed assigned very well it says can you replace f of X with 2 well wait a minute here's f of X can I replace this whole thing that says this piece your output this is 2 so we'd say alright if f of X equals x plus 2 over X minus 6 and I tell you that I want that output to be 2 I'm going to really say f of X is X plus 2 over X minus 6 now f of X is 2 I can replace the f of X with that 2 and then I can solve for X we're gonna spend some time on this because it's incredibly important we get it with finding inverses we do this a lot with exponential functions we talk about it sometimes on even versus odd and domain so I need to show no sorry inverse a lot of inverses not even on so here's how to solve an equation when you have variables in more than one spot on a fraction number one this is a proportion this is a rational equation and so we can and need to multiply both sides by the LCD we're going to do that so we're gonna multiply by X minus 6 on both sides of our equation but we're only doing that so that we can cancel out that denominator we want to be able to do that and yes we're going to distribute 2x minus 12 equals x plus 2 in the future what's happen is that we are going to have two variables up here and I want to start this idea right now so that I can kind of preface your learning when we get way in the future right here it's going to be fairly easy because we're addition multiplying both sides by your denominator but in the future I want you to look at what would happen if we had a variable here instead of a number so think about what you do now is this is something you know how to do and then we're gonna apply it later something you don't know what I do so please focus here how you go ahead and solve this you all know you all know that you're going to subtract your ex from both sides and you're going to add your 12 why because you want to get all the terms with the variable you're trying to solve for on one side and all the terms without that variable on the other side the same exact logic even though right now is going to work later for inverses and later with exponential functions and solving those things so please keep in mind what we're doing here is you're getting rid of your fraction by multiplication yes you are distributing yes but then you're trying to group your terms with X on one side and non X's on the other just keep that in mind because it's going to come back at us so X minus 12 would equal to yes we add our 12 and get everything that's not an X on the other side that's X would equal 14 older than that right well you know what you can check your work couldn't you if you plug in 14 it should give you up to so 14 plus 2 that's 16 14 minus 6 well it's 860 number 8 is 2 so we know that we're writing we've completed a point that you can show that this says I want you to complete a point where your output value is 2 have you done it yeah yeah yeah 14 you've completed the point and that's what that's asking you for domain all I'm hoping you remember domain remember the domain right now there's two issues with functions we have square roots or even roots and then we have denominators and we don't have those generally our domains all real numbers to tell you they're logarithms so here we go we don't have any square roots that looks fantastic but we do have a denominator what we know about doing the denominators is that if denominators equals zero we've got to make issue we have an undefined value so what the domain is is the set of inputs that give you defined real number outputs well x equals 6 would give you an undefined value and an undefined situation and so we say well you know what yeah it might denominator equals 0 this is going to create a big problem for me you talked about a long time ago but X equals 6 is not a good thing it's it's an input that's not defined it's an input where the output is not defined and so we'd say you know what we need to dissin clued that so our domain is x value such that X does not equal 6 if you forgot about interval notation is a little bit a little bit worse than that so if if 6 is the only number that doesn't work I'm dissing cluding it then really the domain is from negative infinity to 6 and I'm dissing cluding that remember how parenthesis dissing food of value decision to go up to five point nine a ten a nine and then from six point zero zero or 1 or whatever to infinity but you're just dis including the six X intercepts X intercepts are found very similar to to setting your functions output equal to zero or equal to two so let's see what's x intercepts X intercepts say I want your output to be zero until we found them on the graph and that's exactly how we find them now it's a little bit easier in this I'll talk about why in a second but I need you to understand the idea an x intercept is where the height of your function is zero so if your height of your function is given by your output set your output equal to zero this will always give you X intercepts in any sort of a function so if we say I want my output to be 0 well that is an x intercept I want my wait a minute here's my function value so if I set my x plus 2 over X minus 6 equal to zero this is saying I took my function I replaced my output with 0 this is saying I want my output to be 0 here that is where our X intercepts would come from now why did I say it's gonna be easier than this well can you still multiply both sides by X minus 6 yes but what is 0 time's anything well 0 times anything is is zero so if I multiply both sides by X minus 6 it's going to give me still 0 on the left hand side and X minus 2 on the right hand side listen when you have a rational function and you're trying to find your X intercepts the way that we appropriately do that by understanding that when you find X intercepts you're setting your function equal to zero really all you have to do is take your numerator and set it equal to 0 why because firstly your denominator can't equal 0 and if it does you get some problems your numerators the only thing that can equal 0 and if you multiply both sides by X minus 6 is 0 anyway so really just set your numerator equal to 0 and you'll find whatever x-intercepts you have whatever ones are relevant so if I subtract 2x is equal negative 2 what that's saying is that we have an x intercept at negative 2 0 don't just don't just think negative 2 think about how this is a natural point so on your graph you'd be crossing the graph at megohm to 0 wherever whatever that graph looks like last one the y intercept y intercepts are always found by plugging in 0 so don't get these two confused x-intercepts setting equal to 0 usually it's just a numerator for rational functions and then we solve that for y intercepts miners have say hey you know what what is your if you what is it where you cross the y axis well that's gonna be where your x is 0 so if I take my x value of 0 and plug it in that says I want you to find the output when your x value input is 0 it's going to give you a help with its on the y axis that be 0 plus 2 over 0 minus 6 and that's negative 1/3 again this thing is a point you plugged in 0 you got off negative 1/3 that is your y-intercept I hope that this has made sense and I've Illustrated how to find points on graphs I know it's fairly basic but sometimes we could confusing this stuff and once you understand it very very well mostly I need to understand the domain and the range idea the domain is a section of the x-axis your graphs covering the range of the section of the y-axis that your graph is covering this is also very this last example make sure you understand that an input value is absolutely find an output value giving you an output values that you find input value but in both cases you're really just to believe the points if I give you an input plug it in if I give you an output if to set it equal to the output and solve find the domain well we know our two issues we know square roots and denominators so we know the square roots need to be inside positive or greater than an equal to zero denominators cannot equal zero so we set the equals zero and say I must exclude that value other any other number works just fine x-intercepts are basically this problem we'll just say your output is now zero and not two so set your output equal to zero okay my f of X is now 0 and we solve y-intercept just plug in 0 so next time we'll talk about well we'll really go through and talk about even versus odd some of some of these other features of functions that are there coming up at us so I'll see you for that you 

Transcript for: Properties of Functions - Even vs Odd (Precalculus - College Algebra 8)
hey welcome to another video so we're going to continue talking about some features and prop racism functions and the next thing we're going to do is we're going to talk about even an odd and often misunderstood thing or property of functions that students really want to get wrong because they have a misinterpretation of what even versus odd means hence it's right in the root of the word even odd so we'll talk about exactly what even and odd means how to look at it graphically what that translates to mounds of great Glee and then how to check whether it functions even versus odd I'll give you a very very quick way to do this so number one thing that when we talk about even versus odd of course some numbers pop in our head we know even numbers or numbers like 2 4 6 8 10 odd numbers are 1 3 5 7 9 and so oftentimes what students will do when they hear the word even versus odd is think that that relationship between even numbers and odd numbers is always what determines of functions even this oddness or neither nests and that's not true so I'm going to give you the formal definition of what even odd actually mean then we'll talk about algebraically how to deal with it so what an even function looks like graphically and then algebraically after that when we say that a function is even its graph is going to have a certain property to it the graph of an even function is going to be symmetric like if you fold it down the y-axis and fold it onto itself it would be a mirror image perfectly well toggle that means House of bread from in just a second but graphically that's what an even function would do it's going to have a mirror image on write down where that axis symmetry look that y-axis where if you fold it over and make a perfect mirror image and you can probably look at the graphs behind me and determine which one is even and which ones are odd or not what odd means a little bit more difficult odd is this symmetry about the origin so I rotate the graph 180 degrees it's going to give you this thing that was kind of cool if I rotate the graph 180 degrees gonna give the same exact picture that's what odd means for for the graph of a function every odd function will have that property where if we rotate 180 degrees it's gonna be symmetric so looking very quickly we're gonna do a couple things here we're gonna look at the graphs and determine even versus odd we'll also talk about domain and range so you don't forget it well even are there any graphs up here there even well yes this graph is even if I fold this across the y-axis I'm trying my best to make this symmetrical about the why this has symmetry to it this is an even function because we have this this idea of symmetry about the y-axis if I fold it across it match up do we have any odd functions well let's look at the next one is this even well no if I fold this across the y-axis it's not gonna match up but if I rotate it 180 degrees about the origin it would still have the same exact picture to it the same exact graph this is an even function that's giving us this bigger graph this is an odd function that see this this particular graph now notice something you maybe you had some trig before but if we start thinking oh well odd just means the power of the function or something like that that's a trigonometric function if I use PI or I manipulate a little bit but this is based on a trigonometric function its sine of X sort of I would use negative PI and PI but the point is that the exponent itself has very little to do with actually being even or odd in power functions it does single term functions the power will tell you whether the function is even or odd that is true but if I have polynomials we really lose that also functions that don't even have exponents can still be even versus odd so please don't let that misconception probably the biggest one is even an odd that misconception that oh the excellence what tells me that it's even or odd not necessarily so cosine of X is an even function but it doesn't have an exponent at all we need to get away from that we need to understand the definitions of what what these things mean even means as far as its graph is concerned that it has symmetry about the y I'd means as far as this graph is concerned as symmetry about the origin that needs to be in your head right now so even yes even no but it is odd if I rotate 180 degrees about the origin or hath cemetery about the origin that's a lot of function you know what let's skip this one for a second let's look at this one is that even I think in your head right now is that even if I fold this across the wax it doesn't match up no no if I fold it across the y axis and the x axis or rotate 180 degrees is in the same picture yes that right there is an odd function and so you heard me mention something this is this double sort of symmetry if I reflected one piece across the Y and then reflect it across the X so all you visual type people you could probably see that right now can you see it right they might fold this and then fold it again it would give me the same picture same thing here if I reflected this about the Y and then about the x axis it's gonna give me the same exact picture down here that is another way we can think of rotating 180 degrees about the origin this definitely has symmetry about the origin so symmetry about the y even symmetry about the origin odd symmetry about the origin odd symmetry about the y no symmetry about the origin if I reflect it twice does it make the same picture or rotate 180 no that would be neither so if we want to write this stuff down this is an even function both of these are odd and this is neither a lot of graphs are neither even nor odd I don't wanna say most of them but lots of graphs so have this feature the features as far as being having any sort of symmetry there and that's okay we're just trying to have classify this and we're going with it so you know is that when we get to graphing polynomials and especially rational functions that even versus odd is going to tell us a whole lot about how they look in a neighborhood of points so how they behave with asymptotes how they behave around X intercepts has to do with multiplicity and that's an even versus an odd idea so getting a picture what these looks like incredibly important that's why we're studying them now before we go back and I'm a top talk about the algebraic manipulation of this and just saying but before we do that I want to make certain that you understand domain so it so stick with me here let's just go through these really quickly do you remember that the domain is the section or interval of the x axis of their graph covers and the range isn't section or interval the wax or graph covers so let's run through the main real fast domain here would be from negative 4 to 4 including the endpoints range would be from 0 to 3 including the endpoints here domain is from the entirety of the x axis it will eventually cover that negative thing to infinity a range even though we have a couple points here our range will eventually cover the entire y axis this graph goes down forever it will cover the entire y axis domain would be all real numbers range of the all real numbers here domain this will eventually cover the entire x axis domains or members range is from oh not the whole y axis but only from 0 and up but not including the 0 we have parenthesis 0 to infinity here our domain is awkward man what can't we get out if I look at the x axis only I can cover everything past 0 I can cover everything up to 0 but 0 itself has no output remember the domain is all the values of x that give us a valid defined real number output 0 doesn't have that I would have to exclude 0 here interval notation negative a to 0 and then 0 to infinity with with a union between or to say X cannot equal 0 and that's that be fine same exact thing happens on the range I don't cover the whole y axis I cover everything from 0 down everything from 0 up but not 0 itself so I'd exclude 0 in the same exact fashion I hope that makes sense I just want to refresh your memory because domain you get lost when we don't really practice it now because I mentioned that even is a cemetery about the wine odd the graph will have symmetry about the origin sometimes we don't have a graph to look at and I want to be a little bit more specific on what happens with even versus odd because that is a definition but not the only one that we have this is a great definition for grass oh yeah even wood all over have symmetry about it now y-axis odd would rotate 180 or double flip around x and y if you want to call that it has symmetry about the origin but I want you to look at what happens to the inputs versus the outputs and don't give us a new definition for this this is more important so really focus on this if we look at an even graph what happens to the outputs when I plug in opposite inputs and think about how this would cause symmetry here if I plug in or look at my inputs for and the opposite negative for what would have to happen to keep my graph symmetrical about the Y well what would happen to happen is if I plug in let's say for you guys negative 1 and 1 and I want symmetry about the y-axis I want to look for even functions but I plug in 1 negative 1 and positive 1 my outputs would have to be exactly the same if I plugged in negative 4 and positive 4 my outputs would have to be the same no matter where they're both above or both below here's what even really does even functions take opposite inputs and give you equal outputs they give you the same output they'd say okay take an opposite take two opposite numbers so 3 and negative 3 and 3 or negative 4 and 4 and they even 101 or whatever you have and whatever my opposite inputs are they would have the same output are you see you have to see how that would create symmetry about the y-axis that would say yep my outputs are the same when my inputs are opposite that's what even functions really do it says if I plug in if I remember to put my sign correctly if I plug in opposite inputs they have the same output opposite inputs they have the same that's 2 I will put it that is what even functions do now mathematically here's how it looks it says if I plug in man I hope you get this if I plug in opposite inputs notice how this is opposite inputs it says 3 up negative 3 this is negative 5 over negative negative 5 opposite negative 5 that would be positive 5 whatever X is these are giving you opposite inputs and says for even functions if you have opposite inputs you will have equal outputs that is what defines an even function says if I'm plugging in two numbers which are opposites my outputs will still be the same are you seeing how that would give you symmetry opposite inputs same outputs that's how we check so basically what we're going to be doing is you're saying if I take a negative x it's the reason why we we started evaluating like several videos ago like can you plug in five can you plug in negative x completing X plus one why why why would we try to negative x that's how we show even functions and mod functions so with even functions the graphs will be symmetric about the Y but what that means for us is that if I take opposite inputs now I have to have the same output out opposite inputs will still yield equal outputs now odd is different odd says if I want to be odd or symmetric about the origin I want to be able to plug in opposite inputs but get opposite outputs so plug in one and negative one and get out five and negative five I'm saying I want to be able to plug in two and negative two and get out one and negative one say I want to be able to plug in opposite inputs and get opposite outputs out that would give us this ability to rotate and have the same exact picture one of the 180 degrees or about people words that's what's happening here if I take positive two and negative two I'm getting opposite outputs one negative one every single odd function will have that feature now how does it how's that look mathematically well if we have symmetry about the origin if we're talking about odd this says if I plug in opposite inputs notice these are opposite inputs then well the outputs would be opposite as well so says take your take your input values plug them into your function these things will not be equal that would be even if I take out opposite inputs and I get the same output I'm getting symmetry about the y-axis if I take opposite inputs I get opposite outputs I'm taking opposite values in I'm getting opposite values out no matter how you cut it that would be an odd function this is what defines odd so it all comes down to your understanding of what even means and how that relates to it mathematically you have to get it if even means symmetry about the y that requires you to be able to take opposite inputs and get on the same output opposite inputs same output equal odd says I'm requiring you to take opposite inputs and get opposite outlets here's opposite inputs and they're opposite outputs this is exactly how we check algebraically to see whether it functions even odd certainly surprisingly to some of you it's not about the powers this definition works for for every function that we would check for even versus odd absolute values those don't really have exponents in them but there you do you have a power one if you wanted absolute value X that that V that we get for an absolute value that's an even function it has nothing to do with an exponent sine cosine tangent those things we can check whether the even odd or neither by taking these and a certain interval of numbers so we'll be doing that in just a moment erase these functions at this point you need to really have in your head two things number one how to identify even and odd versus the graph whether it's cemetery about the why cemetery about the origin or neither and then the idea that even means opposite inputs same output odd means opposite inputs opposite outputs and that's going to really drive what we do it in just a little bit so stick around be right back okay little mistake there what I want to mention is that when we have F of negative x we plug in an opposite inputs I had this sign wrong this sign should be over here that should be an opposite output so this says hey if I take opposite inputs my outputs are also opposite sorry about that I want to make sure that that is clear the sign is gonna be wrong use a little bit but this is what you need to know I need to make certain that so that's clear for you so odd says if I plug in opposite inputs I've got opposite outputs this is the output of the function is that the function they would be opposite values so that's what odd means mathematically all right so we're ready to see whether these functions are even odd or neither and instead of grafton because it takes a whole lot of work we're gonna use the definitions of what even and odd actually mean so even means if I plug in opposite inputs I'm gonna have the same output all it means if I plug in opposite inputs I'm gonna opposite outputs that would give a century about the Y and the origin respectively so one way to do this it's not by looking at the expo all the time at least this down a really bad path there's some times I'm going to show you very quickly how to do it something very similar to that by looking at excellence and changing certain parts of it but in general one idea that to find this without graphing it is to just evaluate it so if we evaluate our function from negative X and we get exactly the same thing so basically we plug in negative x and see we the same function back if that's true if we plug in negative x at night for negative x and the thing we got out here is exactly the same thing that we started with it's what you're starting with then we have an even function since you plugged in opposite values in general not for just one point and it gave you opposite but it's the same outputs they gave you equal outputs that's even for odd we could do the same thing so if we plug in negative x to our function and we get out the same thing we started with but with a negative sign or every sign is opposite that would be odd so in general we're going to evaluate for negative x and see what happens so you can have maybe a guess at what goes on some of these you know well every every powers even it's probably even that's true sometimes you can do that every power saw it's probably odd no it's not that's not odd there's even an odd ones that one the idea isn't just about exponents the idea is what happens my plug in opposite inputs so I'm going to show you how to do that with these six examples just walk through them and true we're looking for I'm also going to give you kind of a shortcut here mathematically what we're doing when we have value for negative x is we're plugging in an opposite input to our original function we're saying imagine taking positive numbers or plug in all days or negative numbers and the hub solute negatives positives and seeing what that gives us case-by-case so but for all inputs if I do that man our knowledge of compositions or of evaluating functions comes into play we've already done this we say how do you evaluate well you say I want to replace the X with something I want to create a blank space I want to plug that negative X in there for that blank space what is going to happen when you have even exponents well your powers are the powers are going to change the signs are going to cheat the signs are going to be positive so if we have these positive even exponents and we start plugging in negative numbers it's going to always give us positive out so for every positive whole number even power we're always going to be getting a positive numbers out so negative x to the fourth power has to give you positive x to the fourth our sign is not going to change our minds doesn't gonna change negative x to the second power is positive x squared notice how what we got out is exactly the same thing as what we started with so this says you plug in opposite inputs you're getting the same exact outlets out no matter no matter what input that is that right there is the definition of even it says that nothing changes when you plug in a negative X you evaluate that nothing changes you have an even function now let's try G of X when we look at that ago right now you know what we know what's do we know that in order to test whether this is even odd or neither we start by evaluating native X you start by plugging in a negative or an opposite number and seeing if we have the same outputs or ops outputs so we're gonna do this you know all right well when we evaluate things we always give our self some blank spaces and then we plug in whatever value is here so this is replace your X with negative x no problem there's negative x here's negative actually already looked at compositions well with our power 2 we know that that even powers maintenance positives all the time they maintain positivity so we would have an x squared minus 1 our denominator has not changed but our numerator there's no even power here it's an odd part power one well odds maintain silence so that would be a negative x over positive x squared minus one well for me right in just a little bit I could write that negative in front that is saying hey look yeah the same thing as you started with but with the negative front that's this case it says you ended with the same thing Hey look you put the negative X we're looking at negative x you got the same exact thing but with a native front same exact things are started with the native front this is what God looks like that's what God looks like so in general evens a little bit easier to find because nothing changes oh yeah nothing changes legs thing but odd is a little more difficult because you have to you have to find a function where if you factor a negative out you can get original function with a negative front that's what we're looking for let's talk about one more and I'll give you kind of a quick way to deal with it so H of negative x this is testing whether we have an even odd or neither function and so what this says is you're gonna replace your x value with something but notice how the +5 cannot possibly change you all right let's evaluate with negative x I know that odd powers maintain signs so this would be negative 3x to the third here's negative x cubed three times that's negative three X to the third plus five you go well that's that's not exactly the same as that notice this is not the same thing as that so they can't be even so okay what's the next step well let's factor out a negative if i factor out a negative I get 3x cubed minus five what's the minus five when you factor that negative out you go we'll wait a minute this is not the same thing as I started with so this is not just opposite outputs this is not the same output at all right there that's telling you that this is neither it's not even you didn't get the same thing out it's not odd you get the same thing with a negative in front you didn't get the original function with a negative front you got neither the original function in neither of these cases so you factor negative that's not the original function you didn't factor negative that's not the original function so this is not even not the same this is not odd not the same with a negative factored out this would be neither now what we can infer from that is that this doesn't have any sort of symmetry about the y-axis or about the origin so it's kind of nice to know that now here's the little shortcut that I would do when I do these on my own I know that because even powers make everything positive and odd powers change the sign if I plug in a negative and constants don't change how I check for even odd or neither is I just change the sign of my odd powers and then if I get the same thing out well then I know it's even if I if I don't well then I know it's if I get an opposite in front then I know it's on if I get neither those two things I know it's neither so here I'd say hey let's change my odd powers there's none okay that's even changing my odd powers okay there's one on powers power one so I'm gonna change that sign there we go okay factor that it's on I'm gonna change my odd powers so I changed that to a negative so change of terms and my odd powers leave my constants oh wait that's neater so that's a very quick way to at least check your work with it let's go to the next one so I think about that if I think let's plug in negative x my odd power terms would change signs I don't have any nothing can possibly change signs here that's an even function or you see what I'm talking about now so I'm looking at this and going my odd powers would change signs if I do F of negative x I don't have any odd powered terms and so I know that x squared and say the same plus 3 that's a constant it can't change x squared let's say it's a my so let's say the same that's exactly the same function I started with even though I plug in negative x that would be an even function and this function will be symmetric about the y-axis important stuff to know let me talk about here for a second so H of negative x age of negative x ago right let's see I'm gonna change my odd powered terms I'm going to leave my even power terms alone and my constant loan that's what negative XO do now can you show this by evaluating of course I've shown you three examples where that's the case I'm show you do it right here but if you're if you're really thinking about it what what happens or even power terms would not change signs even if I plug in a negative my constants cannot change no matter what I plug in my odd power terms will change signs so negative x-cubed become positive execute you go wait a minute i can't factor a negative out of that that's true but think further than what we're doing this is why we talked a long time about the idea of you're plugging in opposite inputs you're getting out opposite outputs probably care that I don't have a double negative here or something what I care about is that this really is probably appropriately written as this here's your input here's the output here's your input here's the output I have opposite inputs do I have opposite outputs yes one has a negative in front and one does not this would be an odd function this is going to have symmetry it's graphs could have symmetry about the origin if you need to see another way or you want to show some more work listening we'd have to show that we'd be plugging in this 2t here I'm gonna erase this first thing I'm gonna do it that way we'd say all right you have a negative I know that I'm replacing X with negative X I'm plugging in opposite inputs I know that negative x cubed is negative x cubed but then that negative is going to give me positive x cubed this would be positive 3x squared because even powers always make that positive for you or if you want to show this differently say you know what I can factor that negative I can leave this as negative x cubed over 3 x squared minus 9 then you do that move this negative to the front of a fraction leave this naked as negative x you and now you can really see that hey here's the original that I had here's my opposite in front of it so opposite inputs yielded opposite of the same exact output that we had either way you want to go on that work now the last though this is definitely on I have the last one so we know that even and odd we take an opposite input so as we evaluate for negative X and we look at what happens if we get the same thing out even if we get opposite outputs out so the same thing with a negative front we get odd now in a situation like this where Y all right well wait a minute if these are positive numbers because domain wise you have to have positives gives you that to give you a real defined output then these are all be negatives if these are negatives that would be defined and those are view positives so one of these is not a great situation for us when that happens you have a meter because if you're positive values are defined and your negative values aren't what that means is you plug in opposite inputs and one of them works and one goes not real number when that happens you have an either this is not even there's no symmetry about the y it's not odd there's no symmetry about the origin this graph will have no symmetry at all because ops and values aren't even defined these would be imaginary numbers so we say neither all right I hope that makes sense for you I hope that graphically understand the idea of symmetry I hope that you understand why this is the case based on that symmetry in looking at the graph so then we used it we understand that even means opposite inputs same exact outputs odd means opposite inputs and then opposite outputs yielded from that we can check it through evaluation simplifying if we get the same exact thing we started with by plugging in negative x so we have an even function if we get an odd function that means that we have a negative that we can factor out me an opposite in front of the original function after plugging in negative x if those things don't happen then you have an either so that's it for even on we'll talk about that's something three my next time local extrema and absolute extrema so local maximum or relative maximum and absolute maximum I'll see you for the next video have a good day you 

Transcript for: Properties of Functions - Increasing vs Decreasing (Precalculus - College Algebra 9)
hey welcome to another video before we get into extrema absolute maxes men's local or relative maximum ins I wanted to talk about increase in decreasing because the way that I'm going to define local maxes and mins is the change where we change from increasing decreasing or decreasing to increasing and that give us a little peak or a little trough there and so we didn't really understand what increase in a decreasing mean in a graph in order for us to interpret that accurately so let's take a look at that for just a little bit so when we say you're going to get a formal definition in your textbook where you're going out of when we say that a function is increasing here's what we mean and then practically here's what we can look for increasing in a function or a graph means that if I take an x-value and look at one just larger than that so as you're moving from left to right of the x axis then the functions input is growing and the functions output if we're increasing is also growing so if I say hey take a look at an X value and one to the right of it then the output will be larger as we move to the right that's what increase what the says in English it says as you look from left to right so in x value and one bigger minute as you look from left to right what's your function doing if a functions increasing then the output will be getting larger as you move from left to right so in English what it says is from left to right the graph ly climbs that's what increasing means for decreasing opposite happens and this says hey look at your look at your x-values if you have an x-value that is getting larger as you move from left to right then your output will be getting smaller and that would create this graph that is falling as you move from left to right a couple notes to really keep in mind all of this is given by an open interval you will never ever use brackets or equal signs with increasing and decreasing and the reason why is because if we're increasing as a connotation that as we're moving from left to right the graph continues to climb and climb and climb and climb that mean the next value has to be bigger than the previous one and you can't stop or create this this close interval and have an increasing idea it could have increased until that point but it can be increasing because the next value would not be there and so we can't check to see well what's the next value pass an endpoint so if we have an endpoint you can't say it's well it's a you can't say it's increasing at that endpoint because there's no next value to test whether to see if the output is higher than the one that you're looking at so in order for something to to have increasing you have to have an open interval so that says you can continue to get larger and larger and larger and larger and larger to test whether to see if those outputs are getting higher and higher or smaller and smaller you can't do that if we start closing things off so all of our our intervals are always open for increasing and decreasing and they're always given by the x axis remember me telling you that how a lot of things in in graphs are determined X X it's really only arranged a couple other things with your mother y YX the idea but like domain X idea x axis idea where we're above or below the x axis x axis idea so what increase in decreasing really asks in English it is this encryption says tell me the part of the x axis where when you look from left to right your graph is climbing decreasing says tell me the part of the x axis where if you look from left to right your graph is falling that is what increasing and decreasing means as simple as I can make it so we're going to look at some intervals I'm going to use only interval notation today you can translate this to to equality notation no problem but let's take a look at this first graph we want to look for increasing first and then decreasing later you move back or it doesn't really matter but let's take a look at it when we say I'm looking for the intervals of increasing what we're looking for is the interval the part of the x-axis where when I read from left to right that's what this means left to right when I read from left to right my graph is climbing so not right to left and my grandpa's is climbing that that's not what we're talking about but as I read it from left to right my graph is climbing so it's the graph climbing on this interval no no the graph is falling as I read from left to right this graph is falling then I get to here then it climbs then I get to here and then it falls then I get to here then it climbs notice my right hand was tracing the graph but my left hand was looking at my interval on my x-axis you're the left hand here is what's determining your intervals of increasing and decreasing so again it's the section of the x-axis or as you read it from left to right my graph is climbing that's what the increasing means so I'm moving what's going all right on here to here my graph is falling oh right here right here at negative two it starts to increase until I get to zero so one interval of increasing would be on the x-axis from negative 2 to 0 this is increasing I'm just put an eye there that's an interval of increasing then at 0 it sits well at 0 at 0 am i increasing at that point am i decreasing at that point well well no this is the reason why our intervals have to be open at 0 I'm neither increasing nor am i decreasing that's called a local match we'll talk about it next time in the next video but this is where we will change from increasing to decreasing so we have this idea of open intervals for increasing decreasing because you have to happen to have the ability to get larger with every point that you're checking every next value that gets larger your function must get larger from increasing must get smaller for decreasing so we have this open interval from negative 2 to 0 where our graph was climbing as I'm looking on the x-axis from left to right there's another one so here I'm looking from here to here my graph is falling then from here to here we're increasing no problem that's climbing from 0 to 2 my graph is falling and then the next section of the graph where I look at my x axis and my graphic line is I move left to right is from 2 to 4 this is another section of increase in my graph is climbing on this portion of x axis at 3 like to write so I'm going to put all this together and we say that the increasing the the intervals of increasing are the parts of the x-axis where when I look from left to right my graph is finding that's from negative 2 to 0 that's also from 2 to 4 we must use open intervals for all of those sections of the x-axis it's a climbing idea it doesn't have climbed and then you saw here you always have to have an open interval so that you can you can satisfy this so that there's a next point and there's a next point and there's a next point open intervals that you do that get as close as you want without actually stopping and so do that we got to have open decreasing is is the opposite idea so as you're still moving from left to right but as you move up the right your graph is falling so find the intervals on the x-axis where when I look from left to right my graph is falling well my graph starts at negative 4 and it's falling until we get negative 2 so this right here would be in the interval of decreasing and another interval of decreasing so our graph decreases in this case our graph is decreasing wherever it's not increasing sometimes you can have a constant so where it's horizontal for a time and then it will neither increase nor decrease will dissipate constant we can we can deal with that too but in our case here we have an interval of decreasing section exaggerate or graphs falling as I read from left to right is negative for the negative to open interval then again from 0 to 2 that is how increasing and decreasing work they're always open they're always intervals of the x axis super important for us to understand that let's go ahead and let's talk about the the next one we'll do this one over here can you look and see man you should be doing this see if you can find the one interval of increasing so the only interval of increasing as I look from left to right on the x axis where my graph is climbing so I'm going to use to answer left hand is looking at my intervals the state studying the x-axis it's going to mark where I start and stop my right hand is tracing so here I'm falling I'm falling and falling I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling oh I hit a low point now I'm climbing a little margaret there that's gonna be where I start increasing I'm going I'm going go and go and go okay that's stop increasing put another little mark that right there is how we determine the interval of the x axis where a graph is climbing so I was fall of Spaulding's like it here I started increasing I stuck increasing that right there is my interval of increasing does not increase outside of that so interval of increasing is just from negative 1 to 1 now decreasing gets a little awkward when we think about what's going on here but and the arrows they look confusing you know oh well that's that's increasing no it's not it's not increasing because the way we're either graph has to be from left to right as our X's are getting larger so we put our hand on our x-axis or okay our graph is falling from where well falling on the x-axis this hand is way over at negative infinity negative infinity over here and positive infinity or whatever here so our graph is falling on the x axis on that interval the interval of this this graph is falling on us from negative infinity all the way until negative 1 so decreasing wise this graph is decreasing on the x axis from negative infinity to negative 1 and then again so let's see now I start to increase I stop increase oh I'm starting to decrease again so it's decreasing from 1 and then it never stops decreasing it goes down but my left hand keeps on with that x axis forever that's gonna be decreasing in to positive infinity so we'd be decreasing here and decreasing here and it doesn't end I hope that's making sense you hope the idea of your left hand is kind of your marker so where were you where you're decreasing your mark and a decrease in them when you when you change when you start increasing make a little mark so I'm decreasing a start increasing that makes my little mark here for increasing and then I stop and that's going to show you where your interval is okay this one's this one is tricky because of this right here because it looks like sometimes we get some weird graphs and we have to kind of assume where it crosses the x-axis it keeps on going forever you should be looking at this and finding your intervals of increasing right now you should be looking at that finding increasing so as far as funding increased I'm going to trace the graph of my my right hand I'm going to look at my left hand and wherever my pencil starts to climb as a move from left to right that starts my interval on the x-axis for increasing so I'm falling here I'm falling right here I start to increase so an increase increase increase increase I'm following this in my left hand I'm hitting this go up now I'm inserting decrease I'm stop that so this first interval from negative 2 to 0 that part of the x-axis is where my graph is climbing so again I'm at 0 now I'm falling falling falling falling falling falling falling falling falling Oh I've stopped falling now I'm climbing in so this next interval is an interval of increasing that starts at 2 and it doesn't end those are my two intervals on the x-axis where my graph is climbing that's exactly where showing they're always open they never include the values because of the definition that we have for increasing and decreasing now decreasing I'm going to show the intervals an x-axis where I'm falling so again I'm gonna take this No oh yeah hey I start off falling and because this goes forever it will eventually get remember X as an idea is one-dimensional it eventually get to negative infinity so this graph is falling way over here it's falling falling falling falling falling all the way to negative 2 that's interval of decreasing and then ok so now I'm increasing increasing increasing up and start to fall again so I'm going to make another interval of decreasing until we get down to this point and on the x-axis until we stop that positive 2 that's another decreasing from 0 to 2 we've seen how to work that are you seeing how hopefully you're seeing how to make your interval your graph is doing one thing but the interval is an increasing decreasing or only on the x axis so when we look one dimensional you're writing those intervals last one is that graph ever-decreasing is it ever decreasing the answer is no it's not because as we move from left to right there's nothing going on here I want to include this interval at all so I'm going there's nothing going on why would I include that there's no graph over here but right when I hit that zero oh my pencils down here so at zero open interval here it's not there's no point at zero it's not defined but it's just past zero my pencils way down here and as I trace this my craft is climbing along this portion of the x-axis it's increasing the whole entire time it'll never peak it's going to get really slow but don't let that repeat so this is increasing from let's let's see again it starts off at zero and then it climbs forever open interval there is no interval of decreasing it never falls I hope that gives you a good interpretation of what increasing decrease you mean how it is always on the x axis you you can tell how easy it is for students to go oh it's increasing from negative whatever this number is to positive whatever it's very easy to make that misconception if we really focus on this as increasing decreasing our intervals of the x axis only where your graph is climbing do it the way that I showed you and typically that works pretty well so that's gonna be where we're going to stop on this video in the next video I'm gonna talk about how where we change from increasing to decreasing in a neighborhood around that point we will have a peak and then the neighborhood around where we change from decreasing to increasing it will have a little trough and those are going to be local or relative maximum and we'll talk about that and absolute Maxima in the next video you 

Transcript for: Properties of Functions - Extrema (Precalculus - College Algebra 10)
hey welcome to another video today we're going to talk about extrema local or relative and absolute extrema what that means is local maxes local mins absolute maxes absolute mins talking about high points and low points of our graph so let me explain the difference between local Max and min or relative maximum and absolute then we'll just go through some examples and learn exactly how to determine local Max and min through graphs we won't be able to do it very well with algebraic expressions because we pretty much need calculus to do that in something called a derivative and a horizontal tangent and some things that we are not ready for but get an idea about what they mean now is important so that when we find them later in calculus you'll understand what what we're finding so what a local or a relative maximum or minimum means is that in an open interval a little neighborhood of your graph you have a high point or a low point that's pretty much what a local or relative maximum mean the definition of it is that on this open interval we have this value that is higher or equal to all the other values around it for it a little neighborhood nothing tire graph there just a little neighborhood of an open interval of the x axis so the values seen would be called a local max one thing that are saying right now when you're finding a local Max or local man or absolute max Raps of min the output value is the maximum or minimum it occurs at a point X comma that output X comma the local Max X comma the local man or absolute max absolute min but the output value itself is what we're talking about as far as a local max Ehrmann that should make sense the maximum output would be an output value an absolute maximum output would be an output value again so keep there to mind we're finding the value of the output at a certain x value for our input so an easy way to remember that as far as what a local match your local min is what where to look for a local maximum is going to generally occur like 9 amperes on the time it's going to generally occur where we change think about this where we change from increasing to decreasing on that change remember that the increase in is open and the decrease is open and where they change we didn't include that point on increasing or decreasing well that point itself is where the change happens that point itself is a local Max or lumen so when we change from increasing to decreasing we're going to have a little peak there that peak is our local maximum or where that local maximum occurs so we are going to generally look for a function changes from increasing to decreasing and that's going to give us a relative or a local maximum a neighborhood of points it's open interval where we have one value higher than all the other ones higher than or equal to all the ones around it likewise for a local relative min we're gonna have this value that's that's lower than or a small and gray less than or equal to all the other values around it on an open interval of points it's a little neighborhood generally that happens where function changes from decreasing to increasing well we're having a little trough there so we've fallen and then we've changed from decreasing to increasing well where that change occurs where you're no longer decreasing and you're not starting to increase yet that little point that that's where your local minimum is going to occur a couple things to note about this you do not have to have local maxes or local mins on any of your graphs you also don't have to have absolute maxima none in your graphs but where they occur is going to be a change from increasing to decreasing most likely or a decrease an increasing for local minimum the y say most likely there are some cases where we have constants that this can come into play so I need to understand that also you can have more than one place where the same local maximum occurs you also have more than one place on the same absolute maximum incursion or likewise a minimum so the main idea is look for areas of your graph where your change is increasing to decreasing for maxes and decreasing for bids as far as relative or local maximum absolute maximum just means the highest and lowest point that your graph attains so the absolute maximum is going to be this this thing that you never get a value higher than that that's an output absolute Mensing to this value that you never get a value lower than that for a under graph as far as a output is concerned so a few things to note you also you don't have to get these either that they could not be non-existent on your graphs but where they occur you're going to get you're going to get this actual physical point that you do not attain a value higher than that I need to make a note that every closed interval brackets every closed interval will guarantee you that you have an absolute max and an absolute min that and that would be a closed continuous no gaps no jumps no no separating things there are no asymptotes then you can guarantee they of announcement max in it without that condition you cannot guarantee it so every closed interval that's continuous is going to have both an absolute maximum I'm going to put the word continuous up here I'm gonna spell right so every close continuous interval gonna have an absolute maximum we're going to try these right now with with one one thing I need to make sure that last thing you know is uh that local or relative maxes cannot occur at endpoints absolute maxes mins can occur angles so one last time all the way through what local means is on the neighborhood so on this little thing you change from increasing to decreasing local Max or decreasing increasing local maybe yellow peak or you have a trough on your graph somewhere in a little neighborhood points any points don't qualify because it's defined as an open interval your endpoint is not on an open interval your endpoint is on a closed interval you can't get past that endpoint to determine whether you change from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing you don't have that point being higher than all the the points around it because there's no neighborhood to look at and so we do not include endpoints for local maxes or local mins absolute maxes and mins that's the highest point or lowest point in your graph every closed continuous intervals you don't have that and we can't allow endpoints because we're just looking for the highest value in tank that's the idea keep in mind that all these things are the output value they occur at a point and so the point itself is not really a local max local min absolute max absolute min it's just where that occurs the output value is the maximum and we'll be looking forward so we're going to do how do I mean that is looks like six examples I'm just going to go through what the local max local min absolute Max absolute min is what they are I'm going to change this last one to make it work for us and talk about how the absolute Max and min the absolute maximum value can occur in more than one place we have to define that and so here we go as far as a local Max is concerned we may look for a local Max we are looking for a point where our fun in general change from increasing to decreasing or a neighborhood of the x-axis little interval x-axis we have a high point a little peak so that right there this graph changes from increasing to decreasing it has a little peak in this neighborhood of points on the x-axis that's the highest point that there is so our local maximum is not too it's not too comma for the local maximum is for it occurs at the point 2 4 but you see the difference you should see the difference the maximum value in that little neighborhood is 4 that is what we're talking about just occurs at the doubt at the point 2 comma 4 likewise there is a local minimum or a relative minimum you say either one the local minimum well wherever we change from decreasing to increasing very little trough wherever we have a neighborhood of points where we have a smallest point that would be right here so we're decreasing up we're increasing where the change happens negative 2 comma 1 that's where local minimum is so the minimum value is 2 it occurs at the point negative 1 comma 2 this is not a local minimum this is not a local maximum the reason why is because there's no neighborhood around it it stops right there you go well what about what's next I don't know what's next so you can't say that it's changing from decreasing to increasing because you don't know what's next you can't say it's on an open interval so we can't say that that's the smallest point on the open interval to define a local max remains so it might seem like a nuance but we can't include our endpoints for local Max or relative Max or relative min we can do it for absolute Max Ehrmann and so when we look at the absolute max what we're looking for is the highest value attained by your ear function notice one thing about it can it elves can it occurred something that's also a local max yes does it have to know so in general we look at our local maxes and we look our our endpoints and whatever is the out of those that's your absolute max so we look here to Elm is that the highest value for or is my end point the highest value is this end point the highest value so I'm looking at output output elbow that's the highest output that right there says that this end point is where my absolute maximum occurs on being very specific among wording here the absolute maximum is 5 where it occurs as negative 4 comma 5 can they be at local maxes yes do they have to be no they can be endpoints locals cannot be endpoints absolutes can absolute minimum let's see the lowest value attained by our graph let's look at our outputs 5 2 4 1 okay that's the smallest output we have it doesn't go any lower than that my local minimum it has a value of 2 right in this neighborhood my absolute minimum has a value of 1 it occurs an endpoint that is okay it's 1 at the point 5 1 and this should be making sense to you at this at this point now climb 10 then that the the value of the output is our Max or min and where it occurs is if there's a point so let's look at the next one so we're going to go up here the next one if we look at that that is a continuous function on a closed interval do you see the same thing here there's no there's no gaps there's no missing points like we have in these there's no asymptotes that we're trying to not that we can't cross over this graph right here is going to have an absolute max and an absolute min that doesn't guarantee we have the local matches are minced but a closed interval with the continuous curves go to guarantee that we have a highest value and a lowest value it's got to be that way so let's go ahead and identify our local Maxima local min first and their absolute Max and min so our local Max we're looking at our our graph and and seeing where we change from increasing to decreasing so here I'm decreasing here I'm increasing here I'm doing okay so I'm changing from increasing to decreasing that's going to create a peak and neighborhood where we have a high wait the local max here right there is five at the point 3 comma 5 we also have a local min so where we change from decreasing to increasing oh it would decrease okay now increasing that point right there when we change from decreasing increasing it's a little trough that local minimum is negative 1 that's our output value at the point negative one maybe one that's where that occurs we never include endpoints for local master mins of this not included that cannot be included because we don't have an open interval absolute Max or min so now we're looking just for the highest value that occurred so the highest output our outputs are 2 negative 1 0 & 5 the highest of those values occurs actually at that local Max so the absolute max is also 5 add 3 comma 5 but for a different reason than this so the local max is a change where we change from increasing to decreasing or in a neighborhood of points we have a high point it does not have to be the highest point in your graph does it because this is still a local max but it's not the highest point this is a local Max for the same reason this one is it's a change from increasing to decreasing in a little open interval it's the high point just looking at like when you zoom in oh that's a little peak right there but it's not the highest point it's at the highest point here it is also the highest point here so the local is just a zoomed in idea and absolute is the big picture so big picture the 5 is also the highest value we've ever attained it just so happens that it's also occurring a local max in this case put an end point in this case absolute mins same thing that's the minimum here it's 2 5 0 negative 1 the negative 1 is the lowest value that we get it happens to occur at a local minimum and not an endpoint here so you can have absolute maximum of the same as other local maximum or at endpoints generally that's where they're going to occur on continuous curves is absolute Max or min is going to occur at a local or at an endpoint and using calculus when we get there for continuous differentiable curves we look at that we look at the the local measurement critical points give us those and we look at end points and determine what's our absolute maximum or minimum all right I want to go on to this one then this one then this one amount so we're moving over here now we're missing some points that's what those little open circles mean they say you you get close to it but then we're just removing one little point like a removable disk company it's only a discontinuity so this is no longer a continuous function which means that this whole hey every closed interval is going to add one of these that's true if we have a continuous function and we're going to see how we're moving that point really affects a lot of what we're going to do so let's see do we have a point where we have changed from increasing to decreasing well we're increasing increasing increasing increasing increasing decreasing so at that point if there was a point there we would have a local max we would have a peak we'd say hey in the neighborhood around this this little open interval we have a high point that this value is higher than anything around it but if I take that point out they say well that's no longer there well then we will still increase forever here this is still increasing it never stops increasing this is decreasing it never stops well it never actually has a point where you're not decreasing on this open interval so we can't actually change we can't have a point where it's neither increasing nor decreasing everything up to the three is increasing everything after the three on the x-axis is decreasing where the value that were changes it has been removed therefore we don't have an actual point on an open interval that's higher than anything else let's say this is the highest point we don't have that and so we do not have a local max here we would but we took it away so there's none we also have no local minimum or relative minimum and it's not just because this point is gone it's because we never change from decreasing to increasing endpoints can't be included in those anyhow and there's not even an endpoint there so we're always decreased here there's no value that's the literal lowest in a neighborhood of points an open interval that doesn't occur with with any points in general or even at this open missing point because you can always be a little bit lower a little bit lower a little bit lower there's no solid point that's the lowest in a neighborhood same thing here endpoint we've failed to be on a neighborhood of open interval so there's no local max there's also no local minimum is there absolute maximum no for the same reason that there's no local max here there's no actual physical point that you say this is the highest I can attain you can get like like 4.9 can't you we need 3 comma or close to three comma four point nine or four point 99 or for what I own a night but you never get an actual highest value because we're missing that five you never get to the five for that output and so we don't have an absolute max do we have an absolute min sure we do this doesn't continue to go down this kind of fizzles out as we approach a height of two so if X is six but height is two but we do have a lowest point of negative three on that end point and that occurs at zero negative 30 so notice you can still have some absolute Max and min if we if we don't have a closed continuous an interval that's closed and a continuous group on that but you can still have them you know it's just as a guarantee it anymore so yeah no local max there's no point there no local man we have nowhere when we change from decreasing to increasing absolute max again there's no point absolutely okay we can now include that end point that's the lowest value that we have let's go you know what let's do that one so do we have a local max thing for yourself is there a point to find point not open where we change from increasing to decreasing we're on an open interval little neighborhood we have a high point yeah we have right there so the local maximum is 4 it occurs at the point to comfy do we have a local and there's only one of them do we have a local minimum yeah yeah we have a point where we've changed from decreasing to increasing there's a little trough here we know that in the neighborhood around this point that's the lowest spot has a height of 1 at the point negative one level do we have an absolute maximum sure we do we have a high point on this graph right there at that local max that's also the highest value attained on this distress so we have an absolute max of 4 at the point 2 comma 4 just like our local max but for a different reason it's just the highest point that we get do we have an absolute min well no no this graph decreases increases and decreases and it keeps on decreasing forever and ever never as X approaches whatever that vertical asymptote is this graph approaches negative infinity so we're not gonna say negative infinity is the absolute max even though that's where the limit as we approach the x value would go the limits value would say yes it goes to negative infinity the limit is as we get closer and closer to something on the x axis our graph approaches something on the y axis that's basically what when it does a value of from the y axis here we don't have a an actual value though so an absolute Max has to be a point a value that we attained that happens to be the lowest value on the graph there's there's a time here we wouldn't have put negative infinity we wouldn't do that all right moving forward can you have more than one local maximum and more than one local minimum absolutely you can so here when we look at this we're decreasing and then increasing okay that's a local minimum or increasing and then decreasing okay that's a local maximum or decreasing and increasing that's a different local minimum it's okay to have several local mins and local maxes because we're looking at individual little neighborhoods individual little open intervals so you could have a craft this just does this all day long and you have hundreds of local maxes and hundreds of local minutes they could even occur the same value like well sine and cosine when we get there we're gonna see they have an infinite number of local maxes every PI or PI over two intervals you're gonna get this oh here's the peak there's another trouble there's something there's another trough like a little roller coaster over and over and over and they get the same height again and again you just have a different local Max and local min at every single one of those X values so our local max here and change from increasing to decreasing right there then that in an open interval the highest value is five and it occurs at the point zero five local minimum we have two so we have one where we change a decrease increase in here careful the height is zero that's the local minimum it occurs at negative two zero we have another one decreasing the increase in local minimum we have a height of 1 at the point 3 comma 1 so we certainly can have multiple local maxes because their neighborhood oriented they're just a little open interval around a certain point where that point is the highest point of any neighborhood absolute max what do you think absolute max have some X no absolute max no it goes to infinity so as we're approaching that as we're approaching whatever this numbers on the x axis our graph is going to positive infinity for there for that reason we have no absolute max we do have an absolute minimum so we're looking at the output values 3 5 1 0 0 is the lowest value that's attained by this function therefore that's the absolute minimum at this point this should be really making sense like ok I understand that the the value the output value is the local max local man absolute max absolute min I should be understanding that on continuous curve on a closed interval has to have a highest in the lowest point as soon as I mess with that start taking points out start having non closed intervals like these well then we start removing that necessity we start looking at just okay is there a highest point as their lowest point it could occur at a local max Ehrmann or it could occur to end point local maximum cannot occur at endpoints because they have to be based on open intervals but we could have more than one of them you will only have one absolute maximum get out many different local Max and local mins let's check out one more maybe you see it you should be seeing that there is no local Max ooh even though we change from increasing to decreasing at once you move there's another local min here even though we changed or decreasing to increasing there's the point's been removed there's no absolute max highest point Harrison on it gets closer and closer to five that never gets there absolute min there is none you closer and closer whatever this height is but it never actually achieves that about you can get closer and closer that better gets there now let me change it just look so nothing nothing on this guy let me change it a little bit let's put that point there let's say it's negative 4 comma 5 does this graph have a local max now yes the local maximum is 5 it occurs at the point 5 5 does it have a local minimum no that points still missing a local let's see absolute minimum nope no at this point still missing this is not the lowest point it does get lower than that but it never achieves the a lowest point does it have an absolute max yes and an absolute maximum can occur at more than one x value because you need to understand what an absolute max is an absolute Max just says what's the highest output you attain well the highest output i attain is 5 now it occurs in more than one place but then is the highest value this graph gets so absolute max here it's 5 that's the highest value it occurs at two different places at five five and eighty four five so hopefully they explains it to you what local or relative maximum in our well how they're defined what why it's important that you can't include endpoints it's an open idea how you can have more than one of them at different values that's okay just every peak every trough that we have that's defined has a defined point and how absolute maximum is just the highest value on a graph can occur if endpoints or it can occur at local maximum so and in a good curve at more than one place so no problem so hopefully that makes sense to you I'm gonna come back and talk about about average rate of change in just a little bit you 

Transcript for: Average Rate of Change of a Function (Precalculus - College Algebra 11)
hey welcome to another video in this video we're gonna discuss and you'll learn about the average rate of change of a function and if you learn why it's important a lot of times we just kind of teach a you know what's that for well if you don't teach calculus you know calculus that's not going to make a whole lot of sense on how that's why that's used so we're gonna talk about average rate of change we'll talk about why we do what we do and what it's trying to get you to learn so what the average rate of change looks for is basically cuz I hate suspense in math you shouldn't have it you should know what you're gonna be learning you're gonna learn that average rate of change it's just a slope between two points on curve what they call that a lot of times is called the secant even though we're not really used to a secant being two points in the curve kind of a circle ideas more what's it's it's used from but we call this anyway it says this this suppose that you have this curve this this function of X looks like the black curve here and you want to find the slope of that curve well well roll would you find the slope of a curve can't can't you bad racket and so you go yeah yeah you can't you can't really do it so can you find the slope between two two points on that curve yes okay so if a slope is a rate of change and I can't really find it at a point on this curve well we can find the average rate of change but fine so between two points in that curve so we say all right well here's a point here's a point and I would find the slope of that line that's connecting that we call that a secant line then the slope of that line would be the average slope of the curve between those two points that's the idea and somewhere is pretty cool but somewhere between this point and that point the slope of the curve will actually equal the slope of that that secant line now why why would you learn it well the main question there was hey can I find the slope of a curve at a point and the answer is yes you can using calculus and so what this idea is is man if I can find the slope of this line and I really I'm looking for the slope of this curve at that one point does this slope of the line represent the slope of what we call the tangent line does it represent it yes this is represented well no because this is much steeper than that so this slope of the secant line would be much deeper than the so glow tangent line can I make it better answer is maybe what if I start moving this B value closer to this a value well then this point would be closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and closer closer and closer and notice mathematically I can make it as close as I want without actually touching that a value and the one of the theorems of calculus are our derivative is that when we make that close that points so close as to be negligibly different then the slope of that secant line that we're getting is actually by definition of slope of the tangent line that we're trying to find and so that's what we're stemming from in this it all starts with your idea of can you find the slope between these two points and find an average rate of change yes and then later on we'll be making this closer closer to find an instantaneous rate of change and not an average so the slope of a curve at a point slope of the tangent line to that curve at a point so then I'm trying to change in long story maybe little short it's really just the slope between two points I want to prove that to you right now so if I'm trying to find the slope of this original secant line and I say well here's a point it has an X value an input of a well it will have an output of F of a yeah sure because the point here would be X comma Y and we're so used to doing our notation now that we understand that that's just input/output well but this is also just an X comma Y and input an output but wait a second wait a second what what this formula does it says you have an output - an output over an input - an input and this is one point and this is one point so so this is this is an x value and it's corresponding Y value this is a different x value and it's corresponding differ why value and if you look it like that you say this is so wait a minute FOP this is an output - okay f of a another output over the input that relates to that output - input that relates to the other output the average rate of change just gives you a slope formula it's just a different way we look at it output - output over input - input one point another point y2 - y1 up that's subtracted over x2 - x1 input subtracted it's just the slope so the the reason why we have the term average rate of change - slope is that because when we're looking at this particular situation we're saying I can't find the slope of a curve we're gonna do that in calculus but I'm just kind of finding out what is the rate of change between these two points on the curve in average and that's why they call it average rate of change and not just slope but essentially you're just finding the slope of a secant line and so the slope formula is practically the same now how we how we do it well this is just the slope formula and we're just subtracting the Y values and X values we can find the average rate of change of any function if we have two inputs so so what's the idea the idea is if I want to find average change that's a curve yeah it's a parabola much like this one is but if I want to find the average rate of change between two x-values let's find the points first and let's just do the slope formula that's the same thing well wait a minute how do I find points and we spent a long time doing that so if I have a point where my x value is three and a point where my x value is five can you find the Y values yeah sure we just plug them into the function the function gives us outputs for any input so if this is my output for an input of three would be let's plug in three if I plug in three I'm going to get three square that's 9 minus 6 is 3 if I plug in five so we're just finding F of 3 we're finding F of 5 notice how this kind of makes this formula nice for us F of 3 is the output value and the final output and three and five over input value so we're gonna be putting output a five output of three and then five and three it's gonna be the same thing it just looks it's slope formula so we plug in five to our function to find the output for that course one input let's see 25 minus 10 is 15 those are the two points you gotta see it these are two points on that curve we plug in three to find out what we plug in five define output and now we're going to find the slope between those two points of a secant line that's connecting them that is an average of change of that prevalence saying this is the way the function is changing slope wise on average so our average change is really just slope how I do slope is the same every single time I make up my slope formula I know the slope formula subtracts outputs and then subtracts inputs I know that this has to stem from one point and so does this so when I do this slope formula I just find one point like five comma 15 I make sure I put five comma 15 outputs on top I put three comma three outputs on top so here's my one point five fifteen there's one other point 3 comma three my outputs are on top on my numerator so that gives us the slope form and very easily let's make sure this works so is this f of five is this f of be our F of whatever the outlet input is is this F of five yeah that's that's our F of five this right here is f of three that's the output value from that point and then we have over five minus three so it does work just the slope so ever average rate of change here 15 minus three gives us 12 5 minus 3 is 2 that gives us an average rate of change or slope of 6 that's the slope between these two points that's a slope of two points that are on that graph which is averaging the rate of change between those two points for that particular function that's that's about all there really is to it if you wanted to find the equation of the secant line this right here would act as your M and you choose one point that they give you like three comma three and we can say okay Y minus y1 equals M X minus x1 it's just the equation of a line and since that we're talking about a secant line here we'd use this slope with one of those points so Y minus let's say three because that seems like a smaller so I values equals six and then X minus three thanks buddies and why these are the same there so Y minus three would give us 6x minus 18 and let's just add three so Y would equal 6x minus 15 so if you were to graph this and you were to graph this that line is going to intersect that graph at exactly those points and the slope of that line is six which would be the average rate of change of that graph that's what a majority change means I hope I explained it well enough that it's just a slope of a secant line that's touching the graph of two points and it's averaging the rate of change of that function it just it's it's just the soak formula kind of made fancy so hope that makes sense hopefully you understand why we're learning it so that eventually we get down to to a calculus idea when you when we get there so hope you're with me every day you 

Transcript for: How to Graph Piecewise Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 12)
hi welcome to another video in the next few videos we're going to talk about graphing and in this and this class we talk about graphing an awful lot and so we're gonna get really good at that and how we start is basically understanding some of the ways that we graph so in the next few videos we're gonna talk about what piecewise functions are how to graph them what our basic graph shapes are kind of a library of functions idea and they have transform them so I move them up and down let's right stretch them compress them things like that and then we move forward we'll have a better understanding of like how graphs work in general for polynomials and rational functions it all starts with just some some key features of graphs one of them kind of a a little sidestep from normal graphing is something called a piecewise function so in this this video what I'm gonna intend to get you understand is personally what a piecewise function is how they work what the domain for piecewise functions are how to use them kind of the directions for the graph directions for how to use the function and then we're gonna review some of the kattegat align like what slope means what a parabola is what a cubic function would look like that way our library functions in the next video makes a little bit more sense so we're kind of refreshing our memories on on what these basic graph shapes are as we're doing some of these these piecewise functions so we're gonna jump right into it what I'm going to talk about is what a piecewise function is how to work with it and then how you graph them so what a piecewise function is a piecewise function of 1 it's a function which means that for every one input you get exactly one output that's key that's an important thing so how piecewise functions look is a little bit funny we see a function we have this little curly brackets and a it's a it's both of these things oh great so I'm just going to take numbers plug them into both of them no no don't no don't do that because if we take any sort of an input you plug it into both of these little pieces of your function piecewise functions it's going to give us two different outputs for most of our inputs that's a problem so every one of the piecewise functions I've given you right here is really not defined for you so what a piecewise function says is sure you got this thing as a function it's gonna give me one output for every input I'm going to give you directions on what to do but then also directions on how to use each piece of it so a piecewise function gives you a function in pieces you can only use one piece for certain sections or intervals of your x-axis that has to be defined for you don't just need to make it up so I'm going to tell you what these pieces are so here's the the domain for these functions it says this function is going to be X cubed that's the piece of it but you only use it for a little bit of this graph or some some interval of this this x-axis when your X's are less than 1 that's when you get to use X cubed for this function it's gonna say I also want to use 3x minus 2 it's going to use 3x minus 2 anytime your X's are greater than or equal to 1 this is sort of like our separating value on your x-axis this says for anything less than 1 strictly less than 1 you're going to use this piece this thing this function to define f of X for any value 1 or more so any x value that's greater than equal to 1 you're going to use this piece to define that function that has helped piecewise functions work it gives you the function in little pieces that are not the same piece the main thing here please don't ever take a value and plug in one value to both of these pieces what that's doing is that's breaking the fact that this thing is actually a function we need one output for every input so here's the what you do here's the when you do it this right here this is your domain this is this is where this function is defined more than that it tells you when to use each of these pieces let's try it we're going to plug in a couple of values I mean four values will do the same thing over here I'll give you some directions of the domain for a piecewise function we'll plug this in and then we're going to go back we're going to grab them and that's that's pretty much it so if we use this piece whenever X is less than one we use this piece of number X is greater than equal to one we should never ever have a time with these crossover graphically that means our graphs will never cross will never have the same piece same graph sorry never have two different graphs on the same interval of our x-axis how we use it practically to evaluate we just have to understand that these are the values that are our inputs we need to notice where they go and then plug them into one and only one piece of that function so let's look at F of negative 1 asks you look at the function f got it I want you to evaluate negative 1 you okay eeny meeny miny no no no don't do that we look at negative one and we say where does native one fit in our domain negative one fits in this part of our domain negative 1 is less than one fits that that direction that well this interval of your x axis so it says I'm gonna plug in negative 1 where it actually works I'm gonna plug it into just this piece it doesn't qualify here it's not fitting that condition doesn't fit this domain so we say they can plug this here that means that I would have negative 1 to the third power I'm using just this piece and we would get an output of negative 1 that means you had an input of negative 1 and you would output a negative 1 that's a point on this graph that needs to make sense to you when we graph this thing in them field a while we're gonna notice that that point is going to be on that graph how about F of 0 F of 0 says all right well look at your functions look at your function f got it plug in 0 that's your input okay how do I do that I use one of these pieces depending on where if it's my domain 0 is still in this interval of the x-axis less than 1 so I would still use just this top piece not both that means that I have 0 to the third power I plug in 0 I got out 0 that's another point on our graph how about 1 well let's skip that one let's get let's go to 3 so f of 3 evaluate the function for 3 here's our function f our input is 3 I'm gonna be using these two things to define my function but what my domain is is given over here so I'm gonna look at 3 and say is 3 on this interval of the x-axis is 3 in this domain no 3 is not freeze not less than 1 is 3 in this interval the x-axis 3 in this domain yeah 3 is greater than or equal to 1 its namely greater than 1 so it says you are defined this 3 is defined for this this domain this 3 says you would use this function which has this domain plug in 3 so when we have 3 times 3 minus 2 let's see 3 times 3 is 9 9 minus 2 is 7 we pointed in 3 we value it for 3 we got him out that is a point that is good beyond this function that needs to make sense notice how you're just taking one value finding out where it fits and plugging in to one of those pieces never ever vote well you know 101 doesn't one fit in both no it can't and you will never see an equal sign on more than one of these intervals you don't even have to have the equals it doesn't have to be a continuous crap this won't be it doesn't have to have an output I'm sorry it doesn't have to have every input on your x-axis that doesn't have to be the case there if it does though if it does have an this this interval that x-axis for which you have every single input you can't ever have an equal sign on both of those domains that would disqualify that from being a function that would say you can plug in one or value it for one and have more than one output that's a problem so when you see this F of one it's got a fit and only one spot so look at your function f plug in 1 no problem use these pieces but how you use them is your domain so it's a where's one fit is one less than one no no it can't be it will never ever be the case on a function where you will be able to plug in one value to two different pieces it won't happen so plugging in one says one is on the interval of X greater than or equal to one this is specifically equal to one that says oh hey I fit in this domain let's use that piece for which the domain is defined that'll be three times one minus two let's see three times so it's 3 minus 2 is 1 I evaluated one I got an output of 1 these are giving me points on my graph that is exactly how evaluation for piecewise functions work just figure out the domain well figure out where your input fits in your domain and use that piece of your function for which that that domain is defined next one obviously this is incomplete this is why I got three different pieces that define this particular function of F I have x squared I have two and have two x plus one and it has to be given to you what for what interval the x on the x axis that this piece of the focus is defined so basically what your domain is well let's say that x squared is defined any time X is less than zero that's an interval in your x axis mompos are you can you look at your x-axis right now you should be able to and say the interval of my x-axis or which this piece of the function is defined X is less than zero that's this entire interval of your x-axis it should be pretty clear right now that I'm looking here that means when we get to graphing we're going to look at this we're gonna make a little separator line and say this piece is on that interval and that's probably the best way that I know how to graph piecewise functions it's separating my x-axis into intervals for which my functions are to find my little piece of line and then graph in those pieces on those aerials alright moving on this says that you're gonna have the output of the function to be - anytime X is just equal to zero and you're gonna use the piece of the function 2x plus 1 anytime X is greater than zero notice real quick I only have one equals only one I'm using the entire x-axis this is less than zero equal to zero more than zero therefore I can only have one equals sign now could you have it like something kind of weird where you went from maybe negative 5 to negative 2 and they skipped a few points and then defined it again from like 7 to infinity sure and then you could use more than one equal sign but if you are having the same number you're saying I call it separated number boundry number whatever you want to do on your your x-axis if you have the same number here you can't ever let one input give you more than one output just check for that make sure you're not plugging in one value to more than one piece that should never ever happen so let's see negative two this is look at your function plug in negative two and just see where it fits in your interval on the x-axis your domain maybe two fits let's see it's not equal to zero it's not more it's less than zero I'm going to use only this piece of the function for which this domain is defined and my input fits in that domain so I'm going to plug this in here it's a negative two squared is four that means I have a point negative two comma positive four that's going to be a point on this graph where the graph a little bit zero Wow zero doesn't fit in this interval it's not less than zero it's not graded zero it's equal to zero and this gets a little funky it says well what do i do have nothing to plug in for yeah exactly it's called a constant these what you plug in you're going to get out to well specifically says if you plug in zero you're going to get out - it's only defined for one input value this is defined for the input value of zero hey I haven't input value zero it means I get out - that's a point zero comma two for F of two it's not less than F - is not less than zero if it says my input values have to fall in one of these intervals in x-axis my domain says two is not less than zero tubes not equal to zero two is greater than zero so I would use just this piece this is two times two plus 1 that's five so we're going to plug in two or evaluate for two and then gave us an output value of five every input must have one output value that's what a function means right now we're going to transition to a little bit we're gonna graph these so what I'm going to talk about when we graph them so I'm going to talk about how our domain is always based on the x-axis well therefore our domain can separate our x-axis into intervals we kind of did that we were evaluating right we just said yeah that separates it a X denote my x-value an input can only fit in one of those intervals we're gonna do the same thing so we're going to say because this is the domain for that piece of the function and this is the domain for that piece of the function if we separate our x axis and say that function is only defined on that domain that interval this function is only defined on that domain that interval then we have a very clear marker on our graph for when we use one function first or the other one piece of the function versus the other so I show that to you right now I'm going to erase the our values we really don't need them all that much I want to keep that we'll keep it even so let's go ahead and erase those and what we're going to do is I'm going to show you the kind of Lenard way to graph a piecewise function so here's here's what I do here's how this much for us because their domain separates our x-axis domain is always an x-axis idea our domain shows us for what interval we use each of our pieces of our function so what I would like to do is I'll take our what I call a boundary number or separating value and I go to my x-axis something alright this is defined for less than this value this function is defined for this piece of functions of for greater than that value but they have the same value so I'm gonna go to every single one of my values that's given in my domain my domain from each of these pieces I'm gonna put a little vertical line so I'm gonna look at 1 1 is the only value on our on each of these these domains for our pieces so I'm gonna go to 1 when we all right well 1 has this kind of this idea of separation it's a boundary for which these pieces are defined now here's the next thing I'm gonna do I'm gonna look at that and I'm gonna understand that what that does is practically it's not in your graph and please please don't get this confused with like a vertical asymptote idea it's not a vertical asymptote and that's the same sort of a line that we use for her glasses oh so I understand that but in the context of what we're doing we don't have a vertical asymptote here that comes later we will talk about them give you everything a vertical asymptote is and show you how to use them but all this does practically it separates your x-axis and it says that your pieces of your graph will be defined on either this part or this part but never both you will never ever have a piecewise function where you have two different graphs on the same interval of your x-axis that's got to make sense we know that domain says for all of these inputs I'm getting one specific output that's all that that says you can't ever have an interval where you have two outputs that means your graphs can't cross your graphs can't overlap at all so we're going to look at this guy right 4x is less than 1 X is less than 1 on this interval not up to the y-axis up to the dotted line up to this x equals 1 up to that boundary line I'm gonna have X cubed so I'm gonna make a little little mark over here that up to here I'm gonna have X cubed the graph of x cubed is only on that interval of x-axis all the way going to negative video on the right hand side so 4 X is greater than or equal to 1 so about this one we're going to have 3 X minus 2 so what we're doing is we're taking our domain or separate our x axis into intervals of that domain and we're understanding that these pieces will fall into one or the other interval just follow the directions so this is 4 X is less than 1 here's an X cube 4 edges greater than equal 1 using 3x minus 2 now the next thing that we're gonna do we're gonna review what in the world lines and cubics look like what in the world quadratics and constants and lines look like the same thing to two lines over here so when we were doing this what I always do I always graph the left interval first oh well I always grab the side of all of this the side of my boundary line where my y-axis is so my y-axis is on the left hand side I'm gonna graph this interval first I'm gonna graph this interval so I'm going to look at X cubed what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna understand what X cubed looks like I'm not plugging in points if I don't have to there's only pretty much two values of one value I'm going to plug in for two different functions I'm going to plug in my boundary line number so my one I'm gonna plug that in I'm gonna understand what less than what greater than equal to actually mean there and that's the only value no I'm not plugging a whole bunch of points I'm basically understanding what X cubed is though X cubed is this X curve graph looks like this and it has a few key points to it right now I'm trying to teach two things number one is how to graph a piecewise functions but number two is that when you're graphing some of these basic shapes it really helps to have an understanding of what X cube looks like what the execute has three key points on it one one zero zero and negative one negative one that stems from being an odd function we talked about odd functions this is kind of revolve a ball around or has symmetry about the origin that 1 1 and negative 1 negative 1 have opposite inputs and therefore opposite outputs so when we graph that and we say alright X cubed looks like this it has some key points 1 1 0 0 negative 1 negative 1 yes and plug those in I could plug in zero zero I could plug in negative one and get up negative one I could plug in one whoa hang on I can plug in one and I could get out positive one there's a mistake on the on the board right now but I'm going to fix it just a second so this is the way my graph X cube looks X cube is only defined for this interval of our x-axis it's an s-curve it's gonna say all right well I'm gonna leave my origin on my left hand side of the y-axis I'm gonna drop to negative infinity eventually I'm gonna go all the way up to this point but I cannot cross it I can't let it go into the interval for which three X minus 2's define that wouldn't break the fact that this is a function you can have the only one piece of the graph on one in earlier function otherwise you have two outputs running but that's a big problem now the next problem what about that point this is a mistake I was talking on this is wrong why why is that wrong because wow this says you can go up to 1 it says you can't include the 1 so here's the deal whenever you don't have an equal sign you must not include that specific point now please don't say well I can only go up to 0 no no you can get all the way up into almost 1 you can plug in point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine if you plug that in cubed you're gonna get almost one but it's not quite there for that reason what we do if you do not have the equal sign do not include this value as an endpoint how do we show that you're just gonna say all right well you know what seven plug in 1 1 cubed is one that gives us a almost the point 1 1 but we're going to show this as an open circle saying that just that's a civic point is missing you need to remember this from some of our previous videos that we just did that when I don't have the equals sign I just don't include the point how we don't include the point is with an open circle like the parenthesis idea is all the way up - it just does include that point it's missing one point so long sort of a really short hopefully is find your domain separate your x-axis identify what piece goes in what and graph the piece if you don't have an equal sign use an open circle for the endpoint so here I said okay X cubed I understand what that looks like I understand my three key points negative 1 negative 1 0 0 1 1 so I put that on my graph and then say all right I'm gonna look at my boundary line I'm gonna look at that value on my x-axis and say ok one should not be included so this point is an open circle that needs to make sense before we go any further next I'm gonna look at 3x minus 2 now the reason why I do this side the y-axis side of my boundary line is because it's a little bit easier for me I have a y-intercept that's very easy to find I don't have that on the right hand side and frankly it doesn't matter would you graph first on the right hand side I think it's a little more difficult because there's no y axis there's no y intercept over there so here's what we do what we do is we take our boundary number or separating number that one and we plug it in so exam right well since this piece is defined for this interval I'm gonna plug in where I start oh my god I plug in 1 3 times 1 is 3 minus 2 is 1 so if I find F of 1 that says all right this is giving me out the point 1 comma 1 Kelvin what wait a minute that's that's interesting that's this value right there so so wait a second this cubic was missing that point this value to this graph has that point so we're gonna graph this in just a second we're gonna graph it and what we're going to do is we're going to say I'll write the black line right here hoping to the colors the black line is X cubed the purple line of about to grab says this point starts right there it starts there notice how this does not fail to be a function in that there's not two points for that one input value of 1 this value 1 is not defined for X cubed there's a hole this this value is defined for 3 X minus 2 it doesn't a hole it's not break in fact it's a function because X cubed does not have an output for that they've won this does have an output for the infant value one so happen city thinks in that pool that's pretty that's pretty neat kind of a cool little graph that we did kind of made it up in my head but works pretty well now for the rest of it since we have now a starting point we know that our output value is actually on that set that boundary line says this is defined for once plug in one I did three times one is three three months two is one okay here's the plug didn't one got out one right there now what is that what is three X minus two well it's not a cubic it's a line lines have a starting point we've got it they also have a slope like three over one so it says from that point from that one starting spot on your boundary line not before it don't go to the y-axis don't go to a y-intercept of negative two what if you went to a y-intercept of negative two and started graphing this you're gonna have a whole bunch of points right here for which you are breaking the rules of your domain since it's not even this is not defined on the side you can't go till the left of that boundary that's why I choose to graph the y intercept the y-axis side first they go right I cannot cross that I cannot I can't touch that this is the only this is the boundary there's the only place where my functions are fine I've done that I've plugged in the boundary number plug in one I got out one now let me use the fact that this has a slope of three to go from that boundary sale right how slopes work is we go up three one two three we go to the right one because the slope is 3 over 1 and this gives us some line so we're going to graph that piece of the function on this interval of x axis for which we're to define the domain that's the way that this graph it almost looks like a cubic but it's it's not this is a straight line that cubic would have gone very steeply through here this is the way that piecewise functions are graphed what you do is you look at your domain you separate your domain into an interval I call it a boundary number of separating number no problem this tells you what intervals axis for which these pieces are fine don't break the rule just make sure that we are understanding where that separator is we're understanding for where our pieces work on the intervals for which we just have a define domain let me graph okay this for 100 this for another interval you can do it by plugging in points but again my secondary like motive for teaching you this is to understand what cubics look like to understand what lines are with slopes and to understand these things do not cross over the lesson the last thing I want to mention here is that not all of your piecewise functions look like this this is kind of a special case where one interval we had this cubic that left an open circle an open point of missing value this one filled it in there's kind of a cool little graph that's not going to happen on this we're going to look notice how with piecewise functions often we get these jumps where we don't have a continuous function so I'm gonna talk about continuity here real fast and then we'll move on so we're not gonna have a continuous function you have this I'm sorry I'll talk about after we do this in only one so we're not gonna have a continuous function we're gonna have a little gap here so I'm gonna show you how to deal with that so start now we look at our function we got right here's a piecewise function we basically have three pieces and three different domains it says for what interval in the x-axis these particular pieces are defined so I'm gonna go to my separating value of let's separate these well what's the kind of boundary for when we use these particular pieces that's zero well x equals zero that's the y-axis so we're gonna go to the y-axis and say alright at x equals 0 that is my boundary to the left I'm going to be using a certain function to the right I'm going to use in a certain function add it I'm gonna be use of certain function so to the left of 0 this is say for grid 0 and use this piece for equal to 0 use this piece for less than 0 so on our x-axis our domain always separates our excess into little intervals says for anything less than 0 to this side I'm going to use x squared for anything at 0 I'm going to use 2 for anything greater than zero I'm going to use two x plus one that's exactly what the domain for a piecewise function does separate your x axis into little intervals on which you're gonna grab specific pieces of your function so let's do it you know probably the easiest one to do right now is at the x equals zero so at x equals zero says hey on on x equals zero on that line on the y axis you're just gonna have an output value of two so we're gonna go to two all right output value to done that is the point if you remember I erased it but it said is right there it says when you plug in zero you got out two Beyblader we got a two that's all that means the only point on the y axis needs to be an output of two plug in zero you get out too what that means is that for this function and this function when I get to my boundary line I'm going to use an open circle signifying that I don't have an output there the output for zero is two but it's gonna go right up to them output about you that we're missing so x squared do you remember what expert looks like do you remember that it's a parabola crowd let's look like this and they have some key points they do have zero zero but because if I plug in zero zero squared zero they have 1 1 but plug in 1 1 squared is 1 they have negative 1 negative positive 1 I plug in negative 1 squared I get positive 1 it's an even function and we need to know what even functions mean they have symmetry about the y-axis so I'm going to look at this and go all right I'm gonna graph x squared but I'm only going to graph it up until this boundary so I'm gonna be able to graph the 0 0 I'm gonna be able to graph the negative 1 positive 1 here's a negative 1 positive 1 here 0 0 my parabola looks like well it can't cross over to here I used 2 X plus 1 over there so for my parabola I'm gonna graph it just like a parabola always is and it's gonna stop right at our boundary so our parabola looks like like that I've graphed x squared I've graphed a parabola but only done it and the interval for which to find only on that particular domain all the way up until our boundary you should see the mistake right now man I'm really hoping you see the mistake right now right now is this a function right now if you look at it and go hey is it a function up until this boundary yep yeah for all these input values of X I have one specific output you can plug in negative 2 and negative whatever and you can get these output values mine's a little bit too steep here but at 0 this is a problem so we go back to when I talked over here for every single boundary that does not have an equals you must not have a solid circle so what this says is it you're gonna graph a parabola yeah you're gonna graph it on this interval no problem but when you get to zero you need not include it so I've graphed my parabola I'm almost able when I get to zero I'm going to not include that as an alpha value it's not there now you can plug in negative zero point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one and you can square it to be really really close to zero it's going right there but we're just missing that output value that has to be there in your head right now that makes sense so we alright I've graphed x squared I've graphed it to my boundary I am not including that end point because it's not included be like a parentheses that end point is not included there to zero or taken care of that where that point is what that output is for that value of zero now the last one I'm gonna graph 2x plus 1 for everything greater than zero on this interval x axis for which this function is to find them a domain I'm gonna grab this so how to do it well what I told you is plug in the value of your separation or your boundary number for your domain so I'm gonna I'm gonna plug in 0 well what about that you can plug in 0 well we're gonna outsmart this thing we're gonna plug in 0 to this two times zero plus one we're going to get one so if I plug in zero to this function which I know that I can't do I'm gonna get a value of one here's what that means that gives you a place to start it just says just don't include the actual output value what I plug it in but then when you say alright I would I would normally if this was here if that was there you'd be here at zero one obviously you'd be there since it's not included we're saying yeah I would start there but I'm just gonna dis include that little end point just give it an open circle and say my line is gonna start just after that point not at one it's still you plug in zero you're just not including the end point kind of like a parentheses if you said on a number line here's 5 to infinity let's say well I want to I want to show this interval of my x-axis I'm making up the 5 is not coming from anywhere well would you start at 6 would you say oh this goes from 6 to infinity no no that wouldn't be right you'd say I'd start at 5 to infinity but I can't use a bracket because the 5 is not included this says oh I would use these parentheses I used kind of this open idea that's what that open circle says it says I want to I want to make sure that my x axis for greater than 0 is defined but greater than 0 is a parentheses idea greater than 0 is an open idea written 0 is a yeah you're just missing the endpoint just don't include the endpoint use no it's perfect so for here I'd say up to 0 double to the endpoint at 0 I'm including the point after 0 don't for the endpoint but I still basically plug in 0 so that's what I'm starting at 0 1 now we hadn't understand hopefully that that's a slope the slope is 2 over 1 so from that point I would go up 2 over 1 that point is there on that value of 1 I am certainly defined everywhere after that open circle undefined on my interval so the only place we got a really worried about is the values that are our boundary lines are they included or not in this case because I don't have an equals right here I cannot include the endpoint or that value that's on my boundary line on my separation value oh that makes sense I hope you're understanding or that I've taught you well enough that our domain for our pieces show you intervals in the x axis what we do is we graph the pieces on those intervals make sure that it fits make sure that if you have no equal sign you just have an open circle on boundaries if we have no equal sign we just have an open circle on that boundary equal side give us building points sometimes we have these values these lines that are these are functions that work together and give us what's called a continuous function this is a continuous function what's continuous mean continuous means that for your interval you can put your pencil on your graph and you can graph the whole thing without picking it up that's a really loose way to say continuous alright can i graph this whole graph without picking it up the one single missing point here is filled in by that graph I can graph that whole function without thinking of a pencil can I do that here let's see I go this way oh man then I would jump to here fill that out jump back down to here and finish my function this is not continuous notice how the piece that or the the point that's defined is not in this circle even if it was it would fail to be continuous because that has an open circle and it's not you're not able to to graph this without picking your pencil off the paper that's one way to think about continuity alright the last one now there's obviously something missing I'm missing the directions here so let me go ahead and make them up let's go let's say that this is define from negative 4 to negative 2 and this piece is defined from negative 2 onward I'm not going to ask you to plug in value so we're evaluate but you should be able to do that right now you should be able to say all right if I'm plugging some values I would take them and find where they fit in my domain and use the piece for which the domain is define what I'm asking to do here is just graph it so let's take a look at it so though the lamp thing I don't know what am I thinking right now what I'm thinking about is I'm going to look at my boundary values for each section of my my domain for each of these these pieces I want to put a vertical dotted line saying this is the boundary for the interval my function that piece is going to fit on these interval for which I'm now kind of deleting a dominating my intervals on my x-axis I'm gonna say where the function fits that's I'm going to do so my first general my first piece X plus 3 this is defined on the x-axis from negative 4 to negative 2 so I'm going to go to those boundaries here's a negative 4 here's negative 2 I'm going to put a vertical dotted line so I looked at I said this piece has this four domain our domain always separates our x-axis in the intervals so the interval is negative 4 to negative 2 and I know that X plus 3 it's going to fit in that particular interval now the next interval well because this has the same boundary number I'm going to say that from everything from negative 2 onward X is greater than that I'm going to be using negative 2x plus 3 so from here onward that's this piece of our function notice something negative 2 negative 2 this one doesn't have an equals that one does isn't going to be continuous I don't know we'll see when we graph it if we have to jump somewhere then it's not continuous it fills in the whole than it is one more thing I don't have to have a piecewise function that has this number the same as this I can do some weird things I can do things like go from negative 4 to negative 2 and then what if this was 2 what if that wasn't there well then I wouldn't have anything defined it would say there's no no piece for this interval or function I can now have a boundary of two and then go on to another value or go to infinity it doesn't really have to have the same numbers as a boundary this one happens to and most of them do but I just want to make sure that you understand that you don't have to have the same number here here so what we looked at we said our domain is this for these pieces we've defined our x axis as having those particular intervals for which are our pieces are defined have a domain now what we're going to do is we're going to say we're going to graph well I'm gonna graph the the function that has the y axis first it's a little bit easier for me to do that so I'm looking at this interval and saying this interval right here has my y-axis I'm going to use that because it's easy to find a y-intercept it's easy to go ahead and graph this function so I'm gonna go alright what's my y-intercept I'm gonna plug in 0 I'm gonna understand that's a line this has a slope of negative 2 so if I have a slope of negative 2 and I plug in 0 or we understand slope intercept form this has a y-intercept of negative notice how that is certainly a point it's not an open circle it's clearly in the defined domain of that function its output is negative 3 then I'm going to think all right it also has a slope of negative 2 which means that I would go down 2 and write 1 not left one it's always slope means a positive goes up negative goes down your run so that's 2 over 1 it says you're gonna go to the right one so let's see down to write one that gives us our lying but we want to be a little bit more specific we don't want to just graph this thing go all right and up about here on my daughter's line I'm gonna do one more thing so I know what I cross the y-axis I know where my next point is but I'm also going to take my boundary and I'm gonna plug this in a separate value I'm gonna plug it in here it says it's defined even if it wasn't guys if it wasn't defined I would still plug in negative 2 so let's pretend about this for a second let's say it's equal you're going to plug in negative 2 so f of F of negative 2 let's see negative 2 times negative 2 minus 3 so I'm taking my lay into my boundary by separating value I'm plugging into this piece no matter what I would do this so negative 2 into here maybe 2 times 2 is a state that's positive for positive 4 minus 3 is 1 negative 2 comma 1 now I told you that no matter what we would plug that in so please watch her let's say that this was not equal but sin that was not equal I would do exactly the same thing I take the negative 2 I would plug it into this piece I know it's not going to exist and not have enough but at that value I know that I know that this would be a point where I'd be missing well a but would be missing the point don't miss the point so if I plug in negative 2 even if there's not an equal sign that said my output would be 1 but now it's missing we'd still put that open circle it would say that if that was included I'd have that value since it's not included I just I'm missing the point but this line would still do this says this graph this piece is defined for this interval from negative 2 onward it just if I don't have the equals I would not define the output but use it use where the output would be to give yourself an open circle to say at the boundary I'm just I'm just not including the point I'm missing the endpoint that's how to use that so we graph the y intercept we've graphed our slope we plug in the value this separation this boundary value or our domain even though it wasn't even there you still plug it in and you say I'm just not include I'm should have an open circle instead of a solid circle now do we have to actually have an equal sign there if you don't and if I if I left it like this I would have this that's the X plus 3 it would look like like that I would just have this this line and then I have no end point there now if I do you have an endpoint that just says that all right I have an actual value there and you're gonna fill it in that's the only difference there so so again people sign you got an endpoint no equal sign you still use the value you still plug it in you still get the same exact value for an output you just show that you don't include it with no but circle no equals open circle equals close it in and now we're gonna go and graph the other interval that says from negative 4 negative 2 I've got a line you know what we can just plug these values in I'm never gonna make it to my y-axis this is only fine for this little interval so I'm going to take negative 4 I know it's a line negative for plugged in or it evaluated it's going to give us negative 4 plus 3 that's negative 1 in your head you need to be thinking that because that's equal this value I can actually have an output at negative 4 negative 1 so negative 4 negative 1 as a solid closed point that exists on the domain that means that point exists and has an output that we have defined how about negative 2 this is what I don't know that can actually include it I know but plug it in anyway so I'll write hat negative 2 if I plug this in negative 2 plus 3 is 1 that means that my output value would be negative 2 1 so I'm gonna use that I'm gonna say here's negative 2 here's the value 1 but wait up with is over there's already point there can I put a point on a point no no no you can't for that reason we'd say oh hey that's why that was open that's like a little open circle so what the if I erase this what this graph would do is this would say I have an open circle this function would go from here to here in fact if I plug in negative 3 you get 0 you can see that that's true but if I plugged in negative 2 for this particular function this would say you plug in negative 2 it's going to give you an open circle it was already previously filled in with this output that's the way this graph would look I hope that I've explained piecewise functions to you and how you approach him how you approach them is you look at your domain your domain tells you when to use each piece of the function when you're when you're evaluating values it also tells you the intervals on your x-axis for what your piece is defined and so when we look at it your domain breaks up your x-axis it shows you when you use each individual piece plug in or evaluate your boundary markers your boundary values you're separating numbers what do you want to call them plug them in if you don't have an equals you do not include the end point it's just an open circle if you do have an equals you have a closed circle put them together we can have continuous functions these two are continuous functions we can have discontinuous functions so that doesn't have continuity to it hope it makes sense practice a whole bunch of them and then we'll move on we'll talk about well our library of functions we've kind of practiced what quadratics are before those are the power twos cubics power threes and practice lines so we'll look at a few more functions next time in certain memorizing these have a good day you 

Transcript for: Graphs You Must Know (Precalculus - College Algebra 13)
hi welcome to another video in this video we're gonna start building on your understanding what graphs are so we're gonna talk about some basic graph shapes or a library of functions basically Mansa functions you need to know do you need to memorize them yes but I don't want you to just memorize their shapes I want you to understand why they're shaped the way they are that's a big difference so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to talk about what these are I'm going to talk about where what these functions are as far as even versus odd what their key points aren't that is the biggest thing we're gonna talk about and then why they're shaped the way they're shaped so and how to remember some of these things the reason why is because in the next video we're going to talk about how to transform these which means how to shift them up down left right stretch compress horizontally vertically reflect about the y axis x axis things like that and if we don't understand how these graphs work it's very difficult to not be not understand how they work and still be able to transform them so we're gonna have this understanding what these functions look like why they are the way they are and most importantly what their basic points are so they're their key points so we're gonna start with this one and then after this one we'll talk about even versus odd and how these things are structured so when we say what's the function f of B actually looked like it says sorry f of X equals B what's that actually looked like so there's no matter what you plug in you get constant what's a constant function look like that's gonna be a horizontal line so when it says plug in any X you get out B we've got this idea of a horizontal line what what what's its inputs all the real numbers what's its output just be I want you to notice right away though that's an even function it has symmetry about the y axis that's even no problem we have this symmetry idea in fact every one of these functions the way I've written it for you is even even even that one's going to be neater and then we're going to have on on on odd and I'll talk about why they are the way they are let's talk about f of X equals x this says that if I plug in an x value I'm gonna get that x value as an output so the input and output are both the same i plug in want to get a 1 plug in 2 I get up to plug in 3 get up 3 that right there says if I plug in 1 you know 1 if I plug in negative 1 I have negative 1 but plug in 0 I get up 0 I'm going to pause there for just a second I don't want to talk about how every single odd function in your library functions it's going to have two key points that are all the same and then I also want to talk about how most of them have one key point additional two that every one of these odd functions is going to have one one and negative one negative one as two points in your graph every odd function has that so these are all going to have one one negative one negative one let's look at this take one plug it in 1 cubed is 1 ok there's one one take negative one plug in negative one cubed is negative one it has negative one negative one and it has one one take zero plug it in it has zero zero so wait a minute that's the same exact key points is that one one one zero zero negative one eighty one one one zero zero negative 1 negative 1 I know every odd basic graph shape is going to have those that one doesn't have zero zero but almost for obvious reason how about the cube root of x if I plug in 1 the cube root of 1 is 1 it's gonna have that point 1 1 plug in negative 1 the cube root of negative 1 is negative 1 it's gonna have negative 1 negative 1 plug in 0 the cube root of 0 is 0 keep in mind with cube roots you can plug in negatives a cube root of a negative number 2 says what says what number when I take the cube root of it gives me this particular output or in other words this output if I cubed would give me the radicand of that that cube root well what that means because cubes maintain signs a negative cube gives you a negative that means a cube root of a negative maintains that negativity so we can plug in negative and we just find this is not a one-sided graph and it has the key points of 1 1 0 maybe when they give one the last function over there says well let's see if I plug in 1 1 divided by 1 is 1 so it has a key point of 1:1 but plug in negative 1 1 divided by negative 1 is also negative 1 but if i plug in 0 that's a problem hmm if I plug in 0 1 divided by 0 is undefined how does undefined in this look in a function well we talked about that a lot in the many more videos than this but what this is going to give you is this vertical line that you cannot touch sometimes an undefined function means you visit a point we talked about in last video how you just have this open circle and we can have that's called a hole or removable discontinuity in this case this is a vertical asymptote and we will talk about why it's a vertical asymptote a little bit I can't I can't lie can't wait for it's a vertical asymptote because the the factor on your denominator that's giving you a zero namely X cannot be cancelled out can't be simplified away on your numerator so we have this vertical asymptote we actually also have a horizontal asymptote what well what's the one output value you can't get can you get an output value of zero plug in a number and give me an output for 0 I can't the numerator is 1 all the time 1 divided by any other number besides 0 is going to give you not 0 so this has a vertical asymptote and it has a horizontal asymptote here's what I need you to know about this library of functions number one when I look at X X cubed cube root of x or 1 over X I have some key points here all of these graphs have the point 1 1 and negative 1 negative 1 almost all of them have zero zero this doesn't because that point that value for zero is not defined for your domain so what man if all of them have one one negative one negative one and most of them have zero zero do they all look the same and the answer's no here's what I would like you to stretch your knowledge as for your basic graph shapes number one these are all going to be odd functions what that means they will have symmetry about the origin we can rotate them 180 degrees or reflect reflect and get the same exact graph out they do have that symmetry these will all be odd the difference between them is that as our power increases we've so we sort of get more curvy so like X to the first power is just a line our output equals our input and so line X to the third power is going to take that line sort of so in a curve and give it more of a dynamic feel if we've actually the fifth that's even more dynamic a cube root of x takes that the X to the third and sort of rotates it reflects it about the white was X line that our inverses on top button versus much later but the way that this is shaped is differently so what I need you to understand is number one every one of these graphs is going to have a key point of one one every one of them sides are constant our odds are going to have a key point of negative one negative one our evens are gonna have a key point of negative one positive one because of the symmetry about the y almost all of them have a key point of zero zero the only limit doesn't is now so our features our key points and now shape so the shape of our graph our line gives us just this straight line so f of x equals x is a nice straight line X cube is this graph where we still have this negative infinity to positive infinity idea on the y axis but it's definitely more dynamic in a straight line the cube root of x takes this graph rotated about the y equals x axis x takes this graph rotates it about this line and we hit this this picture sort of flipped on its side that's what the graph looks like this got very weird this graph says I have a vertical asymptote asymptote is spelled like this it means basically the MC hammer version of a line do to do to do to do you can't adjust you cannot touch a vertical asymptote horizontal asymptotes you can cross them in like some some range some interval that Texas but as you get two infinities like way out there you're not going to touch and you're going to approach them so what that means is that if you can't really touch it your graph has to will let see has to has to go through that point no probably no that cannot touch this at all won't touch this one at all it's going to look like this same thing here some people call this the reciprocal function because you put an input in there and it reciprocate sit so you put in like five it gives you an output of 1/5 put it in five you don't want it put in 1/5 get out five put in negative 1/5 get up negative five put it in 85 get out negative 1/5 that's the way this graph looks it is a rational function sometimes called the reciprocal function here's the main point I need you to understand about this number one all of these graphs have a key point of one one zero zero and negative one negative one the only one of those is that does not have zero zero they are all odd look at it look at how the symmetry is about the origin I could rotate these hundred eighty degrees even this one I could rotate hundred eighty degrees every one of these functions is odd the first three are increasing the entire time this is increasing increasing increasing X lower rate but increasing this graph is always decreasing decreasing decreasing so all of them are all of them have key points I need you to understand where they come from why they look the way they do and what their key points are I need to understand the increasing of the first three I need to understand the decreasing the last one those all have to make sense to you I need you to give it your domain all real numbers all real numbers all real numbers you cannot have zero this does not have a value and output value for the input value zero so your domain is everything except zero your range all real numbers all real numbers all real numbers so the interval of the y-axis that these graphs cover are all real numbers for the first three but again you can't get out zero so your domain interval the x-axis is you cover is all real numbers interval the y-axis you cover so you arrange all real numbers here your domain is all real numbers except zero and your range is all real numbers except zero all right we got to move on to the the evens so that these two match of these three are even your domain all real numbers but let's look at x squared if I wanted to define my key points here let's plug in 1 by plug in 1 2 x squared I get out 1 if I plug in 0 2 x squared I get out 0 plug in negative 1/2 x squared let's say negative 1 squared is 1 see that's a bad mix if I plug in 1 to the absolute value of X absolute value of 1 is 1 i plug in 0 if x value of x absolute value of 0 is 0 I look like a negative 1 the absolute value of negative 1 is positive 1 are you seeing the evenness are you seeing that this has symmetry about the y axis unplug in opposite inputs I'm getting the same output I'm putting in opposite if it's I'm getting the same output this one's not but I want to focus on these two so let's go through why on the shape of the graph the absolute value of x is based on the function of X is based on that it's just saying where you have negatives I want you to make it positive so it keeps this side it takes this and goes let's just make every output positive it's going to give you a V that's what the absolute value of X graph looks like is it still even of course it's even has symmetry about the y-axis and has the the idea that if I take negative X algebraically and I evaluated for negative x the absolutely negative x is positive x or any house for any X yeah how about x squared so with x squared I'm not going to be a straight line it's given me what's called a parabola that's a rough estimate of a shape of x squared that's it's this parabolic this parabola that we have and now they plug in 2 I get up four it's definitely not a straight line is it even yeah I have symmetry about the Y if I take negative X and square it I get positive x squared value of x that's the that's the idea so these are our two graphs I want to talk about them like we did here firstly do you notice that every single one of them has the value that both of these have the values of 1 1 0 0 negative 1 1 every even besides their constant every even basic graph shape is going to have that for you you're gonna plug in 1 get 1 look at NATO and get a positive 1 not negative 1 you also have 0 0 notice how we're decreasing for this interval next and then increasing decreasing for this interval of X that increasing so our domain all real numbers domain all real numbers rains range just from 0 to infinity range just from 0 to positive infinity the last one the square root of x is an inverse of x squared what an inverse means we're going to find this out much later is that you take your graph and you reflect it over the y equals x money basically flip it over a diagonal line so it takes this graph and flips it but in order to flip it you need to restrict your domain you say okay well I can only flip one part of this which one you want to flip would you flip the positive part because if I flip both I get this parabola that's non functional is function I don't want to do that if I flip it over so we're going to restrict it what that means is that when we get our graph you're only get out of one side of graph and you're only gonna get this top part if I plug in 1 I get up 1 squared of 1 is 1 plug in 0 I do get out 0 but just like this parabola has no negative outputs this square root can have no negative inputs if you just take and put on side domain becomes range range becomes domain I can't even plug in a negative number we could try it we'd say plug in negative 1 you screwed a negative 1 is I I don't know what that looks like on a graph of course it's not a real number and these graphs are based on functions that have outputs there are real numbers and so since we say that this has no real output it doesn't have something graphically on a real number system that we can graph so this is not allowing you even a plug in negative numbers that means you can't get anything out there's no output on this interval of your x-axis our domain it's just 0 and more so positive numbers including 0 are our range is 0 and more so the interval that y-axis this graph will eventually cover is from 0 to positive infinity it's basically half a parabola on its side these are the graphs that I really need you to know I need you to memorize the shapes I really do we can't afford to be plugging in numbers all the time because of transformations it's going to take absolutely forever and you're probably still not going to get a great graph so what I want you to understand is that constants are horizontal straight lines there's not a lot more than we can say about that besides they are constants they maintain the same out of the value and they are even then what I did as I organized these so that you can look at me oh hey every single one of these graphs is going to have some key points to it almost all of them have 1 1 & 0 0 so every single one of these basic functions in our library functions has one one every one of them almost all of them will be step two this one has a key point of 0 0 most of them so all of our odds have negative 1 negative one negative one negative one negative one all of our evens have negative 1 positive 1 and then the only limits and I'm neither has neither of those that should make sense to you I want you to organize your thoughts like that only that your thoughts like ok man are our odds have 1 1 0 0 negative 1 negative 1 or even to have 1 1 0 0 negative 1 positive 1 there's an ether that has neither negative 1 1 or negative 1 negative 1 keys can't plug in negative 1 and then our kind of awkward function or reciprocal function doesn't have a 0 to 0 does it make sense to you are you seeing that we have 1 1 for a key point on although we have 0 0 for key point on almost all of them we have negative 1 positive 1 for our evens we have negative 1 negative 1 for our odds even this one or missing 0 0 on that we don't have negative 1 anything for our square root I need you to memorize key points I need you to memorize the shapes of these graphs that's really important I hope I've done a good job of explaining to you why they are shaped the way that they are how do you kind of view some of our awkward functions in terms of our previous functions where we're increasing where we're decreasing and whether we're even or odd get that down before the next video because the next video I'm going to show you how to transform things how to shift them up and down and left right are key points and our shapes are crucial for that so I'll see you for the next video you 

Transcript for: Introduction to Graph Transformations (Precalculus - College Algebra 14)
hey welcome to another video now that we've talked about the library functions and the basic functions I asked you to memorize memorize them especially with their key points and what they look like we're going to take them and we're gonna graph with these things called transformations so what transformations do is house you look at a function and determine just based on the operation that's happening with it what the graph is gonna affect or how it's gonna affect one of these basic graph shapes and the library functions whether it moves it up or down or left or right or stretches compresses it reflects it all these sort of things that transformations do why that's important why we want to know that we don't want to have to plug in points or evaluate a whole bunch of different points in a function every time because for a number reasons number one we might miss some very key features of a graph people if you don't pull it in the right points or it man takes a tremendous amount of time and for these graphs that continue forever like trigonometric functions it's really useful to understand what in the world these operations are doing to the graph of your function that's what we start right now with these things called transformations we're not going to talk about trigonometric functions now but later on we will what we visit all of this stuff and if I can teach you what shifts a graph up and down what shoots a graph left and right what stretches it compresses it both horizontally and vertically then when we get trigonal trigonometry it's gonna be a piece of cake to graph the you're not piece of cake but a lot easier to graph them so so really we want to get a feel for what these graphs are doing by just looking at the functions themselves and the operations that are taking place the things you need to know in order to do this are number one what does an x squared graph look like what does an absolute value of x graph look like what are the key points there and then I'm gonna teach you that transform so let's let's start right away we're gonna talk about what a vertical shift is now please don't just memorize this understand what's taking place and why in the world adding or subtracting outside of your function so like this plus 3 y that would be a shift up or down vertical shift on the y axis so I want you to take a look at it let's imagine that you have way too and we understand this you know that X is our input so stick with me here if I had an x value and I plug it into a function the functions value is an output for that that whatever that x value is so says take an input plug it into a function you get an output now this right here this FX this is the output for your graph what if you took the output value f of X is an output value and you added something to it a constant so you just added a number to an output what's I going to do is that going to affect the input that you plug in no is it going to take the effect the output value of your function yes what this says is if you have an output value or you take a functions output value and you just add to it or you take an output value and you subtract from it what's gonna happen it's not going to move it left to right that would be an input idea that's not affecting the input I haven't taken X an effective input it can't move it on the input axis this is take your output add or subtract take your output that's an output axis idea and add or subtract to or from it adding to an outputs value is going to change the output and make it taller will make it higher it's going to take that and shift it vertically upward take an output value and subtracting from this can take an output of a function and move it lower so these are going to give and give us an what's called a vertical shift or a vertical transformation it's going to shift it up for plus and minus four down that's got to make sense that's you've got to see it you got to see that our input would go into a function this is the output of a function and now I just add to every single one of the outputs that would be the same value I'm adding for every one of the outputs it could take the graph shape that's gonna move it up or take the graph shake and move it down that's where this comes from so when I take a function value and I add after the function outside the parentheses after everything's been accomplished and I take a helper value add to it that's a shift up or if I subtract that's a shift down one thing to really focus on here this is not affecting input it says take a value plug it into your thumb Shin yeah then after you've plugged it in after the parentheses are over after u squared stuff R cubed inner square root or absolute value did outside of that after the function you'd have an ugly thought you wouldn't you now add to that oh I'm taking the alpha value and I'm adding to it or I'm taking it out the value and I'm subtracting from it that's why this shifts up or down but not left to right it's affecting the output only input does not change output does change and it's shifting it units above or units below that's what we're talking about here so when we talk about x squared plus three I'm gonna give you this a very specific way on how I want you to graph these it's not going to be in any textbook that you see I know of because I made it up but as far as I know maybe not but but here's the way that I do this number one I identify what my basic rap sheet is it's going to be in one of the library functions that you just talked about in last video so when I look at this I go okay the key basic function here is x squared what are your key points for that function don't be overthinking it with the plus three right now just think what's my one's my basic graph shape X group one of my key points okay my key points very important my key points are 1 1 0 0 and because it's based on an even function negative 1 positive 1 that is what I wanted you to remember from the last video firstly what the graphs shape is this is a parabola secondly what my key points are 1 1 0 0 negative 1 positive 1 I need that to be there now now that we have the basic graph shape in our heads we know it's a parabola we know what our key points are that's them we're gonna look at what the +3 does so we think okay this is this is a parabola and this says take the output values so you plug in a number right you square it that's an alpha value and they'll add 3 to it adding 3 to the output value is gonna be a shift up 3 so I'm gonna circle that I'm gonna say that this plus 3 that means that we take my original basic graph shape my parabola and I would shift every those values those output values up I have a very kind of neat way to do this graphically so here's we're going to do if we're gonna shift every single value of this graph of 3 not left to right we're gonna leave that alone but up 3 here's the might have let's do I'm gonna say you know what we could do instead of graphing this on the original XY axis what if we pretended that we shifted the x-axis of 3 what if we pretended we didn't shift the y-axis at all why not I'm not moving left to right I'm staying right where my input is this shift is not affecting my input it's affecting my output so I'm gonna pretend my my my shift up moves my x-axis up it shifted the whole graph up it has not shifted my my y-axis of left to right at all so that's staying there I'll make a couple key comments about this when I'm doing this I'm not really shooting an exacta simple we're just kind of pretending or giving ourselves a graphic organizer so that we can say you know what this parabola is all shifting up three units if the whole thing's shifting up for you is let's shift our axes let's shift up three units and let's shift lever right no units let's leave that alone but if I do that then what I can do is take the key points of our basic graph shape and if i graph the room for might like new XY axis if i say alright this graph would always have one one right well yeah but now I shifted it up three spots three units let's using the same scale let's plot one one using the same scale let's plot zero zero from my new XY axis let's plot negative one one on the same scale what that's gonna do is if I get my scale right which I didn't what that's gonna do that's gonna allow us to graph the parabola that we know this this graph gives us but it's going to allow us to graph it in the correct spot so the whole idea is identify what your basic graph shape is got it identify which key points are you should have down understanding why I caught you though hey even has the 1 1 0 0 negative 1 positive 1 and odd hasn't maybe 1 negative 1 will make it a lot nicer you go that's even it's got these as key points great I know if the shape isn't no the key points are I also understand that up 3 that plus 3 says I'm taking and shifting this graph up three spots if we pretend our x axis shifts up and we pretend our Y axis doesn't shift at all that gives you this new place on which I can graph my key points now please understand this is not really on your graph it's not really there it's not really the x axis just gives us a way for us to graph it nice and from our new XY axis we can graph 1 1 0 0 making 1 positive 1 are the points 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 1 on your graph no the real points are 1 4 0 3 negative 1 4 what because you took these output values and you added 3 to them that's what happened that's what's going on it's just nice to be able to graph it that way I hope that makes sense I hope you're seeing why adding a value at the end of your function is shifting up outside parentheses outside ups and value outside all the function stuff and - is down you're taking the Alpen value adding or subtracting respectively one way we can show that is this shift our X and our Y axis and give a new X Y X not really there and then plot our key points works very nicely now let's move on a little bit what about a horizontal shift you know what we'll wait a minute a vertical shift what that did was it took an output value and it added or subtracted because output values are vertical idea it's moving vertically on the y axis now look what an input value would do let's say I would take my now what's this do wait a second takes an input value X is our input that says right before you do anything else I want you to add to that or take your input value and before you do anything else I was subtract from it well because X is our input access idea adding or subtracting to an input value before you put any sort of function onto it or any sort of function it's gonna affect shifting on our horizontal axis it's a horizontal shift because our input axis is horizontal and because we're affecting our input first it's going to take an input value it's going to alter it it's going to say I'm going to move you to the right or to the left man I'll tell you what in the 13 years I've been teaching now I've tied I've taught this this stuff in 60 different classes to 260 different groups of students and I'll tell you what this I did is the number one missed idea when you are shifting the graphing with transformations people really really want this to be a shift right it's not they really want that to be a shift left it's not it's opposite of what your brain wants to make it intuitively I'll tell you what in parentheses anything that happens in parentheses is almost always opposite of your intuition it's weird but that's the way were to explain that very well in just a second what I want to make sure that you get right though this is shift this is a shift in a direction on the horizontal and this is shift horizontal in the correct direction but man you need to get your  straight all right so this is a shift left and this is a shift right you probably see that that's really easy for students to get good views big oh I really want plus two I mean plus means up and it does don't haven't change that plus means up when it's outside of function what's affecting the output yes it does plus does not mean right when you're affecting the input - doesn't mean left when you're affecting an input everything in parentheses happens opposite of the way that you want it to happen so here this is going to or instead of a function sense that's not a shift to the to the left this will be shipped right why why is this a shift left and there's a shift right I'm explaining it to two different ways one way is just be the whole way put idea what what this does let's focus specifically on this this says I want you to take I want you to take a number and I want you to to write when I plug it in add 2 to it in order to get out the same height that I would normally have got so let's let's say 0 let's say I want to get out a height of 0 if I cover up that 2 and say in order to get a height of 0 out out plugging 0 because they absolute value it would be 0 now you tell me okay I want I'm gonna add whatever you never you give me I'm gonna add 2 to it no matter what it's okay now what if I wanted to get a height of 0 i plug in 0 is gonna be a height of 2 what value would I have to plug in in order to still get the same height if you're gonna add 2 to everything well it's not to because if I look if I say 2 no 2 plus 2 would give me a height of 4 in order to undo this sort of a this sort of a adding to your input idea I'd have to put in an input that's less than what I started with so I'd have to put a negative 2 in order to get the height of 0 back so I hope that makes sense I'm in a different way in a second but if I haven't giving out if I want to get the height of 0 I plug in 0 to get out at 0 here I have to plug in negative 2 to get the height of cereal the same value that I would get out previously well negative 2 is not to the right now you two need to go left it's a shift left the way I can think of it is like a time line let's say that the years 2015 if it is that's cool you're watching this in the future although it would be the future for me not for you for you weird let's say that that's the year 2015 here's you 2000 and I walk into the room and I say in the year 2050 at this time I say I'm 50 years old I am fitting when was I born I was born in the year 2000 ok never been that's to make sense I hope hopefully that makes sense see if it's 20 59 50 years old which I won't be able to older than that unfortunately but and I say I'm 50 years old you go ok you were born in the year 2000 now what if I walk into the room and say oh now it's still the year 2050 and I say I'm now 48 I'm 48 years old so the year 2050 and I walk into the room and say I'm 48 years old I've subtracted two years from my age and my board year 2000 no I subtracted two for my age imma go to the year 1998 no unborn the year 2002 even though I subtracted two from that that time I've moved to the right on my timeline that's sort of what's going on I'm subtracting two for my input value it's moving me actually to the right I know this is adding to I get it but but I need to understand that subtracting two from your input subtracting two from your value is a moving to the right sort of an idea on timeline that's what's happening here I hope one of those two things make sense to you but for us we just need to understand I well I did explain it a couple good ways but we understand that adding to your input value in order to undo the adding to an input you would have to give me a smaller value that's to the left in order to undo subtracting from my input you'd have to give me a bigger value in order to undo that and get the same height out that would be a shift to the right in order to undo this adding two to your input I'd have to give you smaller values so that when you add two to it and get back the original height that's the idea it's an opposite of what you want it to be so this this and this so this ship let's look at that that's an absolute value of x plus two the first thing one I understand is it absolute value gives me a V I'm gonna get a V here the second thing to understand is that I have some key points my key points are 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 1 that would be the key points but my basic absolute value of X graph that's what that's what value of x is gonna have now we identify that the plus 2 what that does it takes the absolute value it says that plus 2 is going to be and in affecting of the input axis it's not after them so that it's not affecting the output that doesn't affect the output it says I'm affecting the input first it says before you even look at the absolute value I'm saying plug in a value of X I'm gonna add 2 to it that's affecting the input that's a horizontal shift in fact it's a shift left left two units so I looked at it at some values of V as debate has these key points I've looked at my function and saying this is inside my function this is affecting the input the X input that's a horizontal idea it's gonna shift left to so what we're gonna do this isn't shifting up and down there's no nothing outside of that function shift up and down it's not that's affecting the output so we're gonna do is we're gonna sell right well I couldn't that this would shift my graph left - it would not shift my graph up and down at all because there's no constant that's being added to every output value are you seeing how when we sort of create a new XY axis it's given us a place where we can plot our key points so when we shift our graph we're basically shifting the beach and just moving where that thing starts so if we're if we're moving this graph left - I can still 1 the 0 0 and the 1 1 and the negative 1 1 like it would normally get on a on a absolute value type of graph but I've shifted the whole thing over 2 units to the left plus instead of function means to the left I know it's not intuitive but when we really think about it that's what has to be the case in order to undo that adding to it every input you give me smaller values to the same output so we say alright let's plot our new XY axis it's not really there but I can use this to plot my key points and graph my absolute value I know it's not a parabola do not give me a parabola that's an absolute value graph and we're sketching here with our transformations I hope that that makes sense that adding to an input is actually moving you to the left not to the right are and you can check it with outputs if you really want to plug in negative 2 negative 2 plus 2 is 0 absolute value of 0 is 0 the original absolute value would be here that's Memphis in left plug in negative 1 negative 1 plus 2 is 1 absolute value of 1 would be 1 that's the correct graph it's just moved to the left I seem like we wouldn't want to just graph these by plugging in points what if you just plugged in negative 1 0 and 1 you get a straight you just get a straight line you wouldn't get this key feature this change from decreasing increasing this is a local minimum you wouldn't get it unless you plugged in negative 2 and then negative 3 might not do that you just plug in values so we really want to get a feel for what transformations actually do this is one way to do it figure out your basic graph put your key points identify your shifts and then graph your key points from your new XY axis yes these key points aren't actually there the points are negative 3 1 negative 2 0 negative 1 1 but it's a good way to get it all right we're going to put this stuff together I'm going to go kind of quickly through it so I'm gonna model my thinking on what our basic graph is alright my key points first what our shifts are doing I'll move my X and my Y axis on both of these and then we're gonna graph so when I'm looking at it man f of X is it's based on an X cubed graph now so stuff does happen to it but it's based on X cubed that means I know I'm gonna get this s-curve going with sort of an s-curve going up I know that it's odd it's an odd basic graph shape I know my key points are 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 negative 1 because it's based on that font graph I also know what my shifts do so how I look at this I look at the end first I look at after the functions over with after that power 3 is over with is there anything that's added or subtracted to it this is yeah this right here says that I'm shifting down one unit it's after the function is affecting the outputs of my function I've shifted down this plus one that plus one is inside now I really want my head plus one to be to the right but I know it's affecting the input I know it's inside the parentheses inside input so I'm affecting this by adding one of input I know I wanted to be the right but I know the inside produces opposite of that so adding 1 in order to undo the adding of 1 you would have to give me a smaller value to get out the same height so this would be a left one so if I've notified my graph I know I'm gonna be graphing this I've identified that key points based on the fact that's an odd graph in our library functions now I'm shifting down one and the left one I'm gonna draw like a new XY axis a new location for me to graph my key points so there's down 1 and here's left one so we're going to put our key points on that graph so our key points were 1 1 but I'm graphing it from this new X Y X is account I'm kind of not focusing on the black lines and focus on my dotted lines here so 0 0 would be here 1 1 would be 1 1 it would actually be the old origin and then negative 1 negative 1 would be 1/4 the same scale right here I have memorized my cubic I know what it looks like I know that's this sort of a curve that's what that graph looks like normally we get something that's that's just a sketch we can make it a little bit better one way to make it better is to plug in a few points that you don't know now I just said don't grab this thing I plug in the points understand that we didn't we grabbed a very good graph by just having our key points and shifting it if you want to make it better to get more of a feel for where the graph really looks like maybe plug in a value like the y-intercept now when we have that here zero comma zero is on our graph but if you wanted to see plug in one where this thing actually goes or plug in negative 3 it gives you a better feel for it same thing here we could be a lot more specific by saying hey you know what I know where our real key features are but if I want to find out where this crosses the y axis plug in 0 if I plug in the 0 here 0 plus 2 is 2 absolute value of 2 is 2 so I know that really I'm cross you had 2 this is a little bit off I didn't do correctly we can get a much better look that's not much better by graphing that through its actual y-intercept is there more could you do more could you understand that because this is even man stick with me here because this is even I know that if this two units away from my axis of symmetry why would you why would you want to use my technique to graph why would you want to shift over the y axis it gives you explicitly your axes of symmetry when you do that if I want to use this axis of symmetry two units away I can use symmetry because it's even to you it's a way I know it has to also go through that point you get one for free that's nice to do that you done the same thing here all right so our last one we know that we know this is a functions based on a square root graph so in your head hopefully you're thinking square root square roots look like this they're half of a parabola on its side that's big look like I know my key points my key points for square roots there's only two of them I know one one and 0 0 there are no negatives that are allowed in your square roots that means that not necessarily you can't plug in negative numbers but I can't plug in any value that's gonna give me a negative number inside so for instance I can't even plug in 1 here I can't put them like this 1 minus 2 is negative 1 that'd be a problem so we're probably not gonna have anything to the left of the next value of 2 now that's fine because that says shift to the right but we want to think about that right now this is a one-sided graph it's based on the square root it's based on original key points of 1 1 and 0 0 no negative 1 1 negative 1 negative 1 so I understand that I know the shape I know my key points now I'm gonna identify what my shifts are so the plus 3 what's happening with that I go from the outside in the plus 3 says that I would take after my function and affect the outputs by adding 3 3 is gonna move my outputs up so that's a shift up 3 now I'm gonna look inside them ok inside my function inside parentheses or absolute value or inside the square root I see a minus 2 so my hand I think okay -2 is affecting horizontal -2 is going to be to the right - I'm going to subtract 2 from every input in order to undo that and get the same height out I originally would so where my graph is but same height but move over somewhere I would have to give me bigger numbers those are to the right but your numbers to the right so this would be right - so I've identified my shape my key points what's happening to those key points and now I'm going to graph it so Unruh graphic okay I'm gonna shift up 3 that's going to shift this up three spots I'm gonna shift right - that's going to shift this over or that allowed me to shift an axis over two spots so right up three right - even though that's not actually on your graph and even though my key points when I shoot them are going to be different points on your graph it's a really nice way to get where this graph is what this graph looks like so I'm looking at okay here's my new XY axis if i graph these key points from this new XY axis i have 0 0 according to the same scale my graph I have 1 comma 1 now that 2 points 3 comma 4 you didn't know that this is not really here but it lets me identify exactly where my graph is I know my shape I know I'm not going to put a V it's not absolutely I'm not gonna put a problem it's not a problem this is a square root type of graph that's why it's so important to memorize the shapes of these graphs from your library functions if you want to be a little bit more specific you might plug in a value probably not for if I play them three I know I'm going to get that value 4 I get the square root of 2 that's kind of hard to deal with so maybe something like let's see if I wanted to get out for I play in something like 6 plug in 6 6 minus 4 give you - sorry 6 - to give you 4 squared 4 is 2 and then add 3 you get 5 and you can find a couple other values if you want to you better get a better graph but before sketching this is what I need you to know I need you to understand the shapes of the graphs on the basis of what I'm giving you I need to understand the key points on being even or odd and then I need to understand what these shifts are doing after the function plus means that my space down within the function plus means left and minus means right and putting those together right now I'm gonna come back with how to how to affect your outputs as far as stretching them and compressing them and then we'll talk about how to reflect them let's continue so the last couple that we had last three we have to deal with is how to take a graph and stretch it out vertically or compress it vertically how to stretch it out horizontally compressed horizontally and how to reflect it both across the x-axis and across the y-axis so we'll talk about those kind of four transformations we'll talk about how this one really man almost always in at least point on those are functions you can change it into a vertical stretch compression and so will really focus on vertical stretches and compressions and there are reflections let's talk about the vertical stress compression so imagine imagine that you take an input you don't mess of it look at what you're doing you're not messing with the input you're saying take my input plug it into a function that's going to give me an output value f of X stands for an output value of some function so take your output value now multiply your output value not your input value multiply your output value by some sort of number what's gonna happen let's say your input values were something like I don't know one one zero zero and negative one one like the key points for an x squared now take those and multiply your not into it this is doing nothing to give the value that happens over here this is doing nothing to improve value this is take your output value and multiply it by a number what's going to happen your Impa values are going to change so for the same input values your output values will start growing or shrinking depending on whether you multiply it by a number greater than 1 or less than 1 so what the vertical stretching compression does it says you're taking your output value your x number it's going to leave your inputs alone it's going to stretch it if the numbers more than 1 taking the output value times 2 times 3 times 1 and 1/2 times some fraction greater than 1 it's going to take those in it's a multiplier taking it up and multiply them it's not a shift it's not moving the whole graph it's taken the graph and growing your outputs or if you multiply by numbers less than one one third one five sevenths 1/2 taking your output value and shrinking them that's what's happening here so for our eight values and greater than one you're going to get what's called a vertical stretch it's gonna take those output values and it's going to multiply that so they get bigger what that's gonna do it's gonna start making your graph look more narrow imagine like I'm 6 feet tall so if if I start if I stayed my same weight and I gained like eight inches while I'm gonna get pretty tall but I'm also getting pretty thin so I'm that that's gonna that's gonna make me appear narrower and taller a vertical stretch is a narrow sort of idea I'm also gonna talk about this in a minute it's not on there to be suspense a vertical stretch is a horizontal compression a vertical compression is a horizontal stretch with six feet x six we tell if I if I shrunk 8 inches and same the same way I'm gonna get wider there's no way I'm not going to be wider that's what happens with with these vertical sort of stretch compression idea so with our values greater than 1 we're multiplying our outputs it's not an input idea now but idea I'm multiplying that by numbers that are making them bigger I'm stretching out my outlets that's a stretch and it's gonna be more narrow for numbers less than 1 that's shrinking that's saying take your output and give me fractions of them so I'm going to take my output values with my inputs being the same and make it smaller or it's going to go shrinking that's a compression and that will make the graph appear more wide so let's go ahead and let's talk about this one look at what this says look what it doesn't output this is I have an x squared kind of graph that's my basic graph here I've done my key points 1 1 0 0 negative 1 they do 1 now this says these are all your outputs our x squared your anklets are not affected all your outputs are x squared and B plug in a number and squared now take all those outputs and multiply x to know what can we do why in the world would Leonard want you to learn key points for something because if you're taking your key points and all you're doing is affecting the output by multiplying it by 2 then why don't we take your output and multiply the outputs of our key points by two so what this to does it really does take this and multiply your outputs not your inputs so you'd still get one button one times two is two zero zero times zero is zero times zero is zero negative one one well negative one that's insane but one times two gives you two those are your new outputs for this graph now we did not shift up we didn't shift down there's no plus after here no mines up here no plus in here if I can input an alliance in here if they can input so really we we still have zero zero but now we have instead of one cup of one this has affected the output values not the input values there's nothing in here affecting the input there's no fit in you're affecting the input because it's a but affect your output values are multiplied by two that's why I wanted you to learn the basic graph shapes and their key points so that we can start affecting outlets and later affecting the inputs since affects your outputs by multiplying by two so instead of one one you know one comma two zero zeros to the same negative one comma two this is taking your original parabola and made it skinnier made it more narrow it's stretched down vertically that's what's going on now I love the next one what about one-half X to the third so we're looking at going alright this is an X cubed graph this is an odd graph this has key points of 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 negative 1 but what does this do there's nothing add or subtract if therefore there's no vertical shift there's nothing added or subtracted inside the function no horizontal shift this says take every output can do it that way I can take every output of your X to the third power and multiply by 1/2 don't fit the inputs just take the output values and multiply them by 1/2 that would take the output values and that would cut them in half so 0 0 now the inputs with 0 0 1 1 negative 1 1 and affecting the outputs only the 0 0 would still be 0 0 1 1 would still have an input value 1 this is not inputs but it have an output value 1/2 negative 1 negative on would still have an input value negative 1 but an output value of negative 1/2 it's cut all of those output values and 1/2 do you see how it's going to squish it squish it down that's what's happening here in the future what's going to happen is we're going to do two two transformations at once it's me the next video when we just practice all this stuff if I put a negative sign up front that's not look very good but if that's a negative sign up front then that would affect the outputs by changing the sign as well so we can do both a vertical stretch or compression and we can do reflections about the x-axis at the same time so I want you to watch out for that in the next video that's what we're going to be doing so let's graph it we did not shift up or down only not shoot left or right we took our key points we affect your outputs by cutting them in half we still have zero zero but now instead of one one we cut the output in half instead of negative one negative one we cut the output in half so this is going to be a much shrunken sort of a graph as far as a vertical compression we can plug in a couple of the points if you if you want to be a little more accurate but notice how it's it took our original s-curve and women are sort of shrunk it down and compressed it also made a little bit wider because it compressed it this made this graph narrow because we stretched it I hope that makes sense to you that we still have some key points but then when we talk about a vertical stretching oppression we're affecting the output we're growing it if our a of the number in front there's more than one and we're shrinking it or compressing it if our a is less than one fractions of your outputs now how about horizontal stretching depression we I'm not going to talk a whole lot about this just one thing it's very very common that a horizontal stretch or compression can be changed into a vertical stretch or compression almost always with the stuff we deal with when we get to trigonometry no but there's sort of a different way that we're going to approach it so I'll get there when we eat those videos way way way in the future for right now what I would like it is that when we talk about a horizontal stretch or compression I mentioned this is a little while ago virtually everything inside parentheses is opposite of your intuition so here's what's going to happen if you have a number greater than three first are greater than one so you're a here if your a is greater than one that what that's going to do that's going to give you a horizontal compression not a horizontal stretch it's opposite of what you kind of want it to be numbers greater than one are a horizontal compression numbers less than one or a horizontal stretch why why in the world of that'd be the case I said something well back that's it goes into this if I talk about a vertical stretch it would be a horizontal compression when I stretched something out it's gonna make it appear more narrow it's going to compress the horizontally when I squish something down vertically it's going to stretch it out horizontally things work hand-in-hand on the prove it to you right now so if I have f of X equals three x quantity squared that would say what this is going to do this would compress your grab that's a parabola it would compress your graph horizontally well isn't that the same thing as 9x squared yeah well that's a stretch this is it's a stretched vertically x squared and I take every output and multiply it by nine that's going to go one it's going to make it much more narrow a horizontal compression is greater than one here is a vertical stretch do you see it do you see how that makes sense if I had 1/2 it would be 1/2 squared to be 1/4 there would be a vertical compression giving us a horizontal stretch they work in hand most of the time we can change horizontal stretches and compressions into I do vertical compressions and stretches respectively that's what we can do with it if you don't want to do that you're multiplying your input you'd still be the same exact points just doing it slightly different way that's what I'm going to leave it at I'm going to tell you that horizontal compressions and stretches we're going to change vertical doing the same exact thing right there now last one reflections in the next video we practice all the stuff put together what reflections do is they change the sign of either your output or your input so let's think about this let's say that I give you a function and you put something into it it gives you an output they go no no no change the sign well what's that gonna do it says I want you to change the sign of your Y value it literally says in English is look at your Y value your bio is based on f of X but I want you to take the original output and now change the sign so for something that would have a Y value normally that's positive you're gonna give me a negative for something that has a Y value that's negative normally you'd give me a positive so you're you're taking your your sign of your output side of your output is a vertical idea and I would change the sign change the Sun or change the sign change the sign what that what's that doing well that's taking your graph in reflecting it vertically reflected about nothing y-axis but the x-axis changing the output sign put something opposite side of the x-axis because the x axis marks where your outlets change sign doesn't it so that x axis floats at y equals zero above the x axis are positive outputs and below are negative outputs so if I start changing the sign of that positive becomes negative negative becomes positive it's it's reflecting it vertically that's a reflection of the x axis what happens with our what happens we think this sign of our inputs it's not nearly as common as our outputs but imagine I said I want you plug in five you okay negative five oh yeah no I said I said I said five negative I'm fine maybe if I'm gonna pacify you start changing out of the inputs on me well if I change an input sign then an input sign says if I would normally plug in five and I'm changing the sign to give me negative five or plug in negative two and now you're changing something to be positive two that's what that that's something I would do it would affect the input before I even got to the function what that's going to do is affect the sign of the Y axis that you are on this is a reflection about the y axis now like always and you didn't know what the shape is of the graph that we're talking about so I need to know that this cube this cube root function is normally this sort of an s-curve it's like the cube root it's like the the power three function flipped on its side so that's what that's gonna look like I'm gonna be graphing that but let's let's understand it this right here this basic graph shape has key points everything comes back of shape and key points of 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 negative 1 that's the key points for this graph now what's the negative do does the negative affect the input does negative affect the output well it's not next to the input it's not affecting the input I'm telling you you see you're telling me I'm gonna plug in the same input no problem so plug in a 1 or 0 or negative 1 no problem but this says take whatever the output value is and change the sign so take your key points take whatever the output values are and change the sign not the one not the 0 not that negative 1 as far as inputs but the one for an out becomes negative 1 0 does not change negative 1 for the input no problem but change this that's what this says it says change this on your output change the sign of your output of your original function one becomes negative 1 0 stays 0 negative 1 becomes positive 1 what's that done that is not change the input but it's given you an opposite output for that input so add normally being at 1 1 now your 1 they do want notice what it did to get out but they just flipped over the x-axis 0 0 didn't change not gonna change for any of these negative 1 negative 1 is what you normally have it's a change your output negative 1 don't use input make the 1 positive 1 so what's going on we would normally have this graph but now it has reflected it about the x-axis your wait a minute that looks a whole lot like it reflect about the y-axis you can view it two different ways notice if I took this and moved this negative inside cube root of negative x is the same thing as a negative cube root of x because that is an odd function that's the way that that would work so you can view it two different ways but the way that we talked about it what this would do what the negative does that native respect the outputs it would flip the output over the other side of the x-axis that's what that reflection does for you and I would I would want a student understand what that transformation is we would say this transformation there's no vertical shift there's no horizontal shift there's a reflection about the x axis that's what's going on okay this last one what happens about reflection over the y axis this says take your input and change the sign all right my input value is X now change the sign give me a negative x so let's see a square root our key points are 1 1 and 0 0 it's neither even nor odd it's neither it has only two key points that we really focus on so this says now I want you to take your input values and I want to change your values but leave your outputs alone so this would give us a instead of one one it'd be negative 1 1 instead of 0 0 it's to be 0 to 0 so go in from our graph our normal graph would look like this our normal graph would have a point at 0 0 that would have a point and make it positive 1 1 and it would look like this that happened from outside if I say now switch the sign of your inputs leave your output values alone so it's a sign of your inputs then instead of positive 1 1 I'd have negative 1 but I'd still have an Apple one and zero zero still there that's a reflection about the y axis that is what's going on I hope that that makes sense I hope that I've explained in such a way that you understand that what a vertical stretch is is affecting the output and leave the input alone by multiplying the output by some number numbers bigger than one take a number multiplied by something bigger than one it's going to grow it take a number multiply it by something less than one it's going to shrink it that's what's happening here when we talk about reflections we're talking about take an output and multiply by an opposite sign so change the sign it's going to take an output value and reflect you about the x-axis take an input value and multiply by the opposite sign I'm going to take an input and put it on the other side of the y-axis we are going to put all these things together the next video talk about vertical shifts and horizontal shifts and stretches compressions and reflections all at the same time and do a good job we explain what in the world they do we'll talk about shifting our x axis and y axis using our key points affecting the outputs or even the inputs of our key points and seeing what that does for our stretching and compressing and reflecting hope that makes sense I'll see you for the next video you 

Transcript for: How to Graph with Transformations (Precalculus - College Algebra 15)
now that we understand transformations and our basic graph shades it's time to practice them so I'm going to show you I had a letter way to approach graphing with transformations what we're gonna talk about is basic graph shape we'll talk about key points will talk about labeling all of our transformations and then using our shifting of our x and r y axis to create this sort of new XY axis put in our new key points how to modify those on the new XY axis and get a really good graph will talk about axis of symmetry if there is one we'll talk about how to use that and then we'll talk about how we had to make the graphs with a little bit better so let's get started let's take a look at f of x equals negative 1/2 absolute value of x minus 3 and then plus 2 one of the things that we need to do every time we're graphing the transformations identify what our basic graph shape is get a picture of what it looks like in our head identify our key points and then identify what transformations are happening so when we look at this absolute value in your head that's got to make a V now what we do it that V might reflect it yeah but the basic graph shape is a V then after that we go K that basic graph shape because it's a that's absolute value type of graph it is even in its most basic form and then we're going to talk about our key points so our key points are 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 positive 1 because that's based on an even shape and even graph shape so we've identified our V would have identified our basic graph shape and then we're gonna see what these transformations have done so number one we've got this plus two that plus two happens after the absolute value that plus two says your output is being affected so all this stuff is over with all the multiplication would happen before you add all that absolute value happen before you add that 2 so that plus 2 is affecting your output only so it says I'm gonna affect my output this is gonna be a shift up so we can put a whole lot vertical shift up two units then I look inside ok inside that I'm affecting my input that input of X is affected by subtracting 3 now we know that inside the function the horizontal shift the affecting the input is kind of opposite we want to think so minus 3 it does not move left 3 it moves right three now we look out front that OUTFRONT idea is also affecting the output not the input the only thing ever fix-it input is stuff that happens inside the function before you let the function take over so we looked and said that's an output that's a output that's plus two that's affecting the input that's minus three so up to but right three now we look out front say okay that's also affecting the output but in a little bit of a different way that's affecting the output value multiplicatively so it's affecting it by multiplying the output by one half and a negative now practically we treat those as one thing so we're going to multiply this output in just a minute by negative one half both of them together but but really technically that's two different transformations the one half takes your output value doesn't change your input that's already happened here takes your output value for the given input whatever you have and then it's going to cut them in half that's going to be a vertical compression vertical compressions go ahead and make our graph look whiter that's what's going to happen also we're multiplying our output by a negative so we've shifted up two we've shifted right three we've cut the output in half now we're going to take the output values and we're going to reflect them we're going to reflect them about the x-axis so it's going to take the output values and change their sign that's a reflection about the x-axis altering the values of our outputs those would be the four different transformations going on this graph so if you want to write them out we have up to a vertical shift up two we have a horizontal shift right three we have a vertical compression or shrinking our values we have a vertical reflection above the X practically though what we do with it if you look the shape of your graph is that that V and you know what your key points are then if we shift them up to we're going to move this axis we can we can kind of pretend or axis moves if we ship this up to we're gonna move our access up to units we're gonna move our other actions over twice over three units then we're going to take those outputs and say wait then they can one have effects or output values only the shifting affected our input values but the this they don't have affects your output values only our key points we take those key points we see what's happening here I'm finding an output I'm multiplying by negative 1/2 my input value won't change but one times negative 1/2 would give you a negative 1/2 do you see this do you see how by multiplying your output values by the negative and the 1/2 you're doing both a vertical compression shrinking the output and it's also reflecting it's changing its sign this you're gonna zero is never going to change by multiplying but negative one one becomes negative one still you never affect that input unless you started to multiply your input by something either the last example we do in this video but your 1 times negative 1/2 is also negative 1/2 so here's the way that I like to do it I like to do this in the same order we wrote them down so we're gonna shift our horizontal axis up to we're going to shift our vertical axis right three we're gonna get this new XY axis and then we're gonna graph our new key points how do we get our new key points we multiply it our outputs times whatever is there this said multiply your output of your function times this number we just did that here's our original key points and we did that so let's grab them so let's see up to and right three I showed you this in a previous video that when we would we move our X Y axis it's not this is not really there but it gives us a really good place for us to put our new key points so this is you're gonna ship your graph up to great let's let's show that you're gonna shoot your graph right three let's show that this is like our new origin not really there but if we graph our new key points on our new X Y axis is going to show us where our graph actually is please keep in mind our key points when they're graph from our quote-unquote new XY axis they're not the points of 1 comma negative 1/2 I understand that but it's where those points will be on your graph and then you can interpret that and say all right this would actually be the point 4 comma 1 and 1/2 that's fine and that's important but this gives you a very good way to do it so 1 comma negative 1/2 using the same scale that we had as our original XY axis our key points would be 1 comma negative 1/2 so from here this would be like our 1 comma negative 1/2 is about right there we still have 0 0 right there we'd still have negative 1 this would be like our negative 1 our new X Y axis comma negative 1/2 that's about right there so what we've done we've looked at we said this is a V I've got that in my head I know what my my transformations are so I know my key points where I know transformations are I've shifted up to I got that shifted right 3 I get that I am doing a vertical compression I multiplied my outputs by 1/2 I'm doing a reflection about the x I'm multiplying my outputs by a negative we did that one time now we grab those key points on our shifted axes and we recognize this is not a parabola it's not a square root this is a V it's just been reflected so draw the V and then if we want to make it a little bit better that's a sketch I want to make it a little bit better understand that we can do things like find the Y act y-intercept pretty if we plug in x equals zero so plug in x equals zero zero minus three is going to give me a negative 3 the absolute value of negative 3 is positive 3 positive 3 times negative 1/2 is negative 1 and 1/2 if I add 2 it's going to give me positive 1/2 so I found that value by taking 0 and plugging that into my function that's going to give you a better graph so my graph is a little off right now because I was curving a bit ok that's way off that gives you a better look for my graph the other thing I can do because this is an even function you have an axis of symmetry that runs right through where that that change from increasing and decreasing is on this graph that's why I like this technique so much of drawing your like new y-axis where that would shift to because it automatically gives you an axis symmetry it's really nice you don't get that if you don't do that well if at this level of 1/2 or how many units are like 1 2 3 and it's away from axis symmetry then 1 2 3 units away from the axis enter other side will also have this height of 1/2 so 1 2 3 1 2 3 we have a height of 1/2 as well that gives you the ability to graph much more accurately than just a sketch it gives you a really nice looking graph for minimal work you get the plug in a lot of points to get that graph as accurate as we just got it by using our shifting so one more time although a 3 you're looking at you're looking at what your basic graph shape is you're identifying your key points you're identifying your your transformations there's four of them here practically we kind of do three of them so we do a vertical shift if there's one we do a horizontal shift if there's one then we talk about an output affectation this number in front here that's multiplying your output we do this at the same time then we use our axes we shift them up down left right we have this new origin we plot our new key points after affecting them we plot our new key points on that that axis or on the Nuestra axis if we need to find like a y-intercept do it just plug in 0 to your original function no problem that is a point on your graph and then you can use your axis symmetry which you automatically show by using my technique to give it a kind of a three-point so anyway that's the way that this graph would look for sure it is the V it has been reflected it has been squashed it's made it a little bit let so vertical progressed has made a little bit wider and we have our vertical shift and horizontal shift correctly let's go ahead you should be trying that line on your own see if you can identify what the shape of that graph would look like is it a parabola what is it what's it look like is it a V see if you can write down two key points based on the fact that it's odd see if you can write down to four transformations that that has up-down left-right compress stretch reflect whatever that does and then see being graphic so I'm gonna start right now this isn't cubic so it's gonna look like originally like this power three curve that we're hopefully getting used to after we understand what that looks like is odd we know that our key points are going to be one one zero zero and negative one negative one that's how every one of our odd basic graph shapes that's the key points for every one of our basic graph shapes with the exception of the one over X function it doesn't have a zero zero but they all have one one negative one negative one why office tuplets give you all this sort of opposite inputs give you opposite outputs that's how it works now we'll go ahead and identify our our transformation so we have our key points down we've identified our function we're going to say all right well let's see this -1 happens after the function it's affecting the output it's saying I want you to add or subtract here subtract one from every output that's a shift down inside says I want to affect the input I want you to add one to every input before you put it through the power of three that means that in order to undo that that change of input I would have to give myself smaller values as a shift to the left one I'm looking out front this is two things this says I want you to squash the output values I want you multiply the 1/3 to cut them in 1/3 so cut them down that's shrinking that's a vertical compression this multiplies by the output of whatever your function said so I'm multiplying that's shrinking and cutting by a factor of 3 so shrinking it into 1/3 that's a vertical compression the negative says I'm taking your output again but not changing its sign so are you thinking through that are you seeing the shift down seeing this left one seeing them I'm thinking the output is squashing it for a compression there will be a horizontal stretch are you seeing that making the output change sign it's not in putting signs an output change signs can reflect about the x-axis reflect X now practically what we can do that down one takes our x-axis and shifts it down one unit is it really shifting down one you do know but we're graphically we can use that we're shifting our wives left one unit is it really shifting left no but we can use that as an axis of symmetry and so now that we've shifted down one unit and left one unit we're gonna take a look at our key points and understand what in the world is happening here our key points are being affected as far as their outputs not influenced there's nothing multiplying dirt input can't change but your output values to be multiplied by negative one third yeah it's going to shrink them and reflect them so our inputs don't change that's one but negative one third because one times negative one third is negative three zero zero I'm going to change all three times anything is zero negative one doesn't change but negative one times your new multiplying your output idea gives you positive 1/3 look what your outputs are doing it's shrunk it and change the sign it's shrunk it and change the sign in absolute value shrunk it and then change the sign so 1 comma negative one third but from our new XY axis right here so from that new sort of origin idea I'd go 1 and negative 1/3 so here's one and negative 1/3 is about right there then I have negative 1 comma positive 1/3 so from the same scale this would be one unit and that down 1 be like right here so 1/3 of that that gets a little more kind of here so 1 comma negative 1/3 and 1 comma positive 1/3 is about right up here that's really taken a cubic and squashed it it's also reflected so normally the cubic would look like this like coming through through those points but now I've reflected it and squash it so our cubic according to the reflection we had according to birth compression we had a quarter of ships that we have has a 0 a 0 a 1 comma negative up there based on our dimensional axis it's very squished it's been reflected we have a y-intercept so we can't find that you could make it better by plugging in a value like positive one and seen actually where that is so you plug in any okay 1 plus 1 that's 2 2 cubed would be 8 negative 1/3 that would be negative 8/3 so negative 2 and 2/3 and it added 1 be negative 1 and 1/3 so we know that this would go through late so this is off because it should get a lot of flatter than this but we have a value of that for that input value of 1 so you can make you graph a lot better I plug in some extra points around that but what you don't do you don't start by just plugging in the random points you'll miss some key feature to this you'll definitely miss your transformations so I hope that makes sense I hope that you understand that that the first thing I want to do is understand this shape then we want to understand our key points we want to take our vertical shift then our horizontal shift if there are those then we want to take these if there's one or two transformations write down what they are and compression in this case and a reflection about the x in this case then use this in conjunction to multiply your outputs that's the way we go about doing it I'm gonna come back with two more they're slightly more difficult we'll talk about how we reflect about the Y in the last example before that we'll talk about the reciprocal function we haven't done anything with that yet so hang on all right let's continue a couple of these are a little bit more difficult and the reason why they are because number one when I was used to working with square roots and with the reciprocal function as we are with some like an x squared or X to the 3rd graph so that's a little bit more difficult the second thing is that sometimes you really have to modify what's given to you to sort of see what transformations you have and so here's I'm going to tell you to do with some of these functions number one what we're trying to look for is on the inside of your function so in the parentheses in the square root into whatever you have in the absolute value we really want to have X first and we need X to be positive in order for us to really see the transformations that are taking place so when I look at this you okay well but what's the inside the inside here is the inside of the fraction is X positive yes is next first yes that's what we're looking for this is going to give us an accurate transformation however we also want to see the original function in this now this isn't an x-squared this doesn't look like a cubic or a square root it looks like a fraction the only thing on our library functions as a fraction is Juana Rex make it look as close to that as possible so what I mean by that is the three is kind of messing this up sometimes it's a little bit better for us to write this as 3 times 1 over X minus 2 plus 1 what well let's you see that's the reciprocal function it's based on the reciprocal function but it's having to subtracted from its input it's having something obviously a plus 1 adding to its output I see Oh three times the output value so that's going to be vertical or whatever that happens to be this is the way that we should kind of approach it make sure that you're the inside of your function has a positive x and that it's first try to make it look like the function that based on so this is if this is one of rex trying to make instead of three over something three times your original function is just being modified that helps a lot of students that i hope that helps you too so we're looking at it okay that's the reciprocal function the reciprocal function has only two key points it's odd but the key points are 1 1 and negative 1 negative 1 is an odd function all odd functions on our library function have those two key points 1 1 negative 1 negative 1 now we're going to go through and identify what's going on with this function we need to look at it okay based on the fact that is a reciprocal function what's the pulse want to do that +1 say shift up 1 unit you could write out the for the three transformations we have here that's totally fine this is a shift up one so I'd probably circle that and go up that's up one now I'm going to look at the minus two and say all right well that's affecting the input that says take your input value and subtract two from it what would I have to plug in to get the same input value that I really wanted to well I have to go to bigger so that's a shift to the right two we talked about why that was in the last video and you can write those transformations out if you require to list them so right - and I'm creating this idea of a new XY axis no it's not really on the paper but it gives some really good Keita I kind of a graphic organizer on which we can put our new key points when we find a figure those out so we've shifted up one we've shifted right to you and now we're going to do with that three that three says I want you to take the output of your function and multiply the output by three not the input has nothing to do with multiplying the input there's no negative multiplying input no number multiply the input this says just take your output value multiplied by three so what's it going to do is it going to reflect them no that's not negative is it going to stretch them yes it's taking your output the same that three what that does you're gonna get one comma positive 3 and negative 1 comma negative 3 it does not change your inputs but it multiplies your outputs by positive 3 stretching this functionality that's what's gonna happen here so we're going to graph that if you want to write the transformations you have a vertical shift up one horizontal shift right - and you'd have a vertical stretch of a factor of 3 it's taking up with values and multiply every single one of my 3 okay so 1 comma 3 as it relates to this idea of a shenmue shifted XY axis says yeah the point 1 comma 3 is not really there but if i graph it according this 1 comma 3 is like way up here the real point is 3 comma 4 yeah that's that's true and the other point negative 1 comma negative 1 - 3 negative 1 comma negative 3 of you down here that's also true and stretch this out the real point would be 1 comma negative 2 but if we graph this according to our new XY axis gives a really good picture of the graph so we're gonna graph it understanding it gonna be a little weird and we're stretched it out here now what would make this better firstly maybe the point secondly I don't know where this crosses the y axis do i it's it's not going to be very clear maybe find the y intercept they give you much clearer picture what's going on so if I want to find the y-intercept of this graph I would plug in x equals 0 take a plug in x equals 0 go away the cancer on the bottom you won't because you're subtracting 2 from it so 0 minus 2 is negative 2 1 over negative 2 is negative 1/2 that'd be 3 times maybe we'll have is negative 3 halves plus 1 is negative 1/2 so I know this is crossing the y axis at negative 1/2 hope I did that right now to have +1 negative 1/2 so this graph is going to look like something like that it's not going to be perfect if you wanted to find the x intercept it takes a little bit more work to find an x intercept you have to set this equal to 0 and say all right 3 over X minus 2 equals negative 1 we could multiply both sides by X minus 2 make sure you distribute subtract 2 this would cross at negative 1 and we'd get a better picture that so this graph has been shifted up one right - we've affected our output to stretch the graph that looks pretty ugly but that's the way this graph sort of looks as far as your sketch is concerned all right the last one this gets a little bit funky and the reason why it is I just told you that you want things to happen number one you want to be able to identify your basic crashing that's a square root we know that square roots look like this just like the original reciprocal function looks like this that's exactly what we got well our square root is going to have some things happen to it but to understand what they what actually happens we really want to know what this looks like if our X is first inside your square root inside the purple you said whatever but you have and if it's positive so we have a little bit of work to do for instance I really don't like the fact that X's ii really don't like the fact that x is negative it's gonna give us a misinterpretation of what this is this is not a shift to the left but wait a minute I thought plus was left yeah it is if your edge is positive so what this does this says all right I have my function I have my two if i factor out the negative that is what you want if you want that X to be positive even if you have to factor out a negative what that negative does that changes the sign of your input is what that does that's going to reflect this about the y-axis that's what happens this is actually shift to the right and then we reflect about the y-axis so when you're organizing your thoughts on this try to see the the basic graph shape no problem we're going to get our key points in just a minute but when we organize the inside of our function to see some of the reflections we want our X to be in order we want this to be in order but we need or X to be positive as well that sounds a lot this sounds very familiar like a factory because it's kind of based on the same idea so let's go ahead and do it we now know the square root we know our key points for square roots originally are 1 1 and 0 0 but we have a few things happening and now we can see what happens because we've structured it correctly we can see this as a shift of 3 units so we're going to graph that we know this has a shift so this would be up three this says a shift not left one right one that gives a great place from which to plot our new key points so our key points were one one but what happens to them well there's two things number one we have shift up that's a first transformation number two we have shifted right that's your second transformation we have two more things going on this negative inside our square root that's affecting the input inside input it's changing the sign of your input if you change the sign of your input you start swapping on opposite sides of your y-axis that's a reflection about the y and it's going to affect your inputs so what this does is says okay if I'm going to think my inputs by changing the sign instead of one I have negative 1 instead of 0 well I'd still have 0 now what's the to do the 2 does not change the sign of your output it says hey look at you look at your output this is your square root you have some numbers coming out of that now multiply them all by 2 so take your output value and multiply it by 2 so instead of 1 just multiply by 2 there are 4 transformation to one's a shoot up 3 ones a shift right 1 1 is reflecting about the y-axis that's what that does it affects the input change the sign of your input about the y-axis and one is a vertical stretch by a factor of 2 you will find all your outputs by 2 can you see that in the in the app in the new key points can you see that what this has done is change the sign of our input and that's this is multiplied or outputs times 2 that's stretched it out so we have our shift up 3 nailed it got a shift right one we've got it we're gonna plot our new key points key points were 1 1 now it's negative 1 2 key point 4 0 0 it's still 0 0 yes the real point is 1 comma 3 I know that puts a great way to do it so that you get a good picture now negative 1 comma 2 according to this new XY axis negative 1 comma 2 is right there it's right there yeah the real point 0 5 you know what if you plugged in 0 we turn a little better than 5 let's plug in 0 1 minus 0 is 1 the square root of 1 is 1 2 times there's one plus three is five look at that we have it right if you plug in one we should be getting out 3 1 minus 1 0 square 0 0 times 2 is 0 plus 3 is 3 this is the proper graph but understanding how these transformations affect your original graph is crucial to a lot of things we do in graphing specialty calculus and trigonometry understand the picture I promise you you do not want to go plugging in lots of different values to a trigonometric function trying to graph it it's insane alright I'll plug in negative PI over 6 be my guest sine of negative PI over 6 is what that make it's very challenging to do that and plot a graph it's not challenging to get an output it's challenging to plot a graph with those outputs that can be very difficult so understanding that this after a function means you're adding or subtracting and that means that your vertical shifting up and down respectively and getting this organized so that your X is first and your X is positive and now understanding that minus ones means a shift to the right when I'm effecting an input that's a shape to a right if I want you to and that that negative ensign is affecting the sine of our input making it positive versus negative that's reflecting about the Y and then they get this 2 outsides multiply an output and stretching that or compress it in the previous exam so we have and negative will be reflected about the x-axis that's so important for what we're doing so our graph finalizing this says yep it's a square root but I reflected this way I'm still gonna graph my square root function that's about how that graph looks that's a at least a good sketch of it I hope that makes sense I hope it explained the nature of our transformations and put them together in such a way that you really understand what's going on it's a big deal we really need to know what causes a graph to shift up and down we need to understand that that's affecting the output and that would be after the function is kind of done and after parentheses square roots all this stuff we need to understand how the how to shift left and right horizontally that that's affecting the input but then adding to the input is a shift left and sorry that left and and from input as shift to the right we need to get that it has to be in order with your next positive to figure that out you can factor negative we do understand that reflecting about the x-axis is right I change the sign of my output value the outside the function we don't have one here from the previous two examples that was what happened we didn't understand that outside the function when I multiply it is stretching or compressing because it's multiplying out the Y value we understand that reflected about the y axis is affecting the side of the the input so those things have to kind of be there we need to list our transformations I hope I've explained in such a way that you know how to do that now so we're done with crafting for kind of before plow until we start talking about quadratics in just a little bit so I hope that um you enjoyed the video I hope it made sense I hope to see you for the next one you 

Transcript for: Introduction to Solving Quadratics (Precalculus - College Algebra 16)
hi welcome to another video so in this video which is going to be very brief we're going to talk about what it is you are doing when we are solving quadratic equations a lot of times in my experience teaching for a long time students will get here and they will know sort of how to factor and they'll know sort of what the square root method is and they'll kind of know how to complete the square and they will be able to do the quadratic formula but they lose track of what it is that we are finding so I'm going to talk about that very briefly what we're doing what a quadratic is what you're doing how to solve the x-intercepts or the roots of the zeros the four methods that we talked about that will introduce that and then we go in some more videos on how to actually accomplish those things so what a quadratic function is is something with a power to a polynomial where the largest power is to or the degree is 2 it looks like that in general now what these all make we know this is some sort of a parabola it is positive it opens upward if a is negative it opens downward tells us kind of the stretch of compression also when you find - it's very easily but in general all of these things are parabolas now if we want to find out where this parabola crosses the x-axis if it does cross the x-axis or where any function like ever crosses the x-axis what we do is we set that function equal to zero why why would we do this to find out where we cross the x-axis well if f of X represents the height of our function and we say I want to find out all the x-values notice the X is not something that the X isn't something we have is something with looking for says find the x when the height is zero okay when my height is zero find me the X that gives me a height of zero notice if the height of zero is the height of our x axis which it is says the height of zero is on this axis and we're looking for X's that give us that height we are going to find x-values where our function is on the x axis those are called x-intercepts those are called zeros those are sometimes called roots of the function that is what we are doing so in order to find out our x-intercepts routes are reserved or zeros we set our function equal to zero because we're the height zero we are going to be on the x-axis and those X values will be where that function crosses the x axis that's what we're looking for now what we do specifically in quadratics so I'll write if I'm going to set my function equal to zero I'm gonna replace f of X with zero it's going to look extremely familiar we just get our function equal to zero and that's something we've been dealing with for a long time like most of like an intermediate algebra class it deals with stuff like that why because it's so important the problem is is that sometimes we learn techniques without understanding what we are doing so if you if you look at this you recognize that you go yeah I would I would probably use one of four things to solve that yeah exactly what would you use well we would use the square root method if possible if we can isolate the power to without any other X's floating around everything's inside of a power to we can take a square root of both sides that's the square root method we've done that before or if you say all right well I can't do that maybe I try factoring why would we factor because it solves this for you it factors this you can use zero product property we can factor okay what if that didn't work well I can try completing the square it is valuable we're going to talk about that I'm gonna make it very easy for you generally we don't use it a whole lot in solving quadratics because we go right to the quadratic formula can I use the quadratic formula here absolutely and so those four things I need to understand that when you're doing that when you are using the square root method when you are factoring and setting equal to zero when you are completing the square it's solving for x when you were doing the quadratic formula and finding x minus negative b plus or minus radical whatever the quadratic formula you're doing the same exact thing what we're doing is we're finding out where this function has a height of zero which will be on the x axis which would give us x intercepts so doing this no matter what technique you are doing you are finding x-intercepts or zeros or roots as they're sometimes called that's what you're doing so why do we have four techniques well because some are easy but they don't work all the time some work all the time but they're kind of difficult we using the sort of last resorts so that's what we're doing that's why we're studying the next four videos four or five videos about how to solve these things so what's the look of it what can we get out of it that's what we talk about first so number one idea what we're doing is we are finding x-intercepts when you're setting a function equal to zero so all of the techniques were about to unpack everything you know about it what you've probably seen is finding that they're finding zeros now what can what can we actually get it if we know that a quadratic gives us a parabola there's really only three cases that we can we can find it as far as it's x-intercepts are concerned we can have the first case which is very common where a proactive parabola crosses the x axis two times in this case we would have two x-intercepts can a parabola cross the x axis more than two times no no no that's impossible because this goes on forever and ever and ever in the upward-opening direction could you have it backwards well upside down and have sort of a an upside-down opening probably yes and and I need you to understand that but really I'm just going to give you the upward-opening cases here keep in mind if we reflect this then you would still have two x-intercepts no problem so this is the maximum number of x-intercepts that we can get or zeroes that are real zeroes that we can get so number one this is sort of what we get a lot of times in in factory because we don't have we don't have this case where we have imaginary numbers we have real x-intercepts this we have two solutions no matter what technique you use there are two real solutions and there are two real x-intercepts now could you have less than two x-intercepts yes but my stadia that you can't ever have less than two solutions now one we're gonna it's gonna be kind of tricky this next I want to talk about you know well there's only one solution yeah but you get it twice it's called the double root what can happen is this this parabola can touch something some textbooks a touch some say balance some say now there's usually two ones so if I if I think about this parabola getting moved up another enough what's going to happen to our x-intercepts is as this parabola moves up they're going to get closer and closer to closer until the vertex is sitting right on the x-axis this is kind of a special case of parabolas where we don't really get two different solutions we get the same solution twice and that's called that's called a double root and we'll talk about that in our techniques as we go through like how the square root method can give you well yeah how can give you the same number twice or how a factory gave you the same number twice or how a quadratic formula can be the same thing so in this case we only get one unique solution sometimes we can get it twice it shows up in our techniques but this is the only case we get one solution there would be one x-intercept 1:01 root so that's this that's the same case we can we can cross it across once we're going to cross twice we can balance or touch in that case we don't cross it we just our vertex it's right on the x-axis it is still an x-intercept but there's only one of them the last case what if you move this to the Spratly just a little higher is it gonna cross the x-axis at all the answer of course no the parabola would completely miss it and if it's upside-down it would miss it below in this case what's going to happen is that when you're solving on any of our techniques you are not going to get real so as you roll up why aren't they real they would have Eisen they'd have an imaginary component to it so it would be this imaginary number as part of our solution or a complex solution and that's exactly what we get here we will still get two solutions but they're not going to be real solutions they're going to be imaginary solutions signifying that you're not going to have an x-intercept so if you're ever working through these techniques and you get to real numbers that means there's no eyes in you or even found you know that that parabola is going to cross the x-axis since these are all parabolas that we're talking about in quadratics you would know that by not obtaining any eye any complex part of this complex solution you're going to cross the x-axis two times if we get one solution no I were balancing right off the x-axis that would be one x-intercept one real solution if we get no real numbers so that would be two conflicts and they always come in pairs if you get one you automatically get two complex conjugates we'll talk about that much later but if you get no real solutions if you get two complex solutions we know that that parabola is missing the x axis either both above or below and so it says that that would have two solutions yeah but they're complex and there would be no x-intercepts so that's that sort of ability needs to know just a little recap here what we're doing is we're saying these things are all parabolas and we're going to solve them what's solving means solving means that we're going to be finding x-intercepts zeros roots we're finding basically where this parabola has a height of zero that means where the parabola crosses the x-axis bounces out the x axis that means set your function equal to that height and solve for x solve for the X's that give me a height of zero that's going to give me the X values where the parabola crosses or any function in general crosses or touches the x axis we can have only three cases we have one where we cross it twice either upward opening or downward that's going to be two solutions two real solutions to x-intercepts you will have no lies here nothing imaginary we could have one real solution you generally get the same number twice what that means is that our x-intercepts yeah there's two of them but they're the same point what's that mean that means that we're bouncing off the x axis that would be one real solution there will be no eyes no complex number here but only one x-intercept you're bouncing the vertex will be on your x axis doing this if you see this you will have found your vertex it's an important point for us to know last one if we get complex solutions out of a quadratic there will be two of them they will have eyes in them and what that means is that you will not be crossing or touching or anyway interacting with that x axis on your on your parabola so why this is important it's because we're not going to be graphing all of our parabolas we will grab some of them but we want to know even without graphing them whether we cross twice touch once or whether we miss it completely and that comes down to our solutions having two real one real or two complex I hope that makes sense that's what you're doing with all of the next techniques in the next like four to five to six videos that we're going to be we're gonna be talking about so we're gonna start the next video we'll talk about the the square root method and we'll go there you 

Transcript for: The Square Root Method in Solving Quadratics (Precalculus - College Algebra 17)
hey welcome to another video in this video we're gonna start learning about the techniques that we generally use of solve quadratics and there's four of them and last video I introduced that I said we're going to be talking about four techniques coming up I'm gonna teach these to you in the order in which you should look for them so I'm going to teach you them and the the easiest to the I don't say most difficult but the ones that involve a little bit more work guess that means more difficult so we're going to talk about the square root method first then we'll talk about factoring then we'll talk about completing the square and we use that to transition into the quadratic formula so when we're doing this remember what we're doing we're gonna all have quadratics and they're all gonna be parabolas and we're basically looking to see if these are going to cross the x-axis and if they do where and if they don't do they balance do they touch or do they completely miss it and have imaginary numbers so that's what we're discussing we're gonna talk about the square root method first why it works so nicely lights the first one that you check so what the square root method asks is can I find the x-intercepts are the zeros or the roots of my quadratic by taking a square root of both sides so the screw method does basically two things it sets the function equal to zero and it says can i isolate in power too with having without having any X's anywhere else in the function if I can do that then we can take a square root of both sides the biggest thing that I can possibly tell you here is that number one we need to be able to I guess it's two Biggie's things number one meeting about people we need to be able to identify when we can do the square root method and when we can't number two and I swear this is the biggest thing when you take a square root on your paper it wasn't there before and you're the one who put it on there with very few exceptions you have to have a plus and minus right for that square root that's important because what that does and we learned last video is that these are going to generally have two solutions are you going to see that on that one that we're only gonna get one solution out of but we're gonna get the same solution twice in order to get that you have to have a plus a minus in front of that square root I promise you it's the biggest mistake that I see students make especially like an intermediate algebra class and I know this is precalculus but the same mistakes still happen so let's get let's dive right into it let's see what the square root method is when it works and and how did how to do it so number one hey do we have a parabola yeah and in fact that's an upward-opening problem all of these are going to be it's not a big deal if we don't have upward-opening that work the same way but what we do every single time we want to find zeros or solve a quadratic or find out where across the x axis is we set our function equal to zero so we're gonna do that we're gonna stay let's make x squared minus 18 equal to zero now when we go ahead and we solve this go well how would we do it that is the kind of the nature of deciding what technique to use so here's a thought process I really want to build in your head in order to do these the most efficiently way possible so when we look at this we go well will a square root method or will the square root work the answer that question lies in can you get something all wrapped up in parenthesis or just an X or something with a power two on one side that contains all of your X's and a constant on the other side if we can do that taking a square root will work if not then we have to have another technique typically we would try factoring second then we go probably to the quadratic formula I'll show you completing the square but pretty much as a way to get to quadratic formula so we look at it I got x squared minus 18 equals zero y equals zero because I'm trying to figure out where this function has a height of 0 and therefore if or where it cross the x-axis that's given us our zeros well I've done that now the second thing I ask in my head is can I get a power to by itself I see an X to the power 2 I see that that I can isolate this if I add 18 on both sides that would get everything on one side having a power 2 I'll wrap up in that exponent and then a constant other this is what we're looking for we're looking to get some power to with all of your X's inside and a constant on the other side that's important that's the nature of the Scruton that works then you're good to go screwed man that's gonna work you take a square root on both sides why well anytime you have a power to we know that to undo a power to the inverse of that is a square root we've just got to do it on both sides and you go sweet I'm God no no this is gonna make you teacher cry it's make this me literally made me cry not really made me cry but like my heart breaks a little more whenever we do this we need to understand what square roots do square roots when we square a number it takes negatives and it makes them positive and it takes positive it keeps them positive because of that because these these power twos have the ability both 3 and negative 3 and make them both positive 9 or any two numbers that are opposites and make them the same numbers output we need to acknowledge that by saying you know what whether I have a positive square root of 18 or a negative square root of 18 if I square positive square root of 18 it's gonna give me 18 if I square negative square root of 18 it's going to give me 18 but both of those values satisfy this this x squared equals 18 I can plug in I can plug in square root of 18 here square of 18 squared is 18 18 minus 18 0 I can plug in negative squared of 18 here and it's kind of weird to think about but the square root the negative square root of 18 squared well squaring and negative gives me a positive square root 18 square root of 18 gives me 18 if I plug in the negative square root of 18 squared I'm gonna get 18 18 minus 18 is 0 it says both of these and there are two both of those solutions are valid for this that's why we have to put both the plus and minus it gives us the two solutions that we know we're going to get for quadratics in general whatever that highest power is whatever your degree is that's how many solutions you're in general gonna get for a polynomial weird so for here we know we're going to get two solutions we have to have the plus and minus to show is that so what happens well let's see the square root of x squared gives us X on the right hand side we do need to still know how to simplify some square we need to be able to take a submarine you know what square root of 18 I could write that as 9 times 2 I know the square root of 9 gives us 3 the square root of 2 says I can't you know what I can't really simplify that anymore that's a prime number I can't make make it a power 2 to simplify the power of the root I know that I would get plus or minus 3 square root 2 now for my students I have them write this out every single time so that they don't think that this is just one solution what I have them do this is okay now I need you to write this as x equals 3 square root 2 and another solution x equals negative 3 square root 2 this is the fundamental idea of the square root method you're saying you know what I still want to find x-intercepts I'm still going to set this equal to 0 but then we look at what the best technique is are there other ways to do it yeah there are is this the easiest probably for me it's the easiest for a lot of students as easiest especially when I start getting some of these things the screwed math is extremely nice when we can use it again the fundamental problem the fundamental idea for having the screwed method is can I get a power two on one side that contains all of my X's like this next word and a constant on the other side if I can do that take a square root on both sides put a plus and minus around your constant so square root of your constant put a plus a minus there you don't need on both sides because it's redundant if we forget we don't need that so take a square root of both sides and put a plus or minus in front of your square root of constant simplify your square root and then you're gonna have to sum most of the time you're going to have two solutions well it let's look at that what are those solutions this should tell you something does this say that we cross the x-axis twice does it say that we balance off the x-axis once does it say that we missed the x-axis and here's how did it how to determine that in the last video we talked about the only three cases we can have where we cross we balance the vertex bounces or touches the x-axis or we completely miss it how to determine that if you have two distinct solutions like these these are different numbers here they are numbers you can plug them into your calculator it's going to some sort of a decimal on your x-axis where this parabola actually crosses so if you have two distinct numbers usually a pop well I can't say usually a positive negative they can both be positive and both be negative but two distinct numbers that do not have eyes in them then you are going to cross the x axis twice and this is giving you two zeros or two real x-intercepts that's what it's talking that's what it's talking about if we get one real solution so no lies but you get basically the same number twice they're not distinct that means that you're bouncing you're touching you're bouncing the vertex right of that x axis and if you get eyes anywhoo hair in these problems any sort of an imaginary number any sort of a complex number that means that you're missing the x axis so right here we look at this we got right hey I have a I'm going to solve for zero as said this equals zero I must find my x-intercepts I'm doing that I'm saying the square root method works great because they get isolated power tooth on the X isn't a constant on the other side I'm taking the square root of acknowledging I must have a plus some is a big deal and then I'm simplified as much as possible and then say yes these are two numbers they're different numbers and they don't have ice in them that means that we have two real zeros two x-intercepts let's let's do a few more we're going to run through these fairly quickly the ideas that I'm looking for are that you understand number one that we're setting a function equal to zero to find x-intercepts number two whether we use this technique or any other technique for solving quadratics we're getting the same thing we're finding those zeros number three when you man when you set this equal to zero you need to understand when the the square root method works and then how to do it so when it works is when I can get a power to by itself constantly side how or just taking a square root of both sides and you put any plus and minus and turn the square root of your constant so let's set this equal to zero and we're saying alright that's going to let us find any x-intercepts by setting the height of the function equal to zero now we think can I get the this something this power to by itself on one side and a constant on the other side if I can do that so without any other exits floating around if I can do that well then I can take a square root of both sides but what I say that means is that there's no addition buddies no multiplication buddies no nothing just something to the second power so when we solve this figure all right let's let's add 33 I'm noticing that I just have an x squared I'm gonna be able to get that by itself but man you really have to get it by itself this is not good enough I see a lot of students go on Janice yeah I can take a square root I'm gonna get it here and then take a square root please don't do that it's making a tremendous amount of work and it's not right because if we take a square root around 3 x squared the square root of 3 is very hard to deal with so instead of doing that what we're gonna do we're gonna divide by 3 we're gonna get that second power there's something to the second power that X and same power or or parenthesis to the second power get that isolated so let's divide by 3 so dividing both sides by 3 we get this x squared equals a lemon this is what we mean by isolating a a power 2 we mean that I have all of my X's inside something being squared yeah there's only one X so that is ice and empowered to you and have a constant on the other side no other X's anywhere to be found this is perfect this says our square root methods gonna work so when we do that we take a square root of both sides and we think you know what in taking and taking a square root and solving for x we're understanding that a power to takes is both a positive and a negative solution that makes them positive so in understanding that we're saying you know what the square root of 11 is a solution here but the negative square root of 11 is also a solution because if I take square root of 11 and square it would give me 11 so until you hear and say hey square root of 11 squared is 11 or the negative square root of 11 squared it's also lemon so to understand that that that means that we're understanding why we're putting the plus and minus y all right I'm gonna put this here because both the positive and negative version the opposites of this solution well they would both satisfy this equation so how are two in a square root those are inverse on the right hand side we can't simplify the square root of live and there's nothing to do with this what we are gonna write it as the positive square root of 11 and the negative square root of 11 and now I want you to think in your head are these two real x-intercepts are we going to cross the x-axis twice are we going to balance off the x-axis with the vertex or are we missing it well are there any eyes no are these unique yes so they're not the same answer twice this means that this problem which is upward-opening positive it's going to cross the x-axis two times at exactly the square root of 11 and a negative square root of 11 these are called exact solutions so when you don't approximate you don't plug in the square root of 11 and you calculate or find a decimal that's what they mean by giving me an exact solution this is exact no exact us sometimes does it make sense he's like well I don't know what that is exactly no one does no one does because you don't know what the square root of 11 is forever because it goes forever without repeating it's not a fractions it's not rational so when we say accept we wrap it up in a form that contains all the information like the square root of 11 it says okay this is what the number is an approximation would be where you put in your calculator you go okay this is like three points something that's an approximation so when they ask you for approximation yet put in your calculator if not these are exact solutions and this is exactly where this parabola that's upper opening would cross two times the x axis that's what we're doing okay moving on we have four more to do these two are special cases that I need to show you so really there's just these two they need to make sure that you completely understand and then we're we're practically done we'll talk about those ones you kind of need I want to show you the other other cases because these are all real solution up to this point so we have a function G of x equals x plus 2 squared minus 1 you know what one of the the first things that people really want to do here is distribute because yeah let's just let's let's foil that all out or whatever you want to do that might not be the best thing when we go through solving quadratics the first thing I need to understand is that solving means setting equal to 0 to find x-intercepts roots or zeros so solving says I'm going to take my function I'm going to say fine the x value or values where my height is 0 this is inherently spying out where we cross the x-axis now categorize this can you and go through the steps can you solve this by using the square root method if the answer is yes then you should do it if the answer is no then we try to factor it then if you can't do that then we try to do quadratic formula which always works but it's a little bit more tedious so we think can we do the easiest things first that's why there's 4 techniques because some are easier but don't work all the time some work all the time but there's more tedious so we look at this and go right on find out where the height is zero and find out where this crosses the x-axis bounces or if it misses how to solve this well we're thinking about it going can i isolate a power to so that all my X's are within that power to make it just like here just like here can i isolate this so that all my X's are within the power two and have a constant without X's on the other side yes yeah I can if I add one to both sides X plus two squared equals one this is isolated a power to that contains all of my X's there's no other X's being added subtracted multiplied dividing no X's over here next to that constant was once constant this is when the square root method shines because it's a to stand land like a three step process we do this we go right now that I've isolated the power to know if it is building around I can take a square root because I know what we can do basically whatever you want in equations as long as we do it to both sides so we say how planned route I do a power to take a square root just do it to both sides and recognize that anytime you put a square root on your paper you have to do a plus or minus in front of the square root of your constant this is saying that when I plug this number in I would get a positive and I would get a negative but squaring that is going to give me that positive one no matter what so this is this is why we do that on the left hand side hey the square root of a squared those are inverses you basically just compose them and it cancels out so that's X plus 2 equals plus or minus the square root of simplify the square roots so the square root of one is one so we have plus or minus one let's get a little confusing for students what how the world do you solve this we're gonna solve for X and we're gonna solve for x by subtracting two but it's important where we subtract that to where we subtract it to should not be like this we shouldn't subtract two here and subtract two from the one why well because that stands for two different numbers that stands for positive 1 and negative 1 and if I subtract 2 from it one of those would be right and one of them will be wrong so here's what I would like you to do this kind of trains you a little bit for the next few problems instead of writing this out as what you could do that this is perfectly acceptable instead of writing this out as X plus 2 equals positive 1 and X plus 2 equals negative 1 you can certainly do that you can solve each one independently and it will give you the correct solution that's a fine way to do it what I'm gonna try to get you to do is to do this say alright if I subtract 2 maybe put it in front of that plus and minus so we get x equals negative 2 plus or minus 1 and the reason why is because that looks a little bit more like what we're going to get on quadratic formula that looks a little bit more like we're gonna get when we complete the square it's gonna kind of flow through this and looks a little bit more like what we're going to get right here so the reason why so that you can start to to train your mind that this is two solutions how do we get both solutions well if we go and take our constant negative 2 and we add 1 so kind of a highroad negative 2 plus 1 and then take the low road negative 2 minus 1 that's going to yield both of those solutions for us so let's look at a man that's now we can understand this this is negative 1 and this is negative 3 so negative 2 plus 1 is negative 1 maybe 2 minus 1 is negative 3 in your head right now you should be thinking this is a parabola shirts have a power to is it upward opening yeah in fact this is a shift look at this the zip shook down 1 this making sense that is ship left - so down down one left - this should be upward-opening it should have two exhibitions down one left - wait a minute those Exeter ships are probably negative how they are this is exactly where this parabola crosses the x-axis how do we know that crosses doesn't balance we know it doesn't balance because these are different numbers we know it crosses because they're not imaginary numbers so this is two x-intercepts where this parabola that's upward opening crosses the x axis you know what we can plug it and see they both work so we plug in negative 1 negative 1 plus 2 is 1 1 squared is 1 1 minus 1 is 0 oh yeah ok if I plug this and I get a height of 0 that means it's on the acceptance plug in negative 3 negative 3 plus 2 is negative 1 wait that's the same number we just got but it's as up as a sign those are opposites but negative 1 squared is positive 1 and 1 minus 1 is 0 this is the reason why you must have that plus and minus that plus or minus gives you the ability to say okay one of our solutions is positive but square its Square to keep it positive one of our solutions when we plug in some numbers here this would be negative but the squares gonna make it positive that's why we need that plus a minus to maintain that idea I hope this making sense I hope you're seeing that we have three examples where we are actually crossing the x-axis because we don't have imaginary numbers and we have two distinct numbers let's try the last one before we get in some special cases same thing I'm going to walk through it fairly quickly we go all right this is a quadratic how do we know if you were to distribute it you'd have an X to the second power that is a quadratic I want to find X intercepts the first thing we do whenever we want to find x-intercepts is set your function equal to zero no matter what function you have and now we categorize it so we've said quadratic sure I'm thinking in my head what I should be getting I'm thinking I should either cross twice bounce once or miss completely then I'm saying how do I find those those values well I said it the function equals ur I've done that now in my head I'm thinking parabola I'm thinking okay now what technique do I use do I jump directly to quadratic form you know that's a tremendous amount work we had to distribute combine my terms find a B and C put it in a formula and the head go through it that's that's not super fun is there an easier way yes so we start with the easiest way and see if that'll work the easiest technique we have is a square root method can we solve this or can we isolate my guess is a better word a power to with a constant on the other side so something that has all of our X's in iteration of the second power and a constant their side answers yeah this already has a power to and that's a constant there's no other X's that are outside of that parenthesis outside of that thing that's being raised to the second power that's what we're looking for something that contains your X's raised to the second power so if we had if we have that we can isolate the power to then we do it one thing I want to mention right now just just glanced at it for a second what if we would have had something like a 4 out here and a 4 out here before you take a square root you would have to divide by 4 please see that please see that when we talk about taking the square root just like right here it's why I gave it to you just like right here before you take a square root you actually have to have the thing raised to the second power completely isolated nothing around it at all be multiplied added or subtracted or divided so if we had the four yeah we say yeah I can still ask the power too but it's a two-step process add 32 here you'd be dividing by 4 you would not take a square root right now now okay all right because now that we have the square oscillating if we take a square root on both sides and we think every time I take a square root I'm gonna do a plus and minus y because squares maintain positivity for both negative and positive values that's what that's why I'm doing that on the left-hand side Tower matches the root working at 2x plus 3 on the right hand side we're gonna simplify the square root of 32 as much as possible 32 is 16 times 2 so we can take the square that notice I'm picking the it's number I can take the square root of not smallest so I'm not thinking for eight because if I did four and eight I'd have to do this process twice once with 32 and then we'd have a sort of eight do it again so I'm thinking what's the biggest perfect square that I can simplify out of this and be sixteen square root of 16 is 4 the square root of 2 is I don't know let's leave so we have looked this we've said I'm going to set equal zero then we've categorized it we thought I can isolate the power to square method work is just fine I'm gonna fully isolate this if I would have numbers in front I'd still divide them I have 32 I'm gonna take a square root I understand that anytime I take a square root I'm adding that plus and minus there I'm simplifying the radical that we did and then we continue to solve for X and doing that we're gonna use what I taught you up here we're gonna say where would I subtract the 3 well because I trained you right here we're not gonna try to subtract the 3 from us from a radical it doesn't work this has a square root 2 this doesn't they're not like radicals that we learn about and like an intermediate algebra class we can't subtract those things so where we put the minus 3 is in front of that plus and minus that's why I showed you this so we've understand how to how do I organize a problem here so when we subtract the 3 we have 2 x equals negative 3 plus or minus 4 square root 2 so we're just solving for x if this had been any other number we'd be subtracting 3 do the same thing just know where to put it we put it in front of that plus and minus lastly we know that we're gonna divide by 2 we do this for any type of problem solving for x where you have 2x is part of it we divide by 2 do the same thing we need to find the whole entire expression by 2 so our X dividing both sides by 2 would equal negative 3 plus or minus 4 square root 2 and then all divided by 2 I need to make a couple notes you should be making a couple of notes here that number one things need to be simplified so that means our square root needs to be simplified this expression would need to be simplified if possible I want to man you gotta pay attention this please don't miss this there's things you can do and things you can't do when simplifying what you can't do don't simplify little pieces of this fraction you cannot simplify the fourth of two it's impossible yeah if this had been like a number like six you can't simplify just the six of the two that's impossible what you can do if it's possible to factor or if these have a common factor of in your in these two terms and if that simplifies with the two what you can do bear with me here for a second if this had been a number like six I know it's not they just bear with me if they have been a number like six this is something you must simplify so we'd say how would you do that there's kind of an easy way that doesn't really show you what's going on now I'm going to talk about that one so what most people do and then I'll talk about why it is that that works what most people do is they go right divide each of these three numbers not that one divide each of these three numbers by two and that actually works so you all right 6 divided by 2 is 3 4 divided by 2 is 2 2 divided by 2 is 1 and you can simplify like that why that works is because if you would have something that has a common factor you could factor it out so if we factor out the 2 from negative 6 and for factoring out the 2 and give you let's see negative 6 divided by 2 is negative 3 4 divided by 2 is 2 and we'd have this 2 on the denominator then you can simplify that away that's why it works it's a factoring idea we know how to simplify fractions it's a factoring idea that works the same if you just divide all three of these numbers by the same number so that doesn't work be careful with that what what I see is students make mistakes and it'll justify two numbers you cannot do that that's it that's another the last thing I need to mention to you before you know special cases is that that I would really like it if you would make sure you understand that these are two solutions so I'm gonna have you write it like that I'm going to understand that this means negative three plus four root two over two that's one solution and x equals negative three minus 4 root 2 over 2 that's another solution why do we have two of them because we didn't forget our plus and minus now last thing the very last thing what do those mean to you is that a parabola yes is this crossing the x-axis twice is it bouncing once or is it completely missing it don't let weird looking answers give you the wrong impression of what's going on so here's how to think through it are those different answers yes so we know that we're not bouncing get that we know we're not bouncing because we need to get the same answer twice we have negative three plus and a three minus two different numbers so that means that we have two different solutions so it's not bouncing we know we're not in that vertex on the x axis idea do we have any imaginary numbers do we have any eyes up here no so even though they look weird these are two real solutions this is exactly these are exact solutions exactly where this parabola will cross the x axis these are x-intercepts the real solution they don't have eyes and they're not imaginary there's not just one of them they didn't happen the same same value twice we have two distinct solutions and they are exact they look really weird because we don't we couldn't go right now most of us can't go right now I can't do it and go oh that's that's that's here on x-axis I need a calculator now we need to plug this in and do negative 3 plus 4 squared or 2 and then divide that by 2 but think about it would it give you a decimal would it give you some number with decimals in it that you could go to the x-axis and plot yes because it doesn't have eyes what that means is that this really is a real solution this is giving you two spots on the x-axis where this parabola will be crossing it that's what I need you to know now let's move on to the next next couple examples so I told you a couple times that what we're looking is really three cases would we cross twice where we bounce once and where we completely miss we've done a lot of cross twice that happens a lot this is going to be a a bounce this is gonna be able touch at one time and then show you why in the in the form of this why that happens and this is going to be a we completely mess so I'm not going to hold you in suspense that's what's going to happen let's see why that happens and why it is that the the plus and minus doesn't always yield two distinct solutions so let's take a look at this f of X equals X minus 7 squared man is it a parabola yeah and if we distributed that we would see that that would have an x squared in it is it upward-opening yeah that that's positive is it shifted yes in fact if you really think about this this is not shifted up or down this is shifted to the right 7 units and suffered opening weight if we had a parabola whose vertex naturally is at 0 0 and we just shift it to the right 7 units isn't that vertex still gonna be on the x-axis yeah is it gonna cross the x-axis oh this is gonna miss it no it's sitting on it it's bouncing off of it that means you have one real solution one real because it does touch it solutions of imaginary and that's gonna that's gonna bear out in this this technique so let's let's set this equal to zero that's how we find x-intercepts from every single quadratic ever we set it equal to zero and then we acknowledge what technique is best well the guns to go right what's the first technique you try let's try to do square root method square method says if I can get everything on one side all my X's inside of a power to that and I can get a constant other side like that then I can take a square root so this is isolated all right this is fantastic and if I take a square root of both sides I've isolated a power to this is all my X's within a power to nothing multiplied nothing that is subtracted a constant over here and I'm taking square root of both sides and then we know that every time you're the one who takes a square root you put it close to minus on the left-hand side we get X minus seven on the right hand side we get something that I need you to see we get plus or minus zero and I know that's weird you go wait a minute not just zero yes see this is the zero is the only number that you can add and subtract from a number from another number and get the same answer it's the it's this this additive identity right so so you add it and it doesn't it doesn't change the yeah it doesn't change what you get so this is the zero is the only number in the world that we can add and subtract from a different number and get the same number in both cases so if we do this it's gonna look a little weird you probably wouldn't do this you probably just say okay this is zero great add seven you're done but I want you to notice what happens X would equal if I add seven where would I add it to I add it before the plus and minus just like here just like here I'd say okay this is 7 plus or minus zero now I'm gonna do this on purpose so that you see we're getting the same answer twice we still get two solutions we get the same solution if I took this and I said all right well this is a seven plus zero just like we did two negative two plus 1 and 7 minus zero just like we did make it 2-1 over here we get two solutions look at it we do have to write the plus and the minus zero gives us two solutions but we're getting the same solution twice seven plus a 0 is 7 7 minus 0 is 7 is because 0 is the only number you can add and subtract from a different number do the same thing out we get the same solution twice that is what happens what so when you get this this vertex on the x-axis that's what's gonna happen you're gonna get the same answer twice it's called a double root we'll talk about multiplicity much later but you're basically doing the same thing out at two different times this is the second this is the second a lot of times we get to different two different solutions and saying we get to distinct or different x-intercepts and we say okay we must be crossing there we have to be crossing once and then coming back if we get two solutions but they're the same solution what that's telling you just like I showed you with the shifting is that you have the same solution twice you're not crossing the x-axis your vertex is bouncing right off of it this we would say is one real solution technically yet you get two solutions but they're the same so it's really just one real solution there's no imaginary numbers here that's it now I'll make you a promise if you just get one solution from a quadratic it cannot be imaginary imaginary numbers always come in pairs you're gonna see that in just a little bit they always come in pairs so we can't ever get one imaginary solution they always come in conjugate pairs positive and negative of the imaginary part so we've had cases where they're all parabolas but we have two real x-intercepts we've had the one I showed that to you now because plus and minus square root of zero just gives you a plus and minus zero which gives you the same number twice and lastly let's look at what happens when we get some imaginary numbers so we have a spur a below it is a power too if I were to distribute that we would get this this quadratic but it's set up pretty nice for us so when we solve for X intercepts are four zeros and we set this equal to zero and the categorises and say you know what I'm able to isolate this power to so that all my X's are inside of a power tube and have a constant of this side I can subtract so it'd be fun to do that that's core movement that's gonna work nicely for us you know that doesn't look very nice because when we take a square root so we looked at it said set equals zero we said what's the best technique square root method because we can isolate the power tune with all their X's inside of it no X's anywhere else else outside of it I think added multiplied divided and a consonant on the right hand side and we take a square root the problem is you see it when we take a square root we have a square root with any negative number inside of it that's not possible well yeah it is it's not real it's not a real solution but but it is possible under imaginary solutions or complex numbers we still do like every time that plus or minus on the left hand side we're gonna get this 3x minus 2 on the right hand side we get let's think about it do we still have two solutions plus and minuses yes do we still have real solutions that negative says no and right now if you're if you're doing this and says tell me how many real solutions you get you go to zero you're done you're done if you start taking square roots of negative numbers you're getting imaginaries so you're saying I am NOT gonna have x-intercepts here realizes people that if you have no imaginary numbers yes you're crossing the x-axis twice if you have the same solution two different times two times they have no imaginary numbers you're bouncing right off the x-axis if you at any point get a negative inside of your square root you're gonna get a negative number and you are done as far as finding real solutions this does not have real solutions therefore if you're doing this you know this is not touching or crossing the x-axis at all this is going to be floating above how to know above well that's up early there's no negative in front of that so this is an upward-opening parabola that's completely missing the x axis now we have a clear picture that's what I want to teach you is to understand what you look what you are doing let's just do it anybody can do this but understanding it means that you've learned it so when we're learning this we're going this right here that's gonna give me an I know we're about that we're about to solve it but what we get is that that's a parabola it's upper opening and it's missing the x axis completely that's what this measuring stand tell us so when we simplify we know that we could write this as negative 1 times 25 times 3 and I'm pulling out that negative 1 because that negative 1 is what gives us the eye the square root of negative 1 is I the square root of 25 is 5 and the square root of 3 is let's leave that because it's an irrational number so we have plus or minus 5i square root of 3 and we see it right there that these are not real solutions this is saying okay where do we cross the x-axis you don't because that I says you can't plop that on a normal number line you know you don't cross it you don't touch it you completely miss it when we solve this for X do it the same way that I've been teaching here let's add two but put it in front of the plus or minus and then divide the whole thing by three so I'm gonna do that at one step X would equal if we add 2 we get 2 plus or minus 5i screw 3 if we divide by 3 we get that all over 3 now I would like to write this as two different solutions I want to say just a couple things about it number one do you still get two solutions yes and we talked about how with with I said this is a while ago when you have when you have a complex solution there will always be two of them there would never just be one of them why that is complex solutions come from taking a square root of a negative that's right here whenever you take a square root of a negative don't you always have to have a plus and minus in front of it yes so if you ever get a complex solution it's going to have a plus and a minus in front of it that means they always come in these pairs there will always be two of them if you don't have a complex solution you couldn't have taken a square root of a negative number and therefore you could take square root of zero it doesn't have lines in it but if you take a square root of a negative number and you get an eye it's always have a plus or minus in front of it which always gives you two of them at a time and we're going to find out a little bit later that complex numbers always come in water all complex conjugates I said that word a couple times I didn't find it what a complex conjugant is is same number same number same complex parts and sorry an imaginary person any minute or it's just a different sign in between them that's what a complex conjugate looks like same stuff different sign why different sign because of the plus and minus because you take the plus and minus that's giving me this part when you add the two that's giving this part in those you're adding the two to both of them at the same time that's what's going on less less couple things remember one you abb's that we have to realize that this is two solutions they are complex solutions and therefore we will not be crossed an x axis those are not x-intercepts they're complex solutions complex zeros and lastly I've seen this written a couple different ways this technically is improper as far as writing complex solutions really we should have one plus five halves room 3i and one minus five-halves root three I so this whole a plus bi complex form we really should be maintaining that but I've seen a lot of people not do that for for complex issues like this so he kind of depends on who you learn this from for me this is fine if you need someone if your instructor makes you and thanks you to you this as I've done in the past you take 2 over 2 that's 1 you take 5 root 3 over 2 and you put an eye at the end you put the I at the end of that that's that's technically in complex form so that would be the real part plus in imaginary part I hope that makes sense I hope that I've explained to you what how the the screwed method works why it does what it does and what's your what you're getting from it you should be seeing the parabola you should be in your head visualizing upward-opening visualizing crossing twice balancing once and missed it completely based on the type of solution that we're getting so hopefully explain that very well next time we'll talk about this what will transition to factory you 

Transcript for: Using Factoring to Solve Quadratics (Precalculus - College Algebra 18)
hey there welcome to another video in this video we're gonna continue solving quadratics and we're gonna find some x-intercepts or we're gonna focus on the technique called Factory now emo might be like I know factoring you might there's a lot of different ways to factor I've seen many many good techniques I'm gonna give you the best technique that I've ever seen so I'm gonna show you exactly how I factor how I go through the process hopefully you can open your mind a little bit and say wow that that's pretty cool because I guarantee a lot of you haven't seen unless you watch some of my videos from Interview algebra what to do that happens is I see a lot of students make it to a precalculus level and they either forgotten factoring or just okay I'm gonna teach that to you or their technique is miss apply and let you start using shortcuts probably know what I'm talking about and it'll do it wrong there go oh yeah that works I'm suited every time and a shortcut they learn doesn't work every time I promise you I'm going to teach you a shortcut that will work every single time for factoring so the idea again what we're getting into is we have these things called quadratics they all make parabolas we're going to be finding the x-intercepts the zeroes the roots and seen seen how to do that one good technique for it so what I want to talk about is that this is a second technique you try so we're going to talk about how the square root method is going to work for none of these I'll kind of preface the next section and say how would you make the square root method work and then we'll talk about factoring and and why that would be a great technique for these so let's listen to the very first one number one man that's a quadratic and if we want to find the x-intercepts for any quadratic ever or any function ever we set it equal to zero so we're gonna take this and say I'm gonna have x squared plus 7x plus 6 equal to 0 we're going to solve that and in solving that we're gonna find out where the height of our function equals 0 we're gonna find the x values that make the height f of X 0 that means we're going to find out where we cross or touch the x-axis if we do so one thing I want to mention real quick before we move on with factoring you're not going to get imaginary so this technique will not give that to you you may need quadratic formula or completing the square to do that so for factoring it's going to show you if you cross twice or bounce the vertex off the x-axis one time if you can actually factor that's what that's going to give you secondly we're going to kind of juxtapose this with with the square method so we're looking this go what does the square method work and if it does great use it if not why not so let's take a look the square root method worked if we could isolate a power to where I had all of our X's instead of a power to no X's anywhere else and a constant other side can we do that here can we get that power to by itself yes we could subtract 6 and subtract 7x would it contain all of our X's no what do we have just a constant on the side no and for that reason the scrutiny that is not going to work on problems like any of these is because we don't have that power to kind of contained or containing all of our X's that's a problem if we start subtracting 7x well then we don't have all of our X's inside power to is there a way we could make the square root method work the answer is yes we could make it work by doing something called completing the square giving this something that you could make that factorable so saying how would I make that work you would do something called completing the square completing the square is the way you change something that's not factorable into something you can do the square root method on that that's what completing the square does completing the square also gives us a way to create in the quadratic formula so the big scheme of things what we're doing is we're finding x-intercepts of quadratics that are all parabolas upward opening and downward opening the easiest way is square root method that's if we can I send power to that has all our exes it's they can we try to factor you go all right listen let's do that third is we make the sort of method work by doing something called completing the square and third is what have we completed the square all the time in general ah that gives us the quadratic formula which is a very nice all the time working so so we look at every meal can we do the the skirt method no that screws divorce can we factor here's what factoring does factoring takes a polynomial and it breaks it up and do things that are multiplied together these things called factors there's a variety of ways to do it I'm going to give you my way so I'm going to show you the math behind it and then I'm going to show you the shortcut with it I'm not going to really show you the shortcut with these two I'm going to show you the shortcut here and then backwards map it and say here's why the short could you understand why it works so well so let's take a look at it one thing that we can do is we need to make well one thing we have to make sure we do is when we have a polynomial in general or or a quadratic specifically that on the left hand side an order factor appropriately we have to have everything in order so like x squared then our X term that are constant we have to have a zero on one side so that this thing called the zero product property works we'll talk about that in a minute and third we want to make sure that our first term is positive because it makes our factory easier because it makes some of our techniques even possible so let's let's check that we said equal to zero to find X intercepts got it we have this on one side and zero side got it we have all this in order perfect and our first term is positive fantastic this is how I want instead of a factoring next I'm going to give you a technique a guy called the diamond method I don't know why it looks like an X but it's a way it's just a graphic organizer for us to kind of kind of picture some numbers and what they have to be so what I want to do is I'm going to look at our middle term or B term if we think of this as ax squared plus BX plus C are a would be one our B would be seven and our C with these six what I want to do is I want to take my beam number it's a coefficient it's just a number it's always sine specific so in this case would be positive seven not negative seven I want to put that up here I'm gonna look at my a times my see the a here would be one let's see would be six I want to multiply those two things now you probably understand that that's not super important here because one time six is just six and just see but for these later ones we've been very important so I'm gonna take one times six I'm going to put a times C that product there now here's what we need to happen over for factory to work we need to find two numbers we're gonna put them here and here that add to B and then multiply to a times C add this top number multiply the last number it's kind of on you in order to figure those out I'm maybe a couple hints I'm going to be hints like hey if you're multiplying to a positive number so we're going to add to this one we're going to multiply these that one if you're multiplying to a positive number your signs have to be the same either both positive or both negative if you're multiplying to a negative number you'd have to have different signs one negative one positive that's got to happen so here since we're multiplying to a positive number we know that our signs are going to be the same both positive or negative since we're adding to a positive number they both have to be positive so you can't add two negatives and get it positive you multiply two negatives get a positive but these are both have to be positive numbers that narrows down our search the forest pretty well and so what we're gonna think of is what numbers multiply to 6 that will literally add to 7 on tell you this also if your signs are the same you are literally adding to that number if your signs are different this will be the difference between these two numbers we'll see that in just a minute so I'm thinking about this going alright I got 7 I got 6 that's 1 times 6 make sure you do that I'm thinking I have to have both same signs as I'm multiplying go positive both have to be positive because I'm adding to a positive something in what numbers multiply to 6 2 & 3 1 & 6 what pair of that actually adds a 7 1 & 6 it does not matter what order you put what matters they get them right double check it for you any further because if if these are wrong you're wasting your time so does one plus six add the 7 yeah this is multiplied to 6 yeah I guarantee if you can find those numbers this will be factorable and I guarantee you can't find those numbers either the problem is two too complicated probably not the case or it's not factored well we need a different technique so does factoring work all the time no is it really cool one doesn't work yeah and it can be very very fast so we found these numbers and here's what they do what this does for you it doesn't do the math for you you don't have you haven't organizers or help you think of these numbers what those numbers do notice how they add up to that number what they're going to do is they're gonna allow you to split that middle term from one term into two terms why would we want to do that well because we know something called factoring by grouping if you don't know that you need to check out factor by grouping it's an intermediate algebra and this is all review for us but I'm gonna show you great techniques because people tend to miss them what what that does what this idea since this adds to the middle term since this adds in 7x that means I can take the 7x instead of 7x I can write it as 1 X plus 6x well that's still 7x but it takes let's see three terms into four terms so that I can group them together so these numbers say instead of 7x writing with these two numbers writing as 1x plus eight X is 6x and notice that's still 7x but it's changed these three terms into four terms so that now I can group the first pair and group the second hair and it will factor so roofing we're saying disappear if you're unfamiliar with grouping if it's if it's been a while grouping takes a look at your first two terms and then says factor out a common factor greatest common factor which in this case is X and if we do that we would get X plus one it says look at your second two terms but before you factor anything goodness sakes drop down that plus sign or the minus I that's a minus and now factor your GCF or greatest common factor from your second two terms so 6x plus 6y gamma factor out six cool one thing that bears mentioning right now you're factoring like this using the diamond method or whatever X method what do you want to call it whatever method you use it's predicated on the fact that you would have done a few things now it bears repeating so please get it that you set your function equal to zero you have all of your stuff on one side but it's in order and your first term is positive and you have factored a greatest common factor from the beginning if you have this so really what I should have said is when you've done this and when you've done this look here in factor out a GCF that there is one now there wasn't one there these didn't have a common factor at all we're gonna see that this one does so I'm gonna tell you that when we get there but I want to make sure you get it now so we've set this equal to zero to find x-intercepts we have it organized on one side in order first for positive so that we can factor we've tried the square root method it didn't work we've looked at factor GCF there wasn't one then we say can we do this can we factor this trinomial by like an X method or dinah method yep we put our middle number our eight times syrupy our a times C we find out two numbers add to the middle one Y so that we can split Y so that if we have four terms we can factor by grouping so we've grouped the first two group the second two and if you found these two numbers I guarantee that this is gonna be the same you have now you have now created a GCF a greatest common factor of X plus one that's something that we can factor so when we factor this X plus one it creates this other factor for so when we factor Isis normally when we remove it by division just like we did here we said hey these both have an X put it out front these both have a six put it out front create some sort of a factor because these both have X plus one we're putting that out front we're creating some sort of second factor that only has X plus six in it so we factor by grouping X plus one whatever's left over goes in the second set of parenthesis another factor X plus six and we still have it equal to zero now some of you right now are thinking you just wasted a lot of time because can't you just do X plus 1 and X plus six and the answer is sometimes you can do that if your a is one you can do that if your a is one now I'm gonna ask this question why does that shortcut work and most of the people out there go no it just does my teacher told me that your teachers right if you're a is one if you're a is one this technique is fantastic you find a couple numbers and you go oh yeah all right I could just do X plus this number and X plus this number or if they're my negatives do X minus a number whatever the science is saying what you have and you go these create factors for you my question is why do they do that why part of it has to do with the grouping I mean I showed you this this is the math behind if it says set equals zero come with these so that you split your middle term do you affected by grouping and it works great question is why does it always work great what is the shortcut from here to here is it just taking these factors if that's a shortcut then it should work all the time does it work all the time no because if your a is not one you cannot do this right from there it's not possible I'll show you a way to this possible okay let's get won't get to that in just a minute from here you're not quite done you have something called the zero product property or you know you know what if we have two factors that equals zero two factors are multiplied together equals zero the only way that that can actually work is it one or the other the factors equals zero itself because zero times anything else gives you the zero so X would equal negative 1 and X equal negative 6 and then we answer that's not a negative 6 maybe answer the question what are those because sometimes we get wrapped up in the technique and we forget what what are those those are x-intercepts so we knew this was a parabola we didn't find the x-intercepts and I told you the very beginning that factoring will always give you real solutions if it's factorable so these are two real solutions and this is where this upward-opening parabola will cross the x axis twice that's extremely important to know that's what we're doing here so it's just another technique it is like the screwed method and then it gives you X intercepts it's just a different way to go around it so we said equals 0 we say script method don't work we say Miami try GCF we're factoring it didn't work but in order one side first are positive we factor with our technique can't use a shortcut yes sometimes you're kind of fleshing that out right now we'll talk about why that shortcut works in just a minute I might hold you in suspense for the first time like ever because I can't explain it yet but I will explain it and then we're finding x-intercepts and determining that this is where the parabola crosses the x axis let's move on let's talk with the next one so what in the world you do to find x-intercepts that's that's what we're doing here in all these videos well we said that equal to 0 so we have a 3x X minus 4 minus 36 equals 0 all right I know it's kind of nasty how the real can I solve that let's see the first thing we would try is we would try the square root method do we have something raised to the second power that contains all of our X's no we don't we don't even have a second power of there right now so when that happens the screw method is off the table for now there's ways we can get back to it called completing the square but right now this is not a good candidate what we do have to do is if the screwed methods not a good candidate then we have to distribute we don't want to distribute if the square root methods can work but it's not going to work we have to so we look at it we go finding X intercepts all that's zero we look at we go okay screwed method I don't see anything that contains all over it all of our exes race for second power that means we have to distribute barring some special technique like there's some sort of substitutions that we can do that avoid that but this isn't one of them there's nothing that's the same and in two spots that we can set it to so we distribute and we make sure we have this in the proper order for factoring so we've tried spirt method but then we go that doesn't work the next thing we try is factoring so let's look at it is this all on one side yeah is it in order x squared then X's then constants yeah it's the first term positive yeah this looks perfect for factories so we've helped we set this up this is really good now we try our factory so when we when we set up the factory and we everything on one side in order first term positive the first thing that we're in trying to do is factor out some sort of the greatest common factor if there is one now there wasn't here but there is here and this is gonna save you tremendous amount of time a lot of students avoid this of a way to factor the GCF and then that factor gets horrible I think oh man that's really big or they plug numbers in the quadratic formula there are an enormous and they don't have to do that so when we factor always try to when do getting these techniques always tried for a greatest common factor first you're looking at okay is there anything that divides 3 12 and 36 good yeah actually 3 let's factor out the 3 that's a greatest common factor sometimes you might even see it like 3x cubed minus 12x minus squared minus 36 X and you can factor out a 3x the X would give you a factor of 0 you'd say oh so you have one x intercept of 0 and then you factor the rest of it so you can see that we're not going to deal with it here because we're strictly dealing with quadratics but that is possibly always check for a greatest common factor first sometimes you get additional solutions there so we look at it now what's the 3u that 3 does absolutely nothing as far as your x-intercepts it does not have a factor that contains a variable and therefore this will not be set equal to 0 three doesn't equal zero 3x that's a different story so if we had a factor out here that you'd factor out a GCF from all of your terms ahead X then yeah we'd have a zero of x equals zero but we don't so where we find our next intercepts are just and dealing with these these expressions that have variables in them so like the x squared minus 4x minus 12 that's what we're looking at now we don't even really care about the 3 we're not going to lose it but we're sort of going to ignore it this part as far as our factoring or using zero product property so let's go through and let's go ahead let's identify our a and our B in our seat so our a here is yeah we don't we're not worried about 3 worried just about right here our 8 is 1 our B is negative 4 and our C is negative 12 so let's put negative 4 here 1 times negative 12 is negative 12 that's a big deal I don't want you just to put the C I want you to put the a times the C one times negative 12 and now we're gonna think about two numbers that add to negative 4 and multiply the native 12 sometimes or some people these come really easily and they just get it because they're good at their factor tables sometimes it's not that easy for people and so I'm going to give you some good ways to go through it like it did before if you're multiplying to a negative your signs have to be opposite one will be negative one will be positive make the first one negative and the second one positive not because the order matters but because when you get to the grouping it's easier to have a plus here and not a minus because you want to change signs so if it's not possible then yea if you have two two negatives that's not possible but if you have different signs put the minus first it'll be a little bit nicer for you so I know that I'm multiplying two negative that means my signs are different I know that I'm adding to a negative that means that that's the difference between the two numbers so if they add to negative four that means my sons are opposite and my Center obviously that means they'll have a difference of four units in there so I go right well what what numbers multiply to negative twelve well there's 12 and one there's there's two and six there three and four that someone's I can think of there are whole numbers which one of those have a difference of four well six and to do which one will be the negative one because I'm adding to the negative four I need the bigger of those two numbers and I was in value to be the negative so I can't have this as negative 2 & 6 that add to positive 4 I'm gonna have that as a negative 6 & 2 that multiplies native 12 that adds a negative 4 I'd double check my work I know that this is right that's the only time that you go on from here so you make sure that that works now will this really shortcut work yes it will it will work this is going to end up being X minus 6 and X plus 2 we know that because our a is 1 and that's going to work what I'd like you to understand is the grouping as well so what this does practically it says because these add to your negative 4 because they add to your middle term I can take x squared instead of minus 4x I put minus 6 X plus 2 X minus 12 equals 0 notice I haven't forgotten about the 3 it's still there it's not going to affect our solutions at all it's not going to affect this Factory at all but it is still going to be there we don't want to lose track of that so I've looked at I said okay this is Factory I've come up with two numbers that are allowing me to split up my middle term and they use 6 and positive 2 X so negative 6 and positive 2 X those would combine to give you a 4x so it's the same thing but it's taken three terms in the four terms so that we can group them together that's what we are doing why I told you to put the negative first was because when you group things you always have to drop down this middle sign and if this is a negative you start changing signs you have to divide up negatives it's gonna change your signs and if I can avoid sign errors for you I do so I'm gonna put my positive last so that I don't have to change signs and dividing out my GCF for my first two terms that's just next we get X minus 6 I have to bring down my plus see how that's a minus it's R divided by negative that's that's not so that's not great to do for sign errors we have to - this says you're factoring positive to my sons are not going to change and now that I've done that I've created a GCF I've created this common factor X minus 6 that we can factor out so when I remove it by division I have an X plus 2 and I drop down that free I do not distribute the 3 don't worry about it it's not going to affect these factors at all so it's still there that was our GCF of the beginning what are solutions well our solutions say set every factor listen carefully set every factor that has a variable equal to 0 3 doesn't have a variable it's as coefficient for us right now this has a variable so X minus 6 equals 0 and this has a variable X plus 2 equals 0 that means x equals 6 and x equals negative 2 could you go directly from here two factors yes and we'll show you why in about five minutes ten minutes secondly some people will tell you this and it's true can you find your solutions Oh your x-intercepts just by looking at these and changing your signs yes you can yep so your solutions here are negative 1 and negative 6 or shows it's here positive 6 and native to that actually does work if you don't have to show you work and you're just doing this to find your x intercepts or to find out that's basically you can just change your signs and it will work because of the the way that we the way that we set the zero product property equal to zero and our science changed so that doesn't work you can go here and go yep the solutions are positive six negative two and you have them right there that's something that you can't do good I need to do it I don't know it kind of depends on what you're doing but it is possible well that's making sense you I hope you understand the idea that we're still setting equal to zero it's just another technique once where every method doesn't work does factor and always work no that's why we have two other techniques coming one that works all the time and then we use it to create the quadratic formula all right let's move on we're good time right he's feeling great is it a quadratic yeah Howard you said that is the parabola think about whether it's upward opening downward this happens to be upward opening and now we're going to think let's find x-intercepts so when we do that we're gonna set this equal to zero but we're going to be smart about it we're going to say because this is out of order when I set this equal to zero I'm going to put it in order so that our exponents are descending in power so the x squared term should come first then our X term that our constant term and then 0 on the other side is it all on one side how looks really good is it in order yes it's a border is my first term positive fantastic it is this is the set up for all of our solving techniques can you do it differently yes but this is the easiest way to go then we start going through it can you do the square root method here can you isolate a power to take a square root no because that X messes it up I don't have everything all of our X term inside something being raised to the second power so No can I do factoring yup it's set up for that let's try it one thing we try is we would try to do it greatest common factor first can i factor out a number and/or variable from all three of these terms no not even close there's nothing divides Alden so it's not like this problem we had that this fails that so let's try to go ahead and let's factor just like we did let's set up some sort of a technique I call the diet method to help us factor this if our a is 3 and our B is 5 and our C is 2 then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put my be up here I'm gonna put my a times my seat not freaking to our doing 3 times 2 we're doing 6 we're giving a 6 here and then we're going to find two numbers that add to 5 and multiply to 6 now now look we're multiplying to a positive number if we're multiplying to a positive number of signs have to be the same if we're adding to a positive number they have to both be positive think of some numbers that multiply to 6 that actually add to 5 not have a difference of 5 actually add to 5 so same sign you're adding to the top number different signs this will be the difference between the two numbers okay let's see I have three two five six and one that's one things I think of six and one do those add to five no they don't that a 7 3 and 2 those identified yes and because we have the same sign that works it does not matter the order 3 & 2 okay alright so you're done right because because we just go yeah it's easy X plus 3 and X plus 2 and moving on let's go to the next does that work this it work that shortcut that cell is really trying to do it doesn't because if you distribute this you get x squared you get 3x squared if we go directly to here and go our answer there negative 3 and negative 2 because I just changed signs we get it completely wrong this shortcut that we know works here and here doesn't work here and that's problem with shortcuts if we have a shortcut that works some of the time it's not a good shortcut a shortcut should work all of the time I'm gonna teach you this in exactly three minutes so what do we do what do you do if it's troga doesn't work remember one thing you can do go back to something that does work go back to this idea that what these numbers do is they head to five these numbers can split up this middle term these numbers can do 3x squared plus 3x plus 2x plus 2 equals 0 yeah they let you do grouping you can totally do that group the first to 3x we factor out of this if X plus 1 bring down your middle term our middle side to positive 2 would factor out of this via X plus 1 you've created a greatest common factor of X plus 1 factor it that's X plus 1 that's 3x plus 2 equals 0 because we have two factors and both of them have variables we would set X plus 1 equals 0 we would set 3x plus 2 equals 0 and we would have solutions negative one maybe two thirds you think in your head hey those are real numbers this is a parabola it's upward opening this is exactly where this problem will cross two times the x axis these are X intercepts now you heard me say something that was true you should be able to just change these signs and get solutions can you change these signs and get these solutions no what that means is that the short can listen because I know that some of you were taught differently the shortcut you use to get from here to your factors and here to your factors is incomplete here's the complete shortcut hope that it's exactly three minutes because that would be awesome maybe just possibly some time to make sure it's the same three minutes I'm not gonna do that okay so so here's the the real complete shortcut and where it comes from that I know that some of you have never seen unless you watch some my videos here's that works coming right back to here coming right back to here if you find these don't do everything the same get everything on one side in order first term positive put down your be put down your a times your C and finding numbers an add to this one and multiply to this one and then do one additional step look at your a divide these numbers by your a your 8 here is free so take those numbers divide by 3 and simplify what you get this would be positive 1 over 1 leave them as a fraction this is already simplified positive 3 over 2 if you do that I promise you two things number one you can read your factors directly from here and they will always be correct number two you can change your signs of these numbers and they will always be your solutions that's a complete shortcut people so let's look at it how do you read your factors if you need a factor if you don't if you're not just looking for solutions but you're looking for factors look at your denominator your denominator will tell you how many X's factors should contain and your numerator will tell you the constant to add or subtract to a from it so looking at the denominator this says you should have one X in a factor and then add one here's one X and then you add once you can amass chills right now what this should say another factor should have three X's and then you add to three X's and then you add to that is how a shortcut works now what's your solutions one over ones one positive one change the sign that's a solution two-thirds change the sign negative two-thirds that's a solution now why did I say this this shortcut why does it work let's incomplete the reason why a lot of people don't understand why this shortcut doesn't work here is because they do not acknowledge that your a is one if your a is one and you divide by one just like I did here but with I divided by 3 divide these by one why because your a is one look how this doesn't change your X that's why this shortcut actually works if I divide by one it's not changing what you're adding to or subtracting from your your X's it's same okay if I divide by a is one you always have one X it's not changing these numbers you'll always add or subtract that exact same number you won't have the simplified link we just did that's why people lose the fact that these tighten these shortcuts are the same they just never make it that far so this says you should have one X and then factor in add one we actually have that it was X plus one this shows you you have one X and then add six yes one X and then add 6 to the equals zero you should be able to change your signs positive one movie negative one positive six to be negative six that's where this shortcut actually comes from well so why I did it it that's that's where that would come from so it's it's this idea but people lose the fact that this a is one and that's why you're able to go directly from these fat from these numbers to your vectors that's why so if you're gonna do it and you reduce just want your solutions man just divided by your a just simplify and ginger signs that's the easiest way to go about doing I hope that makes sense to you it's it's a really cool shortcut that does work all the time I'm going to show you just the shortcut down I'll show you both I'll show you the factory and the shortcut because we'll have a negative in there I'll show you how that works all right let's get after it so we all know what we're doing we have a quadratic we know it's a parabola let's think about it though that should be a downward-opening parabola in your head we're still finding x-intercepts there the same way we're going to take this we're going to set this equal to zero we're going to make sure everything is on one side it is we're going to make sure it's in order it is x squared then X and then a constant but we're going to make sure that the first term is positive maybe before that you check the square root method so we'll sort method work do you have everything your X is instead of a power - now you don't that messes up but we do want our first term positive there's a couple ways to think about doing this mostly we just think about it we just do it one way is you could add 2x squared + 5 X and subtract 12 to both sides you could divide out a negative or you could factor negative and then multiply by negative 1 divided by negative 1 any of those ways essentially are just going to change every sign up now listen please listen it is not a problem to change your signs when you're solving for x intercepts but keep in mind you're not changing the side of your original function it still needs to be a downward-opening parabola the idea is that if I change the signs of a downward-opening parabola yes it would make it upward opening it would be a reflection but if you reflect something on the x axis about the x axis it doesn't change if my sign on the x axis is an on sign it's 0 and I change signs it's not changing because it's even had a sign so when we when we change when we change our signs to positive 2x squared plus 5x or minus 12 equals zero by either what I said before adding these two terms respecting this 1 or divide anything by negative or factor negative one multiplying or dividing negative one that's not gonna change the parabola and that's also not going to change our x-intercepts they will still show up exactly the same because in reflecting x-intercepts you don't change anything about them they reflect about the x axis but there are we on the x axis they can't change now let's go through the process of solving for x so we're gonna we're gonna try factoring we're gonna look at our middle we know that a is 2 B is 5 and C is negative 12 so I know that 5 goes here not negative 12 but negative 24 is what we could put down there we're going to add to 5 we're going to multiply to negative 24 so I'm thinking if I'm multiplying to a negative my signs have to be different I'm doing this on purpose and putting these out of what the order I said so that you can see what happens when you do that so I'm I'm putting this this minus second I should have the - first I'm thinking okay if I'm adding a 5 and have different signs then the bigger number is positive smaller number is negative and there's a difference of 5 units between them something into I see 24 is 24 1 12 and 2 no 8 and 3 yeah that has a difference of 5 so different sign difference of 5 difference of that B so I'm thinking this needs to be 8 and negative 3 that adds to 5 cool that multiplies negative 24 also let's say I wanted to be really quick about this how I would do it and I'm just looking for my excellent yes I would take my a whatever I'm working with this to negative 2 what I'm working with right now take that 2 and divide simplify the fractions that you can so positive 4 over 1 8 over 2 and 4 1 of the same thing I leave it as a fraction negative 3 halves you can't simplify that anymore I'm done if I wanted to find that X intercepts one x-intercept let's see this is 4 negative or another next intercept that's negative 3 halves so he has done I guarantee you that is where this parabola that's downward-opening crossing the x-axis at those two exact values that is the quickest way that I know use factoring to find x-intercepts and now I gave it to you what if you needed the factors themselves two ways to do it one way is you can read your fraction that says you would have your denominator we tell you how many X isn't a factor so that'd be 1x your numerator tells you what you add or subtract to or from it your denominator tells you how many X's your numerator tells you what to add or subtract or from it can you see by using the zero-product property I'd have X plus 4 equals 0 I'd have 2x minus 3 equals 0 and we would get those exact solutions I need to pause for just half a second now and tell you there's there's a slightly different way to consider this factor some people prefer to do this X minus 3 has as a factor it's the same so X minus three halves and 2x minus 3 are giving you the same factor I need you to be comfortable with both of those so X minus 4 great our side X plus 4 great or X minus three halves and X 2x minus 3 or the same factor here here's why they're the same if I look at 2x minus 3 and I solve for X and I wanted to create a factor couldn't you subtract 3 halves from both sides and get let's see I added 3 divided by 2 couldn't you just subtract 3 halves Linda this is when to factor equals 0 by the opposite of the zero product property tell you a factor to be X minus 3 house it's it's the same exact thing in fact if we just divide divide this both by 2 so divide everything by 2 here here and here you would get X minus 3 halves so that's a different way to write that factor in just wanted you be aware of it okay the last way is to use the grouping yeah it's a little slower but it does work all the time so we'd have this X 2x squared plus 8x we'd use our original numbers minus 3x minus 12 equals 0 we look at the first two in factor out a 2x that's our greatest common factor for those two terms X plus 4 be careful if you have a minus second if you have a minus there you have to drop that down when you factor out your GCF of 3 it says no no no no you have to factor out negative 3 what that does it changes this sign to a positive X and it changes this time whatever it is it will flip your sign that's a plus 4 sometimes we get sign errors because we we drop the mines but we forget about that we should abide by 3 instead of negative 3 your signs got to change if that term as - now we get X plus 4 and 2x minus 3 to 0 and we get exactly the same thing man I'm hoping you appreciate the technique I just gave you if you know before cool if not do you see how powerful it is do you see that with very minimal work you get your X intercepts super fast if you want to try that actually we go back and try that one try all these with with that other ones were working on now these are some special cases I just want to talk and talk over with you so first one negative 12x plus 9 plus 4x squared we're gonna do it fairly quickly I'm not going to show you the grouping any longer that's a lot of iterative group you know I can't you can't I can't not do that gonna be complete here so I'm gonna show you how to how to solve this and just a special case that we get so so far we have we have two real x-intercepts and every single one of these cases even here these are two real x-intercept there's no eyes they're different numbers so we know we're crossing the x-axis twice with that downward-opening parabola let's do the same thing so we have this function it's a it's definitely quadratic we know it's a parabola in fact it's upward-opening because the term in front of my x squared well that that sign is plus plus so it's a positive x square that's upward opening in order to find x-intercepts we would set this equal to zero but we're doing it in such a way that we're putting this in order first so positive 4x squared minus 12x plus 9 equals zero I'm thinking about the square root method I'm looking at going can I do the square root method I know because I don't have all my X's contained in the power - that doesn't work next thing we do is can we factor well we're certainly gonna try and because this is on one side in order in her first term is already positive that's great we're gonna try to factor in GCF can i factor GCF no no there's nothing that divides for 12 and 9 and x squared X and not having next there's nothing that's in common with all three of those terms so we're gonna try to do our diamond method I know that we're going to do negative 12 and 36 not 9 4 times 9 is 36 and now we're thinking wait okay hang on a second negative 12 positive 36 if you are multiplying to a positive number your signs will be the same but if you're adding to a negative that means they both have to be negative this is the only time where you can't avoid having a minus second in grouping here you could have think you would have wrote them written them different here here you can't avoid that so if we do factor by grouping and two negatives you're going to be changing sides apart now this thing what two numbers add to the negative 12 and multiply to positive 36 well they have the same sign so what's your number and they're actually adding a 12 so what multiplies 36 36 and 1 that's an add 12 to an 18 that one was a 2012 and 36 12 and 13 oh that's added 12 6 and 6 yeah 6 & 6 works 94 doesn't work 6 & 6 negative 6 and negative 6 added to negative 12 and multiply to positive 36 now if you were listening anything about what I said if you divide by your a and you simplifies and you change their sign you're done you have just found x-intercepts guaranteed our x-intercepts are gonna be positive three-halves and positive three-halves what wait a minute how long the world do you the same answer twice oh you got to see that physical what's that mean you need to know what that means this is a parabola right it's upward opening right we're finding x-intercepts right what does it mean make the same answer twice this is exactly what we're talking about before and unlike that one of the first first video on quadratics we had two videos ago what does that mean to you does this cross twice does this balance once does this completely miss it can't completely miss because there's no imaginary numbers factoring can't give those to you it doesn't cross because we have the same number twice this is called a double root so do we get two solutions yes are they the same yes so really how many do you get you get one you just get it twice this is where the vertex will be this right here is a parabola that touches our x axis opening upward but just touches your x axis right at x equals one and a half so if you went over to one and a half that's where that parabola is going to be that's got to make sense now can you can you do a little bit more work if you refuse to more work yeah sure you could you could write this as 2x minus 3 because we have a denominator minus numerator 2x is minus 3 another 2x minus 3 equals zero oh look hang on a second wait a second wait wouldn't you do 2x minus 3 squared equals zero yeah checking I'm gonna wrap the whole unwrap all the videos for us right now that we had on quadratics could you do that yep with the skirt method work yep could you take a square root on both sides of the plus and minus yep when plus and minus the square root of zero still give you just zero yes you do the same answer twice do you see the square root method at work you have to add three and divide by two you the same exact thing do you see going back to this do you see that if we wrote it slightly different instead of having two X minus three squared could you have X minus three halves like we talked about here could we have that all squared yes just divide both of them by two or look here do X minus three halves same thing do you see how this is check it out so yeah this is a problem this is shifted right three house whoa about we'd have an x intercept of three handsets the graph I just gave you this is a parabola shifted right three halves this needs to be coming together in your head that we have parabolas the shifting the x-intercepts these vertex they're all they all should be trying to do the same thing get a better picture your graph could you do it as a little bit different could you say alright well you know what I really like the grouping or I forgot my shortcuts or I just really like extra work and so I'm gonna take this and do 4x squared minus 6x you know you undo all this is minus 6x minus 6x plus 9 equals 0 yeah we've got factor by grouping that's a 2x I get 2x minus 3 bring down your - factor out a 3 and you get positive 2x minus 3 because your sign change you divided by a negative here equals 0 well that's 2x minus 3 and another 2x minus 3 and we're back to the same thing we just had 2x minus 3 squared equals 0 there's a few ways to write it you could of course do X minus 3 halves that is appropriate and fine most people like this a little bit better but it does tell you're going to get the same solution twice or you say well how many factors do I have like one but it's repeated so we said 2x minus 3 equal to 0 we add 3 we divide by 2 and you get your three-halves now how many ways that you can get for 4 different ways or something I hope at least one of them makes sense but I hope more than that I hope that what I'm teaching you is that these techniques are everything in parabolas is not like just different little segments I want them to come together to make one cohesive idea about parabolas what their x-intercepts are that the shifting and the graphing and the vertex and and the x-intercepts they're they all work together and I hope that you're now seeing that with some of these techniques that can appear to be completely unrelated than I'm making them relate for you so that's my goal that's man that's about it as far as solving these these quadratics I want to talk just a little blurb about this one and then we're going to be done so this last one this is x squared minus 5 is a parabola of course in fact it's a parabola that shifted down 5 units so it's not moving the left or right just shift it down 5 units that means it's X and I'm excuse me its vertex is going to have an x value of 0 that's what's gonna happen to shape it down with ideas how to solve that for X intercepts yes you still set this equal to 0 you'd have an onion work it is on one side great first positive you got it with the screwed method work absolutely the skirt method would work if we add 5 to both sides and take a square root with a plus and minus but I don't want to talk about the factoring you see a lot of students will say this is factorable x squared minus 25 respectable and you'd say yeah that's X minus 5 and X plus 5 equals 0 and you're done yeah that's that's easy but then when we talk about x squared minus 5 they say all of it that's and that's not fat burning' longer yeah it is and this is sort of a problem in the way that we teach is that students get here and they go this is no longer factorable because that's not a perfect square it's not a perfect square over-over whole numbers over integers but it is a perfect square over square roots and so here's what I need you know I need to know that this is still a difference of squares it's just kind of weird so when you have this house it has a a typical difference of squares actually work well a typical difference of squares actually works because you'd be safe x squared minus something else squared and there's something else that you get is just the square root of that number you go with that that's going to be five it's just a square root of that number now what about x squared minus five could we write this as x squared minus something saleable yes it's just the square root of that number what I want you to get out of this is that you can factor anything any quadratic as you say any quadratic that's x squared or some things squared minus a number so square minus number you can factor that just take the square root let's say it's gonna be X minus the square root of five and thanks plus a squared vitamin much like this would be X minus the square root of 25 and X plus L square root of 25 the same thing happens here if you set this equal to zero then X minus the square root of 5 is 0 and X plus the square root of 5 is 0 and X would equal square root of 5 and X to equal negative square root of 5 the exact same thing we did is we added 5 and took a square root with the plus or minus it works I just need you to be prepared for that because when we get down to polynomials in general and we factor it and you're left with Linear's and irreducible quadratics this is not irreducible this has to be factored still as x squared minus and plus some sort of number just take the square root of that it's factorable I'm gonna leave it for there for right now we'll revisit that when we talk about polynomials I hope that makes sense I hope that you're you feeling pretty good about factoring right now I hope that that new technique kind of stuck with you it's the fastest way I know how to factor and it works really well for me so I hope it works well for you too next time we'll talk about completing the square and we'll talk about why it works I'll give you the easiest way to do completing the square I promise easy way ever seen so we'll rely on our knowledge of factory to do that and I'll see you the next video you 

Transcript for: Completing the Square Made Easy (Precalculus - College Algebra 19)
hey welcome to another video so in this video I'm going to show you how to complete the square easily though easily completing the square is not easy yeah it can be a little tricky but the way to make something easy and math is to understand it and so what I'm gonna do I'm going to teach you why completing the square actually works because I can't afford for this to be a process for you something oh you do this and this then you're good to go I need you to understand what it is that it's doing and the reason why it's important is because in in this class in like precalculus intermediate algebra we have other ways to install quadratics like the quadratic formula but what completing the square does is make it gives you a very powerful tool that you will be using later in math like in in calculus too we use trig sub the trigonometric substitution to solve some integrals and you have to complete the square on some of those problems so I'm going to show you why it works how it works and it's going to seem a lot easier when we're done so we're gonna solve some quadratics we have one of you this factorable we'll talk about the minute and leave some ones that aren't so there's two principles I need you to understand before we get started the first one is this what we're going to be doing how to make completing the square easy is to understand that what it really is is taking something that quadratic forcing it to factor as a perfect square so that you can use the square root method to solve it so we're looking at a quadratic we're saying that doesn't factor otherwise we wouldn't be doing this we're making part of it purposely factored into a perfect square trinomial we're going to talk about that this is one of them show you what that looks like so that we can make the square root method work the second principle is this I need you to understand that if something's an equation like we have here like we have here if we start messing with one side by adding something to it we have to undo that somewhere and there's two choices both are good I'm going to show you in this video how to deal with completing score on one side of your equation because that will mimic more closely well how you use completing the square later on your math lives so here's the principle we all know this to have an equal set up if start adding or subtracting mostly just adding on one side of this equation I have to balance it somewhere and so here's what I want you to look at if I start making seven and let's say I add to this is no longer invalid equation it's not it's not true seven plus two is not equal to 7 7 plus 2 is 9 on the same so seven I have to undo that somewhere and so what I'm going to show you in this video is that in order to complete the square in order to make factor impossible we're going to be adding something to a piece of our equation we're going to have to subtract on the same side to keep it equal now a lot of textbooks are going to say ok once you add here I want you to add here that's perfectly fine that is absolutely true if you add two here and add two here 9 would equal 9 I'm going to show you a different approach that will work better for you later so instead of 7 plus 2 equals 7 even though this plus 2 kind of screwed us up what if we get 7 plus 2 minus 2 would that's still equal 7 well yeah the plus 2 minus 2 those are those are inverses they're gonna cancel out if you will and we would just get 7 equals 7 again this is the principle I'm going to teach you in completing the square and so here's the idea one last time before we start this this stuff we're gonna take a look at how factoring works we're gonna make factoring work for something that's not actually factorable by adding a number to a piece of this equation then we'll have to undo that because you can't just add the one side without undoing this somewhere so I'm going to show you how that works and let's take a look at this example in order to do that so let's look at x squared minus 6x plus 9 equals 0 and we look at it we've got everything on one side we got it in order to get the first term positive let me say number one can we use the square root method in order to solve that well can I get that power to something squared on one side with no other X's and a constant on the side answers know that that X Agnetha this up so the next thing we tries can you factor it yeah of course I can factor that that that looks that's in order percent positive looks pretty good the Reacher if I try to factor it here's our insert build miss process if we try to factor this we use our diamond problem we put our middle term this negative six this be up top and we have a times c1 times a night it was night now of course because our a is one it's gonna look like it's just nine now here's something that I'm going to tell you and we're gonna do in just a minute in just a minute I'm going to say that now imagine something imagine we didn't have the nine imagine you still wanted to complete this you still wanted a factor there's a perfect square trinomial but you didn't have the nine or gonna learn that if you can find these two numbers that's the number that's actually missing some of the changes in just a minute just watch for it so if we went through this say okay had a factor we need two numbers to add negative six but at the same time multiply to positive 9 and we think in our heads we know they're gonna be the same sign we know they both have to be negative and they're both going to be negative three and if we continue we know that whether we do a shortcut away they do factor by grouping we're gonna get X minus 3 and X minus 3 and you wait a minute that's the same factor trying twice exactly so here's what I'm trying to show you here I'm trying to show you that we're not going to be given the 9 we're gonna be given something like ain't missing tonight and we still want to make this work so that when we put it together as X minus 3 squared the square root meant that is still going to work for us that's the whole principle of completing the square is forcing something a factor so that the square root method is gonna work from here yes we take the square root on both sides we get a plus a minus 0 we add the 3 of you yeah you get that from here 2x plus 3 hello yeah exactly because this was actually factorable so here's the point what we're gonna do instead instead of having something that's already factorable here's what it's going to look like we're going to have what if you didn't have than I what if this wasn't here what if you wanted to complete this so that you forced it to factor well if we ask that question the answer B if I had this middle term of negative six I'm looking for this number basically we're just sort you can kind of make up something that we have to add to it in order to make this thing factor like this so you look at the okay well how would I make this work I'd make this work if both of these numbers are negative three you see I still want this to be something that I have the same factor twice something where the square root method would work when I combine my factors so X minus 3 and X minus 3 need to make this X minus 3 squared we have to have the same numbers here and here in order to get the same factor in order to combine it to a power to so that the square root method will work and that's exactly what completing the square it does it forces the square root method of work force the problem is without this number this doesn't work so your weight Louie these numbers have to add to this one right yeah that's how that's how we found them we need them to be the same correct well of course because we need this to happen so that we can combine and get a power to but don't these numbers also have to multiply to here well that's exactly how we did effect in the first place you said these numbers have to add to this one but at the same time they have to multiply to this so how do I find this number let's let's multiply them let's say well negative 3 times negative 3 is 9 9 is the only number in the world that I can add to this and complete the square complete the thing that we want to factor is a perfect square trinomial so that 9 that 9 can get added right here but we run into a situation it's this situation right now you see what I've done I've added 9 to something that didn't have a night we'd have to undo that somewhere and that's what we're going to focus on the rest of our example so I'm going to walk you through this process right now hopefully I've explained well enough the the two major principles number one is or finding a number that's forcing this to happen so that we use the square root method the second thing is if I'm going to add something I'm gonna have to subtract something as well I don't have to undo it I would say so we're gonna practice that on this example and we're certain rate now so let's say that we get this function x squared plus 4x minus 3 and and you need to find the 0 so they say find the x-intercepts or the roots or whatever they call them the zeros x-intercepts roots and so the first thing you do is set the equal to zero and then we run through the all of our options on solving quadratics so we think well is it on one side yeah of course is it in order that looks really good is the first term positive definitely and then we'd say will we check does the square method work and and the short answers you know of course because we have this this X that we can't get in power to with all our X's inside and and cons on this side the next question is can you factor and you know what you should try you should try the factoring for about 10 seconds and if it's factorable great we should be able to do about 10 20 seconds and if that's not the case if you can factor this you look at this you know hey there's nothing that adds to 4 and also multiplies negative 3 then we've got to find another technique here's the two techniques we're going to choose from they work all the time but they're a little bit more intensive than like factoring and square root method they're completing the square and there's a quadratic formula again most of the time guys we're just gonna go to quadratic formula because completing the squares you're gonna see on some of these examples takes a really long time and it's really hard to think of but it is very valuable if you needed for later on in math so I'm going to show you how that works but just to just bear with me here that the quadratic formula is gonna be a better choice for almost all of these just telling you right now so let's see if we can make this make this work for us so we're gonna set this up and we're gonna set up in a way that we're gonna force factory to happen how in the world do we force factory to happen here's the Leonard way of doing completing the square number one I need you to think of this as this parks great this as long as curious l think about why that happens if you were trying to factor this the force not a problem you could you could find numbers that multiply there that had to for very easily but none that also multiply to negative three so we're going to take that negative three or that minus three we're gonna hold it out for a little while we're gonna say this is the number that's screwing us up so let's write x squared plus 4x don't lose this minus three but put it way over here put way over there here's the thing that we're gonna do we're going to treat this piece exactly how we treated this piece about the nine remember how that nine wasn't there we're gonna look at this where a look at this treat this the same way this is the thing that you want to factor this is the thing that you're going to complete so that it can factor so we're gonna say hey if this were to factor like if it even possible what would this part ignore this what would this part look like this part would look like I have a four I wouldn't factor out the axis is not a GCF thing this is not what we're talking about then what we're talking about here is getting something where the square root method works so you need three terms in order for this to have that perfect square trinomial look to it so we're not doing a factoring by grouping or not factor out the X here we're finding a missing number it's going to make as possible so so so again we have some order we say factor does it work correct take off the piece that's not working for you look at the first two terms make factoring work how do we make factory work how does it make factory work in such a way that we're gonna have the same two factors well if this is our middle term after we find one it's gonna be our military if that's our middle term what two numbers add two for two numbers added four that are the same number because we need to have that same factors so we're looking at how well it's got to be two and two those are the only numbers that are the same that add before again why the same because if we can make these numbers the same we're going to get X plus 2 times X plus 2 that shortcut or that grouping or whatever you want to do and these numbers are the same you were going to get the same factors here there's only one problem this does not factor like this right now this is missing one number and if we add that number this would factor this was completing the square does it completes the factoring for you well what is this number that's missing well do you remember like if this if this was if this is the only two numbers are the same that had before this number comes from multiplying these two numbers or missing four so here's that four comes in that four says if I were to add four here this number that I would give this multiplication this is now factorable so you've completed the one missing number right there that makes this factor also so we're looking at we're saying that would be our middle term and put it here find two numbers are they're the same that add that have to add the four are you seeing that would have to be half of this number of your time it's always half of it because if you have two numbers that add up to something that are the same it's always half the number you try to add to then what would this be this is always a multiplication of these two numbers but that's always the number of those missing so we're gonna add that it's always adding this number to it but then we run into that seven equals seven with the two thing we added two we have to subtract it's similar here's where that happens if you just arbitrarily add for you now no longer have this same equation that you started with you just changed your function we have to subtract it and we're gonna subtract on the same side so when we add it for C well we gotta take it away this is the principle of hey 7 equals 7 7 plus 2 minus 2 is still equal to 7 we added something so we undid it right next to it that's what we're doing we added 4 to make this factorable in such a way that it completes the square we made it a perfect square but in doing so we added 4 we have to undo that 4 because if we add it and then subtract it keeps our equation same as it was and then we're going to combine it and say hey that's so we held up that minus three we subtracted four we also have a minus three that's a minus seven does that look familiar that's exactly exactly where the the whole square root method came from so all those problems we did a few videos ago where there was something square you get that square bites lbgtq square root on both sides plus and minus this is where it comes from so we're making that happen by something that's not normally factorable that's the whole idea from here on out I mean we know that this is still equal to zero and we can solve it I mean I might solve some of these for you probably not I probably will do all that was do but if we if we solve this we're gonna add 7 to both sides so X plus 2 squared equals 7 we take a square root we know that when we take a square root we have a plus or minus of X plus 2 equals plus and minus square root of 7 we simplify the square root if we can here it's not simplified so it's as simple as you can make it we subtract 2 remembering where that 2 goes in front of our plus and minus and this gives us two solutions x equals negative 2 plus square root 7 and x equals negative 2 minus square root 7 that's it and then you categorize it so you think about that does that have any x-intercepts and oh man I hope it's making sense that if you have eyes you don't you completely miss a complex solution say we missed the x axis if we had one solution it would have to be a real solution we get it twice and it would say our vertex is on the x axis here there's no eyes there's two distinct solutions those are two x-intercepts if you want an approximation you put your calculator and you get about where this parabola upward-opening across the x axis of two times that's got to make sense before we go any further so we're taking something that's not factorable stripping off this constant that's screwing us up anyway figuring out what its gonna take to make it factorable how think think about if you wanted to factor a diamond problem what what would happen these numbers have added the middle one and multiply it to the the last number so if they have to be the same so as to get the same factor twice you'd basically just divide that by two time this number has to be the product of these two that is the number that you are adding as soon as you add it as soon as you got it you will have something that's factorable because you just completed it you just said what you needed to complete it and then did you added that in there therefore this is factorable as something times itself this is a square we just have to undo the thing that we did so we add for your subtractive it's always going to be added and senator parentheses always because you're multiplying the number kind of cell aren't you number times itself is always positive you're always adding here and then we're going to be undoing whatever this is I said I'm doing not necessarily subtracting because we can have some certain special circumstances so we'll talk about that a bit then we combine the number we didn't really want the first place with the number that's keeping this thing the same function and we would get exactly the same same function just written in a a different form something with a square root method will work and if you wanted to check your work you could distribute this and subtract seven and you're going to get exactly that that's where I need you to be right now all right so let's keep on going now we get this G of X x squared minus three X plus one we're looking at we're thinking it's a quadratic it's an upward-opening parabola it's probably going to have some x-intercepts but if we run into any eyes well then of course we wouldn't we'd have some imaginary solutions so when we're asked to solve for x intercepts here the first thing we're going to do like every time we have a quadratic and you're asked that question is we're gonna set this vein equal to zero everyone say what what's the method what would we go through the first thing we should try is the square root method it is the fastest and easiest but it only works if you have something raised to the second power with all containing all your X's and this is going to screw us up we solve for x squared we have an excellent strength equation it says the square root method will not work right now the next thing we would try to do so we try so you take us over here you'd say alright here's my negative three here's my one I'm trying to look for any numbers to add a negative three multiply the one and you go you can't you can't there's no numbers that add to negative three and multiply to positive one that's the whole point this thing is not factorable now why and why is that what is the problem here the problem is is that this one screws us up can't really change the negative three but we can hold off the one so here's the whole point of completing the square we love this form method it's really nice but it doesn't work right now this won't factor so what we're gonna do is we're going to kind of combine the ideas we're going to make this factor so that the square root method will work how we're going to do it is we're going to say this one that's screwing us up we're going to hold that off for a minute we're going to hold that way over here we're not losing notice that I've written it down I just don't want to consider it's here because it's not factorable we're gonna find something that is so here's how we find something that's factor well it's not super fun with fractions but I need you to think back to the last example in our last example when we didn't have this four we've thought about it we said alright what we want is we want to end with something that has the same factor twice what because you still want the square root method so we want this these numbers to be half of this one something plus itself equals what we will only have been given so we look at the floor and say I want two numbers that add before that are the same number it's going to be half of four I want two numbers that add to negative three that are the same number we go that's not easy it's like one and a half like negative one and a half yes it is half of three is one half or three halves and so half of negative three is negative three halves we need the same number twice in order for this to have the same factor twice to be written as a perfect square we need the same number twice that's investment imperative so we have that will okay that doesn't look nice but let's think about it if we wanted to remember to make this thing factor it would have to be a number that these two things multiplied to remember how this factoring works we add to this one we multiply that one so when we looked at our teacher said we want these numbers to be the same okay they're both two we need a number that when I write it here it's going to make this factor we know that these two numbers have to multiply to this number whatever it is two times two is four you're creating the number that you're adding to this equation so that you can make it factor that's what we're doing so we're looking here we're saying I mean my two numbers that are finding to both be the same they both gotta add a negative three it's got to be half of that but I've got to add to this expression right here on this side of my equation I've got to add to it something that makes my factoring work in order manufacturing work this never has to be the product of these that's the seam negative times a negative is a positive do you see where we're always adding 3 times 3 is 9 3 times 2 is 4 that be positive 9 fourths if I add that this right here is what we just created here it says this this right here is missing the number to make it factor what number to find the number if I add that in that now creates something that is fact we should be factorable we just created something that will give us a perfect square trinomial you don't have to worry about factoring this again because you made it in such a way that it's already factorable look what you did you said I want to hold off my mind 1 it's alright it should be plus I want to hold off my plus 1 I want this thing without my plus 1 to be factored what if that were to happen my middle term goes here I need my my two numbers I'm going to be the same in order to get a complete the square or a perfect square trinomial I need this number to be the product of these so if I multiply this that's the number that's missing it's already factored you already found what this thing is in fact it has in fact you found the number to make this happen so this would be X minus 3 house we know that and another X minus 3 halves or X minus 3 squared there's one thing that we have to do is perfect you just added 9/4 here we need to undo the 9/4 that you added so we held off the one we looked at the x squared minus three said I really want that to factor what's missing let's figured out what's missing is that would be a negative 3 we find numbers are the same that add up to that we multiply them to find the missing number it's always a constant find the missing number that's going to make this Factory complete as a perfect square cleans foil but when you add something you have to undo that and you can't just start adding random numbers in there so we add 9 force we subtract 9 force and you combine these two pieces so when you combine negative 9/4 and 1 let's see negative 9/4 + 4 4 is negative 5/4 so minus 5/4 equals 0 and now we have something that even though it's really ugly you can use a square method on it has a has this power too with all of our X's in it we can get a constant on one side if we take a square root on both sides with a plus of minus well simplify the right hand side so 5/4 will have a square root of 5 over 2 because square root of 4 is 2 someone move over here so X minus 3 times square root empower 2 are gone that's fantastic we'll get plus and minus square root 5 over 2 again squared 4 is 2 if we add 3 house we really do get two solutions think about it are they are the x-intercepts or the imaginary does this have business across the x-axis twice yes it does there are no eyes there's no imaginary complex zeros so we have x equals there's two ways to write it you can leave it as a fraction plus another fraction or because these have a common denominator you can't write this as no succumbing matter 3 plus square root of 5 over 2 and 3 minus square root of 5 over 2 if you've ever had any exposure to the quadratic formula that might look very very familiar to you what well they kind of ruined the surprise in the next video but I'm gonna prove the quadratic formula to you and you know how we're gonna do it do with completing the square might do this exact same thing but instead of having actual a is 1 B is four-season 83 we're gonna have a B and C being a B and C and we're gonna we're gonna do complete the square and we're going to get the quadratic formula from it which is why these answers can sometimes look very very very similar so I'm hoping that makes sense I'm hoping you're seeing the reason why I complete the square works most of the time what I've seen teachers do or textbooks do really is they say okay it's a process what you're going to do divide this number by two goes here multiply the numbers together you do this and then put this on the other side if you be equal I get that it does work but when you get to later levels of math people to completely miss this you know what what is it what's at for this adding for subtracting for this adding knife or subtract uniting force if you add something to an equation you can subtract it on the same side and it's going to keep that equation same as it was and that's what we're doing the other thing that I need to keep in mind is that when you're setting up your factoring you are forcing factoring where it shouldn't that doesn't already so you're fortunate as a factor by having the same number twice it's got always be the same you're always adding you're always undoing whatever you've done on the same set of equation and then we're making it so that the screwed method actually works in solving it so let's let's try one more and it will kind of make it harder all right let's take a look at the last one before we start deal with some some funky fractions there's one other principle I haven't explained yet that I need to explain in this problem so I'm going to walk you through it I'm gonna tell you exactly what we've done already and I'll talk about how our aid needs to be won and then the reason why that is as we go through so your face of this problem and says hey you gotta complete the square but you gotta prove to me that you play the square or you're later on in math like I don't know calculus too and you have to find some sort of a completeness squares you can make a problem happen so the first thing we're gonna do is we're going to set this equal to zero because we know that anytime we want to find x-intercepts roots zeros whatever we're gonna set our function equal to zero so we're gonna get 5x squared minus 10x plus two equal to zero and you know what we're going to try the screw method first is there a way to get a power to with all your exit inside of it and everything else that doesn't involve X's on the side answers now again this X right here says that the square root method will not work the way it is right now so we try factoring alright well let's let's try to factor if we try to factor then we would have negative 10 and we would have 10 because 5 times 2 would give us 10 you say they I know is there's no way that's happening there's nothing that adds new 10 and multiplies to positive 10 we don't have any numbers that do that so we're gonna start setting up completing the square now we're gonna do that by taking this 5x squared minus 10x plus 2 don't forget that plus 2 plus 2 equals 0 it's the same exact equation where instead of stuff so that we can force this thing to factor as a perfect square there is one drawback the only drawback is that that 5 is gonna really hurt because it's a lot harder to complete that when you can't use this nice direct shortcut do you remember the direct shortcut shortcut said if I divide this by 1 I get 1 X plus 2 1 X plus 2 same thing down here divide this by 1/8 of 1 1 X minus 3 halves X minus three halves of that actually workforce but it's fairly difficult to do that if we have to multiply to five alongside of our see that we're finding so we have to find this number and also make it multiply to five times that number we're gonna have an issue and so what happens is that completing the squares are best done if you're a is one because we can start using these nice shortcuts that I taught you in the previous videos so what we're going to do is we're going to factor out whatever this a is so our a here is five do not factor it from this number you don't have to so we're looking at saying it's an order one side first you're positive factor as it works your method doesn't work we're pulling off our X terms because we're going to make this factor we're holding back our plus two are constant and then we're gonna force this a factor but we're first going to make sure that our a is one that we're dealing with so we're gonna factor out a 5 we're going to get x squared minus 2x well this piece this piece is what you want to factor I kind of don't care about the 5 right now I just care about this do you see how much easier that makes it's like if you if you have a 5 there it's fairly difficult to figure out what you need to factor to make it a perfect square in that like it's not easy but if you have this well it's not it's not as easy if you have this without the 5 this is now pretty nice all we're gonna do is we're gonna take and that's my border so we're gonna do we're gonna force this to factor we're going to force this to factor with a negative - we're gonna say hey you know what if I want this to factor as something times itself I need two numbers are the same so we think what numbers are the same that add to negative two it's always got to be half of this number half of 4 is 2 half of negative 3 is negative 3 halves half of negative 2 is negative 1 and negative 1 those are the only two numbers are the same that add to negative 2 we also know that if we're going to complete this square this is missing a number that number has to be the product of these two so no limits that's one it's always positive if you multiply two numbers that are the same you will always be positive you're always going to be adding it in here so when we look at that me all right that's got to be plus one so if we add one what we've just done is we've forced this expression to follow the pattern that we needed to follow that we created so that will be factorable you don't have to worry about fabulous again you've already done it you said this these two numbers will add to my middle one these two numbers will multiply to my last one in fact you gave it the last number so that it would multiply so I know for a fact this is going to factor as X's there you go X minus 1 squared that's going to be the case now if you listen if you miss if you don't then don't miss this this is a one thing you gotta make sure that you don't miss otherwise you've been really frustrated what number did you add well it looks like added 1 but notice where that one is this is the hardest thing for students to grasp notice where that one is you added one bit chip but you added it in an expression a parenthetical expression that's being multiplied times 5 so wait a minute if you were to distribute this you would get x squared minus 10x this actually counts 4 minus 10x because that fine and you'd get plus 5 so in adding that one inside of a parenthesis you have to count on the distribution factor so when you distribute the specter that adding one actually turns into an adding five so how I always teach my students to do this as they hey mr. Biba's when you get when you distribute this you get plus five undo that so if this says five times positive 1 is positive five we need to undo by adding five you need to subtract five not one if you subtracted just one and then you distribute all this stuff in combined and it will not be what you start with exactly that now we know well if you want to try this right now 5x squared minus 10x plus five minus five oh wait plus five minus zero plus two that's exactly what we have it's a minus five that's necessary in order to make this factory consistent with what we had originally so we looked at we said it's in order but this very method factor does not work let's let's make it so that the factory is easy and it works let's factor out the five now we have something where you can complete the square we take a look at our our middle term on this three term polynomial that we're building right now we say I need these numbers to be the same great / - we say that the number I need to add has to be the product of those why because you made one of them if you're a nice one it's really easy to understand that these two numbers multiply into your a times C but one times whatever number I'm getting is still my C and that's why I'm adding when I add that be very careful if you have to distribute you know how to undo the distribution not just the number under the distribution now we see that this is okay I've got an X minus one squared I would still have my 5 as a coefficient I would now have a minus 3 equals 0 I'm combining these two minus 5 and minus 2 is minus 3 from there man we just solve it we saw the rest of the way if you want to and this is this is just the square root method if you want to do it you know you add 3/5 first we take a square root on both sides depending on whether your teacher needs you to rationalize the denominator or not you might have to rationalize it down denominator there's your square root of three over five multiplied by root 5 over 5 you can get square root of 15 over 5 and do that and then we would subtract 1 so negative 1 plus or minus square root of 3 fifths or negative 1 plus or minus square root of 15 over 5 whatever one of those ways you need to do the main concept I'm really concerned about is beating you down to here I've taught you discrete method already we're just isolating the square root the square take a square root on both sides with the plus and minus again two solutions in this case two real solutions there are no negatives inside square root so we don't have any eyes now with that in mind let me talk about that what if this had happened to be a don't change your word but what if this had been a plus well then when I subtracted it I would get it negative and I would have a negative here and would give me an eye right out in front of that square root that right there would tell me that I have no x-intercepts these would be two imaginary solutions that's important I need you to understand it I think that's about it for right now what we're going to do in just a minute is we're gonna we're going to come back we're gonna have at least two problems that are a little more challenging because they start off with fractions and I need to show you what you get with that all right so let's get after it so we have three more problems to do these ones are the toughest ones I could find or make up made up that one to see if we did it we can handle it the way it is without changing signs so what to do with when you have to factor out menus there so we're gonna take a look and say hey you know what on all these problems I'm gonna ask you to find x-intercepts or find zeros or roots complex or not and so we're gonna take all these problems are gonna say seven equals zero put them in order one side first term positive and see if the screw meant it'll work it does great if not try to factor it if not well then we honestly probably do go to quadratic formula but I'm going to show you completing the square so that you can do it so let's set this equal to zero and when we take a look at it and we really likes crude method work but it's going to happen that X messes is up and Factory no it's it's not going to factor because there's nothing that we can find that adds two thirds and multiplies to one at times negative one third and so what we're going to do is we're going to strip off that constant and we're gonna have this as x squared plus 2/3 X we're gonna have this minus one third over here equals zero you see the constant is what is messing up our factory we define a different constants of the factoring works so we're going to take a look at this part right here we're gonna find what number we can add to this to make factory work for us but make it work in a very specific way we want it to work so that we have this perfect square the same factor twice we rounded power to so that square root method will actually work so we take a look and say this is two-thirds right here is what I want to add to but if we're gonna have the same factor twice these numbers need to be the same now what in the world are they going to be if they're the same number that adds two thirds well it's gonna be half of two-thirds here's how to find half of a fraction either divide the numerator by 2 if that works evenly or multiply the denominator by 2 if you can't divide the numerator so in this case we look at the numerator and say hey 2 divided by 2 is 1 half of 2/3 is 1/3 or 2 times 3 or 100 is 6 2/6 is 1/3 so either way you go you're going to give this 1/3 of course 1/3 is half of 2/3 they're both positive because you are actually adding two positive 2/3 so we found the number that's gonna make this factor as the same factor twice so that we can put together as a perfect square that's perfect well we're missing is the number that we need to add here in order to make this factory work so what we know about that number we know that these two values that we found that add to I also have to multiply to your a which is 1 times C then never we're looking for we're looking for the C because we've made certain that our a is 1 so the dispatcher's very nice of course when we multiply these two numbers you get 1/9 if this number is always a times C and your a is always 1 and for this complete the square then 1 times this number is your C well 1 times 1 knife is one night and this is the number that we're going to add to this part of our equation to make the factory possible do you see it I hope you're seeing that when I add that it is now completing this process we knew what we had to have we just were missing it you're adding it so that this process that you just created works so this one's are gonna remember we have that same replaces like that you multiply here this is the number that's missing to make the factor impossible the way I want so we know that this is going to factor as X plus 1/3 and X plus 1/3 or X plus 1/3 squared I hope you're seeing what's missing writing on the board it's gotta be it on your head that we just added something and we never we never compensated for that so when we add in one night we're gonna have to distribute so one times one night okay we've added one night let's subtract one month on the left hand side over here well we know that this expression is factorable as X plus 1/3 squared we just showed that that's right here 2x plus 1/3 times X plus 1/3 our a is 1 the short that works very nicely for us let's see minus 1/9 minus 3 nights is minus 4/9 so this would be three nights 1/9 four nights if we sit man this is beautiful it's all it's a square root method is going to work perfectly if we add 4/9 to both sides if we take a square root on both sides with a plus and minus then X plus 1/3 equals plus or minus 2/3 and if we subtract 1/3 we get negative 1/3 plus or minus 2/3 and we know that we're going to get two solutions out here there's two real solutions so x equals negative 1/3 plus 2/3 negative 1/3 minus 2/3 well this X is going to be 1/3 and this x value is going to be let's see negative 1/3 minus 2/3 native 3 through this negative 1 so we have two x-intercepts we have one at positive 1/3 and one at negative one on the x-axis is up above the opening parabola now I did that because sometimes you're going to listen very carefully here here the words behind what I'm saying here would I actually do this for solving x-intercepts and answers and no no I wouldn't know I'm gonna show you that right now but the second part of it is is it still valuable to learn what we've done yes because later you may actually have to do this when you're not asked to solve for X intercepts so how do we do it what we do instead man every time you have an equation wouldn't you get rid of fractions don't you look at it and say hey my LCD is 3 let's multiply everything both sides times 3 that's going to give us 3x squared plus 2x minus 1 equals 0 0 times 3 is still 0 is that going to factor with 2 and negative 3 yeah you get 1 sorry backwards 3 and negative 1 as the two this multiplies of three if you divide by your a which is three here we get positive 1 over 1 we get negative 1/3 this says your Dunamis is you have 1 X plus 1 this says you have 3 X's minus 1 equals 0 if you set them equal to 0 X plus 1 would equal 0 3 X minus 1 would equal 0 X would equal negative 1 and X would equal positive 1/3 it's the same exact thing so what's ways easier probably the factoring is easier probably the factory is easier but again it's valuable to understand and especially if your teacher shouldn't make it you show this stuff here you gotta do to completing the square with a fraction now you know how to do that I hope that I made it easier for you to understand why you're doing what you're doing because sometimes it just becomes a process you know ok I just divide this by 2 and square it but I have no wine then I subtract this random number because told me to this is the reason why I hope you've seen that you were just making the factor I taught you earlier possible okay last less - we're going to have with whip through these as fast as we really can so I'm gonna show you the process special rattling again I hope you understand and that really what I'm going to intend to do is if you can't factor something give her your fractions first if you still can't factor something pretty much we're doing a quadratic formula here we're kind of just practicing so FX equals 3x squared plus X minus 1 half ago we're looking for we're looking for zeros x-intercepts roots so we're going to do 3 x squared plus X minus 1/2 equals 0 and we got set equals 0 that's on one side you know reversed from positive looks pretty good we say can the square root method work the way it is right now know that X messes it up can we factor the way it is right now no not really with fractions could you get rid of your fractions yes yes you could if you multiply both sides by 2 2 here and 2 over there we get I'll show you we get 6x squared plus 2x minus 1 equals 0 still now is the factoring going to work we have a 2 here we'd have a negative 6 here can you think of any numbers that multiply to negative 6 and add to 2 I'm not seeing it right now I can't think of anything that adds to negative 6 multiplied so sorry as a to both 986 so that's not working for especially wouldn't work like it did in the previous problem so what would you do now listen please get this if you're just looking for x-intercepts you probably would not complete the square here what you probably do is get rid of your fractions and do the quadratic formula which we haven't talked about do the quadratic formula from right here so I hope you pay attention on that one in like real-life situation you're rarely going to complete the square on this to find x-intercepts it just takes too long but you the quadratic formula would be quicker so that's what we would do in order to practice the square method or if you have this function and you have to complete the square on the function which does happen from time to time you can't change much about it well then this is great this is what the technique I'm showing you this is the reason why I'm not working on both sides of my equation you'll see that most textbooks will add to one side and add to the other side you keep it keep it stable if you rule balance let's keep it equal I'm not doing that because I want you to learn how to deal with one side deal with the function by itself without having to compensate with another side of the equation it doesn't exist so that's why I'm showing this way all right we're taking a look at it let's do the completing the square thing we're gonna take our 3x squared plus X we're gonna take this minus 1/2 and the equals 0 we're going to factor out a 3 from just here because we want this the the certain method to work by forcing us to factor but we also know that our K really has to be 1 in order for it is to use that shortcut very well so we're going to factor out 3 we know this is 3x squared plus X we have a missing number this is what we're finding this is factory for and saying hey here's a here's a 1/3 here's a 1/3 I need to find half of that number and you find the number that I can add to itself to give you 1/3 well it's gonna be pepper 1/3 how do you find half of 1/3 you either divide the numerator or you multiply the denominators so I can't divide the numerator easily but I can't multiply the denominator so 3 times 2 is 6 divide the numerator by 2 or multiply the denominator by 2 this is going to be 1/6 and 1/6 1/6 plus 1/6 is 2 6 sixes that's going to be 1/3 that right there says what this is going to factor as so this is going to be X plus 1/6 and X plus 1 6 because our a is 1 right now that's what we know it now the number that's missing to make this happen is whatever it's here we know that these numbers would have to multiply to our a times C since a is 1 this is just gonna be our C times C is C so since airs 1 whatever we get for our multiplications gonna go right there so let's see 1/6 times 1/6 is 136th we're gonna add one 36 but we're also gonna have to undo that now fig carefully what are we undoing here are we gonna undo want that in 136 no because we have a 3 here pretend to distribute 3 times 136th is let's see 336 that's 1/12 this is you basically added 1/12 3 times 31 over 36 is 1 or 12 that's what you added that's we're going to subtract minus 1/12 this is already senator factor we already completed it so we know that all that number did was say oh now this works because if you try to factor this leave it you'd have 1/3 here you'd have 1 over 36 you find two numbers add the 1 multiply to 1 over 36 that's 1/6 and 1/6 this is now factored Balazs X plus 1/6 squared we have a 3 up front - oh let's see - 1 12 minus 6 12 minus 7/12 we're going to add that 7 twelfths we're gonna add that 7 12 the next thing we do is before you take a square root here you have to divide that by 3 so when we do we divide by 3 we're gonna get X plus one-sixth squared equals if you divide this by 3 divide any fraction by 3 the same thing as multiplying by 1/3 remember that so we can multiply by the reciprocal so if you ever divide a fraction by a whole number just multiply the denominator by that whole number so if I divide 7 twelfths by 3 I'm really taking 3 times 12 36 37 36 now we're able to take a square root now we can have a plus and minus we can simplify and get this X plus one-sixth equals plus or minus the square root of 7 over 6 looks pretty familiar that something we did earlier and then we subtract 1/6 so negative 1 6 plus or minus the square root of 7 6 I showed you a couple ways you can write that the main thing is I need you understand there's two solutions here there are two x-intercepts they're not complex this is where this parabola is upward-opening somewhat narrow across the x axis twice this is the way that man in my opinion the best way to conclude the square without just using an arbitrary technique it's thinking about what it is you're doing what you're doing is you're you're factoring you're seeing this thing to factor by finding the missing constant that creates this perfect square factorization that you already have it down all right the last one and then we're going to we're gonna be doing a I changed it up just a bit I'm not going to go through this this les problem as solving it by if for an x-intercept I'm gonna do this problem like what you would see later on if you're forced to complete the square within a function so I'm gonna leave H of X here I'm going to validate the technique I'm using because a lot like I said most times you would you add the 1/12 on the other side of the equation I'm going to show you that the reason why I'm doing that in this example is because sometimes you get to do this out solver 0 so let's leave the H of X out there let's complete the square the way that it is so what are we gonna do well we're gonna hold out that negative 2x squared plus 5x I will put this in minus 7 way over there not forgetting about it but we're not we're just kind of kind of lose it for a second after that we're going to factor so there is 1 so that our shortcut works very well we understand that what we'd be getting multiplies to exactly the C 1 times C so we find that missing constant otherwise in kids becomes very difficult so we're gonna factor out negative 2 if we factor out a negative 2 we get x squared we get minus five-halves 5 divided by negative 2 is minus 5 halves X we're gonna be finding the same number here one thing I want to comment on if you did have this set equal to zero the first thing you do change all your sons you change all your sign and see if it's factorable with negative 5 and positive 14 you just change your sign so add need to make my subtract 5x at 7 & u so if you had zero equals much like getting rid of fractions first you remember that much like that you'd make sure everything's on one side in order first turn positive and that is already a whole lot easier to deal with you'd see if factoring works if it does great if it doesn't well then you would go ahead and you do quadratic formula right now I'm completing this with this actually it's a vegetable no it's not I think you would you would at least try that and then you do quadratic forms and probably okay so here we are we know that if that was a zero we just change your signs and go for it probably quadratic formula but now since we're completing the square we're going to go ahead we're gonna have our B term negative five-halves or understanding that I need these two numbers to add to that and be the same which means we're going to have half of this number that's the only way you find two numbers are the same that add to something is by half so negative five halves divided by two either divide the numerator or multiply the denominator by two that's going to be negative 5/4 and negative 5/4 that actually does Adam eight five halves negative ten fourths is negative five halves and now we find that number there's missing it you see this this isn't here this is there's no there's no see right now we're gonna find what this takes to make this factorable and then we're gonna add it in there to force this to happen so negative 5/4 times negative 5/4 is positive twenty five sixteenths that is what we're missing so we're gonna take this we're gonna add that twenty five sixteenths this is now factorable according to what you found the problem is you just added twenty five sixteen here's the issue I hope that you're seeing it did you really add be very careful because this negative 2 is going to distribute by adding 25 16 you really want negative 2 times 25 16 is negative 25 8 to 16 cross value getting negative twenty five eighths that is what you've actually subtracted I know it's a little weird but if you were to tribute this he'd have negative 2x squared you have plus 5x and you would have minus 2 times 25 16 this would subtract twenty five eighths you need to add that so we're distributing and then undoing that distribution by distributing you find out that you really subtract your twenty five eighths you're adding that back you're undoing the distribution here we kind of did the same thing with our even with our r1 you said hey 1 times 1/9 is one knife you need to subtract adding the 1/9 three times 36 is whatever that was one twelfth year I'm doing the 112 negative two times twenty five sixteenths is negative twenty five eighths okay we're adding twenty five eighths you're undoing that distribution then we're gonna combine our like terms which are constants over here we're going to factor as X minus it's already factored you already have X minus 5/4 squared we know that we had a negative two and then we're from a on senior twenty five eighths minus seven minus thirty-one eights and that looks really nasty but if you had to complete the square our function written as a completed square it's pretty darn nasty if you had to set that equal to zero you could use that to now find whatever your your x-intercepts would be there they'd still be some x-intercepts there they're gonna be kind of ugly but you could certainly find them so I hope this makes sense I hope at least what it does illustrate the way to complete the square it works not that you use it all the time so Matthew cut anything on this lesson it was it's this number one completing the square is taking factor and making it happen number two when it gets hard like this mostly for finance internships we're going to be using quadratic formula that's the way that we do it we look at this and say can you use the square root method if not try factoring if not go to quadratic formula complete the square roots of rare that we do it to find x-intercepts I taught it to you so that it wouldn't be the scary thing and because you do use it as you go to later on in mathematics oh I hope I've got a good job explain that to you hope you guys are having a wonderful day and next video I'm going to show you a proof of what the quadratic formula comes from by completing this work you 

Transcript for: Proving the Quadratic Formula - Twice (Precalculus - College Algebra 20)
hey welcome to another video so in this video I'm going to give you a quick a Leonard version of quick proof of the quadratic formula so well I've really been hurt hearing me say over the past few videos is that there's really three techniques we actually use to solve quadratics we use the square root method we use factoring and then we use the quadratic formula so why are there four techniques the completing the square we rarely rarely use that why well number one what the completing the square does is it gives you what the square root method is based on so when you're when you're doing the square root method a lot of times it's based on someone who's already done the completing the square idea so is it valuable absolutely the quadratic formula does not work without that completing the square idea behind it but the problem is is that as you learn man we just did an over our video on completing the square because it's sometimes teachers even me make you learn completing the square because it is valuable later like with lots of functions we do completing the square on even though we're not sewing for x-intercepts so is it that you've learned yes is it valuable to have like always in the front of your mind when you're doing quadratics no no it's not so here's the process I want you to go through when you are solving quadratic equations for X intercepts number one get on one side in order first you're positive C equals zero and see if the square root method works if it doesn't try factoring if it doesn't pretty much get completely squared less it's one of the really really easy ones and then you didn't go to quadratic formula why is because what the completing the square does if we do it on a general function of general quadratic ax squared plus BX plus C in this this general form standard form and we do completing the square it's going to give us a formula and that's what we're do today so I'm going to show you where the quadratic formula comes from in terms of completing the square so that we never really have to do completing square again unless unless you're forced to by it by some specific thing that's saying you gotta do it so here's what it works on a walk through it and then we'll have this very nice formula will practice in another video so this is let's suppose if we wanted to find x-intercepts so what does the quadratic formula work well with it works with quadratics and it does exactly one thing and find it finds x-intercepts zeros or roots wherever they exist whether they're imaginary whether they're one solution so samesies twice or whether they are there's two real solutions so two actual x-intercepts so it works all the time so factor doesn't work this is your best friend completing the square was a little bit too slow so here's how we go about doing it we're gonna do complete the square exactly the same way i taught you my last videos so how that work is we look at this is said hey is the square root method gonna work no no it's not because i can isolate a power to but with x's other places that's a problem it's factoring gonna work maybe but we know that factor doesn't work all the time there's no general way to factor besides this we're gonna make factory work how does how happen completing the square forces of factory to work for you do you remember that it forces that to happen and so we're gonna force factor to happen it's called completing the square what we did with that is we grouped our X terms and we held off our constant term and we're gonna do the same exact thing the next thing we did we said you know what we really want this shortcut to work with our a being one so that when we develop the factory it's very easy to see what what we need to have in order to make the factory work for that reason we factor out our a so we factor under a factory means divide so x squared divided by x squared DX divided by a is B over ax well you notice if we distribute that that's ax squared that's let's see the over a times a is BX and then we have this the spot where what happens in that spot well what we notice less not last video is that we really need this to be factorable if this is gonna factor and if we need to keep this as three terms this would be my middle term so that's my middle term bigger if that's my middle term we understood that man if I want this to be a perfect square trinomial factor or something that's the same factor times the same factors so they can get it power to I would need exactly the same numbers here now remember these numbers have to add in this one they have to add to my middle term so these numbers have to be the same and they have to add to that number it's going to be exactly half of whatever the value is so it's half of B over a how do you find half of a fraction is you either divide the numerator by 2 or you multiply the denominator by two now we don't know what B is so I'm not going to divide the numerator by 2 I'm going to multiply the denominator remember the multiplication and division are multiplication is that is divisible by reciprocal and division is multiplication that reciprocal is it's the same same concept that you kind of do this different place so we would have B over instead of dividing the numerator I'm going to multiply the denominator by B over 2a hey B over 2a plus B over 2 a is 2 B over 2a that's gonna be B over a the twos are going to cancel so well now we're very close so we have this is a trinomial it's just missing a piece I want this two factors of perfect square something times itself so X plus something and X plus that same thing so they get in perfect square that would complete the square giving you this ability to do a completely a.m. for men so in order for that happen oh I gotta have this seed actually work so how these work is a times C one time that's wife everyday one times whatever is missing has to go here but whatever it was here needs to be the multiplication of these two pieces we understood that from factory that these two pieces need to add to this and multiply to this we're creating the C so that that will happen so let's multiply it if we know that this needs to be the product of these two numbers then this needs to be B squared over 4a squared do these add to B over a yes do these multiply to B squared over 4a squared yes it's just that that's that's missing here that's what we're gonna put in there by the way if you didn't watch the last video the reason why we need this number to be one is because these two values multiplied to a times C well we're trying to find the C so this wasn't one we'd have to define out whatever that number is and basically that's what the factor does at the very beginning anyhow so we divide it out so we don't have to do it later so we're gonna say yeah hey because that's one one time C is this number since we have one divided by one this is our C we're gonna add it right here now there's a couple things that we can do with this a right now we could divide here and here and here or we could leave it here divide it really doesn't matter I'm gonna leave it because that's the technique I showed you in the last video I'm gonna leave it but there is a little issue you see we added B squared over 4a squared and we're gonna have to undo that where we added it to we added it inside this expression and when we went in last video was that because this is multiplied by some number we have to this with the distribution so whatever this a is I would multiply this a times B squared over 4a squared and undo whatever we get so eight times B squared over 4a squared is B squared over 4a so notice I added B squared over 4a squared but this would automatically be distributed that a would cancel out one of those A's so I'm gonna undo that this says you add it really you added this value B squared over 4a I'm gonna undo that whatever we do in an equation we need to undo somewhere either on opposite sides which we couldn't have done or in the same side the only reason why I'm choosing the same side it's because that's what I showed you in the last video because that models better what you do later mathematics would be complete the square inside a function itself without having to set an equal to zero so it looks a little weird why is that not a power - why not because you really didn't add this you added after you distribute you had to be squared over 4a that's what we're undoing we just have a couple more things to do number one thing we're going to combine our like terms here so these are both constants notice they're all constants all our X's are sugar or you can combine that in order to combine it you need a common denominator so we've got an a we've got an x squared B over a X B squared over 4a squared which we know exactly what that's going to factor as that's going to be X plus B over 2a and another X plus B over 2a minus B squared over 4a plus plus C but we also want that seed to have a common denominator with 4 a so instead of just C we're going to give it a common ometer 4ac over 4a remember that if you have an LCD at for a and this is a do not one you can multiply both the numerator by whatever this is the LCD is for eight and now that we have a common denominator working start solving for 4x so or into a couple things right now number one we know that this is going to factor because we made it work we made this out of this factorization so we know it's going to factor as X plus B over 2a squared we know that we're gonna have an a out front still we're also going to put this stuff on the other side of our equation so we're going to add a squared over 4a we're gonna subtract 4ac over 4a so we've shown that this was factorable we just we just factor right now we know that this completes this factorization therefore we get X minus the plus this and X plus this we have X plus B over 2a squared we kept our a we added B squared for a table size we subtracted for IC over 4a m both sides and now we're ready we're almost done we're going to divide by a in just a moment first we're gonna get that expression on the right-hand side of our equation on one fraction so B squared minus 4ac divided by four days there's only two more thing three more things we're going to do number one we need to take square root but you cannot do it with that a being there we have to divide both sides by a when we divide by a on the left hand side divided by a we're just going to get X plus and B over 2a on the right hand side when you divide both sides by a dividing by a is the same thing as multiplying by one over a in other words you multiply your denominator you're going to get 4a squared we're so close now we're gonna take a square root on both sides with the plus and minus so square root both sides with a plus and minus we've been doing this for a long time now we have X plus B over 2a on the right-hand side we get a plus and minus but notice how the denominator is a perfect square so our numerator we're going to leave this as b squared minus 4ac no problem denominator square root of 4 is 2 square root of H squared that's a square inside of the square root that's a then we're going to subtract B over 2a from both sides and by the nature of having a really really convenient common denominator we need to make this one fraction and so we get this negative B sine floats up plus or minus sine floats over square root of b squared minus 4ac numerators on the numerator no problem all over remember to keep their denominators the same and then subtract the fractions all over 2a that right there's a quadratic formula and if you've never seen it before way probably has seen it somewhere this is a proof of where it comes one way to do the proof of where this comes from by completing the square I might give you an optional proof in just a minute just to show you a different way to look at it because sometimes the / H screws people up here so I'll give you a different way to look items in just a minute but what that does that does the same thing as the screw method the same thing as factoring and the same thing is completing the square because it is completed square it's just done it once and for all by leaving these as general coefficients and constants you find a formula that's a formula to find x-intercepts that's all it does just find x-intercepts if they happen and finds imaginary numbers if they don't have a negative inside your square root this piece called the discriminant would give you an eye that says you have imaginary or complex zeros and not real zeros so anyway we'll practice actually using that next time we'll talk about the discriminate what you would get out of that I'll come right back with an alternate proof of a race to outright that start with okay so if you're interested here's a slightly more traditional way just to show the quadratic formula from completing the square what it does it's some of the same the only thing that happens here is we divide by a right away to get rid of it and we have a fraction from the very beginning and then we complete the square sort of the same way and so what that would look like if you divide everything by a well then that becomes x squared plus B over a X plus C over a you notice I'm separating that real quick equals zero and that gives us a fresh start which take-it-or-leave-it that's just the way that we have to have that and then we complete the square with the same exact thing so we have our B over a we know that our B over two a and B over two a TS oh it's going to be given to us if we multiply that that's B squared over 4a squared this is what needs to happen to factor is it a perfect square trinomial but we're missing that piece and so that is what would get added that's what we get added here but you can see because we divided by the a there's no distribution now one times B squared over 4a squared is exactly what you'd subtract and that's the reason why some people prefer this method is because a little bit easier to see that also you can get a common denominator pretty quickly you don't have to mess around with it at all so this is factorable as X plus B over 2a squared we know that spectable because we send out we added this constant so that it would factor is that then finding a common denominator we know that we want for a squared so that's 4ac find the LCD 4ac over 4a squared and then we get everything on one side besides that perfect square and you can kind of see it come together after this if we add B squared over 4a squared plus 4ac over the same fraction we're going to get that exact same fraction taking a square root with a plus and minus we get this X plus B over 2a on the right hand side we get this plus or minus square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a because we did the same exact thing and that's it's the same from here so we subtract B over 2a we put it on one fraction due to that really nice common denominator and we're done that's a quadratic formula just slightly different way dividing by a first sometimes it's a little bit cleaner but I gave you the first way because that mimics exactly what we did in the previous videos so I hope that makes sense I hope you explained where the quadratic form that comes from and how what is used for so next time we show how it how it's used and exactly how to fill that thing out knead it properly see you for the next video you 

Transcript for: Using the Quadratic Formula (Precalculus - College Algebra 21)
hi welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the quadratic formula we're going to talk about how to use it I'll give you a very nice way to set up the formula that way you can do the same thing every time get a process for it and how our solutions would look when we when we finish up the B idea of the quadratic formula so we're going to continue we're working on quadratic equations we're setting them equal to 0 to find the x intercepts and that's exactly what the quadratic formula does it is the same thing that factoring does does the same thing that the square root method does does the same thing that completing the square does except that it works all the time you see the square root method only works some of the time if you can somehow find part of your function with all your XS raised to the second power and you can solve for a constant other side take a square root you're good to go factor it only works some of the time over integers well this the completing the square method works all the time but we found out the last video that and it can be brutal and so what we did is we learned that the quadratic formula is sort of completing the square universally all the time I proved it in the last video and that's what we got out of it so I'm going to show you exactly how to use it I'm not going to go through the proof again because we've already done that this is more just an explanation of how this stuff works and what we should be getting the end of the quadratic formula so let's take a look at our first function f of X equals 3x squared minus 5x plus 1 this is of course a quadratic it is a parabola we can tell it's upward-opening because our a is positive and it's a little bit narrower or has a vertical stretch to it because our a is 1 than 1 and so what we're going to do is we're going to look at this throughout the the lens of how do I find x-intercepts with this that's the only thing that the quadratic formula ever does is finds x-intercepts for you or forces it to factor then that's that's kind of what we think of this as so if we're gonna find x-intercepts the way we do that with every function ever is to set this thing equal to zero now there's one thing that you've heard me say over and over and over again is when we set up the quadratic is solving for x intercepts and we're going to use the screw that or we're going to use factory or we're going to use quadratic formula even completing the square we want everything on one side which is going to be if you have this set equal to zero in order which means that we want our exponents of our terms to decrease to be decreasing which it is and we want the first term positive let me be very specific here with the quadratic formula you don't necessarily have to have your first term positive but because you're dividing by a if that a is negative it leads a lot of students to not quite understand what to do with that negative expression that negative part of your your your fraction here your denominator and sometimes you get some sign errors so I'm going to tell you that because we use a twice in this formula and because sometimes it leads to sign errors I'm gonna have us avoid that so the idea behind solving any sort of quadratic for x-intercepts is set it equal to zero get everything on one side get it in order get your first term positive in trying the easiest things first see if the square root method will work it's not going to there's no way for us to isolate in power to with all of our X's inside and a constant on the other side we'd have to use completing the square to get that and I don't want to do that then we try to factor you spend about 10 seconds trying to factor these see if we can find two numbers an add negative five and multiply to 3 times one multiply to 3 that's not going to happen but we've checked it we've checked completing the square we've checked factoring if those don't work in general we just go directly to the quadratic formula I mentioned this a few videos ago when we did complain the square that it's very useful but for x-intercepts there's a better way to go about it because this is found by completing the square in general so here's how it works once we have this on one side in order first for positive we've checked the easy techniques the square method in factoring we identify an a of B and a C from our equation our a is always the number in front of x squared our B is the number in front of X's or coefficients and our C is the constant and they go with the sign so here's the way that I do the quadratic formula we're doing it this way for years it works really well I created pattern for myself so what I'm going to do just like Taylor Swift has a blank space we're gonna put blank spaces in for every single one of these variables and I have a pattern that I haven't made up for myself like you should to fill it out so but what the quadratic formula really looks like before we start filling things out it has some blank spaces for all of our coefficients and we just need to know what what to do with their numbers were to put our coefficients in our constant so this really is the quadratic formula without any numbers plugged into it why we use print the season why I like this technique is because hopefully we understand that parentheses maintain two things that maintain signs and they maintain operations so when I have four times a times C parentheses show that but it also lets me put the sign in there and not accidentally lose anything especially with our negative or negative B if that's a negative we want to make sure we have both of the signs so I start telling the quadratic formula by using parentheses for all of our letters all of our variables and then we go through so write what is our a what sort of evils our C or a is 3 our B is negative 5 and our C is 1 so how I do this you don't have to do my way but create a pattern for yourself here's what I do I put my beef first and so what I view as a say alright I know that might be is my first two spots might be my second two spots and C is only one spot a goes last so I fill this out by saying negative 5 negative 5 3 3 and 1 and I do it the same way every single time create for yourself a pattern on how you want to do it for me that works really well I know my B's are together in my 8th or second or my C is less work so well after that honestly it's just a matter of not making sign errors we have some simplification that we're gonna have to do occasionally but for the most part its plug the numbers in and just simplify so when we do that we know the opposite of negative 5 or negative negative 5 is 5 inside of our square root whenever you square a number whether it's positive or negative you are going to get a positive number so your first value inside your square root will always become positive and then just be careful right here with this there's red is where a lot of sign errors happen if you ever have a negative in here and if you follow my technique there should only be one negative because your a should be positive based on the fact you go to one side in order first term positive this should always be a positive number this one may or may not be so in this case it's positive which means you're subtracting a positive number that subtracting 12 I'm gonna write that I'm not gonna try to do in my head because it's what my mistakes come in so we've done that and now there's just a couple more steps what we're going to do is we're going to subtract 25 minus 12 is 13 and then we're going to write this as 2 solutions after we check to make sure that we can we have simplified it so what do I mean by simplified firstly you want to check to make sure that your square root can't be can't be simplified any more there's no perfect square just factors inside your radicand in there just in the in the quadratic formula we call that something specific we call this little piece the discriminant I'm going to mention it right now just so we get out of the way what the discriminant does it tells you whether you're going to have two real solutions one real solution or two complex solutions and here's how it does it are you don't watch this for the next five examples if the discriminant the inside part of your reticle if that's positive we're going to add it then we're going to subtract it from whatever our B is that's going to give us two solutions every time two real solutions if this number is positive if this number in here is zero so if you if your discriminant is zero well you would add zero and you'd subtract sir my gosh this is the time where we get the same solution twice we have 5 plus 0 5 minus 0 both divided by 6 you get 5 6 if it's discriminant was 0 so if your discriminants positive that gives you two real solutions if you discriminate is 0 that gives you one real solution notice there's no eyes no imaginary artists if this discriminant is negative square root with a negative inside of it gives you this I gives you an imaginary or a complex solution and so far discriminant is negative you add and you subtract this is this complex imaginary number and so you get two solutions but they be complex and that would signify that you don't have any x-intercepts so again discriminating if that's positive you got two real solutions to X intercepts if that's zero you have one real solution one x-intercept that's where the vertex would balance off the x axis if that is negative you're going to get an eye and says you've completely missed the x axis either above or below that so the discriminant means that's what we use it for just check what how many solutions we get and whether they're x-intercepts or not from here we can't simplify that square root the only thing that we can do is show that this is really two solutions so we'd say this is 5 plus the square root of 13 over 6 and also we get 5 minus the square of 13 over 6 if you watch that completing the square video these are the very familiar because that's almost exactly what we get with completing the square the same look they look so similar because the way I proved it this quadratic formula comes from completing the square on this piece right there and so that's why they look very very very similar I hope that makes sense I hope you're understanding the process the process is set your function your quadratic equal to zero try the square root method try complete let's try a factoring after you've got everything in order on one side first your positive and then those two things things don't work then try the quadratic formula we pretty much skip over completing the square and unless you have a really really easy one easy ones would be like any easy ones up here we'd have x squared plus N even the plus whatever constant that would be called an easy one they'd be fairly quick to do if he understanding through the square well if not let's go directly to quadratic formula okay let's try the next one so with our with our quadratics we know that what we do to find x-intercepts is we set this equal to zero so we're going to do that but at the same time we also want to make sure that this fits our model our model says we want things in order we want things to to have a first term positive it will always be on one side if you start with function notation like we have so when we're doing this really yeah you know what I know I'm going to have this equals zero but I'm also going to distribute because I want to be able to find an A to B to C and that only happens if we have our quadratic in standard form so we want things in order on one side first your positive so that we can identify our a RB and RC don't distribute to the minus one so in our case we distributed we have this on one side it's already an order that's fantastic and our first term is positive now we would check the square root method it doesn't look like it's going to work because we don't have something raised to the second power that contains all of our X's and a constant on the other side there's no way to make that without completing the square we don't want to spend the time to do it so we're gonna check factory it are there any numbers that add to 6 and multiply to negative 3 I'm not thinking of any so if I'm not thinking of any we're gonna go directly to the quadratic formula we need to identify our a our B in our seat and we just plug and plug it into the quadratic formula we evaluated so how they evaluate create for yourself some sort of a pattern on how you like to do this and do the same way every time so I've created some blank space and I'll write your name and then we're going to plug in our a intervener seat so what i do i plug in my beef first i know my a is 3 my B is 6 my C's negative 1 I'm gonna put the B's first A's second I'll see laughs as I mentioned before if you have this on one side it over first your positive there should only possibly be one negative in these two numbers right here a would be positive you followed like my technique so this is going to be the only negative we have if that numbers negative then you're going to ultimately be adding here be very careful that it's very common for students to go oh it's 36 minus 12 is not gonna - well it's gonna be plus 12 be very very careful so now it comes down to simplification we know that x equals negative 6 there's no sign change there we just have negative whatever that number is inside of our square root of this discriminant this is going to be 36 and then because we're subtracting a negative or subtracting negative 12 that really is an addition concept this is the one mistake that students make time time again is they go so fast they try to do everything their head that they they don't catch that be very careful it take if it takes you writing this out as 36 minus negative 12 to understand that you're gonna be adding here that's fine either way but just be very careful on that all over 6 so we can't we continue simplifying I know that the negative 6 that looks really good that's fine and then the square root of our discriminant is now 48 you know what you should tell right now whether this parabola and this parabola is firstly open opening and it is a little bit narrow it's got that coefficient of 3 out there for a whether this is going to cross the x axis or not I'm looking at your discriminate we to be able to lie can immediately identify that and say hey that that's 48 that's a positive number I'm not getting eyes in it but I'm going to be adding and subtracting it so that that is not zero it's going to be negative six plus some sort of real number and they used six minus some sort of real number that's gonna give me two real numbers two real solutions to X intercepts if your discriminant is positive you were across the x axis twice there's a little bit more work for us to do you see we can't leave the square root of 48 and if you if you give this as it as a solution it's not technically wrong is it but it's the same thing as like if you left a fraction two fourths well don't really like that like people even want this to be 1/2 2/4 is 1/2 the same thing happens here we need is simplifies we those simple forms so that people can identify a little bit better so how that works we take off our square root and we try to simplify simplify by finding and perfect square factors so and the biggest one that divides 48 so we think 48 I'm not thinking 4 even though square root 4 is 2 I'm thinking 16 so the square root of 16 is the biggest perfect square that divides 48 in fact it's 16 times 3 so when we simplify that the square root of 16 that's great we can simplify to 4 the square root of 3 yeah we can't simplify that so it stays as 4 square root 3 and so we have this X I showed this to you in another video that we can continue to simplify it was in the square root method if you want to check that out but here's the way that this this happens if you can factor these two numbers then you can end simplify with this then that's possible so the lines you can't then don't do it here's what you may never - don't ever just cross out these two numbers that doesn't work what actually does work is it these values 1 2 & 3 if they all have a common factor then you can simplify that the reason is if you can factor a number out of here like 2 if you can factor it Hey now these are connected by multiplication we know that we can simplify factors when they're connected by multiplication like that we would get negative 3 plus or minus 2 root 3 over 3 you can get the same thing but you've got to divide all three of them not this one but these 3 coefficient and factor and constant so if we divide all of these by 2 negative 6 divided by 2 is negative 3 4 divided by 2 is 2 6 divided by 2 is positive 3 and we get the same thing we get that this would be negative 3 plus or minus 2 root 3 over 3 either way you go I really don't care but you do need to understand that you can't simplify just one part of that that's not okay from here maybe to try this is two solutions we know they're real they're still imaginary no there's two of them there's not a zero here so we understand it these are x-intercepts and if we wanted to approximate on a calculator people tell us about where on the x axis this parabola is going to cross twice that's about all there is those are two x-intercepts and that is all the quadratic formula ever gives us it just tells us where this quadratic has x-intercepts if it does if you if your discriminants positive you're gonna have two x-intercepts if it's zero you can have one that's where the vertex is and it was negative this we're going to see in about three examples then you're not gonna have any x-intercepts at all you have complex solutions all right let's try this next one so I was talking to Taylor Swift on the phone the other day and and I said listen I really like my two favorite songs for math and she was like what favorite songs Matt I was like oh you know the ones you wrote about evaluation functions it's just like oh right blank space I was like yes that's absolutely right because this how you do quadratic formulas with a blank space you go I got a blank space baby Rajini except it's a main right we read our a B and C but she also has another one I don't know if you know it but it goes like this it's never ever ever ever plug in fractions to the quadratic formula ever I said that's that's brilliant she goes oh man that's that's the original way I wrote the song but I didn't think it would fly as like TS I know your musically inclined and all but I disagreed like I think that would have been awesome she was like totes I don't know that means personally but I think it was like agree with me and then and then I said yeah you should rerecord except I just I just can't it's like licensed now and they're this like it's like you know copyrighted or whatever but it's great for I understand the quadratic formula don't ever ever ever plug in fractions to the quadratic feels a little bit dramatic I'm sorry about that don't ever plug in fractions to the quadratic formula well mathematically possible it makes your work ten times harder don't do it instead we know something up fractions we know that if we multiply both sides of an equation by the same number it keeps this equation equal it keeps it exactly what it what it was we also know that we can multiply it by an LCD and we'll kill off while your fractions that's brilliant so while we can't do it we can't just get rid of that fraction that was the drawback of the completing the square method if you remember that we had lots of fractions and they were horrifying so instead of that instead I'm gonna do that why don't we just use the quadratic formula why don't we set this equal to zero like we would do for every finding x-intercepts technique we used to have this in order we have the first term positive but before we do anything with it before we even check for square method by the way it won't work here before we do factory it wouldn't work here anyway but we would check with a fraction anyhow before I even think about completing the square and we actually did that problem completely square we're gonna get rid of all our fractions especially new quadratic formula get rid of your fractions find your LCD in this case it's to multiply both sides by that two distribute it it's gonna get rid of all your fractions so move in 8 6 x squared + 2 X don't forget that minus 1/2 times negative 1/2 is negative 1 we write minus 1 on the right hand side you still have 0 because 0 times any sort of number is going to give you 0 this is so much easier to work with I don't care what you're doing do this first so if you're setting functions equal to 0 and solving them get rid of your fractions first multiply by the LCD this is way back to like intermediate algebra sort of stuff this is what we do all the time let's get rid of arc our denominators by using an LCD on both sides of an equation from here everything works nicer so if you wanted to do the square root method it worked better here even complain the square would work sort of work better here you didn't have one fraction for a while if you want to do factory and we definitely work better here if it was factorable now we would try it but there's no numbers that add to 2 and multiply to negative 6 we can't do that so we do quadratic formula this is even nicer don't ever ever plug in fractions to the quadratic form implicit ever so we know that this is one side in order first we positive we got rid of our fractions we have an A and a B and C well we're gonna plug these into the quadratic formula because that's really our last and best choice and so we're gonna find our a which is 6 our B which is 2 our C which is negative 1 are you gonna plug him in so B comes first I put 2 + 2 is next I put 6 + 6 C is last I put negative 1 I'm really careful here I understand my head that that's a negative so I'm going to be adding be very careful again if you do this if your first terms positive like I've told you to do then the only number that can be negative here is not like that we'll change this to an addition and not a subtraction problem that's why they come with a technique in it so we can do the same thing every time and not run into two mistakes when we don't expect them so negative 2 no problem plus or minus we got it 2 squared is 4 we already determined this what we're going to be subtracting and negative that's going to be adding 24 all over 12 we keep on simplifying that's 28 we're going to have to simplify the square root of 28 we're looking for it before the biggest perfect square that factors is a factor of that number so we can take the square root of it in this case the biggest perfect square the device when it is actually 4 so if we simplify that square root of 4 to 2 we can't simplify the service 7 stays there what we get is this negative 2 plus or minus 2 square root 7 over 12 you should be answering your head right now whether this parabola and is a parabola that's upward bumping a little bit narrow has one x-intercept two x-intercepts or no x-intercepts your discriminant will tell you that right here it will tell you that that number is positive this is going to give us two real solutions than therefore two x-intercepts wear this proudly bounces twice all we're gonna do now is simplify it two ways you can go if you want to factor out 2 and simplify 2 with 12 you're gonna get a big one plus some is 1 that's 4 over 7 over 6 or you can divide all three of these numbers by 2 2 divided by 2 is 1 & 1 & 6 we would never write one root 7 so I could write even one X it's implied that there's a factor of 1 and out in front of that so we know we don't really need that all we going to do now is understand these are two real solutions we're going to write both of them so our negative one plus skirt 706 and negative 1 minus root step number six if you need an approximation be careful on your calculator the best way if I'm going to do this is put a parenthesis put negative 1 plus square root of 7 and the parenthesis and then press divide by 6 and then same thing parenthesis negative 1 minus square root of 7 in parenthesis divided by 6 now give you a nice approximation all at one time let's go on to the last one again we see some fractions it is a quadratic it's quite wide isn't it because we have got 1/8 in there that 1/8 says you have a vertical compression its widened out this parabola we'd have a y-intercept with negative 2 and start talking about that I'm practicing in another section for us but let's go ahead let's see if we can set this equal to 0 if we can get everything on one side in order first compositive kill off our fractions and then see if we can use an appropriate technique right now you should be trying that so here we go whenever we want to find x-intercepts and that's what the quadratic formula does we're going to set the function equal to zero so in our case we've got that on one side we've got the in order can you see it can you see the importers x squared then exponet constant we have the first term positive which is great that's what we want we want to set that up even if you start off with a negative first term remember that once you set it equal to 0 it doesn't care whether you have negative first or you change all your signs x-intercepts don't change when you reflect the function about the x axis so we set this equal to zero and change all their signs yeah it's going to look like the parabola reflects itself but the x-intercepts don't care and that's one nice technique we can use to make sure the first term is always positive very nice okay so we have an order first you're positive no problem the French is gonna kill us man we don't want fractions here fractions aren't horrifying to plug into the quadratic formula we definitely don't want to do factoring we don't factor with fractions you don't do anything with fractions and equations for though and so we have this equation with zero on one side use your LCD in this case it is 8 multiplied both they distribute the 8 and then simplify your fractions so we would get x squared the 8 and 1/8 are going to give us 1 minus 2x 8 times 1/4 is 2 minus 16 do not forget that you need to distribute that 8 times negative 2 is negative 16 - right - and then 0 times 8 is 0 so we're showing that because that's valid right we need to make sure we multiply the same thing on both sides of our equation and that's how to use the LCD to get rid of your fractions but zero times any constant is going to see what times anything so you can give us this zero well now we're ready for it so the first thing we check man does a square root method work and it doesn't we can't get a power to isolate with all of our X's on one side and constants on the other without doing the special thing you give completing the square we don't want to do that second thing we try to factoring can we think of anything looks like it at first glance that adds negative two and multiplies in a you 16 remember that that's a different that have to be different signs there 16 and 1 no that is a mag native - 8 - no 4 and 4 no so there's nothing that's going to factor for us now is our time to use a quadratic formula so we're skipping completing the square even though it might actually be kind of easy here because the quadratic formula is like it's like a fail-safe just plug in another detail So Ra Ra is 1 don't forget that there is a coefficient in front of x squared our B's negative 2 and our C's negative 16 maths we're going to evaluate into our quadratic formula so we know that now when we do our our beef first Sorby is negative 2 negative 2 ra next that's 1 and 1 RC less that's negative 16 I'm noticing right now that's a negative number that's the only thing they can possibly negative here because we have our first trip possible a time that means we're going to add this yet again so I'm going to be very careful because you have some sign changes here opposite of negative 2 or negative negative 2 is positive 2 instead of our square root be careful negative 2 squared is 4 not negative 4 it's very easy for students and make little sign errors we're not going to be subtracting 64 we're gonna be adding 64 and lastly 2 times 1 is 2 kind of on a homestretch here we're gonna combine 4 with 64 man right now you gotta be seeing in the back right there is a positive number that's two real solutions two x-intercepts we're just gonna simplify them to make them a little bit easier so oh man what goes into 68 looks like 17 goes into 68 17 and 4 so 4 is a perfect square 4 times 17 is 68 let's simplify it so the square root of 4 is 2 square root of 17 yeah you can do it as a prime number there's no perfect square in there that we can even factor out that's why we chose the 4 and then we're gonna rewrite this a little bit and we are almost done all we've got to do is simple but so whether you factor the 2 out and then cross out the two that are in factor like that factor it out you have a one factor that you can have a 1 to simplifies of the 2 or you'd like the other technique of hey let's just survive three numbers by the same thing so divide them all by the greatest common factor they all three have common two divided by two is one and one and one whatever we're gonna do here we're going to end up with one plus or minus the square root of 17 we already talked about the discriminant but now we can really see it there's no I here we're adding and subtracting something that's nonzero so we are getting two distinct solutions they happen to be real and that is exactly where this parabola that's a very wide parabola is going to cross the x-axis those aren't your zeros or your roots one thing that I want to say is those are called exact solutions so even though they don't make a lot of sense to us as far as a decimal number because they're not a decimal number we have to approximate to get that this is called exact when you start evaluating on your calculator what one plus the square root of 17 is it gives you a decimal that is actually an approximation the square root of 17 goes forever it doesn't repeat for any length of time it's not a fraction it's an irrational number and so we can't write it as a decimal and contain all of its information the square root of 17 contains all of that information that's what's called exact the approximation when you say oh my calculator says this number around I do the decimal place we've just rounded it haven't you I mean you've cut off a big portion of that number today goes forever that's an approximation there so keep that in mind this would be an exact form of your solution also one more thing that this is another very strange but keep in mind these are x-intercepts so what this really is this is a point this gives you a point on the x axis X comma zero because you are on the x axis the same thing for all of these these are all points in the loop very strange to write but this point would be negative 3 plus 3 which you burned 3 over 3 comma 0 as a point on the x axis it's kind of weird but that's what this is giving you it is X intercepts nd that didn't ever leave your mind so we're gonna come back and just a second I'm gonna give you two more examples talking about when imaginary zeros happen how to change a sign if your first term is negative and then where your descriptive 0 would come in so we'll be right back alright last couple problems so we're looking at two more quadratics do some special things that I want to talk about we already know about the discriminant that if the discriminant the inside of that radical when you're doing the quadratic formula that's positive we need two real solutions I'm going to show you when you get one real solution I'm going to show you when you would get no real solutions and also on this one if your first term is negative how to deal with that and make the quadratic formula work just a little bit better so you don't have to divide by negative in either case we're going to set this equal to 0 like we do every time we're trying to find x-intercepts and we want to make sure it's on one side of course is going to be we set a equals zero in order it is an order with the first term positive and that's true then we would try the square method isn't working factory it actually wouldn't work it would work here factoring works very well if you have a discriminant of 0 most of the time it's fine and so sometimes you don't make it that far so I'm going to show you if we didn't see the factory or if we just didn't want to that the quadratic formula would give you the 0 indiscriminate and that's exactly what that means so our a would be 9 our B's negative 6 and our C is 1 let's plug that into the quadratic formula maybe we missed the factory or something so the first thing we're gonna do I'm gonna thank my aides be might see I'm sorry I'm an agent now in my B's negative six my becomes first my a is next my C is less right now I'm seeing that these are positive numbers I'm going to be subtracting 36 not adding opposite of negative 6 is 6 plus or minus the square root of will have a positive 36 minus 36 and we see the 0 right there so we end up getting 6 plus or minus 0 over 18 and here's what we were talking about a long time ago what happens with a double root or something that would factor as this expression squared it has what's called a multiplicity of 2 we talked about multiplicity a little bit later and that multiplicity is this I give a repeated root a repeated factor and it tells us something about this it tells us that on that particular x intercept that comes from that factor you're going to be bouncing or touching the x-axis we're not crossing it and this is what this says if the discriminant is 0 you will be bouncing or touching of the x axis in this case because we only have one turning point a Verta parabola can only turn one time that turning point that vertex is going to be touching by sitting on bouncing off of the x axis and exactly this value you see we get the same solution twice that 18 is the only number you can add subtract another number to get let's call the additive identity you get the same number back whether you added or subtracted that's one third and again one third this is the only real solution is one-third it's not imaginary there's no I in it there's not two of them so this is the only time that you would get one x-intercept and one solution from right there if you're just screaming it is zero that's what that tells you I just want to make sure everybody get rid of that one more time all right last one we have something that looks kind of nasty it's in order but when we set this equal to zero everything is negative and especially the only negative everything's negative but especially the first term is negative that really hurts for factoring that's not so great for the quadratic formula and so when that happens let's divide everything by negative let's make sure first term is positive the reason why it's because we're the a sits on your quadratic formula is on the denominator and also in here so this is negative it starts messing with our signs inside our discriminant can screw us up if this is negative it really starts to mess with our signs of a fraction so when we change our a from a negative to a positive we eliminate two negatives inside of our function and it sets about better for factoring if we can factor it that's why we do it so it helps us with sign in or sign errors of number one mistake in math in my experience we knew it fifteen years now and even through calculus three like 90% of the errors or sign errors just little teeny mistakes that were making so this is one way to avoid so we're going to do is we're going to imagine either factor and making it out no problem or add everything to the other side the problem or divided by negative 1 including the zero needs so get zero either any one of those things ultimately what's going to happen all of our signs change just make sure if you're changing the first sign you're changing all this nice that's important now we tried square root method at work we try factoring that's also not going to work there's nothing to adds to one multiply 16 4 times 4 but the quadratic formula always works we really wouldn't want to do completing the square here can you imagine that you definite this number back you divide by for you to find half of that this one succeeds in square that's one over 256 then added and then factor and then subtract and then divide and then take a square root plus a class and then subtract again Betim as a the quadrant from the desert forest automatically so with our a being for our baby being one in our sea being four we can plug this in very nicely there's no negatives there's no fractions that's great we don't want any of those things no negatives are for RA especially and we create some blank spaces for all of our coefficients and our constant we're going to plug these entities or whatever pattern you feel most confident with for me I like to look at my beam ideas run my a is for my C is also for and it goes last that's really quick that's really easy it's very efficient that's speed with accuracy then we start simplifying negative one no problem I know that's mean 81 plus or minus the square root of I know I'm going to be subtracting here because none of these numbers are negative so when I swear the one I get one I subtract four to the third power 64 over eight and I'm going to be very careful 1 minus 64 cannot be 63 its negative 63 that negative is very important it's the difference between your parabola which is actually downward opening crossing and completely missing now I sit something important that's got to sink in this parabola decidedly is downward opening and it's narrow because it has this vertical stretch the absolute value a is more than 1 it is being stretched out its downward opening but it's not going across the x-axis when we change your signs you might be thinking waiting that's upward opening you screwed it up I might have screwed up the look of the parabola if we were actually graphing this with Manama we understand that is our parabola this is just a way to use the quadratic formula better and what's the quadratic form of the giddy x-intercepts that's it so if that's the case when you take a parabola and you start reflecting it about the x axis the numbers on the x axis cannot change reflection about the x axis takes Y values and change well the y-value of an x intercept is zero changing the sign of the zero doesn't change the x intercept that's why we can do it we can change the sign of this right here and not affect the x intercepts and that's all we care about for the quadratic formula so I mean go so x equals this is gonna get of 1 plus or minus square root of negative 63 over maybe we got our sign right and right now we should understand what this is telling us the discriminant is negative you aren't going to get an eye man if you don't have an eye you're not seeing your problem very well you're welcome we have to be able to see that this is going to give us an eye right there if your question says how many real solutions you get you say zero there are no real solutions here how many x-intercepts are gonna have none this is not gonna cross the x-axis at all say me to touch it what we do need to do if you're asked for complex solutions we do need is simplify it so we're gonna think about this we're gonna pull out that negative 1 because that's the value that gives us I times Oh let's see here 9 has the largest number that we can take a square root of that divides 63 and so this is going to give us square root of 9 is 3 square root of negative 1 is I square root of 7 is the square root 7 that's how that simplifies so we're gonna have this x equals negative 1 plus or minus 3i square root of 7 all over 8 we cannot simplify that at all this is in the proper order we like coefficient then I then square root where appropriate but we are going to write this as 2 solutions to complex solutions to non x-intercepts now can you give me an approximation for it no no our our calculators we can't really find a value to approximate this as it on a number line because this isn't going on number line there are ways to to show cognitive graph complex numbers but not on XY axis because that is a real number line in both the vertical and horizontal directions so this is it's as good as we can get to represent that this parabola was just downward-opening completely misses our x-axis I hope that makes sense I hope I've Illustrated a nice way to do quadratic formula talk through the very specifics of what it is that you are doing and how the best approach that so well then I sense out I'll see you for the next video when we talk about intersections of functions had set them equal to find out where they cross each other which is kind of interesting see you for that you 

Transcript for: Finding Intersections of Functions (Precaluclus - College Algebra 22)
hi welcome to another video so this would be pretty quick this is just about finding the intersection of two functions so I need to tell you how to do that show you what it is that we're doing what we're finding and that you should it should end with well an ordered pair because when two functions intersect we get a point so that's what we're going to talk about this video so we have just three examples if you've ever asked to find the intersection of two functions well what we want to do is set those functions equal so if the functions are the output of some set of some an algebraic expression where we plug in a number get an output if we set our outputs equal so basically this gives us an output this is the output we set them equal we find out what X values will take to give the equal outputs and by doing that we find out the points of intersection on two functions so in other words just so equal so we're gonna say hey when this function equals this function we're gonna have an intersection and so we do that now what we're finding what this really is if you think about it this is a parabola that's upward opening and this is a constant which is a horizontal line so really what we're finding on some parabola and some horizontal line if those things intersect it will be found by saving the functions equal and we'll find the points of intersection at X comma Y so we we set the function equal saying hey we want the Y vice or outputs to be the same find X this said the x-values that give us those equal outputs and that's going to give us the points where the x's are the same and Y is the same in both of our functions so when we do that we're gonna see some things that are really familiar so we're gonna see stuff that seems like it's from might may be intermediate algebra when you set functions equal to another you look at what I do to solve that well with anything power 2 or higher one of the best things we have is factoring or using some of the rational zeros properties we have later on what we do is we get everything at one side we get it in order we the first term positive I know this sounds familiar and then we try to factor it or use a screw manthe or if we can't do those things we quadratic formula so we want to get everything on one side in order first term positive and zero on the other side so that the zero product property works if we can factor it or quadratic formula works as we can so we'd subtract three and I want you to understand what happens when we do that I'm gonna write this a little funny I want you to notice my original parabola is this x squared plus 6x plus 3 it's got a y-intercept of 3 look at 0 you see that now what happens when I subtract the 3 disgustin basically it shifts this parabola down and it says alright if you shift this parabola down the original parabolas subtract 3 would shift it down 4 units by finding the x intercepts of this function it's like finding the intersection of these two functions so if we it's kind of difficult to think of where this problem crosses the y equals 3 line of G of x equals 3 but if I shift it down 3 units and think well you know what just shifting the struggle it down so that it's kind of sitting on the x axis the X intercepts are very easy to find so if I find any x intercepts of this function we inherently find out the x-values where these two phones to intersect the y-value see how we have to plug it in our X's but this will give us at least the x-values where our functions are going to intersect by finding the x intercepts of a shifted down parabola now how we solve it number one we'd always try to the square root method and it's not going to work because we can't isolate a power 2 without getting the X on the other side but we can do the next step would be factor remember that we can always factor a GCF if one exists here it does we factored X and because we got everything on one side we have a zero on the right hand side the zero product property works says yeah we got a couple factors set e 2202 problem every factor that has a variable gets set equal to zero and we get two solutions we x equals zero of course and subtract six we hit x equals negative six not now listen carefully what this is what this represents these represent the x-intercepts for this function like because you set it equal to zero but what it also represents is the x-values where this function and this function intersect so this will intersect at x equals zero and x equals negative six well we want to do is go a little bit further we want to take those values and find the ordered pairs of intersection where the points you're trying to find a point here of where these two graphs intersect so what we're going to be able to say you know what from the x equals zero and x equals negative six we should be able to plug those into one of our functions or both of our punches if you actually want to check your work and see that this actually gives us what we want so we're gonna create an ordered pair 0 comma some number and negative 6 comma some number because that will be our points of intersection from our graph stemming from the fact that we found the x-intercepts of Meshuga down parabola if we plug in 0 here we get 0 squared plus 6 times 0 0 plus 3 is 3 you know wait a minute can I just plug in 0 here and get 3 yeah that's all the point right that's a that's a constant so where this parabola would intersect this constant of 3 would have to be at a y-value of 3 in fact we could just put 3 here we know it's going to intersect at something comma 3 because that's the only place a horizontal line that's on the output of a horizontal line is 3 in this case now what I did though is I check my work so I plug in 0 and said all right 0 plus 0 plus 3 is 3 this is also 3 that's how you check your work to make sure you have the correct intersection plug in your x value to both functions and it needs to be the same that tells you that that one x value gives you the same output on both functions that has to be a common point between the two and therefore an intersection try negative 6 negative 6 squared is positive 36 and 6 times negative 30 negative 6 is negative 36 36 plus negative 36 plus 3 three also we play them here well there's no place to plug it in it's what's called a constant and you get three so we know that these two points are the two points of intersection of this parabola and that horizontal line that's what we are doing when we're setting two functions equal is refining the points of intersection that's how you do it okay let's move on a little bit we have two other functions here we've got f of x equals negative two x squared plus one we've got G of x equals three X plus two before we go and find the intersection I want to understand what we're doing you need to know what that shape sort of looks like you need to recognize it is a parabola it's power - but it's downward opening so this graph looks like this somewhere on an XY coordinate plane I don't really care right now we're going to find the points of intersection but I just want to get the picture together what you're doing this function is that a parabola doesn't have a power to what it does have is a slope and y-intercept this isn't slope-intercept form it has a wider set of two it's got a slope of 3 so this is some sort of climbing functions climbing line it's a long line because it has a sloping line except it's in that linear equation form if this intersects that's about where it's gonna go to be so we're going to intersect this is a downward-opening problem with some sort of a line and that's exactly what we're finding how to find that they've set the functions equal so we'd have negative 2x squared plus 1 equals 3x plus 2 from here yeah we don't need to keep the same nature of what these are I don't really care that it's a parabola and a line this is what you're finding this is what you're going to know when you solve this but how to solve it doesn't care about keeping these forms in order to solve this we're basically you're gonna change this to a different problem find out what where that parabola crosses the x-axis and then those x-intercepts are going to represent the x coordinates of the points like we did the previous example so what I mean by all that is managed do the same thing we've been doing let's get everything on one side let's get it in order let's get the first term positive let's see the square root method works if not let's see if we can factor if so great we're gonna be able to fact this if not we use the quadratic formula but in all those cases you want zero on one side first now let's see if Procrit I should move the stuff from the right to the left or the stuff from the left to the right well it seems better to move the things from the left to the right so that our first term becomes positive we want the x squared term to be the first term because it has the largest power so if we add two x squared and subtract one so adding 2x squared and 2x squared subtracting one we get one now we have this set up to look like a differently yes this is an upward-opening parabola and set equals zero it's finding x-intercepts but because we set this equal this stemmed from this idea the aect as we get here even though they represent x-intercepts for this function they'll represent intersection values of x for these two functions so we sold it the same exact way square root method not gonna work Factory yeah the factory is gonna work we know that we'd have 3 and 2 times 1 gives us 2 we're adding to 3 or multiplying the two they both have to be positive they have to be 2 of 1 so that adds a 3 multiply C to I love the shortcut for this at this point in our factoring lives we can use pretty much anything we want I like doing the shortcut and simplifying I showed this to you in another video one factor here will be look at your denominator you don't understand one factor will have one X and then you add one this fraction says the number says you'll have two x's in one factor and you'll add one also we learned that if we just change these signs it will give us our X values you can do that to the factory in itself isn't really valuable for us right now it's just getting us those X values of our intersection points so the zero product property means that these equal to zero we'll subtract one we'll subtract one and divide by two and we noticed that's exactly what we get here this is the value one if I change the sign that's negative one here's one half change of sign that's negative one half that's great we can totally do that if you don't need to show your factory you can go directly from here to the values of your suit the x-values of your points of intersection now there is one thing that we want to make sure that we do we don't want to leave it just as next values whenever you find in intersections we want to leave them as points who want to get the point here so to do that I'm going to plug in negative one I'm going to do it to both of my functions why is that necessary no but it's a good idea so that we can check our work so if I plug in negative one negative one squared is positive 1 positive 1 times negative 2 it's going to give us a negative two negative two plus one is negative one if I take negative one the same value plug it in here three times negative one is negative three plus two is negative one so I took this one x value I plugged it into both of my functions just to make sure that that gave me the same output that totally verifies that this is a point of intersection for both of our functions so this is it looks like this point on our on our graph let's plug in negative one half if we plug in negative 1/2 negative 1/2 to both of our functions negative 1/2 times 3 is negative 3 halves plus 2 is positive 1/2 now we better get the same thing if we plug in negative 1/2 to our x value here negative 1/2 squared is positive 1/4 1/4 times negative 2 is negative 1/2 plus 1 is positive 1/2 so we know that this value plug into both of our functions gives us 1/2 that's the other point of intersection so let's see that would look something like scales a little off but plug in negative one get up negative one plug in negative one half get up positive one half that's about where that function crosses the other function where those two functions intersect the x and y axes aren't exactly right we're kind of showing you a a very loose visual interpretation of what's going on that's the downward-opening parabola this is that positive slope in line and we're finding where those things cross do it in kind of a cool way so let's come back we'll do we'll do one more example all right last one and then what we've got here we have two parabolas and we're trying to see where those things intersect one of them is upward opening but a little bit stretched vertical stretches to be narrow one of them is a normal sort of parabola not vertically stretched at all so we have one like this and one like that and we're going to find out these two points of intersection how we do it every time to settle and we're going to go through the same process we do for solving for every single thing that has a power two or more we're going to get everything on one side in order first term positive let's see if we can screw a method factor or quadratic formula if we have quadratics so let's get this stuff on the Left moved over to the right by adding or subtracting respectively because that has a larger coefficient we're going to do that we don't want to move this over here or first term would be negative so we're gonna subtract x squared add X and subtract 1 of course it gives us a 0 which is really nice if factoring a quadratic form is necessary we need that zero and it looks like this is going to factor but I want to talk about what if it didn't square root methods off the table here we can't do that we definitely don't want to do completing the square if we don't have to because we have some easier ways to go about doing that so factoring to be number one and we do know that this is going to factor because we can find some numbers that add to negative two and multiply to one times negative 15 that's going to be a positive 3 and negative 5 that adds to negative 2 that multiplies to negative 15 if that didn't work right now you'd be doing the quadratic formula and well you wouldn't find very nice values for your X in this case X intercepts and what we're really in the context of the problem X values of the points intersection they wouldn't be nice but they wouldn't be accurate so the quadratic formula gives us things that are sort of hard to manipulate but they are very important be able to find so if this did not factor you do quadratic formula right now and you'd have the X values from them of your points of intersection what would be awkward is trying to plug them in and find an output that's where this would get offered that's why most of the time these things are factorable so that you don't end with stuff from quadratic formula because can you imagine I'm making this up I mean what if you had like 1 plus or minus square root of 3 over 1 plus square root of 3 over 2 and 1 minus root of 3 over 2 something they could easily get from the quadratic formula how would you plug that in well you could do it but it's going to give you something very very awkward for your y-coordinate and we need to find ordered pairs our points of intersection that's it's all idea so that's why most of these are factorable is because you don't end with stuff that looks quadratic formula e in that up you know I'm gonna stuff with radicals in it essentially if it's factorable so again factoring if it's not factorable make sure you've really tried to factor if it's still not factorable then do quadratic formula you're going to end with some nasty x-values of your points of intersection plug them in anyway don't use approximations you have to use exact values unless they specifically tell you use approximations and then of course Y so for us since this is factorable we also know our a is 1 which gives us something really nice it's a great shortcut moving use maybe double check our work x squared minus 5x plus 3 is nice to X and then minus 15 said both of these equal to zero by the zero-product property and we now have the x coordinates of our points of intersection of this parabola intersecting the other one so basically our X values of this nets if we plug them in to our functions and value it our functions at these values will find the outputs that's how functions work plug in the x key down the Y that gives you an ordered pair also we notice man if we just change these signs we get the same values you can you can do that so let's take negative 3 let's plug this in we're gonna do both of them just to make sure that we're right so negative 3 squared I'm looking at f of X that gives you 9 9 minus 9 3 that's 9 plus 3 12 12 plus 1 is 13 I'm going to write it down but I'm gonna also check over here so again 3 squared is 9 9 times 2 is 18 18 plus 9 is 27 and 27 minus 14 is again 13 so I know that this value negative 3 and both of my functions gives me out 13 that verifies that that is a point of intersection now the five is the same idea take 5 plug into both f of X and G of X this is just a check your work sort of idea so 5 squared is 25 minus 5 is 20 plus 1 is 21 that should be my output in both of these cases okay so take our 5 5 into the G of X now 5 squared is 25 25 times 2 is 50 50 minus 15 is 35 and 35 minus 14 is 21 so we know that we have 5 being plugged into both of these or evaluating both functions gives us the same output and that also verifies that the point of intersection so this is it these are the two points where one parabola crosses the other parabola that's what we're finding movie sets you folks just equal to another and that is how we find points of intersection of basically any two functions here we were just dealing with quadratics or things that turn out to be quadratic in the future though if you have any two functions you can set them equal to find points of intersection I hope that helps you I know it's kind of a quick video next time we'll talk about how we can use some quadratic methods for functions that quadratic and then we'll start stepping up and doing crafts of quadratics and some inequalities so I'll see you for that you 

Transcript for: Using Substitutions to Solve Equations (Precalculus - College Algebra 23)
hey there in this video we're gonna talk about how to solve some things and aren't quadratic with some quadratic techniques by using something called the substitution so I'm going to show you exactly what that's about when you're asked to do it typically it's something that is factorable in its nature but just doesn't look like it right away so we're going to talk about how to make a very simple substitution so that we can make something that's not quadratic into something that is so that we can normally factor it and then go backwards to find out the appropriate number of solutions for whatever polynomial we're dealing with so let's get right to it so when you're asked to solve something that's not quadratic or maybe it is but it's really wrapped up kind of funny one thing that we do to make these a little bit easier to do something called a substitution what we're looking for we're looking for a piece of our function when we set it equal to zero that is the same in the first term and the second term in the first term we want that piece to be raised to the second power and the middle term the second term we wanted to be raised to the first power and if that's the case our substitution is going to work let's take a look at the first example we're going to go right to it so here's how to approach a problem like this if we're supposed to find x-intercepts or solve this for roots or zeros the first thing we do like all the ways is written set this equal to zero now maybe our first like inclination is to distribute everything yeah the guy's mad distribute you could but it's gonna take a lot longer to do that here's what we're looking for and when a substitution will work if we can write this on one side and have a term that's being raised to the second power and some term that has a first power or a factor is more appropriate and we can have the same exact expression in some sort of parentheses like 3x plus 4 and 3x plus 4 this is what I want you to look for I want you to look at the middle term make sure that we have the same thing here in here this ratio to the first power mil turn same thing raising the second part of the first term this right here tells you what your show institution is if we substitute call this little piece and both of these expression both of these of these these terms call them something else like typically we use you but it doesn't really matter as long as it's some variable you don't already have we want to use something that's not X we're going to typically use you that kind of prepares you for doing something calling you so when you get to calculus 2 and then we can do that we call just a little little U and we substitute and all of a sudden we get back to it later and that's what we're gonna do here we're gonna call a piece of this you we're gonna make it into a quadratic that's easy to deal with with the stuff that we already know we're gonna solve it and then we're going to go back into the terms of X so this is kind of like like breadcrumbs so ever heard the story of Hansel and Gretel I never did personally so here's how Hansel and Gretel works handsome girl works in my head at least that you call something you all right let's call 3x plus for you this is like your breadcrumbs so the way that I was explaining Hansel and Gretel is Hansel and Gretel go in the forest or leave a trail of breadcrumbs they do some cool stuff and they follow the trail of breadcrumbs tapas are still there that's that's the way that works right so this is our trailer bread comes we're gonna use you to get away from 3x plus 4 so go what do you do Matt well if this is 3x plus 4 and this is 3 to the 4 which is why they have to be the same I can call both of these expressions you some sort of variable that I make up then instead of 3x plus 4 squared we have u squared we still have a minus we still have a 6 but then we can also call this U and we still the plus 9 and we still haven't equals 0 and here's the reason why I told you two things and you can see it now it was a little bit vague before because you really can't see it like we get to right here the reason why we need these two pieces to be the same in order for a substitution to change into a quadratic to work it's so that we can put the same variable both here and here we need them both of you the same so the same variable works of both spots we need this information first power and this to be raised to the second power so that we can change into a quadratic of our standard form you owe a on that thing squared you oh you have a thing to the first power this creates a quadratic for us like 99% of time this is going to be factorable if it's not factorable it is quite hard to deal with because you don't use the quadratic formula or the square root method and then we if we have radicals in there it's very difficult to get back to our original variables or at least it's it's kind of it's kind of weird-looking so most of them are factorable this one is and we know that we can use a shortcut / ur a it's already simplified and this gives us two factors and they're actually exactly the same we get and here's one of the major mistakes I see students make people oh yeah let's factor it great I'm used to this this is X minus 3 and X minus 3 and this is the one problem with our substitution if we changed from X's and to use menu is your variable that that is what you're dealing with right now it's a very common mistake you probably have seen people make this mistake if you can check and work with everybody else this is gonna happen sometimes because we're so used to deal with X's you go on done I've set this equal to 0 X is 3 it's not and if you claim in 3 up here is not gonna work what happens is that we have we have to get back to till our X's at some point but for right now we're still in the variable U we haven't used our breadcrumbs to get back out of this u forest for right now so when we get here again really really conscious the fact that we're still doing with the variable into U so this u squared minus 6t + 9 it does factor but it's u minus 3 + u minus 3 equals 0 and now we can write this as u minus 3 squared it doesn't really matter because what happens now is we're going to solve this we got this is it like on we got this equal to 0 we have everything in one side we have a the same exact expression one main squared one of the first power we do a substitution to get the same piece called a different variable it is a quadratic because we made sure that this exponent was two this one was one it forms a quadratic for is something that's fairly easy to factor and then we solve that in terms of U so if u minus 2 equals 0 then u equals positive 3 now we're not done our variable that we started with this in terms of X if we want to find x-intercepts haven't done that we found what you intercept we found a Euler set for this function sure but this is not the original so just like we use a substitution to get away from X's into you we're going to use the same exact substitution to get away from use and back into X's that's why it sounds like a trail of breadcrumbs you leave the breadcrumbs on the ground you go do something and you come back but you eventually have to use it to get back out of what you just travel into we've traveled in a new land when we made the substitution now we're going to try to travel back in the X land by using it again so u equals 3 great great but in the back of our head we know that you really means this so u equals 3 then 3x plus 4 also equals 3 this is one of those times when we're only going to get one solution even though we have a power to because we have a perfect square trinomial we have a double root a multiplicity 2 root or in toggle toggle identity videos that we're going to the same exact solution twice if we subtract 4 and divide by 3 we get x equals negative 1/3 if we check that here no it's not going to work if we check that here yes it actually is gonna work so if we do that if we check this this should plug into this expression and give us 0 and satisfy that equation let's try it so negative 1/3 is gonna be 3 times negative 1/3 let's see that's that's negative 1 negative 1 plus 4 that's 3 3 squared would be 9 plug it in here we're still going to get 3 but 6 times 3 is 18 9 minus 18 stay tonight plus 9 years is zero we know that this is a solution and the only solution to this equation and therefore this is a root 0 x intercept of this function that's what we're doing it's just one way to go about doing it that is it better than just distributing everything yeah I think so because at least spent a lot of time doing that to get the same exact answer so it's one way to sort of shortcut some other techniques and treat this as a very simple quadratic for the time being by using the substitution then at the very end once we've solved this in terms of that dummy variables let me just pick you or Y of whatever it's not the variable of your function we have to go back and solve in terms of the variable you've been given in general we're gonna get whatever that exponent is number of answers here we should have got 2 now we have the same thing twice because that devil root but in general that's what we're gonna get so we're gonna move on to the next example dealing with f of X we know throughout the bat this is not a quadratic organ huge the same idea though to make it into a quadratic with some other variable this is a substitution technique so we're facing as promised says find x-intercepts the first thing it wants you to realize is that we probably will have for for something for solutions somehow enough so it could be complex if there's one of them there's two of them it could be two complex there doesn't have to be but in general we're gonna try to find that many solutions of our of our polynomial and so what we're gonna do is we're going to set this equal to zero and when we look at it here's what to tell when a substitution is going to work look at your first exponent look at your second exponent if this exponent is two times this one your substitution is going to work the reason being if this is two times this one and we know the exponents raised to exponents is a multiplication concept so X cubed to the fourth section 212 well then this exponent is two times this one we can write the first term as the middle term raised the second power that's why we check that's why we check to make sure that our exponents work in that fashion so here's a deal one last time we're gonna look at this and say we want to find x-intercepts set it equal to zero then we check out our exponents if it's not a straight-up quadratic maybe we can change it they've been looking to go hey if that exponent for three terms is twice that exponent I can write this as x squared that that looks really good leave that one but then I can write the first one as x squared squared Y because this is exactly two times this that means I can write it as a square of whatever this middle term is that's what we're doing and this right here shows you what your substitution is we know that we can replace this same thing and yes they have to be the same you can't have two different expressions and call them the same variable that's what works so hard to make sure that these are exactly the same we wrote this as the middle term raised to the second power because this is still X to the fourth but it's represented as the same expression here that is where we get our substitution so our substitutions x squared looks pretty good we're just gonna call that u so we did this we said hey two times this one no problem that means they can write in this term as this this factor as this factor to the second power because it multiplied by two we can basically divide that to becomes a power power to for us x squared squared is still X to the fourth then we change it you know we're going to use that u equals x squared to do two things get us away from X's into use so this is replaced by you this gets replaced by u not the three not the power - not the - - not the - one that's the first thing and then later on it's going to allow us to get back into X's this should generally be something that you can factor and this one is of course factorable for us we have this negative two we have this negative three we're trying to add the native to multiply negative three I'm seeing the negative three and one however you want to do that whether you your head or whether you need a technique factor by grouping I've shown you that already I don't really care I like this shortcut that I showed a while back this right here tells you your factors it also tells you your solutions I know for a fact if I change those those are going to be my solution so we're gonna get you not xu u equals 1 and u equals negative 1/3 if you want to do that right now that's fine we're really looking for efficiency at this point I mean we do want to show work because that helps us but this efficiency is speed with accuracy and that's what we're going for a long we don't want to spend a whole lot of time on things that we understand when you're learning them yeah but once we have this down we know we should know back to it really well we should understand that that's what we're gonna get something in terms of U we can do that now if you want to go and show you -1 3 u plus 1 which it was still true 3 u squared plus u minus threes must to u minus 1 and then we set these equal to equal to 0 that's fine also now we subtract 1/3 and simply add 1 we're so close so this is the last step that we need to do so we've looked at this we said that's equal to 0 we understood hey this is three terms that's gonna make a nice quadratic for us if the first exponent is two times the second one after these things are in order we call this the same expression same factor one raise the second power and one not this is the reason why we had to have a this times two is that that's what we had to have it to write the first as a square of the second then we make our substitution we factor something real nice and now we gotta get back so now that we're in terms of u we don't want to end there we were given X's so since we use this to get away from X's and to use we're gonna use it to get away from use back into X's u is x squared like this in the back of our head we know that that's true so U is one but we also know that U is x squared x squared equals one and x squared equals negative third and now we use of other techniques they've already learned so because we understand the screwed method we know that hey x squared equals one means that I can take a square root and we practice it so much if you take a square root you need that plus and minus so the square root of one is one but we take positive and negative one those are two solutions now ask yourself are those real solutions are those x-intercepts or not yeah those are X intercepts because they're real numbers there's two of them their distinctive are the same number twice so these would be two actual x-intercepts of that quartic function that's a power for how they look it might do this up down up down up thing sometimes they just look like a blanket you soar like a parabola but often times would be this little dip in them and so this is what this thing looks like this is going to be two crossings one a negative one and one a positive one now let's check the other one so x squared equals negative one-third and we go hannes take the square root of both sides so when we take a square root and we do a plus and minus oh man we have dealt with the discriminant in the last video we understand that if you have negative square roots we have imaginary numbers which means you have complex solutions this is going to give us X and the right hand side that negative becomes I outside of our radical whether you rationalize or not I don't really care it's at that point right now the point does it understand that this is not giving you more x-intercepts what it does give you is and this is without rationalizing really what we should do is write this is 1 over the square root 3 x square root 3 over square root 3 and end up getting I root 3 over 3 and negative root 3 over 3 that's fine but that's not the point I'm trying right now the plant trying to make it is this number one in general you should get that many solutions but not necessarily that many x-intercepts so whatever the degree of your polynomial is we should be able to factor that over complex numbers into that many solutions and we've done that right now we have that we have four solutions we have one mated one I over three or three and negative either three or three we do need to understand that a negative so the square root gives us an imaginary number so what this shows is that we have two real solutions two x-intercepts and we have two complex solutions which don't give us X intercepts and that's pretty much it so we're we're finding out on set equal to zero make sure that the first term has a power twice the second term then make it written as second term to the second power making shows two should factor it and they get out of it so I made I made a comment a while back about what if this doesn't factor if this isn't factored we get things like this I'm gonna make yourself this come from nowhere with my head right now so let's say that we got let's say we got that as one of our new solutions so we wrote this out we made a substitutional it was a quadratic we had to use the quadratic formula and you had negative one plus and negative one minus square root of three over two and let's say that you was originally x squared like we have in this example but then we have this like okay use x squared U is what we got here we'd have to get back into X's and the only reason why this is not fun to do is because you have square roots inside of the square roots and looks really awkward but it's certainly possible you may run into this from time to time so if that's the case and notice you have another you like that one you do that same thing over here and then you'd still use a square root method we still take that of both sides we get x equals plus and minus this really awkward radical the square root of negative 1 plus square root 3 over 2 just keep in mind that on this example you will end up getting when you do a plus and minus potentially an imaginary number right here that's sort of part of finding because that's an 8 a minus 1 minus a square root of 3 well that's a negative number that's like negative 2 point 7 over 2 well that's still a negative number of square root of negative number this is going to have an eye in it one way we can deal with this is factor out a negative like this hey there's a negative 1 minus a 3 factor the negative then this becomes your eye and that would count for two solutions are they complex yes they are because they have an eye that would not be X intercepts this one over here these are real numbers negative 1 plus square root of 3 which is like 1.73 that's gonna give you point 7 3 and then we just divide like - it's still a positive number instead of square root which means that you would get plus or minus something awkward but something approximating oh and graph rule on an x axis so I know that this was coming from nowhere I don't have an example that would give you one of these right now and I don't really want to go through most of they're gonna be factored this is just if you run into the weird case where you've done this and this is not vegetable you've done this and this is not factorable go right to the quadratic formula you're going to need something that has these sort of solutions well if you have the power x squared equals this take a square root with a plus or minus just watch out one of these might be doesn't have to be but might be negatives instead of the square root fact on the negative : I and then you have to mention your solutions and one of them might be real solutions which we here so this is a this is a real number it's a positive so I have a square root we have two of them there's two x-intercepts I hope that's making sense generally we don't have to worry about this very often but and the problem is is that our textbooks don't give us that because they think it's too hard for us or something but I wanted to show you that that's possible this is not a limited technique it's a very powerful technique it takes things that aren't quadratic calls on something quadratic figure it out and then moves back into other variable that we originally had we can still do that here and so maybe maybe use maybe to practice that's to try to find something that isn't factorable that's a power for a power to and do the quadratic get more these solutions set X rating goes to a practice of square root with the plus and minus notice you still get 1 2 3 4 3 4 solutions which is to our imaginary I hope that makes sense I'm going to come back with three more channels we're gonna go to Fite quickly through and it'll be done all right let's conquer the last three problem just so to be complete on the lesson make sure we're seeing some things but kind of weird and then how to get back into X's and solve the solve for that X so that's we're going to do in every case we notice there's three time there's three terms it's great there's three terms are going to set each of them equal to zero to find X intercepts zeros or roots and we're to go through the process of making a substitution explain why that works and then replacing a part of this equation with you figuring that out so for you and then replace it back with an X so the resultant variable that's that's being questioned so number one we're going to find X intercepts and set our function equal to zero now the only time a substitution is going to work for us in this context of making it a quadratic is if this exponent the first one is 2 times the second X 5 and so we think about it is 2/3 2 times 1/3 yes and so how the maker substitutions is write these with the second expression a second factor just write the first fact the first term has that second factor to the second power what I mean is in is 2 times 1/3 that we can write this as X to the 1/3 power squared because we know that when we take an exponent to the exponent multiply that's why we always check to make sure this power is 2 times this one that says you can take the this excellent it can't break break it down bring it down into 1/3 times 2 so this term itself becomes X to the 1/3 to the 2nd power that gives us this middle term in this location but raised to the 2nd power that's exactly what we're looking for also I use those parentheses to show what I'm going to substitute for to make sure that but I'm seeing that correctly so I'm going to double check to make sure we represent represent the same thing and ready to substitute so I'm look at this thing and I said equals zero this is 2 times this one no problem that means I can write this as 1/3 squared the exponent power we've done that now I have the same exact factor inside my parentheses in both terms that's great and it shows what our substitution is we always want to show what we're doing so we always want to show that trail of breadcrumbs if you will that substitutions that we can go backwards and people who are following us know what we just did so Sentricon actually 1/3 this variable you we're gonna have X to the 1/3 no no rewrite as u minus 7x to 1/3 no that's you that's why it had to be the same so we could call them the same variable and now we're ready to factor we can do this as quickly as possible there's gonna be u minus 5 and u minus 2 we can do any sort of technique that that works for your factoring at this point so even from here if we were if we thought about and wrote that down we know that you would equal 5 and you would equal 2 and we're still in terms of U so we want to get back to X we use the same substitution twice we want to get away from X's into use once we've stalled that get away from yous back into exes so we know that since you equals x to the one-third that u equals five can be written as X to the one-third equals five and X to the one-third equals two now here's the situation a lot of students understand all this stuff get out of here and they get stuck because we feel they realize what we're dealing with so when we see X to the one-third man what in the world help how would I solve that how would an undo that that exponent there's a couple ways that I'd like you to think on it the first way is this remember that anytime we have a fractional exponent that this represents a radical so this is a cube root of x to the first power and I'm going to do the second one in a different way so the cube root of x to the third power sorry cube root of x to the first power equals five how do you undo a cube root well same way with that you'd under the square root except with a different exponent we'd say if we have a root three a power three is gonna undo that so that would be X we equaled 125 and that's true because the cube root of 125 is 5 the other way we can look at this is by leaving it as a 1/3 power and understanding that you can do anything you want to as long as you do the same thing to both sides in fact we took both sides of the 3rd power can't you do that here if we did one third to the third 1/3 times 3 we have an excellent range of X alone we're gonna multiply those powers 1/3 times 3 is 1 X to the first power equals 18 either way you go you're going to get precisely the same technique of solving they're both reasons their power just kinda depends on how that's what we're doing we're solving these is understanding what that really means and then I'm doing it I hope that makes sense I hope you understand the nature of hey whatever you have here is what you're going to use twice 1 to substitute 1 that substitute again to get back to original variables and that's what we have done both of those are actually solutions let's move on to the next one sometimes it looks a little awkward you know well say excellence at all but based on what we just did when we set this equal to zero and we look at and say that's three terms but I have no idea what to do with it I don't want to start solving for square roots here because then I'm gonna exit other side scaling you down a pretty dark brown when I do that instead maybe we can do a substitution if we think that if we think about how radicals are actually exponents and we understand that this is really X to the first power and this is X to those E power over root that's a power 1 over a square root of every 1/2 then we can see that the first exponent is exactly 2 times a second one so I'm going to encourage you to write your radicals as those fractional exponent X 1 so we can see it pretty clearly that's three terms it's in order to one side the first term is positive it's really good and then we say hey you know what that power is two times that one if that's the case I can write the first term as the second power squared because one-half times 2 is still 1 that's what makes this word you say hey that's 2 times that I can write it as one-half squared their problem I'm still gonna write this in parentheses to show what I'm substituting say hey you know what now the in the same exact thing in both of these terms let's make let's call this u or some other variable that way we get a u squared plus 1 u minus 20 equals zero we're gonna factor that as quick as we can again if it doesn't factor you're using quadratic formula you're gonna end with a sort of nasty u equals some sort of radicals but don't worry you can still undo some of these you just square both sides like we would here or cute both sides that we did here and you basically leave it the only problem that we run into and I'll talk about it here in just a little bit is that when we start squaring negative numbers and making them positive run into submission so it's that the same let's see that would be negative 4 positive 5 that adds to 1 multiplies the negative point I'm going to go right to it I know that U is going to equal positive 4 and you need to be U is going to equal negative 5 we plug that in we can check it and really need to 16 plus 4 is 20 21 2005 minus 5 plus 20 minus 20 is zero we know those are solutions in terms of U and now we're going to go back to our X's so because U is X to the 1/2 we need to really realize what X to the 1/2 power means it is a square root that's where it came from and so maybe that's a little bit help more helpful either way I don't really care but if we think about this square root of x equals 4 square root of x equals negative 5 huh how do we undo a square root well a second power would under a square root became should we do that yeah I think we should 20 back let's raise this to the second power this is 2nd power once you do one side view either we get x equals 16 done that's perfectly right that's an x-intercept that's where that function crosses the x-axis at x equals 16 comma zero so the points are at 16 comma 0 and we do the same thing right we go alright this let's square both sides squared this and we got x equals positive 25 because negative 5 squared equals 25 and that's true but it's basically false friends it's based on the fact that you can get the square root of x to equal negative 5 and you can't with real numbers and so what this is this is a non solution for us as far as x-intercepts this is a problem so right into this room kind of time we don't have polynomials some some of the fundamental things that we deal with like hey the exponent equals number roots that that works for polynomials but not some of the square root a and so we kind of fail some of that so we only have one solution this is a false solution that is not true you can't square both sides we need to really be thinkers we think that hey the square root of X can't equal negative five that that doesn't that doesn't work for us we have we have to have like we can't we can't do that a real at all and so that fails our finding real solutions sort of idea that we're dealing with here for X intercepts so just be careful on that one you can tell right it's really easy for students just to square everything here and cancel undoes the square root and then you get 25 and your kid you guys know you know why well because a square root can't equal a negative and that over real numbers and that's that's an issue so I hope that makes sense what I was talking about a little while ago imagine that you've had something very awkward I'm gonna deal with this weekend and imagine you said oh yeah U is X to the 1/2 or the square root of x because that's a little hard to visualize as a decimal and it is I mean that's negative 1 minus negative minus one point seven three is negative two point seven three divided by two so as a little it's negative one point something it's kind of hard to visualize and so you can see that when people get into the process of solving these it's very common for people to go out and square this square that and then I get this whole thing squared and then I'm good to go no because that still is a negative and you you have this square root of x equal to a negative number already that's the best based on something that's false for real numbers and so by squaring it you can't get a real solution from something's not impossible over numbers I know you thought I hope you follow me on that line that this premise is false under real numbers you can't have square root of x equals negative anyway squaring it ain't gonna make it better it's just you're based on some minutes fault so we can't allow that so this is a problem that watch out for so if you've done this and this is not factorable and you do quadratic formula be very careful on solving for your X's when you undo that substitution be very careful on that I've given you now three examples on that here you won't have a problem when you cube both sides you can have a cube root equal to negative tobe mine doesn't even matter even if that's a negative negative five grading to be negative 125 cube roots don't care keep it's okay to have negatives even roots not so much on roots are just fine and that's what I wanted you to see there this happens so rarely but it does happen I want you to be thinking about it thinking about it how hey look that's a square root that's a negative that's a problem just like this would not give us a solution neither with that one now the other one if this had been a plus would have been fun negative 1 plus 4 3 that's positive divided by 2 that's still positive and then when we took that square root it that'd be okay so if we would have had this and say hey yeah let's make the square root of x that's fine that's ok that something is possible in the real numbers so the squared of X could potentially be this positive number square both sides and that would be a valid solution just me just like that that's fine if you want to multiply it you certainly can but that's probably the most concise that we're going to get it so hope you follow me that he'll be very careful on substitution took me to number one and sent him up a right set but make sure you have the first term is the exponent 2 times a second one you make a nice little substitution hopefully you factor it if not then you do quadratic formula end with solutions that look like these under your dummy variable like you when you go back and re substitute you get your X's just be careful what you set those next is equal to if it's outside the domain of once you can bounce our outside the rain for your X function then you have to exclude that with cubics there's no exclusions it's fine this cube root of XC equal any number positive or negative so you just go with it cute little size you're good but when we have things like square roots when we have things like fourth roots sixth roots things to the fourth power if they equal negatives that gives us problems that gives us either imaginary numbers or things that aren't even possible well so be careful with that just check your work very carefully understand what you are doing that if we're trying to do things like squaring negatives that's no-go this gives us no solution if we're squaring positives even if they look funny that's okay you get a solution there so this quadratic would give us one solution for that cubic you could still get 2 because we can have negative sign cube roots that makes sense ok the last example in just a second so that one looks pretty nasty let's go ahead and handle it see if we can find any x-intercepts for this so we're gonna start my sentence equal to 0 like we do for all of our functions that we're trying to find zeros or x-intercepts and then we see what to do with it is everything on one side yes is the first term is it in order exponents are negative but sort of decreasing absolute value that's in order enough and it's but secondly is the first term positive answer is No so one thing we won't want to do all the time when we're trying to find x-intercepts is make your first term positive how we do that factor of the negative divide both by negative one multiply both sides by negative one change those signs understand they just change all the signs or add and subtract everything to the other side of our equation I'm gonna change all the signs right now so let's say when we're multiplying both sides by negative one what that's doing even though this has a negative for our function because these are finding x-intercepts it doesn't really matter whether we reflect or not the x-intercepts themselves or in this case y-intercepts that's the horizontal axis why though the horizontal axis why would they would not change so let's let's multiply by negative one change the signs of all of our coefficients and constants cannot legally tango that that still doesn't look much better dad's nasty what were we gonna do is it a quadratic no because polynomials include quadratics cannot have negative exponents can't we do it substitution to make a quadratic yes anytime your first power is 2 times your second power of an inorder polynomial or expression in this case we can make a substitution so we're looking to see oh hey that's make them to you this thing about like a negative 2 is 2 times negative 1 what that means is we can write this as the first term is the same as the second term but raised to the second power it's this to the second power that's exactly we have negative 1 times 2 is still a to the river to the same thing what we're trying to find this common piece that's the same with the first 1 raised to the second power second raised to the first power that's going to model a quadratic when we do a substitution so that's what we want if it's we've done before and now we're going to substitute we're going to say that u equals this inside in both of these terms it's got to be the same oh we got to use a different variable little bit using we're going to say it's not Y to the negative 2 is y to the negative 1 power and then we're going to substitute so 2 u squared plus 11 e minus 40 that's something looks a whole lot nicer it's something that hopefully expectable if not well then we'd have to do quadratic formula right now and I'm going to show you how that would look at the very end using my favorite negative 1 minus square root here with you unless my favorite but this is factorable madam like very fact we got 11 yet a negative 8 is 2 times negative 40 is negative ad you know it's gonna be is 16 and 5 so if we do negative 5 and 16 that adds to 11 that multiplies to negative 18 so what do we do we need to do factor by grouping or you do another technique or you use a shortcut thing I've done for you and we say this is negative 5 over a this is negative positive 16 over a we've simplified where we have two and left them as fractions this will read your factors to you or it will tell you the opposite sign of your solutions in terms of U so I know that using equal positive 5s and U is going to equal negative 8 we can find it here too this says to you - five for one factor that says 1 u + 8 for another if you want to distribute and check your work now's a great time to do that - u squared + C + 16 months 5 is positive lemon so plus 11 and then minus 40 sit on both equal 0x0 private property and we're really close to that the only thing we have to do is go back into the variable from where from chicane so this is kind of awkward because we had wise this would be like a Y horizontal axis and H of Y so something like is Z or something vertical axis so it's a little weird or finding y-intercepts right now so we have to put this back in terms of Y use what you've done so you mrs. Y to the negative 1 power if u is 5 halves and we accept why they do 1 power into is equal if I house but then we got to realize what that means why did the negative one power like having any negative exponent creates a fraction on that factor so Y to the negative one power is the same thing as if it 1 over Y essentially what that's telling you is that this is the reciprocal of the solution you want so if you just need to reciprocate this to find a why just reciprocate this one also to find the Y that's that's fine is exactly we're going to do so we're going to reciprocate that fraction so why is it equal two-fifths because 1 over y equals 5 halves same thing happens here don't change the sign though so because this is 1 over Y if one of our y equals negative 8y itself equals negative 1/8 the reciprocal of negative 8 over 1 and those are the two solutions we get I hope this making sense to you that we have the substitution should be made it should be kind of flowing well in your head right now that we're just making a quadratic hopefully we're factoring it and then we're undoing that substitution and solving one for whatever variable you have already been given based on substitution to be made now I didn't mention that I've got to talk about this what if this had been something really awkward like we got like u equals that negative 1 plus square root of 3 over 2 something like that and and another weird a weird solution for a substitution I'm just gonna do one of them this time but if you had Y to the negative 1 power equals this so you've got to here it was not factorable you did quadratic formula you got to nasty somethings this being one of them was something else another one and you realize that this is 1 over Y well this is the reciprocal of what you want then you can reciprocate besides the only problem with that is that that has a square root on the denominator and if you have to simplify it now you're certainly talk about rationalizing denominators you've multiplied by the conjugate negative 1 minus square root 3 and you have to distribute it's gonna kill off the square root of the denominator for me I'd say that's fine if we've ever had to make it that far you can still approximate that and get a decimal something you can find y-intercept in this case but if not you'd have to rationalize that to get that square root off the denominator the other one would just be a negative 1 minus the square root 3 over to you do the same thing your conjugate we make it 1 plus square root then you distribute so again you don't deal with that very often but I want to make sure you understand that this technique is robust it's not just it is specific right it's specific in the fact that you have two terms and you have to have the first power 2 times the second power you've got to make a substitution of the same thing in two terms then we hopefully factor do another technique get down to the variable that's your substitution variable your dummy variable and then we undo this whole trail of breadcrumbs by putting our X's back and solving it with every need like taking both sides of third power or a second power watching out for negatives here having a reciprocal of our solution and making sure that we need to rationalize it possible so that's how to deal with that if we have the quadratic other than that the same thing I hope you explained it well enough we use this from time to time to to make our lives a little bit easier and extend the concept of quadratic methods things that aren't quadratic and start alright we'll catch you for another video you 

Transcript for: Graphing Quadratic Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 24)
hi welcome to another video in this video with something very basic we're going to talk about the properties and graphs of quadratic functions how do you kind of cope with this vertex form versus maybe just graphing the the vertex and X intercepts and y intercepts that they work together just one time through to make sure that you're seeing it this is a little more advanced and like an intermediate algebra class because our none of these are gonna be factorable for us very easily so we need to find X intercepts through quadratic formula but basically just making sure you're ready to move on and grab some polynomials which is pretty much a next thing that we're going to be starting so here's the way that we go and graph quadratic functions I need you to know a couple things about it number one any quadratic which is a polynomial of a second degree so power to polynomial this is the way they're all gonna look they are all going to be parabolas if your a is greater than zero they're gonna be what we call upper opening if your a the first coefficient of your x squared term is negative you're gonna get a downward-opening prevalence where they always look if a is an absolute value larger than one we get a vertical stretch either way or if it's absolute value less than one we get a vertical compression I'll make the graph look more narrow or more wide respectively depend on whether you a an absolute value is greater than 1 or less than 1 so we're gonna be practicing that just kind of looking through these then we need to know how to find the y-intercept and the x-intercepts and if we want to put this into vertex form or you're asked for it how to do that with completing the square so this is the process of going through graphing quadratics we first determine whether this is going to be an upward-opening or down over the parabola just like what we talked about then we find the y-intercept and the reason why we do those two first the upward opening or downward opening give us a great way to check our work later and in combination with the y-intercept which every parabola has we can determine if we need x-intercepts so let me make that very clear to you every parabola is going to open either upward or downward every parabola is going to have a y-intercept we're going to determine those two things every parabola has this vertex where you change from decreasing to increasing or increasing to decreasing we're gonna find that what they don't always have our x-intercepts if you have an upward-opening parabola with the vertex above the x-axis or a downward-opening parabola with a vertex below the x-axis and so we always go through a parabola in the following thought process number one is an upward or downward opening maybe we determine whether it's narrow or wide depending with a bit of vertical or a stretch or compression then we determine the vertex and the y-intercept we're gonna use the axis of symmetry if used the y-intercept to give us maybe a free point and then if we need to we determine x-intercepts if not we're done and so we're going to go through them we're going to talk about these how we find the y-intercept by just plugging in 0 to our exit value of the function for x equals 0 it's always going to be your C we'll talk about that we'll talk about how when you find x-intercepts this is exactly why we've been practicing last few videos we set our function equal to 0 and we use factoring whatever method to complete the square or quadratic formula here it's pretty much all gonna be quadratic formula if we need to and then well we will find the vertex one of two ways either by completing the square which I'm going to show you again or by using this vertex formula which is so much nicer use so this is pretty much what we're gonna do I'm going to show you the order in which we go through it and that's gonna be just about it we have maybe four examples I'm going to show you going backwards if I give you a vertex and a y-intercept help me make something in standard form so let's take a look at our first first function it's clearly a quadratic it's got that power to there's three terms there in order looks really nice here's the order which we graph parabolas number one you have a choice to make either you're going to do completing the square or you're going to find the vertex first then the y-intercept of emanate x-intercepts in that order you graph them again the reason why I don't I don't want to hold you in suspense this order works because every parabola is going to have a vertex and every parabola is going to eventually cross the y axis but not every parabola make it has to cross the x axis so we do this in order to stay on ourselves work if we find a parabola that has a vertex above the x-axis and we know it's upward opening or they'll have to worry about the next intercepts or likewise if we have them below we don't worry about the next intercepts and so we go on that certain order to make certain we're not wasting our time to find x-intercepts that aren't even there so let's go through together we know that's a parabola we determine that because that 2 is positive and because that too is an absolute value greater than 1 this is going to be an upward-opening parabola and that's going to be a little bit more vertically stretched so so a little narrower what we're going to do first is find the vertex by this vertex formula so vertex formula says if you can identify your a and your B and your C which we should be really good at because of the quadratic formula the vertex formula is going to give us that vertex now here's how to find it it looks really familiar because from the quadratic formula if you remember many may watch that proof video again this part was the piece that was here before chicken square root now why is that important because that's the only piece of the necks in it and this right here is in parentheses and this means if I looked at like a function this would be like a shift left that's what that would be as far as our function is concerned and this if I move another side would be a shift up or down that's what that's giving to you so where the vertex formula comes from is this idea that this a left hence the negative and when we find out what that value is that becomes the x-coordinate of our vertex how to find the y-coordinate is once you find this x-coordinate or about to do we plug it into our function that's what this stands for so going to our vertex of says hey identify your a B and C a it's 2 and B is 8 and C is 5 our vertex formula says take your negative B all over 2 times a whatever your a is in this case our a is to we're going to simplify that and then whatever value we find we're going to plug it into our function that's how points work including the vertex every parabola has a vertex we use the formula to find the x-coordinate and then just like every ordered pair ever we plug in the X or evaluate that X we out the output so we got the Y value the Y ordered the f of X the same thing is to kind of Y so this really blank for just a second negative 8 over 4 is negative 2 and then we evaluate negative 2 in our function so we know right now that our vertex is going to be negative 2 comma something along that negative 2 x value some output we have to plug in that negative 2 in order to find the output so negative 2 squared is 4 4 times 2 well that gives us 8 8 plus let's see 8 times negative 2 is negative 16 that would be negative 8 and plus 5 would be negative 3 so we evaluate this as negative 2 and then we get out negative 3 that is where our vertex is now we're gonna plot that we're gonna plug that as we go so negative 2 comma negative 3 is this ordered pair negative 2 negative 3 right about there that's our vertex now think about this this is an upward-opening parabola so if you are asked to find the minimum of this problem which you're going to be able to ask to do on some of the word problems you get what's the minimum of this dysfunction if this is an upward-opening problem and this is the vertex then your minimum right now you're done your minimum value of this function is negative 3 it's not negative 2 that's the x value where it happens your native the negative 3 is the minimum height that this function attains that's the idea that having a vertex being the maximum for a downward-opening or minimum for an upper opening so again we've now we said hey this is a parabola we know it's gonna be upward opening your vertex is going to be the minimum value on that function on the graph that function the height that has chains minimum values no you three we know we can find a y-intercept an x-intercept and a vertex by using some of these techniques we've learned already y-intercepts really the x-intercept we're using one of those techniques we learned about solving quadratics and the vertex has a formula we just use negative B divided by 2a we figure that out we plug it into our function we get an ordered pair that represents your vertex your y-intercept should be really quick the liner stepped occurs where you plug in zero to your X so if we plug in zero that's going to zero and that's mu zero can you see that if you evaluate your function for zero you are only going to be left with the C value if your functions in standard form means it looks like this that if you plug in zero these things are gone you're just gonna get your C value and that's what happens should take about five seconds to find this at most so we know that our y-intercept is zero comma 5 we're going to plot that next and now we're going to determine something you see I gave you an order of steps so that we can identify whether or not we need to find x-intercepts or not so right here because you know that's up or opening because we have a vertex because we know where our y-intercept is are we gonna have to cross this x axis in this parabola so here's our vertex we know it's upward-opening yeah we're going to have to cross this somewhere probably somewhere between here and here of course because it's got to be symmetrical we're gonna have to cross that that right there tells you whether you need to continue to find x-intercepts or not and I had our vertex been above the x-axis and we were still upward-opening we don't have to do this next step so to make it very clear when you're graphing parabolas we always find the vertex matter what we always find the y-intercept no matter what we always use the y-intercept for a free point I'm gonna show you in just a second but then sometimes we find x-intercepts if we have two vertex is below the x and upper opening yes vertex above the X and downloading yes but not if we're above and upward or below in downward I hope that makes sense to you so here we're going to find in just a minute but before we do that I need you to understand that every parabola is symmetrical and and because it's symmetrical we have this thing called an axis of symmetry and it's always going to go through your vertex so our graph is going to be the severe image across that does line what that means is this if you have any point on one side of that axis of symmetry you can mirror that image on the other side being equal to sin front of it so because this five is let's say two units away from the axis of symmetry this is negative two comma five is where that would this point right here is because this y intercept is two units away we can go two units away the other side at negative four or five and put a point so we know that that's symmetrical here's two units away from the axis of symmetry the other side of that extra symmetry is going to create for us at another point this is very very helpful in your graphing you get a point for free that's really nice we can always do that with our y-intercept provided that active symmetry isn't on the y axis so we're always going to rotate the graph of vertex no problem we're gonna graph the y intercept great we're going to use the axis of symmetry that always goes through your vertex to give ourselves a mirror image from where the y intercept is and then if we need to we're gonna find X intercepts so how we find x intercept is always say that your phone should be equal to zero and then trying to factor or try the square root method trying something here in the square methods not gonna work we can't get a power to by itself with the contains all of our X's and have a constant other side that that's not happening could we do the completing the square yeah we can't and I'm gonna do that in a minute to show you that we can solve it that way people generally think it's a little more work and unnecessary but I want I'm gonna practice it to show you that it does work if you're asked to be vertex form that's what you have to do instead if we can't factor let's see 8 and 8 multiply to 10 then that's not going to happen so man we got his quadratic formula and that's gonna happen at this level where you can't factor to get x-intercepts there's no way but you know that they exist so when you said this function equal to zero nothing else works you don't want to complete the square do the quadratic formula so identify your a and your being your see what you've already done now we understand that our X would be equal to make it be plus or minus this will be squared minus 4 times a times C we've done this before all over 2 times a and say hey our 8 is be our a is 2 and our C is 5 and we end up getting this I'm going pretty quickly here we want to make sure that we're not making any mistakes ironic cuz I forgot something and it's 64 minus 40 that's 24 all over 4 so negative 8 we got a 64 we have minus 40 that's going to be 64 minus 4 is 24 all over 4 what this ends up being it's something that is an exact as solution I mean we know they have x-intercept there's no ice here we know across an X but it's very hard to graph and so we're going to approximate it and we're gonna say all right once we take this negative 8 plus the square root of 24 over 4 negative 8 minus the square root of 24 over 4 notice I'm not doing I'm not spending a whole lot of time simplifying this by factoring out that square root of 4 and simplifying with a before I don't care because all I'm trying to do here is approximate my x-intercepts I'm trying to get a number that I can actually graph and so that's what we're gonna do so after taking a break and and work on this under calculator or whatever I got that our x-intercepts are about so I'm gonna change this to about equal to negative three point two two and negative 0.77 let's see if that kind of copes with what we got here negative three point two two they need one negative two negative three point two two and then negative point seven seven negative point seven negative 0.77 here's what we want to check because we have this nature of symmetry for every parabola in fact we use it to get a free point for a y-intercept we want to make sure there are X values our x-intercepts are also symmetrical on this graph so the same distance from the axis of symmetry on both sides and this is one reason why this is a little bit off is because they're rounding error that's that's the idea so man once we have that those five points are what we need to make a really solid graph for a parabola we have determined that every parabola has a vertex find it first use the formula use this one that I'm giving you find the x-value plug it in for the y-value plot it then find your y-intercept plot it use the axe symmetry to give you a free point plot it determine if you need x-intercepts you're gonna be crossing the x-axis you gotta find them sometimes that means when you set this equal to zero but it's not factorable we're using the quadratic formula plug in this into our calculator they need to eight plus square root of 24 and then divide by four they need to make minus square root 24 then divide by four getting two values plotting I'm on our x-axis and double-checking they're the same distance from axis entry after that we have something that we can graph with a nice smooth flowing curve make the symmetric as possible and that's about as good as I can do by hand be honest with you I hope that makes sense the idea that parabolas are these these shapes we get Burton for quadratics they're all going to make that hope make sense that if you're a is positive we're upward opening and negative we're downward opening and then we have a vertical stretch or compression this one is stretched a little bit you can see it's a little more narrow than normal I hope you understand that every parabola has a vertex we're going to find it first if it's below the x-axis an upward opening you're also going to have x-intercepts so we've got to keep that in mind it's above the X and downward-opening again you're gonna have X intercepts so we're going to keep that in mind every problem has a y-intercept they're easy to find we just plug in 0 we get our 0 comma see X intercepts might take some work here because they're not always factorable quadratic formulas going to give us an exact representation for x-intercepts but to graph them we might have to approximate it that's got to be there before you any further now one more thing that we can do if you if you're asked to put this in vertex form or if you just want to double check to make sure that you get this right I mean I wouldn't let me trust this but if you have to we can always complete the square to verify our vertex this is called vertex form because of the nature of the quadrant of the completely square putting this in the form of being able to use transformations need to shifting up-down left-right this is also the reason why tot completing the square root way that I did the way that we didn't work on both sides of our equation so I want you to understand that when you complete the square on a function like this what you're doing is putting this in what's called a vertex form so we're gonna do it we don't need to set this equal to 0 because I taught you the way we did so let's go through it one time on this example and one time on that example to make sure that we have this down though we're not going to touch it again for a real long time so what completing the square does it says hey I need my a to be one I'm gonna factor out my a from these two terms I'm not gonna touch last trip in fact I'm gonna kind of ignore it not forget it but ignore it I'm going to leave myself a space right here and I'm going to complete this I want to add something here that makes this a perfect square or we're doing basically is understanding that when we complete this square we need a word you have a messy number we need a number that two numbers add to this middle one and two numbers multiply to this last number we're going to be adding this number in here we also wanted to be a perfect square so we want these two numbers to be the same so we think what two numbers are the same that add before it's got to be two and two those are the only two numbers in the world that add up to four and are the same number so what number are we missing well we're missing the number that these two would have to multiply by we're missing a four if I add that four it completes this Factory and it says this will eventually factor as X plus 2 times X plus 2 or X plus 2 squared that's what's gonna happen there that completes this factoring the only problem is what we've done is we've added 4 inside a parentheses but more than that something that has a 2 as a factor that's being multiplied by it so in adding that floor it wasn't there before we added it on there and adding that 4 we really increase this function by 8 distribute the 2 you're increasing the function like 8 we have to undo that we added 8 and then we subtracted 8 to make up for it on the same side of our function that's why I taught this to you the convinced where to you this way because we don't have a zero we don't have another side of your equation to compensate for that we're all working on one side of the function here if we combine some like terms this is minus 3 the 2 stays right up front and so our function says hey if you wanted to put this in vertex form here's what this says oh man I hope you remember transition this is pretty cool this this is a parabola how I can tell all its power to what's gonna happen here you're going to shift down 3 wait a minute down 3 1 2 3 you're going to shift left 2 never have everything excited but this is up so we want so the insides has left to right but plus to be left to left - oh wait we see your axis entry that's pretty neat we know that this is going to be narrow in fact if we use our key points these are things we've covered already and we understand that I take these key points and multiply the outputs the outputs of them by 2 that's 1 comma 2 that's 0 comma 0 that's negative 1 comma negative 2 I'm sorry negative 1 comma and positive 2 so from here this would be 1 comma 2 there should be a point there ok then it's negative 1 comma 2 there sheet a point there there is oh my gosh that's symmetrical that's what our key points would have done by by doing this whole transformations idea doing the vertex form if we wanted to find X intercepts you could set this equal to 0 you can add 3/2 take square root and then subtract 2 and if we look at that as well if we let's say we add - yeah / - sure take squared plus - and subtract - if you evaluate them in their calculator you're going to be the same set X intercepts is this if we wanted to simplify this a little bit and we got to find a common denominator it's gonna not be great but we could certainly have done it this would be they get to plus or minus root of 6 over 2 if we rationalize the denominator this right here if we simplify negative 8 plus or minus 2 root 6 hey that's a square root of 4 times 6 all over 4 and we simplify 2 goes into 8 four times into 2 one time into 4 2 times and that's negative 4 plus or minus square root of 6 over 2 so why do they look different this is written as two fractions so if I separate this negative 4 over 2 plus or minus square root of 6 over 2 this is negative 2 plus or minus square root of 6 over 2 it's the same exact thing it's representing the same exact x-intercepts if you want to find the y-intercept you'd have to plug in 0 or go back to your original and say it's still going to be 0 5 my idea here is just to tell you this stuff all works together so whether you want to do the vertex form and complete the square no problem you can still use key points you can find x-intercepts you can find a y-intercept you can find the vertex very easily this is down 3 left to this says down 3 left to that's exactly the same thing you talked about the same vertex the the minimum height is still negative 3 the maximum height is infinity this goes on forever we can find x-intercepts either way we find a wider step either way it's really up to you know which way you most people prefer most people for this one because you don't have to touch completing the square because this gets really difficult if I didn't give you easy numbers I can't be easy ones here I give you an 8 which was divisible by 2 and then created a 4 which you can separate it divide that by 2 very nicely so that's not the case this becomes a fairly challenging we saw that when I taught you how to complete the square so anyway I hope that I've made sense to you on this example is the longest one we're gonna go through later on the rest of them we're gonna do basically this I'm going to very quickly complete the square to verify the vertex and just practice that a little bit and then that's it so at this point meaning understand vertex comes first everyone ever every parabolas got it we gotta find it the whiner step comes second every parabolas got it we got to find it but if you use it across from the axis of symmetry to find our symmetrical point then if we're gonna cross the X then we find out intercepts so we're going to come back and go on another example just a second okay let's continue so we're looking at G of X we get negative 2x squared minus 4x plus 2 the first thing we got to notice is well what's its shape its shape is it's got a power to that's the largest power it's a polynomial type function this is going to be a parabola now is it going to be upper opening or downward opening because that's an order it's really 90 easy to identify that this is negative 2 and for the x squared so you make it a downward opening and fairly narrow parabola it's going to be this vertical stretch because the absolute value or a is more than 1 so that's a little bit stretched out here's what we're going to practice we're going to go through and find the vertex first then our y-intercept that our x-intercepts if we have two then I'll show you the vertex form if you need to find that and we'll just make sure that they're giving us the same thing so let's start with vertex because every prabal in the world has a vertex this formally comes in really handy our formula for the vertex is we're gonna find based on our ABC maybe negative 2 and negative 4 and C be positive 2 we're gonna find negative B all over 2 times 8 kind of real careful with science I often times we use the parentheses here to represent the sign and to represent the the fact that we need to have that negative and it maintains operation so negative B is negative negative 4 all over 2 times a that's 2 times negative 2 we can't repeat those negatives we're gonna simplify it so negative negative or the opposite negative 4 that's positive forward but we're dividing by negative 4 that's negative 1 now to find the Y value we're going to take that negative 1 we're gonna evaluate it but right back in G of X to find the y coordinate so when we plug in negative 1 let's see negative 1 squared is 1 times negative 2 that's negative 2 minus 4 times negative 1 so negative 2 plus 4 well that's 2 plus 2 is 4 and we're going to take that vertex and we're going to plot it right now so negative 1 comma 4 negative 1 comma 4 right about there and we're going to determine something right now because this vertex is above the x-axis and because it's downward-opening in our heads right now we're thinking I am going to have to find x-intercepts or at least an approximation for them so I'm probably going to be factoring I'm undoing quadratic form because my vertex is above the x-axis that's down over means the parabola is gonna cross it we've got to find that one tell me don't is what if this is an upper opening a man that we're golden we don't have a fine X intercepts at all the other thing we're going to talk about right now is the maximum because this is a downward-opening parabola that vertex represents the maximum height of your parabola of this function so if you were asked say this this is a picture of a ball going up and coming down which it's not well that's how would you find the maximum height well you'd find the vertex so you don't even do any an establish your question just find the vertex the maximum height of a downward-opening parabola happens that your vertex so you've maximum height before it occurs at x equals negative 1 but your maximum height would be 4 that's the highest value that this function attains the highest Y value that you get is 4 of us all right so we know that we know that every probe is going to Y intercepts so we take like two seconds to say if I evaluate for x equals 0 my Y value is going to be 2 and I'm going to plug that right now before I forget I'm going to make sure that because I have that axis of symmetry that always goes right through my vertex I'm going to use that y-intercept to give myself a symmetrical point so I know that APIs to this value of 2 I'm at 0 comma 2 there I know that's one unit this is negative one one unit away from axis symmetry if I go one more unit at the same height but on the opposite side of the axis symmetry I met do the fact that this is an even function well based on the XM tree it's a symmetric function about that so we found the vertex no problem we know we're gonna have x-intercepts you're gonna find right now we find our minor seventh we use X's symmetry we know this time we're opening and now because of that we know this is gonna cross the x-axis so we're gonna do two things we're going to use we're gonna set this function equal to zero and find the x-intercepts and then we're going to determine whether approximation is accurate in equal distance from that axis of symmetry so we set this equal to zero you know we can't forget that we can do nice things like if that's not equal to zero we can try to factor and at least set it up for factoring because it also helps our quadratic formula by having smaller numbers or at least less negative numbers so let me my bad is don't forget that when you're when you're finding x-intercepts it doesn't care if your first term is positive or negative it doesn't care about the signs of it if you reflect this function don't do it now or don't do it over over here like before but if you do it now your x-intercepts won't change and so what we would do so we'd factor this let's factor out negative two that at least gives us something nicer to look at for factory now when we think about it looks like it should be factorable but we can't add the positive two and multiply the negative one that's best I can happen for us and so our best choice here because factory is not going to work I really don't want to do completing the square right now the quadratic formula is pretty much it are eight would be one our B is 2 and our C's negative one so x equals negative b plus or minus you've got a square root B squared minus 4 ay C all over 2a then we fill it out B comes first a comes second C comes last I know that we'd have x equals negative two plus or minus square root of 8 all over 2 can you simplify it yeah you sure can do you have to it depends if you're asked for an exact answer then yes you want to simplify this as the square root of 4 times 2 so 2 or 2 and then we can simplify by factoring or understanding the reason why factor works and simplifying all 3 of these coefficients or constants as the case may be and you get negative 1 plus square root 2 and negative 1 minus square root 2 that's almost easy enough for us to approximate our head if you know the square root of 2 is 1 point 4 1 so if we do that well we go ok negative 1 plus 1 point 4 1 is approximately 0.4 1 and negative 1 minus 1 point 4 1 is negative 2.41 that's what we're going to put on our x-axis as close as we can so let's see negative 1 negative 2.41 needed 1 negative 2.41 and then 0.4 one that's positive man that looks about right that's 1.4 11.40 one on each side of the axis symmetry so I know that we're symmetrical that's probably a really good indication you got this right and now we're going to graph our parabola using those five points as symmetric as possible using the vertex y-intercept second with axis symmetry free point and then your next well your x intercepts if you have them now I didn't promise you those gonna do completing the square just to make sure that we have that right if you have to do vertex formula here's a little bit would do so for our G of X remember we don't have two sides to work on and so that's why I showed you how to complete the square the way that I did because if you don't have that other side you can't compensate with what you're adding for or subtracting on another side there's not one you'd have to do the same side so rather than teach two different ways I choose to teach you the way that I do that we have one way that works all the time what we have to do here is separate our first two terms and our constant and a very far back we don't want to lose it with one ignore per second and we're going to divide out or factor out negative 2 it's going to change your signs we're going to complete this so that is factorable we're missing a number right now just think about what you would have to put here to make the factory actually work it's got to be a 1 so I want this to work as far as being a perfect square trinomial it would be missing a 1 or make that happen I'm thinking hey I got added to what never started to they are the same one what do those have to what does this have to be for those two multiplied to it it would have to be one that's the value of missing the problem is this by excuse me by taking and two by adding that one you are distribute this by adding that one inside of something that has a factor in front of it you're technically subtracting 2 negative 2 times 1 is negative 2 you've actually subtracted 2 from the value of this function you're going to undo that so because you added 1 inside of a parenthesis which has this factor in front of it you add 1 here and distribute that to what you really did is you subtract it to you from that function you've got to add 2 to undo that so what I tell students is distribute and then undo whatever that distribution tells me so this distribution says negative 2 we want to add 2 we want to undo that that means that our function is we know that that's gonna factors right here you can believe this so that one factor as X plus 1 squared we've got this negative 2 in the main this plus for this says you're probably should be shifted up 4 1 2 3 4 should be shifted left one number inside plus means left that's where vertex is it's why this is called vertex form because you can easily find your vertex I'm thinking about shifting up for that's a y-value left that's an x-value that's what's called griffix form we know it's a parabola we know as downward-opening we could have used key points this would be 1 comma negative 2 from here 1 negative 2 and 1 negative 1 negative 2 we get the exact same ones that we got before the drawback is this is a little harder to find x-intercepts from you have said equals 0 subtract 4 divide by name to take a square root and then subtract 1 and approximately but so we did the same thing so that's the idea behind going through this one of those two ways either refining vertex then y intercept the next ourselves if necessary or we're finding the completely square process with vertex form can't do the same idea I hope that made this make sense I hope that you see this completing the square is something that's not SuperDuper scary but something that is giving you the same stuff as this you see one of the problems is in teaching is that we think these are all like not meshed together I need you to understand that whether you're doing this or this you're finding the same thing completing the square gives you the vertex vertex formula gives you the vertex y-intercept you can still find a plugin through you to answer you - or plug in 0 here you get two x-intercepts well I would say that this way it's easier because you have the quadratic formula or you complete the square which is where the quadratic formula comes from anyway so I'm telling you you're doing the same thing it's just a different way to get there so on the next couple examples we're not going to go through the whole vertex form this is only if you need it or if you just really enjoy doing I don't want to practice it so at this point we need to be very comfortable with vertex finding that with the y-intercept using that and then finding x-intercepts of quadratic formula and approximating our calculators so I'll be right back with a couple more examples ok let's go ahead and finish up our last two examples of graphing just to make sure that we understand in the process that we don't always have to find X intercepts they don't show you one way to go backwards so you give a vertex Y in R so we can show you how to get a function like that from it so number one f of X negative 4x squared minus 4x minus 1 we should all know at this point but that's a parabola and the VAT is a downward-opening and really narrow parabola really because that negative force you to stretch this thing out absolute value negative four is four that's a bigger one it's going to be very narrow also what we have is this negative which says that it's downward opening now we're going to go through we're not going to complete the square we're going to do this the vertex wider second then maybe X inertia play if we can so with our vertex we gotta be really good identifying a B and C and also I want to make sure you understand this you've seen me change some signs from time to time that only works when you have this set equal to zero to find X intercepts we can't go and change signs now before finding the vertex in a Watership that's why we do the X intercepts last otherwise we start making these signs change and then we have a different opening parabola that's not okay the only reason why we can change sites with X intercepts is if you reflect a function about the x axis change the signs the x-intercepts themselves don't change because they're on the thing that you're reflecting about they can't change signs because their sign lists that will put a zero for those x-intercepts so we don't change signs until we get to here so for our vertex review all right our a has to be negative for our B is negative four and our C is negative one that's the numbers that we gotta use to find the vertex so we're gonna do negative negative 4 2 times negative 4 we're gonna leave that open for just a second so that we understand we're going to evaluate our function for that x value in order to find our output or our Y value or y-coordinate so that's positive 4 that's negative 8 that's negative 1/2 which gets kind of awkward when you start evaluating functions for fractions I'd recommend your calculator just take it use your fraction button cell P we don't we don't make a simple error but you probably can do that in your head but double check your work at least with a counter because it's really awkward to put that vertex down here and then use a y-intercept that's that's correct with the vertex it's not it's not going to look very good using the unity of that sprout so with negative 1/2 negative 1/2 squared is positive 1/4 times negative 4 well that's negative 1 and then we have this negative 4 times negative 1/2 well that's positive 2 so negative 1 plus 2 months when it's 0 plugging 0 well that's weird the worlds that mean well we know that's a vertex and every parabola has got a vertex let's plot the vertex remember it's a vertex at negative 1/2 0 negative 1/2 0 is right there that's negative 1/2 comma 0 now think about this this is the vertex which means it's the highest point of a downward-opening parabola if this is the highest point can this parabola ever cross the x-axis again not only can we know this because if you have a vertex that sing on the that x axis you have found the only x-intercept it's a double root and if we had gone down to x-intercepts and solve this from equal to 0 we're gonna find negative 1/2 twice if you want to try and try it try factoring it try to do whatever you want it's gonna work it's gonna factor but you get protein and then if you would want so that right there that that vertex is you don't have to do x-intercepts right now you found me all the x-intercept that you ever gonna have for this function what you do have to do is find your liner so if we evaluate 0 we're going to get negative 1 I know that 0 negative 1 is there a y-intercept notice how narrow that makes it if that's our vertex and that's our next point that's a really really narrow parabola now what we do with it well we know that the axis of symmetry goes right through the vertex so find a 1/2 unit away from my axis symmetry here I can go 1/2 unit on the other side and find a symmetrical point this is what we would use to graph our parabola now do we have to continue you have to find the x-intercepts no it's relevant you've already found it so that's what news you order every parabola has a vertex sometimes you're gonna find x-intercept here every Club is going to wander sit use it to find a symmetrical point but if you only if we understand what this looks like a downward-opening parabola it matches that it's narrow if they were opening there's not going to be any additional externships don't wish your time the only thing that might make this a little better is to go one more unit outside of what you have what I mean by that is you might want to plug in a value like negative two or here's zero plug in value like one if I plugged in one and I plugged in negative two I have two additional points that would be symmetrical or filling in one and you symmetry that's fine too but that would give me a better shape of this thing so I hope that makes sense to you for me I mean this isn't clear enough that we know that's pretty narrow but you might want to go ahead and plug in two more points here either or one more point you cemetry so we're gonna do this again that's good of a parabola as we came out of it and if you want to see the x-intercepts if you plug this and are set this equal to zero and you changed all your signs because we can now this is equal to zero so x intercepts if you reflect x-intercepts they don't do anything this is it we get positive 4x squared plus 4x plus 1 this factors actually but you've divided by your a and you'd say oh my x-intercepts are remember this change your sign negative 1/2 and negative 1/2 you have an X here so they get 1/2 that's exactly what we found and there's only one it's a repeated root it's a double root multiplicity 2 says your functions bouncing off the x-axis that is what I want you to understand I hope I've explained it well enough that you do understand that so we're going to go on to the last example as far as graphing concerns to be very quick and then we'll talk about what I told you going backwards all right so let's take a look at G of X we have 3x squared plus 2x plus 5 in your head right now I need you to be thinking that's a parabola I need you understand that it's upward-opening because we have that positive three and it's fairly narrow because it's not as narrow as this one was but it's a little bit more narrow than the two lesser of the form we're going to go ahead and find the two things of this graph is going to have its gonna have a vertex I'll do it's gonna have a y-intercept because they all do but this is not going to have any x-intercepts now I want to show you how to deal with it so for our vertex if we identify our eight which you should maybe try right now our a is three and our B is two and RC is five so we put negative B that's negative 2 all over 2 times a is 2 times 3 that gives us negative 1/3 which is kind of awkward now if we evaluate that that's the only way we find points in functions is to evaluate them or understand the function which we're learning about right now so we evaluate for negative 1/3 and negative 1/3 squared that's 1/9 and then a third of that goes 3 times that is 130 in okay well then 2 times native them Thursday 2/3 1/3 minus 2/3 well that's negative 1/3 plus 5 is 4 and 2/3 and so you do that or you use your calculator any in the same thing you might get an improper fraction that's fine too let's see fourteen thirds would be okay now can we graph that can we plot it sure it's a little awkward but what our vertex occurs is let's say this is negative one the negative one-third comma 4 and 2/3 from 1 2 3 4 2/3 negative 1/3 probably right about the air come of it just might grab a little bit more because of this oh maybe not it's gonna be kind of awkward that's where our vertex is now think you just you still hopefully set in your head but this is upward opening its upward opening and your vertex is way up here is this ever going to cross your next axis ever no this this is there are none if you wanted to use the quadratic formula follow me I hope this makes sense what's your discriminant going to be to be positive negative or zero if this doesn't have any x-intercepts your discriminant would have to be negative this would be two complex solutions here saying you are not crossing the x-axis that's what's going to happen if you try to find x-intercepts so we're not going to you says that we're doing something practical we're actually graphing this so we don't have any x-intercepts writing and trying to find them because we understand this is upward-opening vertex it's above the x-axis in fact our y-intercept which is zero zero zero comma five is right here now this is kind of awkward because we don't have a lot of room to notice the curve of this graph so if you used to act as a symmetry which is fine this is 1/3 of a unit from remember this is negative 1/3 that's 1/3 of a unit away from the the y axis the y axis third of the way where that that y-intercept is is 1/3 of a unit away from the access symmetry if we go another third of a unit so like at negative 2/3 we plot another point use our symmetry and use our knowledge of the fact that this is going to be quite narrow to give ourselves that upward-opening probably no we're gonna get what would make this better is to use some values outside of your y-intercept so i would use something like negative one and maybe positive one and they're not going to give you some magical points here because they're not spread evenly from that negative 2/3 negative 1/3 but it would be a little bit better than nothing so plug in a couple points here to get that that nice look to your graph that's where I'm going to leave you I'm gonna leave you just wouldn't understand what the vertex does that you need at first lime sub second and then you might not even have to do x-intercepts and how to deal with that so I hope that that's made sense I'll come back with one more very quick example okay so sometimes you're asked to find a function given some information like in this case you got a vertex and you have a lighter sentence that's fine with function table we're going to do that with me by understanding how your functions work in what's called a vertex form which I've talked a lot about in this video in the first two examples so what we're gonna do here is twofold because we have one two three missing parts three missing dice and one two three missing or three given values we're gonna use those to fill this function l here's the way that we do it number one take your vertex and fill out what your vertex would do as far as your shifting is concerned think shipping think transformations think that if I have a x coordinate of 1 that's a shift right 1 and this minus 5b is shift down 5 this is shift right one down 5 represent that first then what we do is use the fact that a y-intercept of negative 3 is 0 comma negative 3 that's a point that's gotta be a point so I'll be used points and everything we've done so far use that point to fill out what your date's gonna what you ate is going to be and so I'm going to show you how to do that right now so if you have a vertex of 1 negative 5 you go l-listen that that one that really means that we have a ship left 1 and we have a ship down 5 then instead of having X plus h and this plus K I know that this function is gonna be something like this a I don't know yet but I know a ship left I'm sorry I shipped right I said like a shift right one is X minus one that represents a shift to the right of one unit since this this vertex says I should write 1 and down five that right one is a minus ones you remember that remember that everything said but this is obviously what you see so this is a minus one this would be a shift to the right one representing that that value they shift down five is a down five we know that this would be a shift down five K L so that means this would be a shift right one and that's what that means this is why it's called the vertex form because it models your vertex perfectly in your transformations of course the issue is that I need to find what that a is well your first step is done the first step is use your vertex to fill out what you can by understanding the transformations that are taking place to get to obtain that vertex shift right minus one chip down minus five now we use this point that's given to you here's what this says your input is zero and it gives you an output of negative three well since your variable three inputs is X and your variable for your outputs is f of X plug in your point don't plug in for a this says your input is zero so replace the X with zero your output is negative 30 replace the f of X with negative three this is what this is saying to you and saying if you plug in zero you should get out an output of negative three hey I plugged in 0 I should get an output of negative three and now that we have that filled out there's only one thing that we can do is solve for your a so by doing that negative 1 squared is 1 1 times a is a if I add 5 then a is to come right back up here and just put that in there and you've completed your function that still has a vertex of let's see bright one down five that's here this would still have a y-intercept of 0 three plugins or if you want to 0 minus 1 that's negative 1 squared is 1 1 times 2 is 2 minus 5 is negative 3 so I know that that actually works for the information that's given to me that's how they go from given a point like a vertex and a y-intercept of how to find the function for a mat if you need to distribute it you can certainly do that so you distribute this X minus 1 squared first and then distribute your two and then combine like terms and then you get a function in standard form rather than in vertex form which either way you go there very graphical you certainly graph that this one you thought use the vertex while you go we have the vertex use the X intercepts from let's see the factor bowl looks like it now you figure it out if you expectable or not maybe four maybe six not seeing it there so but you could do it if you had to anyway I hope it makes sense I hope I've explained that well on for you guys to understand it and I'll see you for the next video you 

Transcript for: Solving Quadratic Inequalities (Precalculus - College Algebra 25)
hey there in this video i'm going to teach you about quadratic inequalities what they are what they do what they represent and how to solve them it's pretty quick there's not a whole lot to understanding more than what you already know but the reason why we're covering this video is because later on we're going to talk about rational inequalities and we're going to mirror exactly what we're doing here in that video so what a quadratic inequality is quadratic in quadratics are these functions that when you graph them it gives you a parabola inequalities are these things that say hey there's an interval for which we are above greater than or below less than some other value or function and so what a quadratic inequality does is put those ideas together let's take a look at our first example so in this example we've got x squared minus 3x minus 10 is less than or equal to zero what this means and this will give you a huge step up on how to solve this what this means is consider what this is that's a parabola x squared minus 3x minus 10 is an upward opening parabola zero is a constant in fact this horizontal straight line at y equals zero well that's the x axis so practically speaking this says this take this upward opening parabola and find out where it is below less than the x-axis y equals zero or an output of zero that's all that this is so really what we're asking here all these problems that we do in quadratic inequalities practically asks once we change them into where's the parabola below or above zero that that's all that this is about so we're going to be setting these on one side greater than or equal to less than or equal to greater than or less than zero figuring out where if if at all these things cross the x-axis which is zero and then figuring out where we're above or below depending on the inequality that we're given that's a rundown so here's the things that we need to know how to do number one get everything on one side get zero on the other side number two be able to factor or some other way find x-intercepts now why well if we want to know where we are above or below the x-axis we're going to figure out where we cross the x-axis so that we can determine where we're above and or below it that's really the whole idea and so what we're going to be doing is getting everything on one side factoring it most likely finding our x-intercepts but that's not what the question asks the question doesn't say find x-intercepts we're not solving that we're solving inequalities so determining the interval that satisfies this or above or below it so in this case it says hey you got a parabola figure out where we are below the x-axis so we're going to draw something for that we're going to say hey let's say that this is our number line or really just think of this as the x-axis the x-axis is a number line what we want to know is if this is an upward opening parabola where we cross and then come back up over the x-axis that's really the whole idea so what we're going to do out of this is we're going to take a little side step we're going to find our x-intercepts this is not solving your inequality all it's doing is figuring out where you cross the x-axis and then understanding the problem as we let you solve the inequality so we're going to take this off to the side and solve for x intercepts the only reason why we're doing it is so that we can determine where we're crossing if at all the x axis to determine where we are above it or below it keep in mind too that when we're solving for these quadratic inequalities quadratics are all parabolas so what we're going to do is we're always going to have this alternating truth statement true false true or false to false because by the nature of probably it just says one thing it just makes this this u so where we're not above the x-axis we're below it and then back above it that's the whole idea we're upside down down the road we probably were below above and then below so in some way shape or form we're going to factor this and we understand that x plus 5 x minus 5 equals 0 and x plus 2 equals 0 and that says that x equals five and x equals negative two you know that's been a long time talking about what this actually means what we've done here is we found where this function this parabola equals zero we found where it crosses the x-axis if this is a parabola and this is the height of the x-axis y equals zero the output of zero the x-axis then we're finding by setting an equal where this crosses this right here does not solve this problem it just tells you that this parabola is in fact going to cross the x-axis where well if you put it in order at x equals negative 2 and then x equals 5. now listen the only thing we have to do is realize what this does whether it's upward opening or downward opening we already know it's a parabola so there are one of two ways to solve this problem it's neither way is hard both of them work very well i prefer the graphing way because it mimics what we're going to do later so if you understand that that's a parabola and that's the x axis and we're looking for the interval below it well we just found out where the parabola crosses the x-axis we know that it's upper opening so i don't really care exactly what it looks like we know that this parabola is really going to do this that's the the super superimposition of a parabola on our x-axis i don't care about the y-intercept i really don't care about any of that stuff all i care about is the interval that solves our inequality so what this asks is where is this parabola below less than less than zero um less than the x-axis below the x-axis so from left to right is our parabola below the x-axis on this interval no no for this interval from negative infinity until negative 2 our parabola is above that so that's not satisfying our inequality between negative 2 and 5 is our parabola below the x axis yeah that's exactly what you're looking for after 5 is our parabola below the x axis no it's above the x axis until x equals infinity remember with intervals we're always going on the x axis when we're talking about inputs and that's what we're talking about so we graph it and say hey you know what our parabola is less than or equal to zero from negative two to five we're gonna talk about brackets and parentheses in just a second but that is what this question has here's parabola upward opening here's zero where is it less than that where is it below the x-axis well from here to here on that interval of the x-axis now depending on whether you have an equals sign or just a straight-up strict inequality we use brackets or parenthesis to represent that so when we say hey we want to be less than or equal to the x-axis it includes the values that are actually on the x-axis so negative 2 and 5 itself had we had just a less than symbol we wouldn't be using those that values would say we want to be strictly less than strictly below but not on the x-axis in that case if i had given you just this less than we use parentheses here and here what that would represent is that you're below the x-axis on the interval from negative two to five but not including those values as it is what i've given you says we're below the x-axis from negative two to five sure but we want to include those because of that equal sign we say yep those are on the x that's the interval for which this parabola is below or on the x-axis that's pretty much it that is what this is talking about the last thing i want to tell you is that there is another way to do this if you don't don't like the graphing method personally i do it works really well for rational inequalities a little bit later but if you don't like that there is another way to do this but you have to understand something about parabolas parabolas always alternate by the fact that they are an even function here they're going to be on your because of the axis of symmetry always separates our x-intercepts evenly like perfect symmetry on that because of that fact and they're even function and they're symmetrical about an axis of symmetry you will always get the true the same truth statement for intervals that are opposite what i mean by that is that in interval here and here they're both going to be either above or below the x-axis there's no way parabolas do weird stuff they only have one turning point one sort of vertex where we come down go up or go up come down that's all they ever do because of that and because of their symmetry you will always always have an alternating truth to them so we are either going to have intervals that are true false true or false true false that's all they can ever do now what what i mean by the true false true false true false is plug in a number plug in any number that you want i pick an easy one like zero say well where is zero on my interval zero is right here and if we plug in 0 into our inequality we're going to get either a true or a false statement out of that now judging from that one number on that interval we're going to get that either all of these values between negative 2 and 5 are true or all of them are false why because probably continuous functions and you found where you cross the x-axis there are no other crossing points you don't come back up here magically and hit the x-axis and come down we found the only two x-intercepts ever for this parabola so when we plug in a value on an interval and we get that it's true or false we can use it to represent the entire interval so i plug in zero and go hell now negative 10 is less than zero that's a true statement that means that every value in here is going to create a true statement from here to here that's going to be true all of those values give you an output that is less than zero these two values give you something that's equal to zero that's why we included them so between here and here you have values that are equal then all less than zero and then equal to zero again and therefore we include that entire interval you can do that so if you don't like the graphing part just plug in a number and you get okay uh hey that's a true statement cool then understanding something about parabolas says where i'm not below the x-axis i'm above it where i'm at above above the x axis i'm below it and so where we have this we go hey that was true because we're less than zero therefore because of the fact this is a parabola that is going to be a false interval and so it's the other side those will always match up i said that again axis of symmetry creates a symmetrical function for us because x-intercepts are also symmetrical about that that acts symmetry then our truth statements false false or true true are also going to be symmetrical what that means is that hey we're not below that means we're above here we have to be above the x-axis here and that fails what we're talking about we want values that are less than zero below the x-axis all of these values if i were to plug them in are going to be positive numbers stuff that's above the x so those are the two ways that we really go about solving quadratic inequalities so what's the rundown these are all parabolas they're always upward opening or downward opening we find the x-intercepts all right are they going to have x-intercepts not necessarily but if they do the parabola is either above and below than above or below above and below and for that reason we have alternating truth all the time either true false true or false true false depending on what inequality we're dealing with that's it okay let's move on to the next example so we're looking at 2x squared minus 5x plus 3. before we go any further i want to take a look at what this really is that right there is a parabola it's fairly narrow but it is upward opening this right here is a line it's got a y intercept of 3 and a slope of 5. so it's a fairly steep line here's what this asks it says given your parabola and given your mind and let's suppose they cross which they do where is your parabola below the line that's all this stuff is talking about you can look at it here's going to be an x value here's going to be an x value where is our parabola below the line between these two that that's that's where it is so we're going to translate this problem a little bit you could have talked about where is it above the line and that would be this interval and this interval where the parabola would be above the line we're always talking about x values but that's what this picture is now we can cheat this just a little bit instead of talking about the parabola and a line we can get everything on one side in order first or positive and zero on the side and translate our problem just a bit instead of talking about a parabola being below a line if we subtract the 5x and subtract the 3 and get 0 on one side we can translate this problem to well we're not talking about a parabola and a line anymore as far as having a diagonal line we'd be talking about a parabola and the x axis and the values of x are going to be the same where this parabola crosses the the this line or where the parabola we're about to get across the x-axis are going to be the same values so we sort of um kind of trick the problem a little bit so let's do it let's get everything on one side let's get it in order let's get the first term positive this sounds pretty familiar this is still a parabola hey it's still upward opening and there's a zero right here so what this says is if i draw an x axis if this is an upward opening parabola and let's suppose that it crosses the x-axis there are going to be two numbers where this parabola crosses once and then comes back up if it crosses it comes back up and crosses again what we're going to do is we're going to find these numbers how we're going to factor it factoring does not solve this problem it gives you the x-intercepts so that you can interpret it and solve the interval for which your parabola is now below 0 below the x-axis it's going to be this interval do you see it do you see how our parabola is above in this interval below in this interval and above we're not asking for a build we're saying where's this upward opening parabola below okay underneath the x-axis this is zero that's the same exact thing as saying where's this parabola below that line that's all we're doing let's go ahead and factor this so at this point as long as we know how to factor i really don't care what method you use me personally i do a negative five and a negative six uh think about this as negative six and positive one hey let's see that adds negative five that multiplies negative six so we have that right i would probably divide by my a and at this point you can be done if you simplify this and say that's negative three over one and you change your signs you've already found your x-intercepts we know that this is going to intersect our x-axis at positive three and negative one-half now if you want to go ahead and do the whole zero product property factor this all the way out that's totally fine but again that that's not the idea here the idea here is you are only finding these values so you know where to put this on your x-axis so i would say that this is negative one-half and positive three that's all reason at four these do not solve that problem they just tell you where your parabola crosses and that's it now we interpret it okay how do i interpret it look here and imagine that this is a parabola we have sort of an image of that it doesn't cross our x-axis it does here here now find out where this does this to that where this parabola is less than zero um in this interval no that's false on this interval is a parabola less than zero yes so from negative one half to three so we use interval notation here that's pretty standard you don't have to you can do an inequality notation if you really want to so we could do negative one half less than x less than three but interval notation is fairly standard now let's let's also determine whether we need parentheses or brackets here because we say strictly less than we don't want to include the values that are on the x-axis that would be less than or equal to so i don't want to include negative one-half because that is saying where this parabola actually intersects the x-axis so i'm going to dis-include that how we disinclude a value but include everything past it is with parentheses and the same thing with 3. so what this says is this parabola is strictly below the x-axis just past x equals negative one half and just before x equals three just excluding those individual points that's why we don't have a bracket now the other way pick zero take zero find out where zero is there's only one time you can't do that and it's if you don't have a constant so because one of your x-intercepts will be zero in that case you can't plug in zero otherwise find out where zero is it's somewhere in this interval so pick zero and plug it into your inequality negative three is less than zero that's a true statement that says that everything on this interval is true there's nothing in here that's going to give you a value that's greater than zero why because parabolas are continuous functions you found the two places where they cross the x-axis heads equal zero so we're either above or below zero and because we don't have any other x-intercepts we can't change the the sign on anything in this interval they will all be positive or all be negative every value between negative one half and three is a negative output for this parabola that means that they're all below zero this parabola is below the x-axis that's a true true interval and that's exactly where we get this thing we say hey this interval is true this satisfies my equality let's write the interval and then we do this again now because we have parabolas yes you can assume they alternate because parabolas are again continuous functions and once we cross the x-axis we don't come back again every value from here on out when i input it into my parabola is going to be positive that's above the x-axis and that does not satisfy what that is so the interesting thing is that this interval that says where this parabola is below the x-axis is the same interval where this parabola is below that line we just got everything on one side so that factoring worked very nice for us i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing the nature of parabola or it's figuring out where it crosses something and then determine where we're above or below there's two ways to solve it one is just graphically understanding the graph it's a parabola it's pretty easy to understand or excuse me plugging in a value and alternating our truth let me use a word of caution here when we get to rational inequalities i'm going to show you this again i'm going to say that it's possible to determine where we alternate and where we don't by what's called multiplicity so we're going to reference that um or the evenness and oddness of vertical asymptotes we haven't talked about that yet but i'll reference that again so we're going to be thinking of graphs and doing practically the same thing uh it's kind of it's kind of fun actually other than that that's about it we're going to do two more cases uh the last question i often get is why why don't you have any negatives what where's your downward opening parabolas where are those at it doesn't really matter and the reason why it doesn't matter is because if you had a downward opening parabola you could change the signs get everything on one side first term positive and even though it wouldn't be downward opening your inequality would also be different so asking where a downward opening parabola is above the x-axis is the same thing as asking where an upward opening parabola is below and your inequality would bear that out so if you follow the technique and everything on one side in order first turn positive and zero on one side we'll still get the correct interval and give us a slightly different picture but it doesn't matter if we're just looking at the interval now giving the original picture correct understand what's going on yes that is important but maybe i could show you one right now so suppose that we had that that's our first example of everything flipped over flipped around so negatives instead of uh i'm sorry negative x squared plus 3x plus 10 greater than or equal to zero so if i said hey i want to get everything on one side and reverse term positive yeah that's not it's not positive what is that that's a downward opening parabola what's that we're asking where it's above the x-axis so this picture would be a downward open parabola above the x-axis could you still find out where it crossed the x-axis yes but we'd factor negative or we'd change all our signs the thing about inequalities though is that if you factor a negative and you change all your signs if you divide by a negative in order to get this this negative away let's say then when you divide by negative one it changes your inequality do you remember that when you divide by negative you flip your inequality and what i'm trying to show you here is that regardless of how we approach this problem the interval is going to be the same we just made that problem out of that one so even though that's an upward opening parabola and sorry that's a downward parabola and that's an upward and we have this this zero one's greater than zero one's less than zero this sort of proves to you that a downward opening parabola above the x-axis is going to have the same interval as the upward opening parabola below the x-axis you'd solve it practically the same same way if we wanted to stick with this version and say hey this is uh this is still let's see x equals negative two x equals positive five if we wanted to stick with this inequality that would be downward opening parabola but you'd be looking above you'd say hey on what interval is this downward parabola above the x-axis from negative two to five or like we did before if you want to consider it this way on what interval is this parabola below the x-axis it's the same interval these would this would be true for the downward opening this interval would be true for the upward opening i hope that makes sense um like that there's there's two ways to really look at this you'll find the same interval they would have the same truth the main thing here is that if you are going to divide by a negative though you do have to change that inequality that's a big deal another way to do it would be to add x squared subtract 3x and subtract 10. but you can see this asks the same question where is zero above our parabola or where is our parabola below the zero that's the same exact thing as a solid problem drawing so that's what i'm going to leave you at the the main point here is that if you want you can always make your parabola have a positive first term and you'll find the same interval of truth the picture will be a little different so if that bothers you maybe try the interval instead of doing doing the picture but the the process bears itself out so just mind your pictures be careful on what you're drawing understand the concept of what's going on and you'll be just fine let's move on to the next couple problems all right last two let's look at what's going on and then see if we can solve these inequalities number one that's a weird looking inequality maybe we should distribute this to get a better picture of what's going on so x squared plus x always it's a parabola and we're asking where is it above this horizontal line at 20 so what this says is here's this horizontal line that's a constant we're going to have a parabola that's upward opening and asking where is this above that 20. so if this is a height of 20 and we have this upward opening parabola we're figuring out on what interval is this above it is it above between the crossings or outside of the cross seams if you want to call it that and you say oh that's outside we should get kind of an awkward interval something where for a really long way we're above 20 then we're not and then we are again this alternating truth statement now how we're going to solve this problem is we're going to shift this parabola down 20. we're going to subtract 20 from both sides and this is going to translate to instead of thinking about a parabola below a height of 20 we think of a different parabola below a height of zero in other words where this upward opening parabola would be below or sorry above the x-axis that's what we're thinking of i mentioned something in the last example could you have considered this to be a negative a downward opening parabola you you you could have we can just change all of our signs if you want to and this would have the same truth as negative x squared minus x is less than negative 20. by multiplying everything by negative 1 yes you have to change your inequality but this would be a downward opening parabola this would say where's your downward opening parabola below negative 20 that's what that would do so i would say uh between this interval oh hey it's the same exact interval and this interval that's what's going on there so back to this because we're seeing out where this is above our x-axis we're going to be thinking you know what hopefully it crosses if it does excellent we can find our two x-intercepts so we can find that this is upward opening parabola take a picture of it put it on that graph and figure out where we're above so if we know that x squared plus x minus 20 is factorable this is x plus 5 and x minus 4. we can do it a number of ways it doesn't really matter how we do it as long as we can factor correctly then x would equal negative 5 and x equal positive 4. this does not solve this it simply tells you because it's a parabola where you cross the x-axis now we're going to take our picture that's an upward opening parabola we're going to graph it we're going to now understand the problem the problem says i want you to find me the interval where your parabola is above the x-axis where is your parabola above the x-axis here's the two the only two points in the world where we're on the x-axis every place else we're either above it or below it that's a huge interval that's all of this to negative infinity and all this to positive infinity how we write that interval we write from the left to the right the correct interval we're above the x-axis until we get to negative 5. and then we're below the x-axis we're going to dis-include this interval we don't want that and then we're above again from four to infinity these are the two intervals where we are above the x-axis on that parabola that's what we want that's what this translates to now do we include endpoints well because that's not an equal sign this says i don't want you to include where we're actually on the x-axis i want you to dis-include these two values we use parentheses for that we use parentheses for for infinities all the time so no matter what and then we put a union saying it's this interval sort of combined with or this interval those are the two intervals that are going to create true values for this inequality and that's what we're talking about two intervals were parabolas above the x-axis had that been an equals the only change here would be that you would include brackets on your negative five and your four it's all that would change not your infinities the other way if we want to understand that parabolas alternate truth take your zero plug in your zero here if i do that for my inequality zero plus zero minus 20 greater than zero that's a lie that's not true that's false that says this is a false interval nothing in this interval is going to have a value that's greater than zero they're all going to be negative you can see it well because these are parabolas then our outside intervals outside of those x-intercepts those would be true negative infinity negative 5 and then 4 2 infinity again that's the way that we solve these taking a look at the last one this is kind of a weird problem um this has a parabola to it so this looks like a parabola this is let's see a line with a fairly steep slope and this asks where is this parabola below the line we can translate that we can translate that to where is this different parabola below the x-axis it's the same idea it's going to give you the same interval it's just kind of manipulating the shapes a little bit instead of parabola line you have different parabola and the x-axis but we're going to get the same thing we did something very similar to uh with this with the intercept idea like how we find where where functions intersect is by setting them equal and then sort of considering a different problem but we get the same intercepts that's what we're doing here so when we look at that you go wait a minute that doesn't look super factorable so 4x squared that's parabolas upward opening minus 6x plus 9 to be negative 6 and 36. i'm not seeing how to get negatives add to negative 6 and multiply to positive 36. so what do you do when you can't factor well you either complete the square or you do quadratic formula you go okay all right well quadratic formula is going to be kind of nasty if you had to do it you could certainly find approximations couldn't you and you could figure out where you're above or below depending on those approximations it's not super relevant what numbers are here as long as you're able to find those numbers i guess it is relevant you want the right numbers for your your interval but what i mean is that you don't use them to solve your uh the inequalities fall as far as true false true we can understand a picture of the graph to get the true false true or false true false here we'd say all right well i don't even have x-intercepts yet so let's do let's do the um the quadratic formula we know the quadratic formula says that we can do x equals negative b plus or minus b squared minus 4ac all divided by i'm going to get a 4 there all divided by 2 times a now i would typically do my b's then my a's and then my c i don't care about this i care about that right now because here's what's going to happen what's going to happen is that inside my radical we have 36 minus 4 times 36 with a 144 all over b i hope that's 144. uh 36 that's 72 so 2 minus 2 is 1 4. all right what's going to happen there well we got 36 minus 144 that's a big fat negative what's a big fat negative meaning and discriminant we got to know the big fat negatives and discriminants mean that you don't have any x-intercepts so wait a second how can you have an upward opening parabola without x-intercepts it has to look like this here's what this says picture this visualize this that's your x-axis this is an upward opening parabola we're asking where is this upper opening parabola less than zero but we just found out this upward open parabola has no x-intercepts this discriminant is negative it's going to give you an i it says that you do not cross the x-axis are you seeing why i spent so much time talking about what you were doing when you're factoring or squared method or quadratic formula or completing the square you're finding x-intercepts and so if we find that our imaginary numbers here cause a complex solution which says you don't have them then this upward open parabola has to be like that if it does not have x-intercepts and its upper opening it's floating above the x-axis so answer the question where is this parabola below the x-axis it's not there's no solution here there is no no interval where this parabola is ever below zero there are no values you can plug in there to give me a negative number no real numbers at all that's what that's doing so do you i hope that you're seeing that picturing this picturing the parabola picturing the less than zero what the x-intercept represents is very helpful now could you have done it by just plugging in a number yeah if there's no x-intercepts you find that out and you go well plug in plug in zero uh four times zero minus six times zero plus nine is less than zero says nine is less than zero that's false that says wait false what interval is false the whole thing because we don't have any x-intercepts there's no place where our sign changes there's no place where we're above the below than above anymore it would have the same truth for the whole interval here we had three intervals here we had three all the other places we had three this has one interval because we didn't cut it up we have no we have no x intercepts at all we didn't cut that that interval at all and so this whole thing will have the same truth it's either all going to be true or all going to be false that's the two ways we can approach it imagine your graph imagine your x-axis x-axis we have no x-intercepts you're an upper-open parabola floating above you can also do the same thing you can change all your signs and downward opening parabola floating below so if you change negative plus minus and switch this to a greater than it'd say where would your downward opening probably be above the x-axis and you wouldn't be it'd still give you false for everything it'd still say there's no interval for which you are positive you're all you would always be negative that's what's going on now what would happen if we change the inequality without changing the signs we said hey imagine uh imagine this greater than greater than is 9 always greater than 0. is this parabola always above the x-axis yeah if we change the inequality then this asks where is this parabola which is upward opening above the x-axis and it doesn't have any x-intercepts still there's still nothing there you should be quadratic formula you still see there's no x-intercepts you still say hey that's a parabola it's upward opening above the x-axis there is no place where this parabola isn't above the x-axis this would be true for the entire interval in fact since we don't break up the interval at all this would be from negative infinity to infinity or all real numbers so depending on how that sign is we either have the inequalities we either have no solution floating above asking where to blow or infinite solutions floating above asking where it's above that's the idea i hope that it made this make sense i hope you understand the picture of the parabolas getting that your your your number line is just the x-axis it's the easiest way to picture that you can do other ways you can find x-intercepts and do the true false true thing plug in some values for your intervals that's great i used to teach that way a long time ago but picturing the graphs tends to stick with students a lot better and later on when we do rational inequalities it's going to make a lot more sense because we'll talk about multiplicity and we'll talk about even and oddness of vertical asymptotes and i can make these things work really well if you understand the picture version so i hope it's explainable well enough where you understand and i'll see you for the next video when we do a few examples of some applications you 

Transcript for: Applications of Quadratic Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 26)
hey welcome to another video so i always hated it when i learned something and never learned what you would ever ever use it for um so now i gotta tell you with quadratics there's not a there's a lot we can do but not a lot of really really really neat stuff you like differential equations really really cool stuff and higher math and that though and calculus but we can i can give you a couple examples show you how this would be used or some very basic things to say this is actually useful so we're going to go through three very quick sort of quick examples on when you can use the idea of parabolas to solve some equations one business one area real life example there and then one like projectile motion so here's the main thing that you need to understand though this is it if i asked you what the maximum value of a downward opening parabola where that would be located you would hopefully understand that a maximum value of a downward opening parabola would be located at its vertex and the minimum value of an upward opening parabola would again be located at its vertex so what a vertex does if you ever asked to find the maximum height of a downward opening parabola use the vertex formula if you're ever asked to find the minimum height of an upward opening parabola use the vertex formula of course we really can't find the maximum height of an upward opening that's infinity or the minimum height of a downward opening that's also infinity but the vertex will give us the minimum for upward or the maximum for a downward opening parabola we're going to use that like three times in these examples so let's take a look at at the first one uh we're gonna talk about business for a little bit so let's say that you have this business and you've done some some product research and looked at your economics and determined that well revenue is pretty easy but revenue is determined by how many items you sell times the price of each item so if my price is ten dollars it never changes and i sell 20 items 10 times 20. i'm going to have 200 in revenue this is not talking about cost so we're not doing profit it's very basic revenue is this idea of if i have x items x times the price of each item is going to give you what's called revenue how much money i'm bringing in let's imagine that your price changes the more items that you put out there now now this is oftentimes true if we flood the market with stuff that we're making the price is going to decrease because we have to lower the price to sell it depending on supply and demand so let's say that the price for our items is negative one-third x plus 100. so for every item we sell this is what you see it oh man you see the date or slope like this is a downward sloping linear price decrease so every item we sell lowers the price of the items just a little bit and i go that's that's crazy uh why would we why would that why would we ever sell stuff the price decreases you're still making money here so you're still making stuff but you're lowering the price it's kind of the idea would you want to make a product that's super expensive and sell a few of them or make a product that's super cheap and sell a ton of them there's a trade off there right we we might not want to make this super expensive product that we can only sell one of because what if you don't sell it or or you know you've cost a lot of research and development you might not recuperate all that or we might not want to make it items so cheap that we sell a billion of them but then maybe we're not making anything because we're spending all our money making our products so anyway there's a trade-off there so let's say that for our price every single item that we put out in production causes the price to have to decrease what we're going to try to do here we're going to try to find out the maximum revenue so let's put these pieces together if revenue is x times the price and we have a price of negative one-third x plus 100 hopefully you see that i can do a very simple substitution and say hey revenue then if i want to find my revenue i just need to multiply the number of items i'm selling times the price of each item number of items i'm selling times the price of our item that gives us a very nice look at a revenue function now what would we do let's see what we're trying to do number one what i want to understand is is what this looks like so let's distribute it let's see what it looks like oh there it is so our revenue is negative 1 3 x squared plus 100 x in your head right now you think this is a downward opening parabola would i be able to find the minimum value no no the minimum value is going to be practically zero you wouldn't continue to make items and go into debt just making item actually businesses do that all the time but we would want to do that so there's no finding the minimum value of this downward opening problem but you could certainly find a maximum we really wouldn't want to minimize our revenue we want to maximize our revenue that's possible here's what this says as i keep creating values what's going to happen my revenue is going to climb it's going to peak it's going to fall again that's what's going to happen because my price is decreasing as i'm increasing the product but i'm selling more products so i'm getting money from that eventually there's going to be this peak that's the idea of using parabolas to find a maximum or a minimum so we have that now one thing you might be asked is what's the domain like what do we what would the domain be well we would want our revenue to be positive and so we'd find two x values to keep our revenue positive we would want this is going to go back to the last section our domain is we want our revenue we want that to be above zero we'd want to at least break even by doing this but that would be that negative one third x squared plus 100x would be greater than or equal to zero okay well how would we solve that the same exact thing about quadratic inequalities on the last video we'd say well that's a downward opening parabola we're trying to figure out where it is above the x-axis that's what we're looking for if we're able to find our x-intercepts then we can determine between what two x-values our revenue will be positive so we can do a couple things we can do something like let's um let's multiply everything by negative three we could do that we could factor out the negative and then not have to change the inequality by keeping the negative there just find our exit the x values we can do that too it doesn't really matter i'm going to divide out the negative but i'm going to multiply everything by positive 3 as well to make our fat i'm going to factor out negative x actually so negative x and take a 1 3 x plus 100 that's probably the easiest way to go if i take a look at this the zero product property says that one of my x-intercepts i just think of this as negative x one-third x plus 100 is equal to zero i know that the x-intercepts where this parabola would actually cross x-axis i want to find that and determine where i'm above or below it x would equal zero and one-third x plus 100 would equal zero if i subtract 100 oops gotta fix that that would be bad if i didn't mention it the first time check your signs so i made a mistake here i've factored out the negative it happens all the time i factor out negative x because we have a gcf i screwed this up so factor out negative x i've got a positive one third then i have a minus one hundred so i keep that i use zero product property zero would be set equal to x or x equals zero one third x minus 100 sets equal to 0. if i add 100 multiply both sides by 3 between these two x values 0 and 300 is where my revenue would be positive we do not want to produce less than zero items that's impossible anyway we don't want to produce more than 300 because according to our price our price would start getting so our price would end up price times uh times our amount that we sell would end up being negative we don't want to start losing money on this and so our domain would be 0 to 300. if you produce zero items well then zero times i don't care what the price is you're not going to make anything your revenue is gonna be zero if we produce 300 your revenue is also going to be zero i hope that makes sense we have this downward opening parabola we said where is our revenue going to be positive that's what our domain needs to be we don't want to be losing money here so because that is a quadratic that's downward opening we can determine where we are above the x-axis this goes right back to the last section i hope that you're seeing it i did a little different this time and factor the negative x in correctly the first time fixing my sign and then saying hey we would cross the x-axis at zero and at 300 and we're looking for where this downward opening parabola is above zero that's between these two numbers that's our domain for this this problem could you do something like find out how much revenue you would make if you sold 100 items that means that we'd go up here and just plug in 100 so if we did this if we figured out the revenue for 100 items we would just plug this in and figure out what that would be what i got out of it was six thousand six hundred six dollars and 67 cents hopefully i did my math right squared 100 multiplied times negative one-third then added 100 squared so if we sold 100 items that's what we're going to be making out of it now let's move on what would our maximum revenue be that is the idea of understanding that if this is our revenue function and it's a downward opening parabola where would our maximum revenue be minimum would be zero because we cut that off at our domain if we went outside our domain would make negative money we don't want that so zero would be our minimum we don't want minimum we want to make maximum we're going to go into business and try to provide something good for the that people are going to really want well we want to make it worth our time so we want to make the matching revenue at least that's what business people want to do so how do you find the maximum for a downward opening parabola that's got to be at the vertex so we're just going to use the vertex formula so we're going to use negative b over 2a figure out that x value plug it into our revenue and that's going to give us the maximum revenue and how many items we need to sell to get that so negative b if we go back over here we look at our revenue function our revenue function is negative 1 3 x squared plus 100x even though this doesn't have a constant or a c we have an a and we have a b so for our vertex we'd have negative b all over 2 times a don't forget that's negative 1 3. you cannot change those signs not with the vertex formula so what in the world is that going to be um one thing because we're we're because we have a complex fraction here we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3 or negative 3. if we do that multiply by three over three then we get maybe negative three it doesn't matter negative or negative should be positive anyhow we're going to get 300 over two and that gives us 150 so when we take that 150 and we evaluate our revenue function at 150 this says if we sell 150 units that's what the x means how many things you're selling if we sell 150 units then we're going to get this amount of money this amount of revenue from it so take your 150 and we're going to plug that in to right here so take your 150 and put it for your r of x function that says we'd have negative 1 3 times 150 squared plus 100 times 150 that looks to me like we got about 7 500 so what that says to us according to this model if we take our amount of items we're selling times the price of each item that's called revenue we know it's a downward opening parabola we can figure out where our revenue is positive that is an inequality that's a quadratic inequality type of an issue uh find out where your x-intercepts are determine that this is saying where are we above the x-axis but where our maximum is for downward open parabola is the vertex so we find our vertex this tells us two things this says how many items we need to sell to make our maximum revenue and how much revenue we actually get now the last thing what is the price that you would need to charge to get your maximum revenue so we already know when you sell 150 items but because we have a price function we can plug in our 150 and it's gonna tell us what price we should put these at so this is our price for maximum revenue we take our negative one-third times 150 plus 100. let's see uh one-third of 150 is 50. so that'd be negative one-third times 150 is negative 50 plus 100 is 50 dollars so our price would be 50 what we determine here is that in order to get the most amount of money we'd be selling our products all 150 of them for 50 each i hope that makes sense that you understand the nature of downroving parabolas the vertex is the maximum that's it all right let's move on so i need to make a really nice garden and i have three thousand feet of fence it's gonna be a big garden here's what i want to know if if land is not limited to me which it is but if it wasn't limited to me let's imagine that i wanted to get the biggest area possible how would i do it well if we have 3 000 feet of fence for a rectangular area we need to find the maximum area here's the idea what we're going to do is we're going to call one of these sides x one of these sides y we're gonna find the formula for a perimeter now since we have three thousand feet of fence that is our perimeter like we're going to use all three thousand then we're going to find a formula for area the perimeter is going to act as our constraint we can't get above 3 000 feet of fencing or below three thousand feet of fencing and our area is the thing we're trying to maximize so this is gonna be this way we're gonna draw a picture we got it we're gonna make one of these sides x and one of these sides y because we don't they're they might not be the same here dimensions we're going to find our constraint and the function we'll try to maximize and then do a substitution so what a constraint does a constraint says what are you limited by so constraint has the idea of you're limiting something we are limited by not the area we want to find the maximum area that's not a limiting factor we're limited by the perimeter so if we can put that in a function in a formula or an equation and we'd say all right what are we limited by perimeter how much perimeter do we have three thousand feet and find a an expression that represents that perimeter so i know that three thousand feet is going to make up all four sides of my rectangle that's two x's plus two y's so i hope that makes sense that our perimeter 3000 feet is taken up by two x sides and two y sides this is called your constraint because it's what's limiting your ability to make more or less area now we can automatically do a couple things like simplify that we could divide everything by two that's totally fine but that's going to show up when we when we make our substitution well that basic question what substitution are we are we making the way that these problems these maximization and minimization problems which you're going to get a ton of in calculus is find a constraint we've got that the thing that's limiting your problem find a formula for what you're trying to maximize well what are we trying to maximize area do you know the formula for maximize for for the area of a rectangle yeah sure we know that area is x times y so we've labeled x times y we don't know if they're the same length sides we don't know how they're related we don't really care but in order to figure out an equation that has two variables you need two equations one is a limiting equation called a constraint the other one is the one you try to maximize use your constraint to substitute into the the formula or function you're trying to maximize so because the circumstance limits us we say hey our area is x times y we need to substitute for one of those variables it really doesn't matter which one we substitute for just one of them so take your constraint and solve it for a variable you want to maximize in this case we're going to be all right i'm going to solve this for y why because i like solving for y if i do that i would subtract 2x and divide everything by 2. this right there 1500 minus x equals y that is what we can replace inside the function i'm trying to maximize so instead of a equals x times y i'd say a equals x times y but y equals 1500 minus x if we distribute and write this appropriately like in order we get sort of the same exact look as what we got in our revenue problem we have this downward opening parabola that represents our area all we're trying to do is find the maximum so if you think about this what where does the maximum happen on a downward opening parabola it's got to happen at the vertex all we're going to do is find the vertex we're not going to worry about the domain here the domain would kind of be a natural domain of you got to be greater than zero you can't have a side length of a fence that's negative so it's kind of an obvious statement but what we're going to do is and we can't have an area that's negative so it'll limit us but anyway we have this demo open parabola we're going to find our vertex that'll give us our maximum area so let's let's do that based on the fact that we have this negative x squared plus 1500 x our a is negative one and our b is 1500 our c is 0 but that doesn't matter for a vertex so negative 1500 divided by 2 times eight two times negative one that looks like seven hundred fifty to be so fifteen hundred divided by two seven fifty the negative is simplifying to a positive one and now the actual area we're going to be more space than that the actual area what that says is that your x your x is going to be this side length is going to be 750 looks like feet long well according to our area function we can plug in 750 it will tell you what the maximum area is so take your 750 and evaluate a of 750. make sure that when you do this you plug in 750 you square that first and then you change its sign the the there's no parentheses around that negative so 750 gets squared and then made negative and then you're going to add 1500 times 750. and it looks like we get 562 500 square feet so with a dimension of our x side being 750 we're going to get this as our maximum area this is our x because that's the variable that we had this this area in terms of this is our max area now you're probably going to be asked to find the y as well just take your look at your constraint your constraint should be solved for the variable you are missing so hopefully it's not surprised to you that the area that's the greatest type of a rectangle is a square a square develops the greatest area for its perimeter so 750 subtracted from 1500 is going to also give you 750. so our dimensions are 750 feet by 750 feet and sure enough if you take 750 times 750 you get that right there so that's the way we'd find the maximum area for some sort of a measurement like this one thing that people often will do here to make it a little bit more interesting is imagine you only have three sides you need a fence because you have like a river here well the same exact thing would happen it's just your constraint would change if you had a river on one side where you didn't need fencing then you would just have two x's but only one y it's actually easier to solve subtract your 2x make your substitution do your distribution and then you'd find your version actually the vertex formula that's about it just remember that that's going to be an x measurement and your maximization this is your max area you are finding the vertex of your your area function that gives you a dimension of one side and the actual area if you plug it into your function okay in our last example i'm not going to do much with it i just want you to take a look at this it's going to be pretty nasty but that would be the projectile the the height of a projectile h is our height for some sort of projectile starting with at 45 degrees with a 2 000 foot per second launch so if we wanted to find out a couple things about it i'm just going to talk you through this if you want to figure out how far it goes so this is the according to how far it is away from where you launch it the height according how far you wait where you launch it if you want to figure out how far it goes what it's uh let's say effective range is what it's ranges we'd set this function equal to zero so set this equal to zero you want to figure out when it hits the ground right so when it hits the ground is the distance of its trajectory so if you set this equal to zero and solve that's a quadratic you can do quadratic formula you can factor a whole bunch of things to do there but anyhow that's how we figure out how far this would go set the height equals zero so function equals zero and solve for x if you want to figure out its maximum height well then we would say find your vertex if you want to figure out the maximum height this projectile reaches then you would have your a is this nasty thing and your b is one so on your vertex formula you would have negative one that's negative b over two times negative thirty-two over two thousand squared that is what your vertex would look like as far as your x-coordinate and then you would figure that out and plug it into your function to figure out your height and your height would be right there i just want to talk through that because that's that's a somewhat common problem for for people to encounter much more common as an area or like a business type of problem so i hope that makes sense i hope you understand the nature of minimums and maximums on using your vertices for parabolas i hope i've gained some interesting examples for you and i'll see you for the next video you 

Transcript for: Introduction to Polynomial Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 27)
hey everybody welcome to another video we are going to start talking about polynomials and polynomial driven functions like rational functions for a very long time and so in this video i just want to refresh what a polynomial is and some of the vocabulary we'll be using as we go into the future stuff so it's very short video there's not much to do this except for kind of recapping what you should know about polynomials if you don't that's okay i'm going to tell you right now so we're going to talk about what polynomials are some of the verbiage that we use what are not polynomials and then how we really want to see them so next few videos will unpack what all we we do with polynomials especially from the aspect of how do you graph them or better yet maybe a picture of the polynomial in your head like a sketch so you can interpret what it means and get into calculus that's really important so what polynomials are and we're going to go with it polynomials are these kind of creatures in math where we have several terms poly being this sort of mini and and no meal or non this this uh this sort of name or term and so what a polynomial is is several terms it doesn't have to be several it can be just one term but typically it's several terms that are combined with addition and subtraction so you're going to notice on the board right away that that looks really confusing you go that looks like a whole bunch of garbage yeah i get it but it's just one of the ways that we can show what a polynomial will look like eventually so what polynomials are are these these math expressions in this case we have a function so we have a function we're talking about polynomial functions these math expressions from here to here that are connected with addition or subtraction you know well that all looks like addition that's true but if we had coefficients that are negative we would write that as subtraction so this is the way we structure a polynomial so we can kind of wrap up all the cases in one so what does it mean firstly i want you to notice that these a's have different subscripts and they match these exponents so the exponents n and n minus 1 n minus 2 and then all the way down until you get to a 2 a 1 and then no exponent above an x has no x at all at the very end which is a constant term that's how we want to structure our polynomials we want them in order that's one of the notes that we have up there is that exponents need to be in descending order so you want your biggest exponent first it's pretty important because it does a few things for you my kind of spoiler alert here there shouldn't be any spoilers in in math like you should know what you're getting out of it we want these in order for a number of reasons number one our leading term which is what this is we'll talk about that in just a second our leading term tells us a tremendous amount about the polynomial and most importantly what it looks like graphically we are going to get end behavior from our leading term we're going to get the degree which gives us end behavior from our leading term the degree also tells us how many zeros we have if we include complex numbers so it's pretty powerful also we want our constant to be at the end the reason why we want to do that is because if we have a constant you can't just factor out an x if you don't have a constant you can which is pretty cool so it means it's automatically factorable if you don't have a constant if you do have a constant you're going to want to know what that is because if you can't factor this easily or use something like quadratic formula for degree 5 and higher polynomials there is no such thing as a formula to give you zeros doesn't it doesn't exist up to power four there is but it's extremely difficult and it takes a lot of time and so we have something called the rational zeros theorem and you're going to want to know what's your leading coefficient that's the number in front of your living term and what your constant is because if you know those two things i can teach you what the rational zeros are going to be if you don't know those two things you have to search for them it just it's cumbersome so those are some of the reasons why we want our polynomial in order by descending exponents so this n this n minus 1 n minus 2 all the way down to 2 1 and nothing at all we want that to be descending so n obviously is our largest one n minus 1 and now you might be asking the question well wait a minute are we am i always going to have a polynomial where it's like x to the fifth and x to the fourth and x to the second no you're not and that's why we have a coefficient in front of every one of these is because sometimes we can consider those coefficients to be zero and then it takes that whole term and it wipes it out so that's one of the reasons why we structured this way is to make room for every possible polynomial it looks confusing they're honestly not all that bad but that's what that means and sometimes i've seen students just look at that and go i'm never going to get this yeah you will it's not it's really not that bad it's just telling you that hey you have a lot of terms yeah they're going to be added and subtracted we want them in order so we want our biggest exponent first and then descending to our smallest these coefficients they're the numbers in front of our terms they match up to our specific uh our specific specific exponents so this would be the coefficient that matches up with this this exponent coefficient here can some of your coefficients be zero yes they can be zero and that would annihilate these entire terms so that means that you don't have to have an exponent on for every possible case below your largest power which is also your degree so that's what those are for now a couple couple key words that we have uh the first one you've heard me explain it probably define it already is called the leading term if you have this in order then your leading term is going to be the term with the largest exponent it should be your first term if you've done it in order shouldn't it i mean it's got to be in order right you want the biggest one first and the leading term is the term with the largest exponent that's why it's in the front your leading term is a sub n x to the n and those that right there it's really the only um coefficient that we don't want to be zero because you should start somewhere and so this leading term is what they're talking about they're saying hey you know what it's going to be the term with the largest power that's what the leading term means it should be the first one because you should be writing these polynomial functions in order and we already talked about why it's really important that's going to give us end behavior that's going to give us the degree it's going to give us the number of maximum turning points if you subtract 1 from the degree it's going to give us the number of zeros if you include complex numbers there there's a whole lot this gives us and it's going to be part of with our leading coefficient that's the number in front of our leading term there not including the x that's going to give us the rational zeros theorem so pretty important the constant term should be last it's the only one without an x on it if you notice our x's are going to have exponents that that sort of expire uh by the end of it do you have to have a constant no i've talked about that you don't have to have a constant but if you do it should be last so a sub 0 is our constant term we wouldn't consider it to be a coefficient because it's not a variable term variable terms are terms that have variables in it and we have lots of terms in polynomials there should be only one constant term why well because constants are always like terms so if you have more than one constant term you could add it and you see that a lot in like differential equations calculus things like that or if you have a couple constants you add them together and you call them a different constant if you don't know exactly what it is so we should only have one constant term in our polynomial functions like that now the degree what your degree is our degree is the largest exponent that appears in your polynomial it should always be the exponent of your leading term because hey that's the term of the biggest power that should be in the front that's what your degree is so our our degree here is n i'm going to write out right now that it's just the the largest power that is included in your polynomial what you don't do what you don't do is you don't just go add up all your exponents it's very common for students to do that because you're going to see i'm going to teach you a way to sort of fake distribute to find the degree it's pretty cool it's really easy it's going to save you a ton of time especially when you have these really super factored polynomials and you need to find the end behavior well it's really annoying to have to distribute that so i'll show you a way to do that but i caution you here all you're really looking for is look at your leading term pick out the biggest exponent that you see up there it should be in your leading term otherwise that order and that is your degree so i'm going to put and what i'm going to say is this is just the largest exponent in the polynomial and again it tells us a lot about it we've already talked about that i'm not going to recap it here but moving forward we really need to know what the degree is helps us out a lot so um just to run down one more time polynomial means many terms they're always separated by pluses and minuses that's what creates terms for us so you're going to see pluses and minuses you don't have to have more than one term to define a polynomial but most of the time they are more than one term we want the exponents in order descending biggest is smallest that means our first term is always the one with our biggest exponent called our leading term it gives us a lot of information our degree is the exponent of our leading term the number in front is our leading coefficient the coefficient of our leading term and the constant term should be last if we have one so we're going to take a look right now we've really already talked about the second note that i have that these these polynomials need to be in order of descending exponents we're going to look through some that are some that aren't and then all of the exponents and polynomials have to be positive or zero so basically non-negative integers that means whole numbers what that means for us is we can't have any fractional exponents no rational exponents so there's no square roots in polynomials have we dealt with those before well yeah but this is about polynomials it's our our kind of most basic type of function we start with it here because they're easiest to graph so that's why we're doing it so that we we understand the graphs of polynomials and we can make inferences about rationals we make inferences about these other things based on that but we've got to start somewhere so polynomials do not have fractional exponents you're like that's nice it is nice it means we don't have anything really nasty our our domain is really easy it's just all real numbers because there's nothing crazy about polynomials we don't have any negative exponents that means that we don't have like a number with a variable on the denominator why because that would give us asymptotes so with polynomials our domain is all real numbers all the time and that's fantastic we're going to get into end behavior a little while in a different video but that's that's really nice to know that that our polynomials do not give us any domain issues so you might want to write that down that our domain for polynomials is all real numbers as soon as we start putting radicals logarithms and denominators that have variables inside of them we oftentimes get domain problems we get these uh these issues that say hey you can only be positive that's logarithms you can be positive including zero that's square roots or fourth roots but not cube roots right you put negatives in there or you have hey you're dividing now by zero that's a vertical asymptote so when we do that we are going to start getting domain issues that's most of this class honestly is graphing by those domain issues which is pretty cool but for here for polynomials we don't have any of that stuff your domain is all real numbers your range is either negative infinity to positive infinity or infinite positive infinity to positive infinity or sorry zero to positive infinity unless you start shifting around but you you have this this range that's very predictable you have a domain that's very predictable it's all real numbers now let's look at this let's see which of these are actually polynomials we'll identify um the order we'll identify the leading term we'll identify the degree and then we'll identify which one of these are not polynomials so if we look at f of x this 5x squared plus x to the fourth well the first thing we're going to ask ourselves is is there anything that's making this not a polynomial because if it is we're really not going to talk about it yet so when you look at that are the exponents all positive so non-negative are they all integers yeah 2 and 4 look just fine there's no negative exponents there's no fractions with variables on the denominator that would be a negative exponent there are no rational so fractional exponents that would be like a radical so rational exponents give you square roots cube roots things like that so this is fine the only problem that i'm seeing here is this is not in order so a lot of times we spend just a second to get our polynomials in order this is a polynomial from the start but we just want it to be in order now let's talk a little bit about it now that this is in order and what we're talking about is not the coefficients i could not care less about the coefficients being in order it doesn't matter what matters is the exponent so the four and then the two i want those exponents to be descending as i go from term to term from left to right that's what we want so that's an order that looks really good you'll also notice that there's no power three here so could you write it as a power three i was talking about this a little while ago and this is important because when we get to dividing rationals or using long division of polynomials which i'll teach you is that you need a place for every potential power of x this is what i was talking about earlier is there a power 3 in here yes and no do you see it no could you write it yes if you wanted to you could give it a zero coefficient that is still the same polynomial four x to the fourth plus zero x to the third plus five x squared that zero hey you know about coefficients you know the coefficient is multiplied by whatever the variable is that's next it says no matter what you plug in that's zero because it's a term it's separated by pluses and minuses that zero would completely annihilate that term but you could write it and that's why this is written this way it's saying yeah yeah we have every power of x going down to none sure but a lot of those coefficients could be zero that's why that's there so here you go yeah i could write this do i need to in some cases yes here no not really but you just need to be aware that you could do it so let's erase that let's talk about this and say all right well since that's an order it has a leading term the leading term here would be 4 x to the fourth the entire term the leading coefficient is four the degree is also four that four it's the exponent so our exponent of our leaving term is called the degree tells us a lot about the function now the next term is 5x to the second power or 5x squared and our coefficient here would be 5. we do not have a constant term so that's a polynomial how about the next one how about g of x 3 minus 1 half x you know i see a fraction fractions are fine as long as they're not exponents that right there is a polynomial but it is out of order so when we write this in order we need our x terms no matter what they are to come in front of our co our constants and you'll notice i'm always taking the sine of the term with it so here we have negative one half x plus three that's a polynomial the leading term is negative one half x our exponents are decreasing this is x to the first power this is kind of weird but could you think of this as x to the zero power yes x to the zero power is not zero it's one anything to the zero power is one you have zero uh but you wouldn't we wouldn't consider that because we plugged in zero we'd get um we'd get a constant there so for any non-zero so we'd say all right well if i have x to the zero power that being one then this would still be 3. and so that right there because of that that case though we don't have we wouldn't say that that's a variable term we'd say yeah it's not there's not really an x there we would just consider that to be our constant so that's in order we'd say that our exponents are decreasing there's just none at the end our leading term is negative one half x to the first if you if you want right now you should be thinking of the degree the degree here is one the leading coefficient is negative one half and our constant is three let's look at a couple other ones these are often confusing but i want to make sure that you understand this are these polynomials and answers yes they are so h of x equals 9 is a polynomial even though there's one term if you remember i told you you don't have to have more than one term it's just often times you do however you don't have a variable here so 9 is just a constant term it is our leading term but it's not a variable term so we wouldn't say that 9 is the leading coefficient but what is our degree what we would say here is that our degree is 0. for the same reason i showed you earlier it doesn't really have an x it doesn't really have a variable if it did that exponent would have to be zero and so we would say this term this function is a constant function man you should see it right you see that's just a horizontal line at nine that's all that thing is our degree is zero now contrast that to the next one f of x equals zero you go well wait a minute this has this is actually constant the constant is not you yeah that's that's that's a non-zero constant its degree is zero because well if you had x to the zero power give you one sure and you'd still get nine back in this case if you have a function that equals zero you're going to say that that's no degree why why the difference why does why is this a degree zero but this one has no degree the zero is a very interesting interesting number it's this this multiplicative construct really that if you multiply it by anything it gives you zero so you take zero by any other number and you're going to get zero well what that means is that you could put any x over there and it's not necessarily going to matter what that exponent is you're going to get zero for that reason whether it's x to the third or actually the 31st you'd still get zero you could put any exponent up there and get the same thing that means that the exponent doesn't matter that degree could be anything and therefore we say it has no degree so when you have a zero function like h f of x equals zero in this case that has no degree because that is has um that constant right there that zero constant no matter what you multiplied it by as far as a variable is concerned it would end up being zero anyhow and so while we're not multiplying we can't say it has any specific degree because whatever the degree would be you'd say it would be zero so we say there's none does it super matter no not really uh the big things here that we're getting into minutia right now uh the big things here are that put it in order make sure you know what a leading term is make sure you know how to find the degree and then uh understand what the constant term is and that that's at the end how about the next one so f of x equals x to the three halves well that's weird as soon as you say that as soon as you see a fractional exponent what that is that is a square root of x to the third power that's a radical there are no radicals and polynomials so we'd say this is not a polynomial function we're not going to be talking about these right now there is a time and a place but it's not here we start getting domain issues out of radicals often times so we're not talking about that one this is not a polynomial how is this is this a polynomial and the answer is no if you have fractions with variables on the denominator and you can't get rid of them well those fractions with the variable denominator would end up being negative exponents you could write this as 1 minus 4 x to the negative 1 power remember that negative 1 here would become a fraction with x on the denominator to the first power this right here is not allowed for polynomials we're not going to be talking about it we will be talking about rational it's going to give us a vertical asymptote at zero that's going to be great but it's not here so polynomial sure positive exponents no problem following me here sure positive exponents that are not fractions here positive exponents yeah zero non-negative means including zero positive and zero so yeah here uh it's a weird one we say it has no degree it's a zero function uh how about x to the three halves positive yes but fractions are not allowed for polynomials here no negative exponents not allowed for polynomials how about the last one uh is a polynomial polynomials have only to do with the the way that our term is structured and the type of exponent we have so our exponent is 4 2 and then a constant those are not negative exponents and they're also not fractional exponents so even though it might look a little bit weird with pi minus pi x squared that's crazy this is still a polynomial is it an order yes the exponents four and then two and then your constant are in order that's fine so right now identify your leading term in your head you should be thinking my leading term is nine x to the fourth no problem our leading coefficient is nine and our degree is four that degree 4 is going to tell us that this polynomial is even it's an even based polynomial that end behavior is given by your leading term and your degree the next term is negative we include with the sign pi x squared where our our coefficient for that term is negative pi it's kind of awkward but that's okay and our constant term is one-half so that's in order it's a polynomial we have identified the leading term and the degree and that's great that's really all we want to be able to do what i'm going to do now is i'm going to put a couple more on the board that i really want to show you some some intricacies with okay so i had put up four more examples talking about whether or not these are polynomials because this can be a little bit confusing for some students they don't quite grasp what's going on here especially with the fractions and the radicals and how to find a leading term without actually distributing that's the cool part so let's look at this g of x right here is that a polynomial no it no it's not it's not going to be one but you need to do something before you make that determination so how we determine whether or not we have a polynomial is take and see if you can divide it and see what happens here now from its structure just at the beginning we'd say no this is actually a rational function rational is this idea of ratio fraction where you have a polynomial divided by another polynomial however sometimes we can cheat the system if we divide it and so we can we can find a domain and then divide the functions and treat it like a polynomial except for the case of missing some points in the domain we call those things holes so we'll talk about holes and asymptotes a whole is a removable discontinuity it means basically you're missing a point so why is that not a polynomial because it doesn't have any negative exponents right now that's positive that's positive however if you were to divide this and simplify it both of these denominators you can move as x to the negative 2 power and 5x to the negative 4 power so i say this way if you have any any fractions where you have variables on the denominator and you cannot simplify it completely away that thing right actually just from the start that's not a polynomial if you can simplify it you can treat it sort of like a polynomial we call it a removable discontinuity a whole i'll show you that later but this would not be a polynomial this is a rational function now the next one think about what i just told you if it's a fraction where you have variables on the denominator that is when you run into that i am a rational i'm not a polynomial this is a polynomial there's no variables on the denominator and if you were to simplify this if you write this as you could think of this as 3 7 x squared minus 1 7. hey it's in order our exponent is positive and that's a constant my leading term is 3 7 x squared my leading coefficient is 3 7 my degree is 2 and my constant is negative 1 7. that's certainly a polynomial you just can't make the jump until you really look at your denominator if you have variables down there no that's rational if you don't yes that is a polynomial and you can write it as a polynomial with these addition or subtraction of terms in order that's what we're looking for the last one right off the i mean you can look and say yeah man you got square roots everywhere and that's that's not a polynomial and you'd be right however just consider for a second if you were to distribute it perhaps those square roots go away perhaps you simplify them now i will tell you something that's very dangerous if you if you distribute and somehow it gets rid of your square roots it gets rid of your fraction does something where it changes the look of it you need to have found your domain first because in doing this it can make it appear that your domain changes your domain from the original function will not change for the better you can only make it worse it's not going to change for the better so if you start distributing this you go oh my domains all real numbers now but it wasn't before but it is now that's a problem so from the beginning we'd have this thing in our head like wait a minute square roots have to be positive zero or positive so positive numbers if i start distributing this 2 square root x times square root of x is just 2x that makes it look like this part of your function's domain problem is gone now you all real numbers that cannot happen and so from that idea from the beginning say this is not a polynomial it already has domain issues and we know polynomial polynomials have no domain issues you can plug in anything to a polynomial because they don't have rational exponents this is x to the one-half power that's already a rational exponent you can't have that for polynomials so right there you'd say yeah that's not polynomial that that's a radical expression actually and our domain for polynomials has to be all real numbers all the time however what i just said was sometimes you can get a better look if you if you distribute and you can sort of treat it like a polynomial sometimes so it is worthwhile to understand that this is not a polynomial we distributed from the beginning we knew our domain wasn't all real numbers we know our domain had some radicals in it we knew our domain had fractional exponents they're not integers integers are whole pi basically whole numbers here non-negative integers are positive whole numbers in zero um even if we distribute it though we still have that square root of x so we're kind of done smoking on that one now the last example i want to talk to you about i am going to teach you right here it's the probably the most important one for you to pay attention to because this is going to really save you a lot of time later often times we get polynomials that are factored or you create a factored type of polynomial but you still need to figure out the end behavior why well you don't want to know what this this polynomial looks like whether it's going like this or like this like this my favorite dance moves what um so you're going to want that's really dorky i'm sorry you're going to want to know what the leading term is the leading term gives you the degree it will give you end behavior it'll give you the maximum number of turning points that you have but it is a pain to have to distribute this let me pause right here for a second sometimes you're going to have to distribute this if you are going to start on the right hand side and work your way left so distribute your expo well distribute this because it has an exponent x minus 1 times x minus 1 then you distribute this through your product then you distribute this term through the rest of them or this factor through the rest of them don't start this way it's very confusing that's just my opinion now can we find the leading term without distribution yes i call it fake distribution i don't know what if there's if there is a real i've never seen anybody else do this but here's the way that you would do it show where your products are so for instance you have a product here here here take the largest power of your variable that you would get if you were to distribute every factor i'm going to say that again look at all of your factors there's one two three and four take the largest power that you would get if you were to distribute it honestly all you got to do because distribution would take your this term times another term twice take your exponent multiply it by your largest term it should be in order right because these are polynomials take it and distribute that so take it this is 1 and distribute that so take for every factor the largest power that you would get here this is just two here this is x cubed for this factor you get let's see x squared two times one is two that's x squared here's x to the first one times two is two that's another x squared can you see it if you were to factor or if you were to distribute this you have x minus 1 times x minus 1 the largest power you get is x squared here you have x squared oh there's there's only one of those you'd have x squared that's your largest power here x cubed there's nothing to multiply that by as far as changing the exponent if you take every factor and do what i've done take the largest power you would get by distribution and multiply it this is going to give you your leading term just remember when you're multiplying these these variables that have exponents you add your exponents so we have two we'd have let's see three four five six seven two x to the seventh is your leading term your degree is seven your leading coefficient is two your end behavior is a positive because hey that's a positive number odd we haven't got to end behavior i know this but i'm prefacing where we're going so you it makes sense when we get there you're positive and odd it's going to look like this your function is going to look like this it's going to go from negative infinity to positive infinity it's not going to be like this that would be a positive even this would be a negative odd negative leading term an odd degree and this would be a negative even negatively term and then an even degree so this is a positive odd we know for sure that this polynomial if you were to distribute it and you were to graph it it's going to have an end behavior looks like this start down there go to there that's pretty neat so that's the way that this fake distribution sort of works um if this had been let's change it one time if this had been like a power three this would be a six you'd multiply two times three that would give you six and you would add them up so you'd get three nine ten eleven that would be to the 11th power so anyhow that's going to come in really handy i'm going to refresh your memory when we get more into like multiplicity and finding out sketching of these polynomials but that that's practically what you need to know right now polynomials are these many terms added and subtracted you want them in order you want to be able to find your leading term it's super important your degree and your constant the only thing we really have to focus on is that all of your exponents or polynomials have to be non-negative integers so that's zero and positive numbers and whole numbers if not you don't have a polynomial polynomial's domain is all real numbers means you have zero issues because there's nothing to create issues in a polynomial that also means that it's going to be the smooth continuous curve with no cusps those are sharp points no gaps no holes and no asymptotes that's super convenient and lastly you want these things in order all the time hope that makes sense that's just a little refresher kind of a bigger refresher than i thought and we'll get on into power functions next time you 

Transcript for: Power Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 28)
hey again welcome to another video in this video we are going to talk about something called power functions i'll tell you what that means in a minute but i want to tell you why we're learning it we are learning about power functions for one reason to get a picture of the end behavior of a polynomial here's what's going to happen when you have a polynomial and you have found your leading term the end behavior of your polynomial is going to follow that leading term and that leading term is a power function so what a power function means it's just a polynomial with one term so the whole concept of what we're going to be doing remember i was teaching where we're going the whole concept what we're doing is look at your polynomial look at your leading term find the degree check out the leading coefficient that's a single term you're looking at that power function one term is going to tell you the end behavior of your polynomial so that's why we're talking about power functions is you get a picture of the end behavior so that's why i want that's what i want you to be thinking of is the polynomial going to be looking like this like this like this or like this at the end of it at the ends because that's the only four cases that you can possibly have for polynomials so we're going to talk about that but that's the concept so with that in mind thinking about that let's go through and talk about power functions so what a power function is it's just this polynomial with a single term like i said we're going to be looking at the leading term as our power function so what that means is that they're pretty easy to graph and they're very very predictable so in order to get a kind of a view of what power functions do what they look like let's look at a few very simple power functions from here we're going to draw some conclusions about what if your n is even what if your n is odd because they're all going to be this way we'll talk about just a picture in our head of what these four would look like and then how to go and use transformations which you've already done i'm not spending a whole lot of time on that one so our power functions are very predictable and they follow one of two patterns whether they are even or whether they are odd they're going to follow one of those two patterns an even function is symmetrical about the y-axis and odd function is symmetrical about the origin that's the only two things we can possibly have with a power function so and why why because if we have anything else there'd be something added or subtracted to it or within it to shift it around and doing that would create more terms even if i had parentheses here with something inside i could distribute right and that would give me more terms so because power functions have only one term there's no shifting there's no way to not be symmetrical about either the origin or the the y-axis i had those backwards by the way the origin of the y-axis if you have power functions so very nice very predictable let's take a look at it what we're going to do here is just plug in negative 1 0 and 1 and get a pattern we're going to take the pattern and talk about even and odd power functions so if i take f of x equals x and i plug in negative one i'm going to get negative one zero zero and one i'm gonna get one so we'd have this nice function that would have those three points let's go over to x squared now i'm going to draw the the curves in just a minute because i want you to follow the pattern let's go over to x squared i'm going to plug in negative 1 and get positive 1. 0 get 0 1 and get 1. so i have these three points and again we're going to draw the curve in just a bit let's go down to x cubed if i take x to the third power and i plug in negative 1 0 and 1. negative 1 to the third power is negative 1 again 0 i'm going to get 0 1 i'm going to get positive 1. look at exactly the same points as f of x equals x the exact same what we call key points key points if you remember from lots of videos ago are a great way to graph with transformations because it lets you move the graph around and still have three points to graph with as long as you understand the shape these are the same and in fact when we get to odds every odd function at power function ever is going to have these three key points negative 1 negative 1 0 0 and 1 1 every single one of them will have those three key points now let's look at x to the fourth x to the fourth power if i plug in negative one if i evaluate that negative one to the fourth power is positive one zero gives you zero and 1 gives you 1. these are the exact same three points we got an x squared and in fact every even power function ever is going to have those same three key points negative one positive one zero zero and one one so really all that differentiates between our odd and our even is this side of your graph this is what dictates whether you're going to be symmetrical about the origin be able to rotate that 180 degrees or about the y-axis be able to fold it over and have a mirror image it's just that that exponent so if we had this is where the the phrase even or odd really comes from it's from power functions if we have an odd exponent you are going to have an odd type of symmetry about the origin if you have an even exponent and your power function you're going to have even symmetry about the y-axis that's true all the time for power functions so wait a minute if we always have the same same three points and all of them go through the origins you notice that they have to because they can't be shifted around there's no adding there's no subtracting there's no other terms just one they all go through the origin they all have the point one one odds have negative one negative one evens have negative one positive one and that dictates your symmetry they're very predictable so what is the difference between these two graphs and these two graphs the difference is the the radicalness of your your graph itself and here's what i'm going to say as your exponent gets higher these graphs get more dynamic more dramatic so f of x equals x to the first power man that's just a straight line that's a constant slope do you remember that slope here would be one up one over one up one over and up one over every time that's a constant slope so that's just our normal diagonal straight line that would create a 45 degree angle between x-axis and the line itself that that's it but as we start increasing our exponent we start curving it so we start going and then x to the fifth would be even more dramatic and actually the seventh even more dramatic to the point where it would look almost like a box like this sort of boxy in nature so x to the third is going to be a lot more curved in its nature if we had x to the fifth maybe i can superimpose that here real quick for you x to the fifth would still go through the same three points but the way it would do it is much more dramatic so a very steep and then super shallow and then very steep again and the higher our exponent the more dramatic our graph is going to get so that's why i put this odd over here i'm not going to put any graph on here at all because if you have an odd exponent either one or three or five or seven or nine or so forth all of them are going to climb every single one of them is going to climb every single one of those is going to climb from negative infinity on the y-axis to positive infinity they're all going to look like this now if we have a coefficient that's negative yes we can switch them but they're all going to look like that every single odd ever is going to look like that that's kind of cool that's kind of predictable we have some key points there that we can use in our graph the idea is hey if you know that your leading term remember we're always going to lead in terms of always going to graphing here if our leading term is an odd degree we know that the end behavior our graph is going to look like that that's super cool we also know that it's like a fifth power it's gonna be very dramatic seventh power very dramatic third power not so much first power well we kind of know how to graph those already um so that would just be a straight diagonal line that's that's kind of easy but they're all going to have those key points now as far as even sort of the same thing happens we know that x to the second power has this really nice normal parabola we're very used to it x to the fourth is going to start getting more dynamic more dramatic it's going to be a little flatter here and steeper as we get past 1 and negative 1. so what happens with our degree remember the degree is the largest power we talked about last video what happens with our degree is that within 1 to negative 1 we're very very flat and the higher the degree the flatter we are outside of one to one very very steep and the the the larger the exponent the steeper that we are do you notice that the x to the fifth would be very steep until we get here and then it flattens out flat flat flat very very dynamic curve and then outside of that very very steep very interesting the same thing happens with x to the fourth if we would have something like x to the sixth x to the eighth it'd almost start looking like how like most of the rectangle would be almost straight down very very sharp curve almost flat very very sharp curve and so the higher exponent we get the more dynamic but all of our evens are going to fit this model where we go through negative 1 1 0 0 and 1 1. they're all going to look like this yes if we had a negative coefficient it would reflect it to remember that how a negative coefficient reflects a graph we can do that but this is the main point of of our power functions i want to go through it just just one time to make sure you get the main point the main point is when we get to graphing polynomials which we're almost there we're going to look at the leading term the leading term is one term therefore it's a power function it will either be even or odd i believe either have an even degree or an odd degree and that will tell you whether your function does this or does this if it has a negative in front of it well it can reflect it then this or that that's it we can also start graphing this with our key points which is pretty cool we can use that for transformations mostly but let's let's imagine something for a second let's imagine that these are our leading terms of four different polynomial driven functions and let's see if we can put a picture to it so here's what i want you to do if these are our leading terms i want you to think about f of x equals 2x and think in your head whether that is an even or an odd power function first remember that even oddness of functions has absolutely nothing to do with the coefficient has only to do with the exponent so the exponent here is one and you go wow that's an odd power function how is it going to look is it going to look like this is it going to look like this in just just the generalness well this is a odd so it's going to have to go through negative 1 1 0 0 and 1 1 it's going to have to climb so it's going to have to climb from negan infinity to positive infinity we'll talk about domain and range here after we cover this so here in our case that is going to be this sort of climbing function and now we think about it what's the what's the exponent so our exponents one it's not very dynamic in fact it's going to be a straight line so we picture that in our head this end behavior looks like this same slope so with 2 over 1 throughout it's just a straight line it's going to go from negative 5 to positive infinity on the y axis that's pretty cool how about the next one the next one is negative three x to the second power first thing we want to do understand that this should be the leading term of some larger polynomial or just finding end behavior how it looks at the tails that's what we want well that has a well what type of an exponent well it's a two that that's an even even functions have to look like this or this depending on the coefficient so we know that if i covered that negative 3 it would go through negative 1 1 0 0 and 1 1. so this is this almost parabola that is a parabola this almost parabola type of even and now we look at our coefficients well that's a negative what what do negatives do what's the three do remember the sum transformations um if you need to watch that video go back and watch transformations from a while back because that will tell you that hey that negative that reflects it that 3 makes it narrower but it doesn't take away the fact that that's an even and that means symmetry about the y so this is even yes reflected okay and more narrow that's telling you end behavior so this is a larger polynomial and this is the leading term the term the highest degree the term of the high sorry term the highest exponent giving you a degree of two that this would have an end behavior that is downward even and narrow that's what that would tell you how about this negative x to the third so we think let's see uh negative x to the third if that's going to be our leading term that's a power function it's got a degree of 3 so 3 is odd 3 has this idea of negative one one zero zero one one okay it's climbing how's it let's cover that that would be climbing how is it climbing uh well it's got this sort of curve in it it's not straight it does have a curve in it because of that power 3. now think about the negative that negative would take your here's my odd and now i'm going to reflect it so this this power function says i'm going to be dropping so this this curve downward and that's if this was a leading term of some larger polynomial we would understand the the end behavior of that saying yep i'm going to look about like that it's a power three so it's going to have this curve in it yeah a little bit more dynamic than a straight line it's negative that means it's reflected from this so we're dropping from positive into negative infinity last one how about x to the fourth if the seven x to the fourth can you picture it can you picture that this is symmetrical about the y-axis just like this was symmetrical about the origin it was okay we could reflect it's still symmetrical this is symmetric about the y-axis so it has to match up on both sides of the y-axis this is a positive seven so this is even looks like this positive seven okay it's not reflected and seven itself says i'm pretty narrow so the end behavior of this graph wherever it comes from looks really narrow like that it's going to be very dynamic i hope that makes sense i hope you can see here the the value and understanding what our power functions are because they're going to be coming from our leading terms our leading terms are going to give us this end behavior and that's really really nice to know as far as our domain because these come from polynomials and polynomials have a domain of all real numbers the domain for all of these is all real numbers there's not a number that you won't be able to plug in and get something out get a real number out so all of them are real numbers there are no negative exponents there's no rational exponents there's no logarithms therefore with these polynomials you can have all real numbers all the time now as far as our our range goes we've already talked about key points we know that as far as our range the range for an odd power function look at it every one of these graphs even if it had been negative and reflected it would go from negative infinity to positive infinity on the y-axis so every one of them is climbing from all the way down there to all the way up there so our range is negative infinity to infinity on the y-axis this is not true for evens range for evens is from zero to positive infinity or zero to negative infinity depending whether you have a negative in front of that that power function or not and the way we'd write that zero to positive infinity or negative infinity to zero signifying the upper half of the y-axis and the bottom half of the y-axis this is if you have a positive power power function so no negative in front uh then we'd go obviously upward that'd be zero infinity or if you had a negative front and reflected it we'd go from negative infinity up to zero they've always have to be written in order so i hope that makes sense to you i hope that you understand the idea of we're taking lead term and we're just seeing whether it's like this like that so odd positive odd negative or this or that even with a positive even with a negative that's pretty much it one thing that i i really i wasn't i said it i didn't write it down i just want to make sure that you understand that odd power functions are symmetric about the origin i always said that but make sure we write a little note there symmetric about origin so we have there this idea of rotate 180 degrees you the same picture and then symmetric about the y-axis we've talked about it but that's about it so we have key points we know that all odd power functions ever go through negative one negative one zero zero one one that gives us a climbing graph or positive or a falling graph if you reflect it ever even ever goes through negative one one zero zero and one one that is a climbing graph that's symmetric about the y if we have a positive inverter power function or reflect it we have this uh falling graph if or downward opening so that's a better way to say if we have an even with a negative part of it we have our range hey that's all real numbers uh for in for domain for both of these all real numbers for a range for odds not all real numbers for evens you're either going to choose the upper half or lower half of your y-axis depending whether you have a negative in front of your power function or not and then we have two different symmetries about the origin or this mirror image about the y axis now let's go on let's talk about graphing these with transformations we've um we've done this very quickly before uh we i'm sorry i've taught you this before we're gonna do this very quickly right now just to make sure that you see it one last time that this is uh uses some ideas of symmetry but because we're shifting it you're going to you're going to lose the idea of being an odd or an even function we're still going to use the fact that based on it but it's not going to be an even or odd function any longer because we've shifted away from the y-axis and away from the origin let me show you some ideas though so let's identify it with g of x first what's it based on is it based on an even power function or an odd power function of course we're going to look at the exponential that's an odd power function now honestly are you really going to want to distribute that and graph this as a polynomial because it is a polynomial but graphing that would say you don't just get to distribute the 5. you can't do that you could find your leading term that way but you don't just get to say hey x to the fifth plus 32 no no no you take x plus 2 times x plus 2 times x plus you five times distribute that then distribute the three and then subtract the constant of three and then you'd have a polynomial that's crazy if we have something that's nicely factored man what we can do is we can transform this we can use our transformations we should understand that that is a shift down three left two and that three impacts our key points so this is why we needed to know about the odd power function this is based on because this is going to give us key points so let's go through it if we shift down three and left two that's a horrible life too we have this idea of a new origin that's where the new origin would be if we take our key points and pretend that that is the origin then we can use the the sort of this was based on x to the fifth uh power function to graph from that point i've done this in transformations just kind of refresh your memory if our key points are negative one one zero zero and 1 1. why do we know it because that's an odd that odd says every power function with an odd degree is going to look like this going to have negative 1 1 0 0 1 1 we're just shifting it so we said yeah we're down 3 we left 2. what this does this says hey take your three multiply your outputs not your inputs one times three is three zero times three is zero one times three is three and if we graph these key points from our new sort of x y axis from our shifted x y axis we're gonna get a power function that's been shifted so we're taking two ideas we're taking the idea of transformations we're taking the idea of power functions and we're combining them we're saying this is a shift down three that's a shift left to this is a multiplication of an output times three we've talked about it before and that power five says you have an odd here odds are negative 1 1 0 0 1 1. put the ideas together let your shifting take you down 3 and left 2 let your power function say here's my key points let your multiplication of your output say here's my new key points and then plot them if we plot let's see negative one i'm sorry i messed up and you should have caught it hopefully i had my key point wrong so my key point should be negative one negative one zero zero one one that's negative one three times negative one is negative three zero zero so that's where i got messed up good thing i checked my workout as i was going zero zero one here's one one two three right there and if we go a little bit lower one two three i'm kind of estimating here we have a key point of from our origin negative one negative three zero zero and one three from our new origin we're working again we're combining these ideas this is where our power function would be based on after we shifted we're going to get a very dynamic climbing graph we know it's dynamic because that power 5. so we're using two ideas we're using shifting to get down 3 left 3 and then power function to get key points multiply them so let's take a look at it if we know it's a super dynamic graph and we're going through these points we're going to make sure that we go up make it crazy dynamic it's remember these are sketches here and we have a very good picture of that graph with very very minimal work that's the way we can use transformations down three left two the idea of key points from our power function negative one negative one zero zero one one the idea of multiplying that's another transformation idea and then shifting and getting the look of a power five power function where a sort of new x y axis is are these dotted lines actually here no it's a graphic organizer to give us a very good picture of what we're doing it's allowing us to take a look of a power function which is always at the origin and give ourselves sort of a new origin to graph it from it's not really new origin but it works really really well let's try the last one so one issue that we have is that polynomials are always in order and we really do want our transformations in order too so with that being in order let's take a look at it first thing that i want popping into your head is what type of a power function this is based on so we just look at the exponent go that's a power four so how do power fours look well they're symmetrical some way either upward or upward upward or downward but they're symmetrical they also have some key points key points for these even power functions our negative one positive one kind of messed it up before zero zero and one one so those are our key points what we're gonna do is allow our transformations our shiftings to move our origin to adjust our key points and let us graph a power function it's sort of a new origin it's not really there but it allows us to use these ideas in conjunction with one another so we sort of have a feel freezing look at least the symmetry about some sort of an axis of symmetry we know our shift says we're going to be going up three we're going to be going right to and that creates this new origin this new x and y axis where we can graph a power power function from is it really going to be symmetric about the origin or about the y axis no it's going to be symmetric about your new origin or your new y-axis that's the point of why i'm having to do this we're sort of cheating at it we're using while we're thinking about it being smart about it and using two different techniques now let's let's go ahead and do it because our our key points are negative one positive one zero zero and one one and because we have this negative 1 that's being multiplied by our outputs it will affect our outputs it will reflect them so this would give us negative 1 negative 1 0 0 [Music] and positive 1 negative 1. and if we graph those in relation to our new x-axis zero zero is our new sort of origin negative one negative one right about there positive one negative one find it out there and then we understand this is a degree four that's very powerful that's very dramatic and we know that it's symmetric about our new y-axis this axis of symmetry and it's downward opening we expected it to be downward open because of that negative so let's go ahead and do that it's not a parabola sort of looks like one but it's more boxy it's much more dynamic very much sharper curves in this thing one thing i do want to say is these are sketches if you have to be more accurate you do things like hey plug in 0 to find your y-intercept so take and plug in 0 here and figure out what your y y-intercept would be plug in 0 here figure out what your y-intercept would be the actual y-intercept that you would you would have uh set this equal to zero to find x-intercepts sometimes it's not that easy and often times they're not whole numbers so if you had to do that you could also one thing that a lot of people do is they'll plug in a number outside of this range somewhere outside of this this interval somewhere they plug in something like five or four plug in something like negative one they get additional points however i gotta warn you that with these exponents like four five six they are just super up there super down there they get so dynamic so fast they're almost ungraphable uh for for things outside of where like your vertex should be or your your point of symmetry in this case here and here when we start getting way outside of that these exponents make values that are just huge or really really really negative and so they're very hard to graph so a little recap to make sure we got this power functions are one term what we're going to be doing is looking at the leading term and saying hey this is going to model the end behavior for us there's really only four of them because your your polynomials always have a domain of all real numbers never have any issues with it you can only have four looks they're all going to be continuous they're going to be smooth nice curves but they'll only look like this odd negative odd even negative even that's it all we have to do is be able to understand what our function is based on odd or even in this case maybe understand some shifting down three left two take that as an output multiplication that's a factor for your output here up three right to factor for your output multiply it and use your key points when we get to actual polynomials where we're graphing with um multiplicity and things like that we'll be there very very shortly our end behavior just says where we're pointed this this this or this and that's that's pretty much it so i hope that makes sense if you're a little bit sloppy on the the transformations maybe go back and check that video out about what the down three and the right the up three came from the left two and the right two because that might be confusing for you and how we take this number to multiply our outputs of our key points so if you forgot that maybe check it out other than that i hope you hope you saw what we did we just took the idea of a power function and the idea of transformations and we we just marry them together that way we can use the ideas of a power function hey there's symmetry we're just moving the place of symmetry by by transformations hey there's uh there's key points we're just moving where the key points are by transformations as pretty cool odds are symmetric about the origin even symmetric about the y-axis so if we move those things we still have that sort of symmetry just somewhere else so i hope it makes sense i hope that you are still with me and next time we'll talk about getting into zeros of polynomials and getting into multiplicity have a great day 

Transcript for: Multiplicity and End Behavior of Polynomials (Precalculus - College Algebra 29)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about some features of polynomials as far as what they do graphically these are super important and they're also super cool uh what they do is they allow you to picture what the polynomial is going to do sketch it and get a fairly accurate picture with minimal work what we're going to talk about is multiplicity so what in the world that means and what end behavior does and turning points a little bit and that's at the very very end so we're going to talk about multiplicity first what exactly that means in relation to the roots or zeros or real zeros or x-intercepts that you're going to get from a polynomial after you have factored it after you've found some sort of x-intercept in that in that function so we'll talk about exactly what that does how it relates to a graph of that polynomial and then what the end behavior does as far as when you graph them we're not going to be graphing today but we're getting a very fairly clear picture what's going to happen when we get there so let's talk about multiplicity first what in the world that means what multiplicity refers to is a repeated zero or root or x-intercept in a polynomial or any function really uh that you're that you're talking about so what that means is if you can factor a polynomial which i've given you one that's factored and you have the exponent that exponent is going to determine the multiplicity of that particular zero or how many times that zero is repeated and i'll talk about that in just a little bit what it's going to do for you because again i don't like suspense so at least not what i'm teaching so here's what multiplicity is going to do multiplicity is going to say hey take all of these factors that you have set them equal to zero because we know that we can find x-intercepts for any function we set it equal to zero and look at the exponent that exponent will determine multiplicity and will tell you one of two things whether that zero that you get from every one of these factors that has a variable don't worry about the seven doesn't really matter as far as your x intercepts take every factor that has a zero or has a variable set equal to zero what that zero is going to do it's going to either bounce or touch the x-axis or it's going to cross it depending on what your multiplicity is whether it's even 2 4 or odd 1 5 you can say right now that this zero is going to create a bounce or a touch on the x axis so is this one that's a cross that's a cross why i'm about to explain that to you but that's what's going to happen so let's go ahead let's walk the process let's find multiplicity let's talk about the zeros talk about what a repeated group is why it's called multiplicity multiple roots talk about what those exponents do and they get a sort of a picture of it down here so if we ever want to find x-intercepts of a function including polynomials like what this one is based on this is just a factored version of a polynomial if we were if we wanted to do that if we want to find x-intercepts we set that function equal to zero so when we do that if you were just let's excuse the notation here just put that equal to zero and say that function is now equal to zero then in order to find x-intercepts from a factored version of a polynomial we set every factor that has a variable in it equal to zero and that's called the zero product property if we know that several things are multiplied together and that equals zero then each of those factors can set equal to zero will maintain that that's that statement so saying yeah if x equals zero it makes us true if x equals two it makes it true if x equals negative one-half it makes it true if x equals negative three it makes us true that's the zero product property kind of in a nutshell and we're doing the exact same thing fortunately we have all this factored uh well what if it wasn't factored i'm going to teach you that in the next section i'm going to teach you how to get to this point from a let's see degree 12 polynomial because there's no general way to factor that without knowing zeros so we'd have to have that in the first place so let's go ahead and let's use the zero product property there's a couple things i would like you to do when you're going through this process number one for every factor that has a variable make sure it's in parentheses this looks great this looks great this looks great but in order to not get confused on our multiplicity what i'm going to do i'm going to build parentheses right around that x because that x itself is a factor that we're going to set equal to zero i don't want you to get confused with the seven i don't want you to get confused with that power two as far as being a root itself x is going to be a zero the seven has absolutely nothing to do with that i know that's a little bit confusing so what's what's a seven do the seven determines the um kind of a factor that lets you make it more dramatic like like remember when we had if we just had x to the second power we'd say all right we know what that is that's a parabola if i put a 7 in front of it what's that do the parabola makes it very narrow it does not shift it it doesn't shift the the the vertex of that parabola that's still at the origin but what it does is it narrows it but if i put a negative 7 well that narrows it and reflects it it doesn't change the vertex at all it doesn't change the x-intercept at all and so this this coefficient coefficient of leading term really this coefficient of leading term has nothing to do with the x-intercepts themselves has to do with more with the shape of the graph and whether or not we are reflecting it now it will affect how we interact with the x-intercepts whether we cross it one way or another but that comes a little bit later when we start graphing so long story made short factor your polynomial we got it make sure that you have parentheses around every factor that has a variable in it like this one this one this one and now that one that's great and now we're going to set all those factors at variables equal to zero by the zero product property so we're all right well what what do we have then we have x equals zero and x minus two and x plus one half and x plus three equal to zero well that's a zero product property now we solve them all we all right that's that's pretty easy to solve this one's already solved so just x equals zero i'm going to write it again just because i want all of them to be here for us and if we add 2 we get x equals 2 and x equals negative 1 half if we subtract 1 half and x equals negative 3 if we subtract 3. so let's see 0 got it add 2 got it subtract 1 half subtract 3. these are all of the x intercepts that we can possibly have on that polynomial there's only four x intercepts now now wait a minute i just told you a little while ago that's a degree 12 and i'm going to get to that once we finish this example like how i determine the degree 12. it's that sort of fake distribution that i showed you i'm going to show you how to find the leading term in just a little bit but these are all the x-intercepts so why aren't there 12 of them well because we run into a repeated zero what's a repeated zero a repeated zero or a repeated root repeated x-intercept is when your factor has a power that's more than one so for instance what you could do with this it would be super awkward but what you could do with this instead of writing the seven x squared and then x minus two and then x plus one half to the fourth power you could do something a little crazy you could write this as seven times x times x that's the same thing as seven x squared times x minus two and this is where it gets a little crazy times x plus one half times x plus one half times x plus one half and you could do that again x plus one half i'm gonna pause there for just a second because hopefully you're gonna get the point right now we could do that this is still seven x squared times x minus two times x plus one half to the one two three fourth power here's the point of multiplicity or repeated word roots could you set x equal to zero and x equals zero yes are you gonna get two different roots no are you gonna do the same root twice yes and that twice you get in the same root twice that's what multiplicity means it's a repeated zero it's you're getting the same thing twice and that determines what happens with your graph that's really cool it's so valuable when we get into polynomials and we get into graphing rationals is knowing how many times that root is repeated will dictate whether we bounce or touch the x-axis or whether we cross the x-axis just based on the number of times that zero is repeated i'm going to tell you why when we get down to here so you could set this equal to zero uh let's see x plus one half equal to zero x plus one half equals zero x plus one half equals zero x plus one half equals zero but you're gonna get x equals negative one half four times that zero is repeated four times that has multiplicity four that's going to tell you that we're bouncing off the x-axis at x equals negative one-half that's awesome that's very important for us to know this you could do five times i'm going to write it because it's really annoying but you could write x plus 3 times x plus 3 5 times you would get x equals negative 3 5 times do you actually need to do that in order to understand you'd be getting the same root five times no you just need to know what exponents mean exponent means a repeated factor so we have a repeated factor repeated twice we have a non-repeated factor it's only done it's only repeated but it's actually not repeat at all you just have to have that same factor once we have a repeated factor four times a repeated factor five times that is what multiplicity means so frankly you do the zero product property without worrying about the exponents you get your zeros or x-intercepts or well real zeros or x-intercepts or your roots and you look at the exponent from where you got your zero you look at the exponent that is of on the factor from where you got your zero and that is your multiplicity that's how many times your root is repeated so what we would say here is that x equals zero has a multiplicity of two and x equals negative 2 has a multiplicity give it an exponent make sure all of your factors have an exponent they all will this has a multiplicity one x plus one half has a power four what that means is that this zero this x equals negative one half has been repeated four times that's a multiplicity four and lastly x plus 3 has a power of 5 that means that this 0 would repeat be repeated or this x intercept is repeated 5 times you get 5 of them if you were all that out and set them equal to 0 eat the same 0 5 times that's all multiplicity means how we use it is very powerful but that's all that it needs this is multiplicity 5. so if i can recap real quick which i'm going to because i'm making a video here's what multiplicity means and now what it does multiplicity means take a polynomial and factor it from those factors if you set the function equal to zero to find x-intercepts from those factors you will get zeros or x-intercepts or or roots if we do that use the zero product property and then solve them these are the only four real zeros or real roots or real x intercepts that we get the number of times they're repeated comes from the exponent above each factor from where you got your zeros that's how many times the zero would be repeated and that right there is called multiplicity now here's what it does depending on whether your multiplicity of your zero is even or odd it will tell you whether you bounce or sometimes we call that touch the x-axis or whether you actually cross it so it's not about the value of the x-intercept itself it's about how many times that x-intercept is repeated multiplicity means multiple times of repetition so we look at this and go all right this 0 is repeated twice it has a multiplicity 2. that is an even multiplicity i don't super care that it's too uh i care that it's even or odd i care whether the multiplicity is even or odd this two this x equals two this is not repeated you only see it one time that fact only appears once that is a multiplicity one we'd say that's odd multiplicity right there that shows you i'm not talking about the evenness or oddness here that's that's not the thing the thing is how many times we've been repeated that's multiplicity and whether that number is even or odd and i'll explain why it does this after i finish x equals negative one half that's a repeated root four times that's multiplicity four we really need to understand that that is an even number of repetitions of that zero even multiplicity and lastly multiplicity five says that factor's been repeated five times that zero would come up five times if we went ahead and worked all that out and set each factor equal to zero that multiplicity five that's great what i care about is that multiplicity is odd and here's the whole interpretation for us and why it works if you have a zero with an even multiplicity and all zeros all roots all x-intercepts if they're real numbers which you can't get there without complex numbers if you're just factoring normally so if we're if we're getting real zeros real x-intercepts all of them are going to intersect the x-axis so i call them x-intercepts in the first place they all intersect the x-axis every one of these every one of those numbers you're going to have your graph in some way interacting with the x-axis at x equals zero and x equals two and x equals negative one half and x equals negative three this graph will be there on the x axis however how it intersects er sorry how it interacts intersects depends on what your multiplicity is if your multiplicity for that zero is even then this graph is going to we call it either touch or bounce off the x-axis it's going to go down and go boop or come up and go boop and bounce right off of it it will not cross in other words it looks something like this either your graph is going to come down touch or come up and touch but it will not cross now i'm going to answer the question why why does it do that why does that even make it bounce and not cross i want you to think on sort of a microscopic level for just a second and we call doing that like a neighborhood so you live in a neighborhood probably uh where you have some some neighbors around you some like some like points around you but it's not talking globally all right so when you say neighborhood you're sort of zoomed in to like where you live so we're zoomed in to where these x-intercepts right here live and around that neighborhood what you would have if you say hey if we have an even multiplicity what happens when you have an even multiplicity that's like a power 2 or a power 4 or power 6. what happens when you take numbers to the second power or the fourth power or the sixth power well they're all positive what that means is that on both sides of that x-intercept that has an even multiplicity so around x equals zero let's imagine like this is zero for second around x equals zero then you would square that the numbers what's going to happen well they'd both be positive yes but i want you to think more importantly they'd both be the same sign so what they'd either both be positive or if i reflected it both be negative they'd have to have the same sign around the neighborhood of that x-intercept so for evenness for even multiplicity around these zeros x equals zero and around x equals negative one-half if i take something a little bit to the left of that just a little bit over here little neighborhood or a little bit over here little neighborhood and i plug that in and then i say okay take that value subtract one half and then square it around that neighborhood you're going to get the same value of an output um either both at least a sign both positive or both negative it's not quite symmetry so i hope you're hearing this it's not exact symmetry around that but it will at least have the same sign either both positive or if i put a negative in front of this both negative and it sort of depends when we get a little bit further on whether you're bouncing coming up and going down or bouncing coming down and coming up i'm going to explain that to you in another video but the main point here is that in a neighborhood around the x-intercept if you have an even multiplicity another route that's been repeated two times four times six times etcetera then what's happening is that your neighborhood around the x-intercept has to have the same sign both above or both below the x-axis i hope that makes sense to you i hope you're kind of getting that that hey even multiplicity is going to bounce or touch gonna look like this around that x-intercept and the reason why is because the neighborhood around that you have to have the same sign as far as odd goes if you have a zero or a root with odd multiplicity you're going to cross the x-axis at that point so you'd look something like this or that either coming down and crossing or coming up and crossing the x-axis why well because we know that with with odds once we get a different sign so if i pick a number let's say this and do this again let's pick how about just two here's x equals two now look look at where that two came from that two came from x minus two imagine picking a number in the neighborhood that means very very close that doesn't mean three that doesn't mean five that means like 2.0001 a neighborhood is really tight knit compared to the world your neighborhood is super small okay so if i pick something in a neighborhood of 2 like 2.01 or 2.0001 2.00001 so something right close to 2 but just bigger than it what's going to happen well something just bigger than 2 minus 2 is going to be a positive number if i if i take a positive number to a an odd power like 1 or 5 or 7 3 1 3 5 7 any of those odds it's going to maintain that sign of being positive i'm going to say that one more time you really need to get this so if i take a number that's slightly bigger than 2 and i subtract 2 from it i'm going to get a positive value and i take it to an odd exponent it's going to maintain that positivity for me i get a positive that's above the x-axis now take something in the neighborhood just smaller than 2 like 1.99 okay take 1.99 and subtract 2. but wait a minute that's negative yes it is now a negative to an odd power what's that do well that maintains negativity negatives to even powers don't negatives even powers maintain the same sign as if you were positive it doesn't really matter because we know that even powers maintain sign for both positives and negatives odd powers switch sign and that's why we cross for odds and that's why we bounce for evens because in that neighborhood if i had an even whether i'm above or below the number i get a positive or negative yes but when i square it or take to the fourth power or six power gives me the same sign when i have an odd if i'm above or below in that neighborhood it's going to give me a positive or negative yes but odds maintain the sign of that so for positives things bigger than that i get a positive and for negatives taking it to an odd power i get a negative that's above and below or below and above the x-axis it's going to cross it here that's above and above or below than below because it maintains the same sign i hope that makes sense maybe watch that again to get the point of in the neighborhood around your zero you'll be positive excuse me positive or negative but the way that your exponent interacts will either keep the sign the same or reflect it keep the sign the same or change the sign if you're odd even to keep it the same that's why they're sort of quasi-symmetrical around that that's why they maintain the same sign they're just going to bounce but odds don't switch sign that's therefore we cross so i hope that makes sense that's what multiplicity does for you and we're going to now we're going to use that the last thing i wanted to tell you before we get into end behavior maybe after we get into end behavior i'm going to show you how to fake distribute that to recap that so we'll get there in just a minute all right so now it's time to move on to end behavior these two things if you haven't realized it yet these two things are going to be super important for our graphing we just learned a minute ago that multiplicity what it does is basically tells us if you can find your x-intercepts which we're going to be able to do after the next section we're going to be able to factor it as much as possible over linears or irreducible quadratics we're going to be able to do that we're going to be able to use the zero product property to be able to count exponents and say hey this is a double root or a single root or a quadruple root or a clint double root or basically multiplicity two one four and five and determine from that whether they have even or oddness we talked already about how evenness maintains sign in the neighborhood around your x-intercept and therefore you'll bounce maintain sign either for positive negatives you get the same sign out bounce or for odds you cross different signs different outputs that are the opposite sign outputs that's going to tell us whether we're going to bounce across around the x-intercept that's very valuable for graphing we need to know that the second thing we're going to learn today is about end behavior what end behavior does it says because these polynomials are all continuous we'll talk about that in last they're all continuous there's no gaps there's no jumps there's no holes asymptotes there's no cusps there are these really smooth flowing curves that that go to and from infinity somehow all along the x-axis and once you start restricting domain which we're not we already learned that domain of polynomial functions is all real numbers look at anything there's no room for a domain issue well what that means is that our end behavior is going to be one of four cases our four cases are you can start from negative infinity on the on the y i'm talking outputs here negative infinity and go to positive you can start at negative and go back to negative start from positive and go to negative or start from positive and end with positive think about the cubic function x cubed looks like this and the quadratic function x squared looks like this that's positive to positive or negative to positive you're going to get one of these four shapes on any i look like i'm dancing now uh you're going to get positive to positive negative negative negative to positive or positive to negative as far as our infinities are concerned that's the only four things we ever get out of polynomials and it all comes from the leading term of your polynomial i told you in the last video it was important this is where the rubber meets the road for the leading term so if we look at our polynomials the leading term all that means if you need a little refresher is that if you put this in order it's the first term that you see it should be the term the highest exponent that's your leading term so in our case our leading term is 3x to the fifth here our leading term is not negative 2x to the third because that's out of order so if we took just a moment to write this in order our leading term would be negative 5x to the fourth here's the point within a finite interval of the x-axis your function can do a lot of really cool things but outside of that it's going to behave as far as your leading term dictates your end behavior is determined by your leading terms so if we think about like way out there on the x-axis it's going to be determined by this so this is going to look and behavior-wise a lot like i'm going to use squigglies to say approximately so like the end behavior is going to look approximately like 3x to the fifth at least that's what it's going to look like when we get out to the infinities x approaches negative infinity and x approaches positive and we're going to see what that looks like and for g of x it will look approximately not modeled exactly but approximately like negative 5x to the fourth so all we need to understand is what those power functions look like you remember that last video so the power functions are basically looking at your leading term and saying hey what's what's that going to be well that's an odd well what do odd functions look like well around the origin they're symmetrical about the origin and around the y-intercept our y-axis evens our symmetrical about the y-axis so here's what this would look like this says this is a positive a three's positive odd type of a function odds look like this when they're positive so why am i leaving the middle not filled in because this is end behavior only what's going to happen is that this function is going to start by coming up increasing it might do some sort of turning points things like that and then it's going to end increasing that's the point when you put this in conjunction with what you're doing around your x-intercepts it's extremely powerful with these two things multiplicity and end behavior if you add just two more to them any y intercepts that you have and any turning points you can identify you have a very very powerful graph turning points are really identified like a calc one class where you take derivative set equal to zero and you go oh that's probably a turning point let's just do a sign analysis test and it's not that hard um here we're not there yet because you don't know what a derivative is yet but you will and keep this in mind when you get there that if you know multiplicity oh my gosh students usually forget it and then i have to refresh it or they never ever really put it together use that and end behavior and you have a very powerful graph so for our our leading term you go yeah that's a leading term that gives me end behavior i know it's odd odds look like this or if i have a negative they look like this for evens go well evens this is a our leading term negative 5x to the fourth i know even functions look like this or if they have a negative they look like this why well because even power functions have to be symmetric about the y-axis why is that because if i take positives and negatives and i take them to the fourth power or second power or sixth power it's giving me the same sign out if i reflect it it's still the same sign but negative that's the same exact logic that we use with multiplicity that's why i paired these things together because they have very similar concepts odds don't work like that i'd say if i take positives and negatives and take them to an odd power i get out a positive and a negative respectively or if i reflect it a negative and a positive reflective respectively it's going to reflect but they're going to be opposite signs so odd opposite odd opposite that means cross even the same even the same that means bounce same exact idea that we're using but now it's on a grand scheme it's saying hey look at your your leading term let that be a power function for you and then determine that is a negative even even means the same but negative means downward opening so this would look about like that now some some interesting things might happen in the middle of this we might get some x-intercepts that be determined by this we might get some um some turning points that are not associated with the x-axis and we'd have to identify those typically with calculus or estimate them but that's about it so one more thing what if we change some signs what would it do if we change this to let's say negative 3x to the fifth then what that would say is you're an odd you have opposite signs but now i'm reflecting it so now it would sort of do that i'm trying to color code coordinate for you so that the opposite there would reflect your graph totally reflected actually here if we change this to a plus then instead of downward we sort of get a upward opening at least as far as the end behavior is concerned that would be an even sure but positive means you'd come from positive infinity and at positive infinity or at least heading that way that's what end behavior does for you uh the last thing that i want to talk about is is this i mentioned turning points a couple times what a turning point is in a graph is where you have a local that means in a little neighborhood a local maximum or a local minimum so where you take your graph and you are increasing then change to decreasing local max or decreasing then change to increasing local men they're they're basically like a little peak or a little valley somewhere in your graph if your polynomial has degree whatever in this case degree 5 there it is or in this case degree 4 there it is that's always from your leading term then you will have one well at most one less turning point than your degree what that means is that if your degree is five you can change directions at most four times so if you're a degree five and you know that you go from here to here let's say you're a positive degree five uh well how many times can you change direction and still make that work well you can do one change one two three four but you can't do a five because you'd end at the wrong infinity so to make this work you can have at most four changes to make you still end up with the end behavior that you need for degree five polynomial even if you reflect it still the most four changes you can do without messing up your end behavior or likewise imagine a power four or degree four a degree four polynomial should either end this way or this way it's even it has to it's based on that sort of symmetry idea at least from our power function that's why we have approximately it's not exactly symmetrical but it's based on that so if you have to end this way so degree four you can have at most three turning points that would be down then up that's one up then down that's two down then up that's three what if you did a fourth well you'd be facing the wrong way you'd be an odd so you have to have at most uh one less than the degree number of turning points does it have to be that many no it doesn't it really depends on what's happening in your function but it doesn't have to be that many turning points it's just at most that many the last one i've said it already but every polynomial because of its its domain being all real numbers there's no room for any sort of asymptotes it's like a kind of a force field that you can't hit it makes it a sort of weird gap in your function or a hole or a cusp but cusp is just a sharp point be like going like this and then a sharp point there's no room for that in polynomials they're not that interesting so every polynomial creates a continuous this is continuous curve with no cusps no sharp points that means they are continuous everywhere and also later on in calculus they're differentiable everywhere means you can find a derivative or a slope of a curve at a point so the tangent line to a curve at a point everywhere basically they're the the uh the least interesting graph that we have because there's there's nothing weird about them and that that's pretty much it that's what i need you to know about polynomials at this point next time we'll focus on starting to find functions from zeros and then after that we're going to graph them so it's it's pretty cool but hopefully you can see how important this is to graphing man if you can factor and you know your zeros your x-intercepts from your zero product property and you can find repeatedness multiplicity of your roots you know whether you're going to bounce cross bounce or cross that's very important i explained to you why if you know your end behavior so basically just your leading term you know whether you're going to end this way this way this way or this way just by reading whether you're odd that means opposite associate odd with opposite uh positive or negative or even positive or negative that's it the last thing that i wanted to talk to you about i mentioned it i said after we finished end behavior in this multiplicity i would show you again how to fake distribute because the multiplicity here is very easy but your end behavior might be eluding you you go i i'm not i don't remember how to do that with your end behavior um what we can do is sort of fake distribute this distributing this would take a very very very long time you'd have x plus three five times you'd have to foil it because five times a lot of inside outsides and distribute so instead of doing that use the same concept that we had that there are one two three four five factors here one of which is a a sort of a constant factor and then what we're going to do is multiply them together as far as the largest powers that you would get from distribution so we take our 7 times x to whatever power is here your multiplicity x squared times x to whatever power's here x to the first times x to whatever power is here x to the fourth x to whatever power's here x to the fifth that i guarantee you will be your leading term if you took the time to distribute all this don't forget the seven it's pretty important because you know that that seven was negative it would reverse your end behavior so keep that that's seven and then we know that if we're multiplying x's we're going to add those exponents that's 5 9 10 11 12. that's 7 x to the 12th ah so right now what's the end behavior you should picture in your head what the end behavior is is the end behavior odd well no is it even negative no because a 7 is positive this end behavior will look like this guaranteed that is so powerful when you have it in conjunction with your multiplicity all of which has to work together you get a very clear graph with almost no work now finding the factors yeah that's a lot of work we do with that in a couple videos but at least we have that so again if i change the sign made that negative that would now be an even so same sign but but uh reflected so downward opening man i hope that's made sense to you oh yeah one more thing if this had been an irreducible quadratic if that had been an irreducible quadratic like x to the second power plus three don't forget that you would have to multiply these so you'd have two times five that would give you ten here not seven you would multiply that and the reason being you have x squared plus three times x squared plus three times x squared plus three five times so if you were to distribute that you get x to the tenth and then here you see all nine see seventeen yeah 7x to the 17th that would be an odd if it's positive this way or if i put that negative back that would be an odd reflected okay now i hope that makes sense so you talked about multiplicity we talked about end behavior we've done an example of that fake distribution to get the leading term where we get end behavior from and next time we'll start wrapping all this together so i hope you enjoyed it and i'll see you for another video you 

Transcript for: Creating Polynomials from Real Zeros (Precalculus - College Algebra 30)
hi welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about how we can go from x-intercepts or zeros or roots into a polynomial type function so it's pretty important because what we're going to be learning at the very end of it is that if we have a graph and we can identify some x-intercepts well then we can build a function from it same thing is going to happen in the next few videos where we find some zeros and then build functions from that as well so pretty useful for graphing gives us a very good impression of our interpretation i should say about how x-intercepts and polynomials play together and one way we can go is from x-intercepts into the polynomial so we're going to learn how to do that and how we're going to start is we're going to kind of rediscover how factoring and the zero product property give us x intercepts and then we're just going to go back to that so here's what we're going to learn we're going to learn that if you have an x intercept you can create a factor and by using the zero product property we can take those factors and build a polynomial from it so this is only to do with polynomials for now but we can use some of the same ideas to build rational functions later on when we get to rationals which is a polynomial divided by another polynomial so let's check it out imagine we have a function x squared plus 2x minus 8. and i know that you've seen this before but remember what i'm trying to teach you i'm trying to teach you how going from here to our our zeros our x-intercepts our roots if we go backwards we're gonna be able to start with zeros x-intercepts or roots and find polynomials from that so let's let's discover it how we find a zero or an x-intercept or a root of any function is we set it equal to zero so let's start that now if we don't have factoring available to us for quadratics it's pretty nice because we can just do the quadratic formula and we're good for cubics those power threes we do there is a way to do that there's a formula sort of that you can use and even fourth powers you can do it it's very very labor intensive uh for fifth power and higher degree five polynomials and higher there is no general way to factor it that means there's no formula that you can just throw at it uh plug in the coefficients and it does it for you quadratic formula is the easiest one that we have uh there is one for power three and a power four but none for a power five and higher you can prove it but it takes some fairly high level math uh to do it you do learn this in like a bachelor's level mathematics and so we're not going to be doing that maybe even masters level i can't remember where i learned that but we're not going to be learning that what we're going to be learning a little bit later is if you have a power 3 power 4 power 5 power 6 if you can find some zeros that means you can factor it and so you're going to be learning that in the next few videos what that means is that factoring is sort of our our best case scenario for working with these polynomials for quadratics man we should really try to factor them and this one is in fact factorable but later on if they're not factorable we're going to be trying to find x-intercepts so as to make them factorable i'll teach you about the the rational zeros theorem a little bit later so let's go ahead and factor this this of course we know is x plus 4 times x minus 2 equals 0. now here's the point because we were able to factor this polynomial we're able to use the zero product property to set each of those factors equal to zero and it's going to give us two in this case real x-intercepts now keep in mind i know that you know this what i'm going to do is after we finish this i'm going to structure this problem as a way to go backwards and get a polynomial from your x-intercepts so zero product property and if we solve that we get two x-intercepts these are the places where this parabola upper opening crosses or intersects the x axis at negative 4 0 and a 2 0. now here's the point what if you were only given this say hey we know two x intercepts can you go backwards and figure out the function from it and the answer is yeah and it's pretty easy there's only a couple things that we want to make sure that we we do number one is we want to make sure that we have any multiplicity taken care of with an appropriate exponent on the factors that we create from our x-intercepts we also want to make sure that we match degrees that's the degree of the polynomial if one's given to us lastly if we have a point that's given and we get this often times from graphs we're going to do this in the last half of the video if you have a point that's given you can find a specific polynomial if you don't then you find a general polynomial sort of a family of curves that has these x-intercepts and we'll talk about that as we get into the factory we'll notice that man this this could be a whole lot of different polynomials that are given so typically we have a little a out front to say this is a family of polynomials of a specific that has specific x-intercepts that would fit this and so we'll talk about that as we go so let's go ahead and let's start going backwards so what if you were given some x-intercepts can you go back and find find a polynomial well let's suppose that we have x-intercepts of negative 3 4 1 and 0. what we're going to do is we're going to allow the zero product property to work for us in reverse model it exactly the same just going backwards so if we have x-intercepts then we know that x would equal negative 3 x would equal 4 x would equal 1 and x would equal 0 for some polynomial if that's the case if that's true if x equals negative 4 well then that's an x intercept of some function we're saying the reverse now here's your x-intercepts of some function that means that x equals negative 3 for some function we're going to find now x equals 4 for some function x equals 1 for some function and x equals 0 for some function that we're going to find those are the x intercepts now how do we build a factor from it if you solve this so that you get 0 on one side so basically undoing your solving if you add 3 to both sides or subtract 4 subtract one subtract zero don't do anything then that right there gives you your factors we're basically doing the opposite of this step you're saying hey you know what from x plus 4 equals 0 i got x equals negative 4. can i create these factors see here's the point what we want is we want to find the factors so that every factor is set equal to 0. if we do that the zero product property works both ways it says if you have products that are multiplied to zero then every factor can be set equal to zero but likewise if you have factors set equal to zero you can multiply them together and that product is still equal to zero that's the zero product property in reverse so we say all right here's our x intercepts great let's create some factors where the zero product property is going to work in other words have some factors set equal to zero and make sure that every single one of those factors is equal to zero then what this says is man you have one two three four factors every one of those is coming from an x-intercept what that means is that you can develop a polynomial not the only one but a polynomial that has these as its factors and by setting them equal to zero you can use a zero product property in reverse and so we're going to do that right now we're going to say all right these factors are x plus 3 x minus 4 x minus 1 and x we typically put individual term factors in the front of an expression not out of necessity just out of convenience it looks a little better we don't lose them as often so let's check it out and just just think through through it with me if you were to do this backwards if you were to have a function like this a polynomial has been factored like this and you have it equal to zero you could certainly say well yeah by the zero product property you'd have x equals zero x plus three equals zero x minus four equals 0 and x minus 1 equals 0 and that would give me these four x intercepts so we're basically just doing this in reverse that's really all there is to it's not not super complicated you just need to know what to do and this is one way that we can go from x-intercepts into a factored version of a polynomial now you'll notice something about this this right here is a function that's set equal to 0. to get a function out of it you just go yeah one function that would have these x-intercepts could be f of x equals x x plus 3 x minus 4 and x minus 1. now i said this is a polynomial that would have these x-intercepts and i don't want to have your brains explode or anything but you can put any number out front and have the exact same x-intercepts wait a minute what any constant factor like let's say seven if i put seven there that seven has absolutely nothing to do with those x intercepts it wouldn't change it or negative seven it still would not change those x intercepts try it if you want to if you put a negative seven in front you would still set x equal to zero the negative seven does nothing even if you take the negative seven and put it over here and divide by negative seven it does nothing as far as your x intercepts all that would do is start changing the the let's call it dramaticity the dramaticness i think it just made up two words right there of how it grows between the x-intercepts or shrinks or reflects it would certainly change the shape of your graph absolutely and the end behavior of your graph again negative to positive for sure but it would not change the x-intercepts the way that this graph interacts with the x-axis now that's interesting what that means is that when you do this technique if you do not have a specific point off of the x-axis that you're going through then you are not really sure about a specific function itself and to signify that we usually put a little a in front to say you know what any a that's a constant factor any a positive or negative would not change the x-intercepts so any a here would have exactly the same for x-intercepts and that's really interesting so without a specific point i said that twice now without a specific point then you leave this a here because you're now talking about a family of functions that all have the same four x-intercepts now what if you do have a point off of the x-axis well then you can use it i'm gonna explore that when we get to the graph so we'll see the point or if they give you a point like hey this goes through the point uh one comma something then you can like one comma two well then you can plug in the two for your function the one for your x because this is the input that's the output input is one for your x's output would be two for your f x and you can use that to solve for a it's not all that bad but without that without a point that is off of the x axis you cannot get a specific function i hope that you understand that now why why off the x-axis well because anything off of the x-axis is not going to be an x-intercept the zero product property says that you're multiplying to get zero so each of those individual factors doesn't really matter if one of them is zero it's something off of the x-axis does matter and it won't be zero it won't it will affect the um the shape of your graph and that that one point will kind of dictate what the shape of the graph is it'll allow you to solve for that a without becoming zero so we're going to explore that in graphs and that's about all there is to it one thing i do want to tell you is that sometimes you'll be required to distribute this i generally don't because it takes a whole long time if you're required to here's how to do it start at the right hand side this is my opinion i think it's the easiest way to go start the right hand side and you would foil this or distribute this then once you have this expression distribute the x plus 3 and then distribute the x and then distribute the a if you have to typically you'll want that to be a number if you're going to distribute that so hopefully you have a point that's off that's off of that x-axis and that's really all there is so we're going to keep on going with a couple more examples where i show you how to deal with multiplicity and why they give you a degree here because that can be confusing like who cares like you didn't give me a degree here or what why why does that matter i'm going to explain that as we go through this and i'll show you why this was sort of an incomplete question to begin with so let's go ahead let's say they give you some zeros or they can call these things roots or they can call these x-intercepts as long as they're real x-intercepts when we start getting into complex zeros complex roots you wouldn't call them x-intercepts anymore because they don't intersect the x-axis when they give you these zeros what we can do first off is to understand that zeros are if they're real are where your graph intersects the x-axis that means that we would get x equals man i talked so long my pen ran out i think goodness because i'm used to that we would get x equals negative one and we would get x equals zero and x equals four and x equals nine if those are zeros then that's where the graph would intersect the x-axis and we've done this many times in reverse where we have a function we factor it we use zero product property and we get our solutions here you could also do negative one zero zero zero four zero negative nine zero but it doesn't really really make a difference from these x intercepts or these real zeros we can create factors so we're being smart about it we're understanding that if i get zero on one side of my equation basically going opposite of solving so in this case adding one doing nothing subtracting 4 and adding 9. then what this allows us to do is to view these x intercepts as some result of a factor that's set equal to 0 by the zero product property we're straight up going in reverse of this well now if all of these are set equal to zero we can consider them to be factors of some polynomial some function so we'd say all right well one factor equal to zero is x plus one this is what gave us the x intercept of negative one in the first place and x we usually put individual term factors out front and x minus four and x plus nine those would be the four factors that we would get from these four x-intercepts you're done the only thing that we have to do right now is to say by the zero product property this is true we're using in reverse so we start with x-intercepts we say let's create some factors that are set equal to zero then we have all of our factors set equal to zero they have to come from somewhere or you could create a function that uses zero product property to state that those are factors so we write them all out the last thing that you would do is you'd say because i have not given a specific point here this is one of many functions that would satisfy these four real zeros and so we'd say yeah there's a function as possible this is one of them we don't want to leave it here equal to zero because we're asking for a function technically we're asking for a polynomial and polynomials are typically not factored in when you write them in standard form and so you would usually distribute this so distribute these two and then this one on top of it and then this one on top of that and then if there's a coefficient out front then you distribute that as well for us we say this is one of many possible so give it a little a because whatever constant factor you put out there it would have the same exact x-intercepts for sure so that that's about as far as i would require to go again you'd have to distribute if you want a polynomial now the degree four what does that mean and why is it relevant the degree four actually saves you work here's the the point of doing this what we want is if you have a degree four then you should have at most four factors one two three four four factors that have variables any more than that and you would have a degree that's higher than four so imagine remember our fake distribution i hope you remember we did in last two videos if you were to distribute this you would take x x x and x that's x to the fourth power that matches our degree what it does is it prevents you from doing things like this it prevents you from putting in some factors that are irreducible quadratics and wouldn't give you any more x-intercepts you know what in the world does that mean for instance if i allowed this to be anything but a degree four if i said let's make it a degree i don't care well i could start tacking on some irreducible quadratics like x squared plus nine x squared plus 9 hopefully it doesn't come as a shock to you is not factorable that's not x squared minus 9. it's not a difference of squares it's called an irreducible quadratic which means you cannot factor it any further than that over the real number system now we allow complex numbers sure but we're not talking about that yet uh we can't factor it it's not going to give us any more x-intercepts you can try you want you go uh how's that factor well x plus 3i and x minus 3i is 3i and x intercept no it's not is it zero yes but it's complex zero so it's not what we're talking about here in terms of the real number system that's not really allowed as far as graphing on our x-axis the way we're normally used to so what would that do this function would have these as it's only for real x-intercepts this would do it but notice why the degree four is there if i allowed that that would be now degree one two three four five six that would be a degree six do the fake distribution in your head right now make sure that i'm right you take x x x x and x squared that would be a degree 6 polynomial once you're done well that's not what we asked for that's a degree 4. so if we didn't have that statement of degree 4 you'd be allowed to multiply as factors these irreducible quadratics that wouldn't give you any other x intercepts and you could do it all day long uh x squared plus five and keep on going x squared whatever doesn't factor and you would have these degree however much you wanted that would still only have four x intercepts that's what the degree four is therefore is to make sure that you're not degree four is therefore make sure you're not doing too much work and adding things in there that um that wouldn't change your x intercepts but would certainly be much more complicated of a graph which is why this one i told you was a little bit incomplete of a problem you see this says suppose we have x-intercepts of just these four well this would be a function but i could also put on some irreducible quadratics and not be wrong there's many different answers to that any constant would make a function with those x-intercepts any irreducible quadratic would not make any additional or alter those x intercepts this x squared plus 9 does not change the fact that we only have one two three four x intercepts it would change the look of your graph for sure so would the coefficient of any sort of constant we change the look of your graph for sure but it would not change the x-intercepts so that's really the whole rundown start with your x-intercepts make some factors equal to zero make them factors using the zero-product property in reverse call it a function and you're done just don't overwork so if you have a degree four you should have at most four at most four factors that's that's about it you can't have less than that but i'll show you how the degree should match up so we deal we do our work we sort of do our fake distribution to make sure that we're right here's one two three four x's that's a degree four so four factors with uh x to the first power and each one and we know that we're right put a little a out front and you're good to go all right let's move on to the next couple so we have some multiplicity up here are they any harder no they're really not i just want to show you what to do with the multiplicity and how that works into the powers of our factors so we're going to reverse we say hey this really only has two distinct x-intercepts we would have x equal one and x equals two all right that says here's our zeros x equals one and x equals two what about the multiplicity we deal with that later and then we check our degree so what we're gonna do is we're gonna say every time we have an x-intercept it should come from some factor we find that factor by setting our one side equal to zero and that says hey if that's true then this came from something by the zero product property that be x minus one would be a factor and x minus two would be a factor of some polynomial set equal to zero and that's great it says here's our x intercepts cool subtract one and subtract two this would be a factor and this would be a factor that's where our x-intercepts would have to come from now is where we deal with the multiplicity if you remember from i don't know it was last video before that we talked about multiplicity as the power from of the of the factor from where we got our x intercept so these are x intercepts they come came from some factor that factor has an exponent to it it's either one or two or three it's not zero because then we wouldn't have that factor but it's some sort of integer remember polynomials can't be fractions or negatives some sort of positive whole number integer included typically is possibly including zero but we're never going to see that so our multiplicity basically tells us how many times that factor is repeated and so we just have to read it so here's our x equals one cool we built a factor from it and now we're going to look at our multiplicity this says this factor has a multiplicity of one it's not repeated more than one time so you have this you could put a one there we're not going to but that's where that number is coming from now x minus two this is here's our x-intercept here's our factor and it said x equals two has a multiplicity two that means that it was repeated it was a repeated zero repeated root repeated x-intercept that means it had to have a power two there that multiplicity 2 is the exponent of the factor from where you got your x-intercept so go into reverse you have your x-intercept build your factor and then put the multiplicity on after the fact now that's our that's our polynomial as long as we write this in function form this is one of many polynomials that has these as x-intercepts with the appropriate multiplicity the appropriate repeatedness of those roots you see if we took this and said hey x minus one equals zero cool x minus two equals zero you'd have another one x minus two and x minus two that's a repeated root and that's where the multiplicity is coming from that's what that's saying to you is that that zero has been repeated now i also mentioned something that your degree is something you'll wanna check so this should be a degree three this should have at most three factors now this only has two sort of it has one and it has one that is repeated that really counts as three doesn't it so x minus one x minus two and x minus two that's three factors three linear factors you will have at most the degree number of factors if you have irreducible quadratics you'll have less than that we're going to get into that in several more videos where if you allow complex numbers you'll have exactly the same number of factors as your degree if you have complex numbers that you're working on and you factor you'll have the same number of factors as your degree you'll have at most the degree number of factors if you're working over reals those those uh irreducible carbon quadratics sort of mess that up a little bit so we're going to fake distribute we're going to make sure that we match our degree we're going to put a little a out front to represent this like a family of curves so if we check it out we'd say hey this factor would give us x and if we fake distribute this the biggest power we get out of this would be x squared hey x to the first times x to the second is x to the third that would be our leading term that matches our degree and that we know that that's correct the only last thing we're going to do is say that any coefficient any constant well any coefficient that those are technically constants anyway if it does as long as i have a variable in it that's not going to affect those x intercepts one bit so the last one let's go ahead and work through this real quick you probably should try this on on your own um one thing that you can do just really quickly this typically works pretty well look at your degree and count up your multiplicities and they should usually match up the only time they wouldn't is if you have a hidden degree in there or they're not giving you multiplicity so then you'd want to match your factors to that degree so if you have an irreducible quadratic that can mess it up but usually you don't see that so here's one two three four five six seven eight nine oh hey my multiplicity matches my degree that's great that's really what we're looking for then what we're going to do is we're going to take all of our x-intercepts that they've given us be careful here sometimes we go too fast and we go oh yeah x equals negative two and we see the one we go x equals one just make sure that you're setting your x equal to the x intercept and not accidentally the multiplicity it happens okay so i'm going to double check x equals negative two got it x equals five got x equals zero got it and x equals positive one half got it so i'm not worried about the multiplicity right now that comes as the factor is the power of the factor we're about to create so we're going to make sure that we have zero on the right-hand side of all of these four equations i need to talk about this one in just a minute uh so let's see uh x plus two cool we added two x minus five subtract five x equals zero is good and x equals negative one half equals zero these right here are the four factors of a polynomial that would have these x-intercepts we're going to use the multiplicity to make sure that we have the same degree it's given it to us we just don't need to use it appropriately so we're going to go ahead we're going to write this out i'm going to put the x first it really doesn't matter the order but by using the zero product property we're saying these factors are all equal to zero therefore if i multiply them together that product would still be equal to zero and this is one function that if i were to set it equal to zero that's how we find x-intercepts as we said a function is zero right so if we're doing that to find x-intercepts why not go in reverse and say hey a function that looks like this would have those x-intercepts now i told you a couple things about it number one we're going to deal with the multiplicity number two i said i need to talk about this a little bit and number three we're going to put an a out front because we haven't been given a specific point to have a specific or unique polynomial here we have a family of curves so any a out front any coefficient out front positive or negative doesn't matter you would have exactly the same x-intercepts we also have to match the degree so the degree is important because otherwise we could add on any irreducible quadratic and still not have altered those x-intercepts um however it is important for us to understand what that multiplicity does as far as a balance hopefully you remember this that an even multiplicity will bounce or touch and an odd will cross at those x intercepts it's really important for graphing so let's go very carefully and make sure that we have this correct so we know that the x plus 2 factor has a multiplicity of two so i'm gonna work myself down x plus two has a multiplicity two so i write my exponent of two uh x minus five so that's our our x intercept of five x minus five factored has a multiplicity of one i'm not going to write anything right there i don't need to the zero the x equals zero x intercept the factor of x has a multiplicity of three and the one half x equals one half also has a multiplicity of three we can fake distribute in our head just a really easy way to find a leading term is to take your factors and your coefficient that have x's in them and multiply the largest power that you would get if you were to distribute so x to the third x squared x and x x to the third so next to the third five six seven eight nine so we know that our degree matches here so if you were to distribute this you would have an a x to the ninth as your leading term that ninth power would be the largest one you could possibly get if you were to distribute this and that matches with that degree that's how we would check your work so here's the last thing i want to say this factor can look different i need you to hang on for this because people get kind of weirded out when you get to uh like synthetic division and then you have fractions flipping around wait a minute i thought my my factor was 2x minus 1. yeah it is it's also x minus one-half because that's the same there are two ways to go about getting that factor let me show you on that side another way that you could get that factor is by undoing that fraction rather than subtracting it if you multiply both sides by two you would get two x equals one and if you subtract one you would get two x minus one equals zero you know well which one is better it depends on the case um it doesn't really matter but what i'm trying to tell you is that the factor of x minus one half and the factor of two x minus one are identical set them both equal to zero and solve it and you're going to get positive one-half as your x-intercept so whichever one you want to use is fine but i will tell you that for synthetic division that doesn't work and this one would if you needed to divide a polynomial by a factor you wouldn't really want the two there if you did you'd have to do long division polynomials which isn't a huge headache i'm going to show you both ways anyway but i just want to make you aware of that so that when you get there you're like why the minus one half like why do we need that for synthetic division it's because you can't have an a that's not one or well let's say that a coefficient of x that's not one so that's about it so we're taking x-intercepts we're finding factors by making zero on one side using the zero product property in reverse and then making a function out of it understanding one thing man you need to get it that if you do not have a specific point that's off of the x-axis like a y-intercept or something like that that you cannot say that this is the only function it's a one of many all of all of whom with a different coefficient would give you the same x-intercepts make sure your degree matches what they're telling you so you're not allowed to add or sorry multiply have any factors at a factor of irreducible quadratics that would not change your x-intercepts it would just um make your function much more complicated by the way this i think i gave you x squared plus 9. keep in mind that x squared minus 9 is not an irreducible quadratic you could factor that it would give you additional x-intercepts so that's certainly not allowed the degree allows you it's kind of prevents you from multiplying by any irreducible quadratics so we're going to come right back we're going to have some kind of same idea but using graphs and i'll show you how you can find a specific polynomial if you do have a point that's off of your x-axis okay now that we have an idea of what to do when we're given x-intercepts we can use them to find factors use zero product property create some sort of a polynomial where we normally should be distributing but that is a family of curves that has the same x-intercepts and matches the degree that we're given now we're going to do that from graphs it's a very similar idea but the multiplicity is not expressly given to you you have to read the graph also a lot of times we can find a point that's not on the x-axis to make it so that we can find a specific polynomial and not a general one so so basically we solve for the a i'm going to show you how to do that in the last two examples so let's take a look at it if we're able to find x-intercepts then we can find factors and then we can find a polynomial that has those x-intercepts that would match our graph now we can't match our graph exactly unless we know a point that's not on the x-axis that doesn't give it to us so typically we're looking for a y-intercept or something that they've marked and said hey this is the point 1 negative 8. well our y-intercept here is 0 that's not going to help us because that's on the x-axis to give it the the shape that we need to match you'd have to have a point that's not on the x-axis one that's on the x-axis you can sort of stretch this graph out and you wouldn't change that x-axis at all and that's why we need one off of it so here's the thought process what we're going to be doing is we're going to say okay what are our x-intercepts how is our graph behaving on them are we crossing or are we bouncing or touching that's going to determine multiplicity we're going to pick 1 for a cross we're going to pick multiplicity 2 for a bounce or a touch could we pick 4 or 6 yes we could but we're trying to keep it easy we're trying to create a function that has that x-intercept that's not like let's pick uh x minus 1 to the 7th power because it's odd and i know it crosses you could do that probably it's not going to match that graph a whole lot because when you start getting very large exponents you get super dynamic super crazy graphs i haven't even given you any markings on the y-axis because because this is a sketch but we're going to pick very easy numbers to work with one or two for a multiplicity for odd and even respectively so let's go through it our x-intercepts if we look an x-intercept is where our graph interacts with the x-axis it intersects it so either it crosses it or it bounces off of it our x's here are zero one and two and right now at this point you are exactly where we were if they were to just give you zeros or x-intercepts or roots like all right well you know what we know that these x-intercepts they have to come from factors and those factors would be set equal to zero if we were using the zero product property now that we have those set equal to zero we can use zero product property in reverse and say hey our factors would be x and x minus one and x minus two and our function would have this as its basic form now a couple things about it could you start adding in or multiplying some um some other like irreducible polynomials you you could irritable quadratics i'm sorry here's the quadratics here you could except for the fact that our turning points really suggest that we have a degree three uh so there's two turning points remember that the the number of turning points maximum turning points is one less than the degree so probably this is a degree three polynomial it has one two turning points local maxima or local minimum and that's what we're looking for this is probably a degree three so we're not going to be putting any strange factors in there we're going to keep it simple also we know that this was crossing crossing and crossing so those factors should have odd exponents now we could do something like x to the third and x minus one to the seventh then x minus two to the seven hundred eleven but why i mean if you wanna be fun about it i guess you could do that but we're not going to be doing that we're going to be keeping it simple saying hey if we have a crossing x intercept so where the graph crosses the x-axis at the x-intercept then we need an odd power otherwise you have this idea of being even in the neighborhood or sort of even at least you have the same sign in the neighborhood of that that that x-intercept here we have different signs so we're crossing right one's negative one's positive on that in that neighborhood around that x-intercept and so what we would have to have is an odd power to signify that we studied that in that a couple videos ago so we're going to say hey that's crossing let's leave this odd choose one that's crossing let's leave this odd that's one that's crossing with this odd that's one and so our function has to have an x factor and x minus one factor and an x minus 2 factor now we are not given a point off of the x axis and so this is one of many polynomials that could look that way as soon as we start altering our coefficient which in this case is one as soon as we start altering that we start getting not different x-intercepts but a different shape maybe it's more dramatic or maybe it's flatter maybe well it shouldn't be reflected that should be positive because otherwise oh man i hope you get this this is important right now if you distributed this you would have x to the third power as your leading term that end behavior would fit this if i start putting a negative in front that would be reflected i hope that makes sense to you our end behavior here actually fits that so we would probably leave it this way or at least say that that has to be a positive coefficient coefficient in the front without a point off of the x-axis you don't know for sure but we're going to leave it just like that if you have to distribute it to get the polynomial you would distribute these two first and then run the x through it on distribution let's move on to the next one so this is a little bit different in that we actually do have a point that's off of the x-axis we are going to be able to solve for the a here so in most cases you have an a and you go yeah that could be any number here not negative any number and it would fit there that's true now when we get this we're not going to have that so here's the way to start these number one what we're going to do is we're going to identify our x-intercepts so x equals negative 1 and x equals 1 and x equals 2. we're also going to identify a point off of the x-axis if we can this guy didn't have any but this has the point zero negative one now we go through the same process we go all right well if x equals negative 1 then x plus 1 has to be a factor and x minus 1 has to be a factor and x minus 2 has to be a factor of some polynomial also we're going to look at this this is probably a degree oh man really follow me on this one this is probably a degree three y it has one two turning points it ends in a sort of an opposite infinities idea it's not anything like this or like this it's ending like this it's end behaviors like that that has to be an odd degree if you're opposite infinities if you will uh that's an odd degree why is it three and not five it only has two turning points five most of the time is another turning point and there's some another two turning points in there somewhere so this is probably a degree three think through this use that critical thinking head that i know you have this is probably a degree 3. it probably has a negative degree 3. otherwise it would have looked like this like that one so this is probably a negative in front of a degree 3 polynomial keep that in your head so when we solve this if we don't have a negative in front of our factors we've probably done something wrong it has to mesh with this it's got to be that so we go all right here's our x-intercepts uh negative 1 1 and 2. cool find some factors x plus 1 x minus 1 x minus 2. let's build our polynomial so f x would have three factors in it x plus 1 x minus one and x minus two now is where we look for how that graph is intersect intersecting the x-axis is it bouncing is it or touching or is it crossing so we have a cross we leave this a power one across leave this to power one and across we've got a power one so we're picking odd powers because crossing x-intercepts have to have a multiplicity that is odd we're picking one so that we're making it easier we don't want to pick three or seven if we're five if we don't have to and we already determined that we should have a degree three why because it looks like a degree three i mean it's a horrible way to say that but it has two turning points probably it's going to be a degree three has the end behavior of a degree three and so we're going to leave this as one two three factors that have x's in it that's the most number of factors you can have for degree three now how in the world do we use the point that's off of the x-axis to find a specific function well you'd give it an a you'd see there's lots of polynomials that can have these three x-intercepts that's true there's lots of polynomials that can interact with a cross across and across that's also true there's lots of degree three polynomials it can look exactly like that except for that point that point makes a specific graph so if you have x intercepts and one point off of the x-axis you can find a specific polynomial and here's how to do it go through the same process we just did here's your x-intercepts here's your factors okay they're all crosses so make them odd exponents let's choose one give yourself an a saying lots of different polynomials but now if this is your x coordinate and this is your f of x coordinate your y coordinate sure but i'm going to use f of x because that's the output that we're talking about here if that's the case then you can fill out all of your x's with well in this case zero you can fill out your f of x with negative one and it will allow you to solve for your a so let's try that if i fill out my x's i'm gonna leave my a my x should be zero and my a should be sorry my f of x should be negative one let's simplify that let's see that's one negative one and negative two if we multiply this together that's positive two so 2 1 times negative 1 times negative 2 is 2 times a if we divide by 2 oh my gosh hey we solved a now all we need to do is say hey that a that we didn't know before now that we've used a piece of information about a point that's off the x-axis we don't have a general polynomial we don't have a family of curves anymore we have one specific curve all you need is one point off of that x-axis to determine a specific curve that would have those x-intercepts at least a degree three so now we say hey we know the a the a is negative one-half then we'd have those three factors and that's about it i hope that you um hope you understand that although this is this is not like super brain-bustingly hard math to do once you understand it but getting to understand it will absolutely very much help you when you start graphing things in calculus so getting the idea of oh that's what x-intercepts do oh that's how multiplicity affects the exponent of the factor oh wait a minute the point off of the x-axis will let me solve for that unknown coefficient that's huge i mean that's really really really helpful also understanding beforehand what's going to happen that's why i have you do those things so that you can predict what's going to happen and check your work we said that's probably a degree three why because that's two turning points it's probably a degree three one two three factors hey that's the most you have x times x times x is power three hey this end behavior is looks odd and it's a negative odd hey there's a negative in front if i distribute this this would have negative one half x to the third as a leading term it fits it fits the model that's why we do these things so we can understand more appropriately how these graphs behave makes us much more powerful when we get to things like calculus all right and that by the way just for the last time that's not a family of curves this is one specific polynomial that would be that exact graph so that that's kind of neat to be able to find that if you have to distribute again you'd start here distribute this once you simplify distribute this once you simplify it then distribute the negative one-half and you'll see that leading term in there right away it'll be negative one-half x to the third all right last one we're going to go through and then we're going to be done so how we start all the time if we're going from graphs to polynomial functions how we know it's a polynomial there's no weirdness here there's no asymptotes there's no gaps there's no holes there's no sharp points no cusps how we start this is by listing out our x-intercepts so our x-intercepts are x equals negative four x equals negative one and x equals three we got one here here and there even though it doesn't cross that's very important that says hey that's an x-intercept but wait wait it doesn't cross oh it bounces oh what's that mean for multiplicity you need to know that like what does that mean when we cross versus when we bounce as far as multiplicity because we're about to use it so we have our x-intercepts there's only three one two three we're going to list any points that we find that are off of our x-axis in our case the x the y-intercept i'm not exactly sure what that is don't guess at it find an actual point that is off of our x-axis in this case the y-x the y-intercept is not going to work for us this though 1 comma negative 8 that's a great point so we're going to be able to take our x-intercepts build some factors find a function and put an a in front of it and then use that point to solve for the a so when we build our factors we're going to have x plus 4 and x plus 1 and x minus 3 all equal to 0. we take care of the multiplicity in the next step so we're going to start building our our function we're going to say hey by the zero product property all of those three factors that are set equal to zero would still equal zero if i were to multiply them together they they'd have to uh by the zero product property now we're going to start taking care of our multiplicity um i yeah i didn't have to do the last two because we didn't have any bounces but now we go ahead and we do that so we're going to take a look at okay look at our intercept x equals negative 4 look at where this whether this crosses or bounces sometimes we say the word touches well this one crosses so i know that x equals negative 4 is an odd multiplicity so that factor has to have an odd exponent we're going to choose one now let's check out the next uh x-intercept x equals negative one this bounces or touches this but this does not cross so it bounces right off of that so it is an x-intercept but it has to have an even multiplicity that means the exponent of the factor that we got from that has to be even we're going to choose two so negative one here's our negative one here's our factor from that x equals negative one that factor is a bouncy and so it's gotta have a 2. could it be a 4 possibly but probably not why not well how many turning points does this have turning points are local minimums or local maximums so turning points are where we change from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing this has one two three turning points well that's three turning points then one more than that is potentially our degree so we say all right it probably has to have at least a degree four but it's probably not six or eight uh because it doesn't have more turning points so we'd say the the least degree this could have is four why because degree is always at least one more than your turning points why isn't it six well because we don't have that many turning points it's probably not that also this isn't as dynamic so i mean that'd be crazy or eight that'd be super crazy why isn't it odd look at your end behavior look at your behavior your end behavior says i'm even in fact it says i'm a positive even do you remember that odd even negative odd negative even so this is an end behavior that's a negative or sorry a positive even function so the reason why we don't have an odd mole well the reason why we don't have odds here is because this right here would have to have a degree that is even it has the end behavior before the reason why we're picking a two and not a four or something crazy is because our degree is probably four and if we start making a four here or six here we're going to be blowing up that degree okay last one so x equals negative 3 i know that's a cross so that's across e so that means that this x intercept gives us a factor that has an exponent that is odd i'm going to pick one so we know that our function is based on the following factors i'm giving myself an a so that i can solve for it so i know i'm going to be able to find a specific polynomial but i'm giving myself an a so that i allow an x and a y or an f of x and let me solve for something so i don't know what that coefficient is yet i know that it could be anything and have these x-intercepts but it can't be anything and so and be this exact graph that's where the point comes in hopefully getting the point um one last time just to make sure that you're you're with me before we wrap this thing up so while i have your full attention is that you should be thinking of what you're going to get before you do anything you should be thinking hey i've got one two three x intercepts i'm gonna have a multiplicity one because it crosses two because it bounces through one because it crosses i should have a degree probably four because it's even it has to be four or six or eight there's three turning points i have to be at least one more than that so four but it's probably not six or eight we try to keep it as simple as possible and still fit our model now we're going to go ahead and plug in our 1 for x and our negative 8 for f of x or our y so that would give us 1 plus 4 1 plus 2 and 1 minus 3. of course you don't want to forget about that square so let's see that's negative 40. 20 times negative 2 is negative 40. if we divide both sides by negative 40 we're going to get one-fifth you can also put 0.2 that's fine doesn't really matter but we have gone ahead and we've solved this this polynomial function we know exactly what it is now not a guess not a family of curves because with the point off the x-axis we know that this function is one fifth or point two x plus four x plus one squared and x minus 3. let's see if it messes with what we thought it was going to be we thought it was going to be a degree 4 is it a degree 4. one this would be x squared so two three four that would be x times x squared times x that's a degree four one fifth is positive so one fifth x to the fourth would be your leading term do your fake distribution one fifth x to the fourth point two x to the fourth um positive x so positive that's one fifth x to the fourth that's even that's positive even that's a degree four should have at most three turning points one two three it has our x-intercepts negative four uh negative one and three that's across e and bouncing across e there's a crossing bouncy crossing it works has the point one negative eight in it so we know right now that this is the exact function that would have this picture to it if you have to distribute it gets kind of nasty uh how you would do this take care of your exponents that are not one first so you do x plus one times x plus one distribute then distribute your linear factors over that and finally distribute your coefficient that one-fifth so i hope that makes sense i hope now you really really understand how multiplicity is used to create functions how we can find a specific function if we have a point off of the x-axis and if not we cannot do that so i know we've gone uh very very deep into this concept the reason why we do that i'm not trying to teach you just how to do this stuff i'm trying to teach you why it works and how you use in the future because if i can build that in there if you understand why it works man it makes your life so much easier when you actually get to calculus to use this stuff so i hope you're doing well i hope this is making sense and working for you and we will see in another video when we start sketching from scratch on some of these polynomials have a good day 

Transcript for: How to Sketch Polynomial Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 31)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to put together everything that we've been learning in the last i don't know how many videos we're going to put together end behavior maximum attorney points the degree uh we're going to put together y intercept we're going to put together x-intercepts multiplicities whether they bounce or cross off the x-axis and we're going to get some sketching of polynomials now this is a very very important concept because when we get to rational sketching we're going to be doing the same thing with this we're just going to add to it and so it's really important to learn now how multiplicity works with x-intercepts and how to get a graph out of it when you get to calculus you're going to be rehashing this but going a little bit further like hey where are your turning points how do you find that because we're going to be estimating right now that's why it's called sketching and it's not straight up graphing because we need more information to do that frankly you need what's called a derivative be able to set it equal to zero and then you find these critical points and then you analyze whether or not their maximum or minimum in in sort of their little neighborhood so that would be a turning point and that's what you're gonna learn in calculus one for right now we're getting a basis down uh so that when we get there you don't have to learn everything just a little bit more so let's put together i have a crazy example here for us where we're going to do kind of the ground work i'm going to make it as hopefully difficult as you'll ever see as far as identifying what all these things are we're not going to sketch this you're going to see why when we get to right here why we're not going to sketch it the y intercept is going to be like what i'm going to alter this a little bit tell you what you would do if that was a x squared minus 9 and then we'll uh we'll actually graph about five examples after that a very basic one and we're going to kind of make them more difficult to the end where you should be able to graph any factored polynomial now i said that and i want to explain that for a second i am going to be giving you only factored polynomials right now and the reason is is because many of these are degree 3 degree 4 degree 5 and so forth you have not learned how to factor those yet and so i'm going to have to teach you a little bit more in the next few videos on how you would factor polynomials if you don't have a general form like a quadratic formula so that's what we're going to get into so let's start with our first example if you have a factored polynomial that looks like that first thing you do is kind of go ah and then once the shock wears off that's crazy there's a a set number of steps that you take in order to get from this to a picture of it the first one i want you to do every time you see a factored polynomial is find the leading term i've taught you sort of how to sort of fake distribute this so that you can find a leading term i'll refresh your memory on that in just a bit but that's really important you do not have to distribute all of this garbage in order to get a picture of this graph so if you have a factored polynomial leave it unless you're absolutely required to distribute it which i don't know why you ever would leave it so i'm going to show you right now just kind of refresher on how you would go about finding the leading term that leading term is going to give us a lot of information so we're going to find leading term find the degree from it the maximum turning points that says max tp when you use tp take it to the max that's not what that means uh this is finding the maximum number of turning points that you can that you have in a graph we're going to find the end behavior then y intercept and x-intercepts with their multiplicity and whether they bounce or touch the x-axis and whether they cross so how we define a leading term is we look at every one of these factors every one of the factors including that coefficient and we multiply the highest power of the variable that we would get if we were to distribute it what that means is we take negative 2 if we were to distribute this there's no exponent here we would only get x to the first power out of that factor if we were to distribute this we would actually get an x squared out of that factor remember that this is not as simple as saying oh x squared plus one fourth that's not what we're doing what we would have to do to distribute is x plus one half times x plus one half but if you think about that if you were to distribute that you would get x squared as your largest power of x and upon distributing the whole thing you really would get just the largest powers of x that you you would obtain in order to find your leading term and that's what we're doing here so you'd say all right if i were to distribute this my largest power would be x squared here if i were to distribute this i would get x plus 4 times x plus 4 times x plus 4 and if i were to distribute the whole thing my largest power of x i would get would be an x to the third power so is it as simple as just taking the exponent here and multiplying it times there yet yes it is now you can't distribute that way but that's what we're going to end with our last one if you were to attribute that that's x squared plus nine times another x squared plus nine x squared times x squared let's see two plus two is x to the fourth power yes you can multiply two times two and get four these are all the largest powers of x that we would get from every one of those factors if we were to distribute it and distribute the whole thing basically comes down to take your coefficient whatever it is multiply it by all of the largest powers of x coincidentally it's 1 2 3 and 4 that you would get and remember to add the exponents here so let's see four five seven eight nine ten that's negative two x to the tenth i guarantee it if you take the time to fully distribute those two things are gonna happen you're gonna spend about 10 minutes you might make some mistakes in there because i know i do when you have that much to distribute but secondly you're going to end with a leading term that is negative 2 x to the 10th for sure that's really all you need to know from distributing this on what you're getting that's it that's the only reason to distribute it is to find your leading term and your y intercept i'm going to give you some workarounds the first one i just gave you is pretty nice so our leading term is negative two x to the tenth we're going to use that to find out several things about this number one is the degree if you remember the degree is the largest power of your ex largest exponent that you have in your polynomial so you look at all the terms you go okay what's the largest power it should be in the leading term the one that's right out front because you should have written this in order so when we look at our leading term it automatically has our degree in it it's 10. the reason why we want to identify the degree is because the maximum turning point you can get now you might not get this many turning points but the most you can get is always one less than that degree and we explored that concept in a few videos ago so you can have at most nine turning points here's what that means you can change directions on your graph from increasing to decreasing or decreasing increasing at most nine times so you could go one two three and you could do that nine times uh so this also gives us an interpretation of our end behavior so when we we learned about power functions a few videos ago we learned that even always kind of pairs up your infinities it has to it has to have that same sign in your end behavior so evens either do this if they're positive evens or this if they're negative even power functions and because our end behavior is based on the power function that we get from our leading term that leading term will tell you your end behavior this says the 10 is an even power function that's like this but then negative 2 says yes but that would be reflected and probably a little narrower because that coefficient in absolute value is greater than one and that's what determines the narrowness or whiteness of your graph that vertical stretch or vertical compression so again we think about it we go all right uh that says even sure that means that we we have either upward opening completely positive infinity positive infinity uh or downward over negative v negative infinity so we look at that and go that's even but that's negative so that makes a end behavior that would do this sort of a downward opening graph if you kind of zoomed out a long way so we're going to draw like just a little picture of that our end behavior should be pointing downward as we get to uh x approaches negative or positive infinity should be doing this and it's going to be doing it very steeply because of that power and because that's a negative two so it's it's going to be very dramatic that's really what we use our leading term for leading term gives us number one the degree from there we subtract one we get the maximum number of local maxima or minimum we can get those are turning points so where we change increasing decreasing or decreasing increasing and then it gives us a picture of our end behavior this right here is what our graph is going to look like outside of all the junk that's going to happen in the middle which is why we sort of leave that empty we don't know how many turning points we're actually going to get but it can be at most 9. but we don't know what that looks like it's just kind of a zoomed out approach of what this graph is going to look like at the ends alright the next two things that we do is we find our y-intercept now had you distributed this your y-intercept would just be your constant term well can you get that without distributing yeah we know the defined y-intercept you just evaluate for x equals zero so you plug in zero so plug in zero here and here and here and here and you're going to get let me do that quickly in my head um 18 144. i didn't do that quickly in my head i did a long time ago but that's why we're not graphing this so our y intercept would be eighteen zero comma eighteen thousand one hundred forty four that's like way up there and this is the reason why most of our our sketching is based on fairly simple things because you just can't graph that at least not very accurately and that's not even the highest point on this graph most likely you'll probably have something higher than that that would it'd be impossible so we're not going to do that the main idea on this particular problem is to get how to find the leading term what that is used for how to find the y intercept without having to distribute in order to find those two things and then to take our x-intercepts and understand what they're doing so let's move on to that right now our x-intercepts are found for basically every function by setting that function equal to zero which is really convenient if we have it already factored and that's great so when we set this equal to zero we can now use the zero product property and what we're going to do is we're just going to set every factor that has a variable in it equal to zero now now listen your coefficient makes no difference as far as your x-intercepts it does not matter so you never set this coefficient equal to zero it doesn't have a variable it's not going to change your x-intercepts all that does is stretch out or compress your graph and possibly reflect it that doesn't make any change on the x-axis because when you reflect about the x-axis your x-axis doesn't change it's just kind of rotated maybe but that doesn't change the value so you don't have to worry about that so take every factor that has a variable in it and set it equal to zero let's do that now that's what the zero positive property says so once we've done that we have some basic solving to do to find our x-intercepts like x equals seven and subtract one-half x equals negative one-half if we subtract four x equals negative four and wait a minute x squared plus nine equals zero we'll wait a minute if i subtract nine i would get x squared equals negative nine if i take a square root that's going to give me a complex number if you think about it more closely we really should have all of these factored as much as possible before we set these factors equal to zero but this is factored as much as possible this is what is called an irreducible quadratic it's something that you cannot factor over the real numbers any more than it is right now there is a theorem that says that you can factor any polynomial into linear or irreducible quadratic factors it comes from a couple things like the factor theorem and the fact that every odd function has to have an x-intercept in it and so because of that you can always reduce a cubic um and there's a lot of theory behind it i'm not going to get into the whole thing but let me just say this if you have a cubic function you can factor it if you have a quadratic it might be near useful so you can have these irreducible quadratics here's the sort of the punch line to it this is not going to give you any real x-intercepts so if you factored your polynomial and you better make sure you infected it and you can't factor any more this thing right here for your quadratic any irregular quadratic is not going to give you any more x-intercepts this does nothing as far as where we cross the x-axis so what does it do what it probably does in a lot of the cases is it gives us a turning point that that doesn't have anything to do with an x-axis so we could have some crossings maybe a bounce and then we could have a loop down like that that right there comes from something like an irreducible quadratic and so that probably is what is going on here we would find these things out with calculus so we're not going to get into it right now you don't really need to we're sketching but that's most likely what's happening with that as far as our x-intercepts this gives you nothing this would be no real solution right you cannot factor that if you solve it you get imaginaries no real solution says this is not yielding any x-intercepts at least not from that factor so once we've done that once we've managed to find our x-intercepts and we only have three in this case we've got the negative four the negative one-half and x equals seven what we're going to do is we're going to assign them the multiplicity from their exponents where we got the factor from so when we think about that okay let's take a look back at x minus seven and let's look at the exponent the exponent on x minus seven that factor was one what that means is that this x-intercept has a multiplicity of one the x plus one-half had a multiplicity of two the x plus 4 has a multiplicity 3. you should remember that the multiplicity really just came from the exponent uh upon the of the factor upon which we got our our x-intercepts this x squared plus nine don't worry about the multiplicity for right now it really doesn't do anything for us because that multiplicity had to do with x-intercepts and since this yields none we don't really worry about it for now in calculus yeah you'd worry about that and i will show you if i change this problem just a little bit that it really does matter but for right now it doesn't so the last thing that we're going to do is we're going to understand that every even multiplicity at that x-intercept causes the graph due to its its little neighborhood having uh above and below that x-intercept would have in the neighborhood around it a the same sign either both positive or both negative and the same thing would happen with um with every even power that you get and for odds it would cause the graph to cross so having the little neighborhood uh different sign or the left and right of that that x-intercept causes different signs that's above and below the x-axis we talked about that multiplicity the main thing here is understand that every even multiplicity is going to cause this to be a touch or a bounce it's going to sort of just bounce off the x-axis at that x-intercept so this would be a bounce sometimes we call it a touch you'll use those interchangeably these are going to be crosses every odd multiplicity x intercept will be a crossing so the graph will cross the x-axis due to the reasons that i kind of just explained again and that is about it with that information we can get a very clear sketch of a graph what would make this better is some additional points to show just how dramatic this is the y-intercept is a good one but between our x-intercepts typically we would plug in a point i'm not going to do that for the sake of time on this video but you can certainly do that also just be aware that with a lot of these polynomials when you start plugging in values between your x-intercepts you're going to get some very very large or very very negative numbers it makes it pretty hard to graph which is why we call it sketching that's that's the whole thing so long story made hopefully a little bit shorter fake distribute find your leading term find your degree subtract one for your maximum number of turning points it will give you a picture of your end behavior in this case even but reflected so draw that picture plug in zero you do not have to distribute to find your y-intercept and then because it's factored yay we can set every one of those factors that has a variable equal to zero solve it usually really really easily because they're all going to be linears or they'll be irreducible quadratics which you can't do anything anyway with then find your multiplicity and let that interpret whether it's crossing for odd multiplicity not odd numbers i don't care about the numbers you care about the multiplicity or bouncing touching for even multiplicity that's about it so now let's move on to the next example this of course is as much oh you know what i forgot to say something about that if we i told you that i would change it if you made this an x squared minus 9 before you did any of this you could certainly find your end behavior just fine and your y intercept just fine but before you went and did your x intercepts you would need to factor that so all of these all of this multiplicity idea comes from the fact that you have factored everything and so you would take the time and say that this would be x minus three x plus three do the nature that being a difference of squares but these would both be to the second power this is x minus three x plus three and the whole thing's being taken to the second power which would instead of this you would actually get x minus three squared and another and an x plus 3 squared and that would give you two additional x-intercepts now on your head right now you should be thinking yeah that's two additional x-intercepts negative three and positive three and they would both be bounces or touches it would not change your end behavior you'd still have this negative even sort of function so this would just make a little bounce bounce and then you on two different sections x axis and then you'd still match up that end behavior the last comment i did want to make is that all of this has to mesh so if you run into like well i can't do this and get that end behavior with that y-intercept then something's wrong these things all have to work together and if one of them's off then uh then it'll show up when you try to sketch it you'd be like well i have to go up but i have this end behavior that says i should be going down either your end behavior is going wrong or you might have forgot like a crossing or or a bounce or your wider shift is wrong so so double check that it's not meshing together something's off okay now let's go on to the next example this is a little bit simpler of course because it's our first one that we're really going to sketch but we're going to go through the same exact process that we did on this so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to find our leading term so step number one our leading term is well we take every factor that has a variable and the largest power that we would get when we distribute that would be x squared times x so our leading term is just x to the third power our degree would be three the maximum number of turning points is two that means that we can have at most two changes in direction do we have two not necessarily but typically with a cubics you will if you have specs in if you have more than one x intercept you certainly do and let's see our end behavior our end behavior look back at your leading term and just check out that power function whether it's odd reflected odd even or reflected even since that's an odd it starts like this there's no negative associated with it so this is an odd power function that means this end behavior is going to look like an odd now some things are going to happen in the middle of that function namely our x-intercepts our y-intercepts things that make it curve a little bit more or less but all in all it's going to end up looking like this at the end behavior okay so once we've done that now we move on to our y-intercept your y-intercept is always found by setting this equal to sorry plugging in zero evaluating for zero you could distribute and look for a constant this one's actually not that hard but if you notice that if you try to distribute there's no constant you would get x to the third minus three x squared there's no constant there which means that your y intercept would be zero and you can do that if you just evaluate for zero so zero squared is zero zero times i don't care what that is it's going to be zero so y our y intercept is 0 0 and the last thing we do is we find our x-intercepts so our x-intercepts come from setting every factor and that's factored that's great and in fact you know what we should have checked it it's factored completely x squared is irreducible really that's irreducible quadratic you can't just factor x squared i mean you could do x and x but that's a repeated factor and then x minus 3 is a linear so we're good what we're going to do is we're going to set every one of those factors equal to 0. now keep in mind i did this when we first started multiplicity i said that if you have variables that are raised to a power think of the factor as x not as x squared so x is the factor the exponent of it is 2 which means x equals 0 sure but its multiplicity is 2. and that's important because we don't want to say well x squared is 0 x is 0 done no we want to say x is 0 and it's a repeated factor multiplicity 2. so we do x equals 0 and x minus 3 equals 0 and it's pretty easy to solve this one is done if we add 3 we get x equals 3. those are the only two x intercepts that we would get we have x equals 0 we have x equals 3 then we look back at those factors and say you know what that x equals 0 came from the x factor and it has a power 2. that's a multiplicity 2. and what that means is that every multiplicity that's even gives you a x-intercept where the graph bounces or touches so i'm going to put balance and then the x equals 3 well x equals 3 came from the x minus 3 factor that's right here and that factor has a power 1. that says that's not really repeated that's a multiplicity 1 x intercept and every odd multiplicity x intercept creates this crossing for your graph and all there is to it right now is to put this stuff together so we go kind of the same order we don't really draw the end behavior we just have in the back of her head so in the back of her head here's what this should do for you the end behavior says that you're going to start down here and you're going to end up here it should do something in here but that's the general trend of this graph is to start low and high the maximum turning points say yeah we should only change direction twice at most you don't even have to change that many times sometimes but you would change it at most twice so where we really start graphing is with our y-intercept and our x-intercepts and i'm going to show you a little known as a trick maybe a tool on how i think of bounces and crosses so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to make my y-intercept my y-intercept is at 0 0. now when you think about that you'll wait a minute then we also have an x-intercept at zero yeah and when that happens when you don't have a constant or when your y-intercept is zero zero you really need to plug in a different value to get something off of the x-axis otherwise you cannot be assured of your end behavior it's there's no way to check your work your y-intercept checks that for you it says oh yeah i have to match my end behavior with my x-intercepts if you don't have anything off the x-axis it's really difficult to do that so we're going to be plugging in a different value in just a minute to check that but when this happens use this but know that you're going to have to plug in another value so we've done that we've said okay x equals zero is a multiplicity two oh it's a bounce so here's x equals zero but we know that the graph is going to bounce here's how i show that this is not in a textbook or anything but this is what i do i always put a little dotted line and the reason why i do that it's kind of what an asymptote would do where it says well you don't really touch it here we're going to touch it it's just a sign for us to bounce it's not mathematical really in nature but i do this i put a little dotted line there because it accused me when i'm graphing like hey uh i can't cross that like there's no way i'm gonna cross that so i'm either gonna come down and bounce this way i'm gonna come up and bounce this way since our end behavior said we have to do this we're going to come up and we're going to bounce off that without the dotted line i've seen a lot of students just cross and go my graph doesn't work of course it doesn't work because you need to bounce here and not cross there so just a little tool that i use when i see bounce i put a dotted line at that x-intercept plain and simple now at x equals three i'm not going to put a dotted line so in my head i know that's a bounce that's across and now i have to make this fit i also said one one thing to you a little while ago that because we don't have a y-intercept that's not on the x-axis we really should be plugging in another value i'm going to plug in one y well it's between two x-intercepts and that's a really good way to find out where this graph goes and so i'm gonna plug in one if we do that one squared is one and one minus three is negative two 1 times negative 2 is negative 2. so 1 comma negative 2. now when you do that please do not assume that you have found like a local minimum or something that point is not a local minimum in fact the local minimum actually happened so if you plugged in two and got negative four how do i know that well because i did the calculus on a little bit earlier and i found out that that right there is actually a local minimum you would find that out in calculus one so how to do that for now really you just need this this and that and your end behavior i'm going to use that one to give you a better picture of it and to show you that this is not your not your local minimum it's not a turning point for you so don't assume that the point you plug in magically is just some some turning point if you plugged in two let's see 4 times negative 1 is negative 4. this right here is but i did i i only know that because i went a little bit further so now we're going to go ahead and sketch it so we take everything it's got to work together we know that our end behavior is down here to up here so we're going to start down here we're going to sketch to make it better you plug in more points we're going to sketch up we know it's got to bounce okay that makes sense because my next point is here i got to go down i'm going to go down a little bit further i'm going to come up hit this i'm going to cross oh that makes sense because my end behavior ends up here that's how we get a sketch for these polynomial driven functions and then we make sure everything works before we move on and make sure that it has at most two turning points it does here's increasing decreasing decreasing increase and that's two turning points it matches our end behavior looks really good we had a bounce at zero awesome we had a cross at three that's fantastic we have another point off of the x-axis to give it more of a shape otherwise you could just make it real flat if you don't have any points off the x-axis you go yeah it looks like this no not really it's a fairly dynamic graph so we wanted to show that as much as possible so that's putting everything together of course a pretty basic example but we're going to come back with about four more just to make sure that i can give you a very very thorough slender explanation of your graphing back in a second all right let's get going a couple other examples so we're going to do things fairly quickly i'm just going to walk you through this four more times to make sure you're seeing the little details making sure that we're really understanding the concepts so number one thing we do is we find the leading term that's typically done by distribution or if you use my technique of that sort of fake distribution idea it can go pretty quickly so what we're going to do is we're going to take the negative 2 this x to the first power and x to the third power the largest powers of x that you would get and the coefficient if you were to distribute this that would give you negative two x to the fourth and that's our leading term now that leading term gives us a lot of information number one thing you write down is what your degree is it's going to be the exponent of your leading term that's the largest power that you would get if you were to distribute this and write the polynomial in order if you subtract one from that you get the maximum turning points the maximum number of local max or min in this whole entire graph that'd be three and also gives you a picture of end behavior if you know about those power functions so the power function says that leading term is a power function that power function will either have an even or an odd exponent even exponents for well even power functions are symmetrical about the y axis and odd power functions are symmetrical about the origin since that's even it has to either do this for a positive coefficient which is why we include the coefficient or this for a negative coefficient which is why i include the coefficient this says this is even that would match up or sort of be symmetrical and downward opening this graph itself would be symmetrical this one doesn't have to be so this is downward opening and even so we're going to sketch that and that is what our graph has to do as x approaches negative and positive infinity it's got to do this in the middle we're going to get some other things like the y-intercept x-intercepts things like that okay so let's uh let's find the y-intercept this is done by either distributing and taking the constant or plugging in zero evaluating for zero so if we do evaluate for zero it looks like we're going to get positive 32 so 0 minus 2 is negative 2 negative 2 to the third power is negative 8 0 plus 2 is 2 so that's negative 16 and negative 16 times negative 2 is positive 32. our x-intercepts here are very convenient and it's kind of a manipulated problem because i'm giving it to you in factored form in general it's not that easy you'd have to find your own x-intercepts but in doing so you'd have the leading term already because you have to factor it but this is really nice if something comes factored so don't mess with that don't distribute this these are really easy to find your x-intercepts so we set this equal to zero and then for x-intercepts we only need the factors that have variables so we don't really care about the negative 2. what we care about is x plus 2 and x minus two and by the zero product property we set them equal to zero we solve them pretty easily we'll subtract two and add two respectively and then just just be careful in this case it doesn't really matter because we have both odd exponents that means the multiplicity is both odd and there's going to be two crosses however you want to make sure that you're looking at the right factor it's pretty easy to go oh x is uh negative two that comes from here it doesn't it comes from here so be very careful go back to the factor from where you got your x-intercept and then look at the x-coordinate so my negative two came from x plus two i'm looking x plus two look at the power 1 and then say okay that's why that's a multiplicity 1 odd multiplicity that's a cross same thing here the two came from x minus two as the factor i look back at x minus two the multiplicity is three because the multiplicity is odd we know that that graph is going to cross the x-axis at x equals 2. and now we just put this all together so what we're going to do is we're going to say all right starting with our idea of end behavior and behavior says we're going to have to be down here do some junk and then end up down there so that has to be the case we also understand that our maximum turning point is three so we can do it most one two three changes do we do that many i don't know but that's as much as we could have then what we know is our y intercept is 0 32 we're going to graph that first our x-intercepts are both crosses so i'm not going to use that little dotted line because i know that my graph has to cross so i'm going to do let's see negative two and positive 2 and we're going to cross here now this is a sketch and i'm not quite sure what happens in here without doing some other math on it so can you assume that that right there is like the peak of your graph you really can't assume that we're going to draw it sort of that way because it is i mean appears symmetrical it doesn't have to be that way but this is also a sketch to be more precise you'd want to do something like plug in 1 or negative 1 some value between the y intercept and your x intercepts so if we plugged in 1 let's see 1 minus if we put in positive 1 1 minus 2 is negative one third power is negative one uh one plus two is three that'd be negative three um negative three times negative two is positive six so we're up here somewhere like right about there so we know that this is going to drop down somewhere in there this of course my scale is pretty far off because i want to make sure we could graph with 0 32 but i'm going to just sketch this i know my end behavior comes up i hit my x-intercept and cross it i hit my y-intercept come down hit my x-intercept cross it and then i'm going to end with my appropriate end behavior now we need something about like that at least that's a decent sketch again to be more precise we want to plug in some additional values here or use derivatives when you get to calculus that clear a lot up for us so i hope that makes sense on that example next we're going to move to this one and do basically the same thing but there is something i want to point out as far as setup we really need to make sure that these polynomials just like when we have them in standard form they're in order um everything is has uh has been distributed for a standard form polynomial well here with factored we want to make sure that everything is factored appropriately if you remember if you've been watching my videos for a while you know that when you factor you factor so that your first term is positive and what that does is creates in every factor your first term positive in order first term positive this is great and this is not great it's not horrible you still get the appropriate look but it's a lot easier to to make sure we write this appropriately so that we get the appropriate leading term and then the appropriate end behavior from it otherwise i've seen a lot of students mess up the sign on that and so what i'm going to show you is that when you factor this this is fine you might want to spend some time on that factor out the negative here's what i mean if we wrote that in order we'd have negative x plus one but we don't like a first term being negative it leads to a lot of sign errors so if we factor that we get negative x minus one also if you notice something that's most people when they do x-intercepts after you finish this little section you're probably going to look at that and go oh x-intercept's a 2 x-intercept's at negative 2. x-intercept's at negative 4. yeah great x-intercept is negative 1. no that's because that's the wrong sign and so by writing this appropriately it's really easy to switch your sign and get it right rather than accidentally switch your sign and get it wrong so our x-intercept here should be positive 1 not negative 1. what that means is that if we write this function a little different form from what originally was if we factor appropriately we should have a negative floating out front so we have our negative we have our x minus 1 and we have our x plus 4 squared that's a better look for it that helps us to find end behavior a little bit easier that helps us find x-intercepts a lot easier and not make a sign ever accidentally if you're not going to show some of this work that i'm showing so let's move on our leading term comes from any coefficient so that's negative one the largest power you get if you were to distribute that's x squared and that's x so our leading term is negative x to the third power because it's so easy to find degree we just write down the exponent maximum turning points we subtract one and the end behavior you need to know about power functions that's an odd so it's like this but it's been reflected so our our end behavior must match up with that sort of look everything has to work to make sure that happens once we've done that we go ahead and we evaluate for zero you can do it anywhere you can do it in the original you can do it here it really doesn't matter where you evaluate for zero so be a value from zero at the beginning hey zero plus four that's four four squared sixteen uh 16 times one is sixteen or here this is sixteen this would be negative one times the negative one as a coefficient that give you positive 16. either way we go we get positive 16. and the last couple steps we take and we set this function equal to 0 and after doing that by zero product property we take every factor that has an x that's x plus four equal to zero x minus one equal to zero and when we solve it we get x equals negative 4 and x equals 1. now's the time when we take that exponent from each factor we say what the multiplicity is and then how that's interpreted so the x equals negative four that comes from x plus four and that has a multiplicity two in your heads you need to be thinking hey that's a bounce or a touch x equals 1 that came from the factor x minus 1. since x minus 1 has an exponent of 1 for that factor that's a multiplicity 1. it's not a repeated root and that's going to be a cross now we're going to graph it so we're going to fit our end behavior our y intercept or x intercepts with the multiplicity across these bounces all on that graph and we're going to start with just the idea like hey i need to start here and end up there if that doesn't happen i've made a mistake i need to have a maximum of two times i change direction if i do more than that i've made a mistake i need to have a y-intercept of 0 16. that's right there i need to have x-intercepts at negative 4 and at positive one i need to understand that at negative four i have a bounce i'm gonna show that otherwise it's just too easy to cross this and be like wait a minute i imagine that imagine if you accidentally crossed so end behavior says you start here you go down if you actually cross and then you cross again you miss your y-intercept and you'd have to have a different linership to make that happen that would be a real strong clue that you made a mistake so we go oh wow how did i mess up oh shoot hey that's a bounce so that means i have to bounce off of the x-axis here and cross it there that's why i use that that that notation so our end behavior says i'm going to start it's probably going to be fairly dramatic because i'm going to have to come down bouncing and come way up here also it's probably not the case that that is your vertex it would be a really funny looking graph if it did well a local maximum let's say it'd be a real funny graph if i came up and then hit that and went sharply down it's probably and you should double check this it's probably the case that if i were to plug in negative 1 i did something above 16. we can try it right now if you want to so if i plug in negative 1 evaluate that for negative 1 let's do it here uh negative one plus four negative one plus four is three three squared is nine one minus negative one is two nine times two is eighteen hey that's above sixteen this point is like right sorry about this scrunchy probably right about there which means that this peaks somewhere between here and here and it's coming down that way in order to find where that is you have to plug these values in for right now later you use some calculus but my point is is that this is not a local maximum so this probably goes way up come back down and cross this is why it's a sketch because i have not taken the time to actually find out what those points are should i it kind of depends on how specific you need to be for right now we're just getting a look of the graph so we understand our end behavior says down and down i end like this i have to have at most two turning points i have them here and something up there if i plug in negative two it's probably going to be higher than negative one or that might even be equal i haven't taken the time to do it then we have our y intercept and we cross so that's a fairly decent sketch for the amount of time that we put in i hope that's making sense we have two more examples and then we're going to call it a day all right let's wrap this up we have two more examples we have some factoring to do i'm going to change the last one just a little bit to show you a tweak on it and that's about it so f of x negative 5 x x squared minus 4 and then x plus 3. if you are going to graph these polynomials that are factored you need to make sure they're all the way factored we've seen it a couple times but just be careful with it so if you have this negative 5x that's good but the x squared minus four if you have quadratics make sure that they're all the way factored if not that's fine they don't give you any x intercepts they might give you some turning points that are sort of hidden with this technique this is sketching but you want to make sure they're all the way factored so we would factor x squared minus 4 as that difference of squares now we get that negative 5x x minus 2 x plus 2 and then x plus 3. now what we're going to do is make sure that we have all of our factors that have x's in them we have all of our exponents we can see them right now and then we can go ahead find our leading term our y intercept and our x-intercepts so our leading term comes from all of the factors including the coefficient that have x's in them and all the largest powers that we would get if we were to distribute so we get negative 5 x to the first x to the first x to the first and x to the first that's one two three four that's negative five x to the fourth with a leading term of negative five x to the fourth tells us a lot about it this says our degree is four maximum turning point of three so we can go one two three different changes and that's probably what happens here well we have at least um three or one we have to have at least that because we have a downward even so the four says we're even the negative five says we're downward and the five says we're pretty pretty narrow because this would have sort of a vertical stretch in it so at least we have a model for that when we get to graphing it we're also going to take care of our y-intercept so the y-intercept comes from evaluating this function or any function for x equals zero that's where the y axis is so when we evaluate for zero we notice right here that negative five times zero is zero times anything else is going to give us zero it's really nice when we have this factored even over here if you want to plug it in here negative five times zero it's going to zero everything out that means that we have on these two things number one we know that we have a y-intercept of zero zero if an x-intercept is zero zero but we also have to plug in another point because we'll have nothing off of the x-axis and you have to have something to make sure that you're following the pattern of your end behavior and to make sure that you have sort of the dynamics of this graph at least sketch and now for our x-intercepts so we're going to set all the factors from here that have zeros equal to sorry they have x's equal to zero and after solving them we get x equals zero we get x equals two we get x equals negative 2 and we get x equals negative 3 and all of them have a multiplicity 1. so whether you want to write that or not you probably should power one power one power one power one every one of those factors that had an exponent of one says we have no repeated zeros we cannot possibly be bouncing these are all multiplicity one they're all odd multiplicity they're all crosses this graph is going to cross the x at every one of those points and now we're ready to graph it so we're going to start with the idea that if we have an end behavior we're going to be coming up and we're going to be coming down we also have a y-intercept of 0 0 we have our x-intercepts we're going to be showing those in just a minute but we are missing something let me show you why you need to point out the x-axis here so if we start graphing this with our y-intercept and all of our x-intercepts one of what you already have right because that that origin that's an x-intercept and a y-intercept but we have x equals two x equals negative two and x equals negative three and we know that all of those are crosses so i'm not gonna be bouncing anywhere i'm to have to follow my end behavior come up cross come down cross come up somewhere cross make a turning point cross and then go back down so that fits our model the problem is is that we really don't know how dynamic this is without a point that's not on the x-axis you could make a super shallow graph that follows that and it's gonna look nothing like the real picture so this is minimum okay really what we should do we should probably be picking a point here and here and in between in between any two x intercepts and outside of the furthest ones that's really what we should do it takes a lot of time to do that so if that's what's required great do it it's nothing more than what i've taught you it's just saying here's how to make it a little more exact i'm not taking the time because it does take a lot of time to do so you'd be plugging in negative two and a half you'd be plugging in negative one you'd be plugging in one you'd be plugging in three and you plug in negative four and figuring out those values what i've done i've plugged in negative one i evaluated this for negative one and i got negative thirty so the point would be negative 1 negative 30. that's way down there and let's see if this fits our model so we're going to come up we're going to cross don't know exactly how high we are but what i'm going to try to do here is i'm going to try to to mimic the dynamics of this point up here so i know it's a fairly dynamic graphics i have to go way down here then way up that's pretty cool so way down way up this is probably pretty high now i'm going to probably run out of white board before i graph the top of that if i were to plug in one i think i got 60 when i plugged in one which is why i played a negative one so 60 is way way up there so this would go way up and then come back down make my point bigger it's a super dynamic graph which is why they're so difficult to graph on one sheet of graph paper because you need like this much of it which is why we are sketching here and i hope that that makes sense i hope you don't think that i'm trying to cheat you out of something i have given you the the main points and i've told you how to make this more specific you plug in the values that are between your x-intercepts usually right in the middle hopefully it's a whole number or at least an integer and then you plug in them some values that are outside of your furthest x-intercept so again you plug in negative four that's left of your furthest left x intercept you plug in two and a half hopefully it's positive otherwise you made the same negative two half you plug in negative one i did i got negative thirty you plug in one i actually did i got 60 and you plug in three it's going to be very very negative that is the way to get a better picture from this thing after that what you'd have to do is some calculus to figure out exactly where those turning points are to find local max and local men okay let's talk about our last one uh well the first thing hopefully you notice is that there is some factoring that has to happen we've got to factor x squared minus 16 first at the very end of this problem i'm going to say what if that was x squared plus 16 what would you do and we'll eliminate some things from it but i'll show you that so we'll factor we don't have to factor x minus 1. that's done for us but what we do get out of this is that we have a a 2 an x squared an x and an x those are the largest powers of x including our coefficient that we would get if we were to distribute this and multiplying them together we have a two x to the fourth hey the degrees four looks really good maximum turning points is three our end behavior that's a positive power function a positive even power function that means it's upward opening it's basically a reflected picture of what this end behavior is it has to do that from here we'd start coming downward we'd end going upward and that's how this graph has to look our y intercept well it's not going to be zero because we don't have any factors that are just x so we're going to have to plug in zero or evaluate for zero and if we do that evaluate for zero it looks like we're going to get negative 32 so zero minus one is negative one negative one squared is one two times 1 is 2 0 minus 16 well that's negative 16. 2 times negative 16 is negative 32. you can also do it here it really doesn't matter it does not matter where you get that y-intercept from the only reason why we do this is to make sure that we're spot-on with the next thing make sure we're spot on with our x-intercepts that's really why we do that so now that we have this all factored ready to go we would set that equal to zero and then use the zero product property now that sets every one of those factors that has an x in it not the two but the x minus one the x minus four and x plus four all equal to zero and when we solve that and look back into the our totally factored polynomial function we're going to take the exponent the multiplicity for every one of those factors from where we got these x-intercepts and determine whether we're going to cross or bounce at that x-intercept so the 1 comes from x minus 1 that has a multiplicity 2. that means we're going to bounce at that point the x equals 4 comes from x minus 4 that's here and that has a multiplicity 1. because that's an odd multiplicity we are going to cross the x axis of that point and the same is true for x equals negative 4 that comes from x plus 4 is a as a factor that has a multiplicity 1 that's also a cross and now we're ready to graph this as much as we're able to again we are sketching so it doesn't have to be exactly perfect it's not going to be because we don't know exactly where the turning points are but we do have to model all of this in our graph so we're going to start with the idea of end behavior i'm dropping and i'm climbing i'm decreasing and increasing on the end behaviors here i have a y-intercept of 0 comma negative 32 i've got a x intercept of 1 multiplicity 2 so it's a bounce and i'm going to show that that is just a cue for me so that when i'm graphing this i know oh yeah i'm just going to bounce off that it looks like i have a cross at 4 and negative 4. so that's the case then what i'm going to do is match all of this to this graph it is probably not true that this is a local minimum this probably goes way down here it comes way back up you'd have to plug in some values to determine that so you plug something like negative two um it's probably the case that this also is pretty far down here you wanna plug in something like negative two something like positive two or positive three i remember like 5 or a number like negative 5 to verify where those points are if you need to be more specific generally we don't we're just sketching here but if you have to be if you want to be plug those values in and see what they do something like like negative 2 oh man let's see uh negative two minus one is negative three that would be nine that's eighteen so you'd have two times nine and then 2 squared that's 4 4 minus 16 is what negative 12. so 18 times negative 12 really down there so that's really that's negative hey at least you know it's negative but it's way down there that's through my floor by a lot so we're we're not going to really graph it but but what does it do it gives you a picture that this is a super dynamic graph this is not something that goes oh yeah i'm just going to come down here bounce and come up this comes down here goes way way way down there hits this y intercept on the way up bounces probably drops way down here again and then comes up and hits that four and continues to positive infinity that's probably what this does again if you need to be more specific yeah plug in some values like i've told you but just be aware that it's going to exceed your graph paper it's going to give you a really really crazy graph in most cases or you have to really adjust the scale to make it work just keep that in mind so i'm going to be sketching it i know we're coming down very drastically coming up bouncing probably coming down way down there and coming up you're going to want to know what that value is if you need to be more specific so this is purely a sketch it gives you a shape of what this graph is doing to be more specific you either plug in a lot of points or do calculus one to figure out derivatives so but we have fit our model we know that our end behavior matches we know that we have a cross a bounce and a cross we've hit our y intercept we set uh let's see three turning points one two and three and it's a fairly decent graph for minimal work again this is minimal work right if we wanted to be perfect we'd plug in all the points but this is sketching and we're getting a shape of it i hope that makes sense to you virgin i'm just trying to prepare you for how calculus one is going to treat this stuff this is like the first four steps and the last step is not hard it's just a basic derivative set equal to zero and then you plug in the values of critical points not bad now i promise you something i said what if we change this to a plus if we change that to a plus then this no longer factors what's that mean if we change that to a plus our end behavior well let's see our end behavior would still be x squared times x squared times 2 that's 2x to the fourth we'd have the same end behavior what would be missing though is we would not have that factoring in fact the only x-intercept would be one this would not give you any x-intercepts this wouldn't be here anymore which means that we would not cross the x-axis at all this would purely be a bounce none of this would be here you would no longer cross the x-axis at all let's see your y-intercept would now be positive 32 and not negative 32. so we probably would come down here very steeply maybe have a turning point in there somewhere that's usually what irreducible quadratics do they have a turning point somewhere that's above or below the x-axis a couple of actually a pair of them above or below the x-axis it probably would come down here bounce if it certainly bounce at one and go back up you'd still fit your end behavior this would be a positive 32 you would only have one x intercept with your balance so probably a pretty dynamic graph but we'd be sort of guessing at some turning points there without calculus one you'd have to be guessing well i hope that this makes sense as far as you're sketching as far as how to put this together this factored polynomial into a graph and i honestly a really good graph i know we're just sketching but it is a really good graph what we're going to do later is take these concepts and sort of fill it in with what asymptotes do vertical asymptotes horizontal asymptotes and oblique or slant asymptotes i'm going to teach all that stuff to you so that when you get to calculus one it's not even going to be a big deal you'll be like yeah i know that wait the only thing i have to do now is derivatives yeah it's not even hard in a lot of the cases especially for polynomials so i'm preparing you for that so that your graphs are really really solid when you get to like a calc 1 level i hope it makes sense i hope you're enjoying it i know graphing is sort of like ah for a lot of people but by understanding what they look like and how they work i promise it's gonna get easier you might even enjoy it i kind of like doing this especially in calc one because it it goes fairly quickly like you're not having spent a lot of tedious time on it so i'll see for the next video what we're going to do next is we're going to start talking about real zeros so that if you don't have a polynomial that's factored you can factor it so i'll see you for that you 

Transcript for: Synthetic Division and Long Division of Polynomials (Precalculus - College Algebra 32)
hey everybody welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about division of polynomials and man are we going to need that in the next few videos we're going to unpack something called descartes rule of signs use that to simplify or make our lives easier with what's called the rational zeros theorem it's basically how to find x-intercepts if you have no idea what they are so we're going to we're going to start with long division polynomials and synthetic division polynomials because we're going to be using so much in just a couple videos so we're going to spend a lot of time doing that but before we get to that there's something i want to talk about called the factor theorem and part of it is the remainder theorem what just lets the stuff pop be possible so i'm going to explain that we're going to talk about long division and synthetic division why both because you need both synthetic division is super nice and it's very convenient and very fast but it only works under certain circumstances and so i'm going to teach you both of them because you will be using both long division and synthetic division in your math lives so that's we're going to be doing so let's get right into it what lets division of polynomials be possible is something called the factor theorem and what we're going to be using is this idea that if you get a remainder of zero what you're dividing goes into what you are what you're dividing by goes into what you're dividing evenly and is therefore a factor that's basically all of it in a nutshell with this gel it sounds kind of wordy if you uh really just read it and it goes if upon division you get a remainder of zero your divisor is a factor of your dividend here's what that means here's 48 here's six you go okay let's divide 48 by six this is your dividend this is your divisor this up here is going to be your quotient so we start inviting go hey does uh does 6 go into 48 it goes in 8 times you go oh 8 times 6 is 48 and if we subtract we get 0. oh hey the remainder 0 and that's what this says it says if your remainder is zero then your divisor is actually a factor of your dividend that means that you can factor your dividend as six times some other number and that's exactly what we're going to be doing that sort of summarizes the remainder theorem and the factor theorem as far as what you need to know to get this stuff done so we're going to be doing a couple things number one we're going to use the remainder theorem to say if you if you divide and you get a remainder of zero this is combined with vector theorem then what you're dividing by is a factor of what you are dividing we're also going to be checking this by plugging in a value and making sure that you get zero out of it that would say that you have this zero which would create a factor for us and then we can sort of use that in conjunction with our theorems to give ourselves a factored polynomial that's what we're going to be doing this is actually a good model for long division of polynomials how it works and so let's just jump right into it let's see as we keep going what this stuff means in relation to what we're doing so again why we're doing it you are going to be doing this stuff a lot once i teach you about the rational zeros theorem you might hear rational roots theorem that is really important for us going forward with polynomials and also with rational functions so here's how this works the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to start testing a number to see if it's actually a zero so here's the logic behind this if i say here's my polynomial and i really can't factor it so if i try to factor this i might think grouping or something grouping's not going to work i don't really have just a quadratic so quadratic form is not going to work for us there is actually a technique that you can go through to solve a cubic by just doing using the coefficients that's possible but it's really beyond the scope of like a precalculus level class so you learn that much much later and it's very very involved so the way we get around that is by doing something called the rational zeros rational zeros theorem and what it does i'm going to kind of cheat here and give a spoiler what the rational zeros theorem does is it gives you a list of numbers that are potential zeros for your function all the rational that's whole numbers positive negative so integers and fractions that could potentially be factors of your polynomial so no it wouldn't include square roots things like that but it's really really helpful for us so what that's going to do that's going to have a list of numbers for you and you're going to start trying them you're going to say okay hey if something is a 0 an x intercept or a root of our function then when i plug it in it should give me zero that's the whole point of being an x-intercept so here's what we're gonna do we're gonna take this value and we're going to evaluate it if it gives us a zero that means that this is going to create a factor force think back to last video that's kind of exactly what we did we said oh that's an x-intercept yep and we can make a factor from it uh you have to subtract one you get x minus one and you know that's two years ago and you know that's going to be a factor well that's using these theorems that we're talking about so we're going to plug it in see if it gives us a 0. if it does we're going to divide because we know it's going to be a factor by these theorems and then we're going to get a at least partially factored polynomial from it that's awesome because the last video what we had was i gave you the polynomial already factored so let's graph it you know how do we get the factors like this by dividing long division or synthetic division so here's our steps we're going to go through number one we're going to check to see whether this x value is in fact an x-intercept if you evaluate it and it gives you 0 then that's an x-intercept think about that if i plug it in it says you have a height of 0 then you are on the x-axis that's we're going to check first after that we'll create a factor and start dividing so we're going to evaluate f of 1. so f of 1 would take and plug in 1 everywhere you see an x and so we'd have two minus one is one plus two is three minus three is zero hey look at that if we plug in one we get zero here's what this says what this says is that if you plug in one and you solve it that is going to be your remainder if you were to divide divide the factor that that one is giving you let me say this one more time i'm going to evaluate one it's giving me zero this right here is the remainder that i'm going to get if i divide the factor that this creates so if i get 0 i have an x intercept that's what this is saying saying this is for sure and x intercept because when i evaluate x it gives me zero gives me something on the x axis that's fantastic let's find the factor so the factor would be subtract 1 on both sides oh that x minus 1 equal to 0 that's using that sort of zero product property to say this thing is a factor that's part of the factory third as well this thing is a factor of your polynomial why because we know that our remainder's zero remember if you divide something and your remainder is zero then your divisor what you're dividing by goes in evenly or perfectly divides your dividend you're going to get a remainder of zero and so we're going to use that so we're going to take our polynomial and we're going to do what's called long division of polynomial and then i'm going to show you some the synthetic division after that synthetic division is much quicker but it only works in certain circumstances i'll explain that when we get there so long division of polynomials takes your polynomial the whole thing and then it writes it where the dividend goes so like where the 48 was in the first example what you do need to make sure that you have you need to make sure that it's in order that is very important all our polynomials should be in order but we need to be extra careful on that also you need to have every exponent below your degree remember your degree is the largest power of x below your degree you need to have that represented so if you're missing any you put a almost like a place value holder like 0x cubed or something like that we'll see that in the next example here we're not missing anything so we're going to write the polynomial and then we're going to write the factor that we're dividing so one time all the way through we are going to be checking to see whether this number creates an x-intercept if you get zero it does after that we're going to create a factor from that x-intercept we know it's an x-intercept now therefore it should work in the zero product property that when we multiply it it's going to give us 0. so we're going to create a factor and then we're going to divide our polynomial by that factor this is factoring your polynomial but not using a technique besides kind of checking a number to see if it's an x-intercept or a zero now the question you should have in your head is where where'd that come from did you randomly guess it no i didn't um this is going to come in two videos from now when i teach you the rational zeros theorem i'm teaching this now that way when we get there we can immediately go for it that's what this is for so i'm going to go ahead i'm going to write out my my factor x minus 1. now please listen to something i know for sure that this has to divide this already why because i plugged in the one and it gave me zero it has to be a factor so if i do all this work and i get not zero down here either i messed up on my evaluation or i messed up on my division if you plug in this number and it gives you zero then the factor that you create it has to be a factor like it must divide this and give you a remainder of zero 100 every time that also means this you're not going to waste your time doing long division if you check this number and it doesn't give you zero so if you check and he goes oh you got like seven why are you wasting your time because we're trying to factor polynomials now there is cause to do this sometimes sometimes you do need to divide things that are not going to divide evenly especially like slant asymptotes of leg asymptotes you do have to do that so i'm going to show that to you but if you're checking to factor your polynomial and it's not giving you a zero you're not like you wouldn't go any further so i guess the main point is if you do this and you get this it better divide evenly if it doesn't you've made a mistake so here's how long division of polynomials works what we do is base pretty much everything off this first term so we're going to check our first term and divide by our first term so 2x to the third divided by x what's going to happen is that really all you're going to be doing is lowering that exponent and keeping that coefficient because you're just dividing by x 1 x to the first power it's not going to change much that's the logic of how the synthetic division is going to be built so synthetic division only works if you have firstly a linear so like x minus something not x squared not x to the third just x to the first power and it also only works if you have your coefficient of x as one if that's not true synthetic division does not work or at least it doesn't work very well um long division of polynomials it's it's much more robust it'll work all the time so it'll work with it x squared or 3x squared or 2x which is why i need to learn both of them so i need to learn long division polynomials because you'll be using it to divide out x squared quadratics at some times you'll be using it to divide out when your x is not just one x or you'd have to change it and then use submit division so and you choose that but you do need to know both of them so with long division polynomials we take our first term and divide by our first term if you need to write this off to the side like hey 2x to the third that's our first term divided by x that's our first term here what we're going to get is 2 divided by 1 is 2 x to the third divided by x to the first is x squared that right there is the first part of our quotient we're going to put it right there now just like every time you've done long division we're going to multiply do you remember that like we divide then we multiply and we subtract the same thing is going to happen here however when you have more than one term you do have to distribute this so we're going to take 2x squared times x well that's going to give us 2x to the third power and it should always be that your first terms here should be identical because you're subtracting and you need them to go away and we distribute 2x squared times negative 1 is negative or minus 2x squared this is the reason why you have to make sure that you have every potential power of x 3 2 1 constant uh at least represented in that that dividend because you're going to be matching up exponents and if you miss a spot you're going to go where do i put this you go i don't know you mess it up um that's why we have to have that then we subtract and this is where all the mistakes happen like 99 of them and you know that well 95 you know this right because i say this all the time that 95 of your mistakes in math are probably signed errors like mistaking negatives with positives and that's what happens here you see when we subtract right now we are really subtracting a polynomial minus another polynomial put parentheses around here and when you subtract understand that what you're really doing is 2x cubed minus 2x cubed great that's 0. but you're doing negative x squared minus negative 2x squared wait a minute negative x squared minus a negative subtracting a negative is adding this sign the second sign inside your parentheses will always change always so keep that in the back of your head if you're always subtracting and you're distributing a minus sort of uh you're subtracting both these terms in this polynomial your second sign is always going to change so this says negative x squared minus negative 2x squared no no negative x squared plus 2x squared well that's positive x squared and we would bring down the plus 2x looks a lot like regular long division of of integer numbers and then we keep on going so this is an algorithm it's a process for doing this stuff and we check the next term so this first term divided by this first term again so we take x squared divided by x and if you simplify x squared divided by x is 1x to the first power just x well that's the next thing that we're going to put on our quotient so since that's positive we'll put plus x and we're going to do the same process we're going to take our positive we'll think about this as positive x and we're going to distribute so x times x that's x squared it's looking good those are exactly the same that's what we want to see and we distribute x times negative 1 well that's negative x or minus x and then just like before we're going to subtract so i'm going to put my parentheses around that because i'm really subtracting polynomials so first minus second says x squared minus x squared that's 0 that's what we want to see we want to see those first terms kind of disappear all the time but watch your signs 2x minus negative x and that's going to give us 2x plus x do you see i hope you see why i use parentheses because that's a little q for my head say hey slow down you're going to have some sign changes the second the second term is always going to change signs because you are subtracting if you have more than that all of your last terms are going to change signs because you are subtracting a full polynomial so 2x minus a negative so 2x plus x is 3x and we bring down our minus three and we do this one last time we're going to take our first term divided by our first term if we simplify we simply get three and it's positive three so we'll put plus three if we distribute one last time three times x is three x and three times negative one we think of that as negative one is minus three and if we subtract this is pretty neat this is what we knew would happen oh man hey look we should have a remainder of zero this is what we knew would happen and what we wanted to happen because when we get a remainder of zero it says that what you've divided by is your divisor divides perfectly into your dividend gives you this quotient in other words this is a factor if you have a remainder of zero it's a perfect factor that's great it means you can factor your polynomial fantastic so when we subtract this 3x minus 3x is 0 negative 3 minus negative 3. negative 3 subtract negative so it's negative 3 plus 3 that's zero if you do not end with that either you've done something wrong either this was wrong or something happened here so if you plug in this number and it gives you zero and you create your factor by subtracting that number or adding that number if it's negative and getting this factor this has to divide that and give you a remainder zero if that doesn't happen something went wrong or if you didn't get a zero there then why are you doing this if you don't absolutely have to sometimes you do but for finding factors you wouldn't you'd want to make sure right you don't want to check and do long division on every potential factor that's crazy it's going to take you forever so we find the factors or sorry to find the values of x that give us 0 we create our factors and we know that they're going to be factors that's what we're going to be doing two videos from now now why why does this even matter well here's the reason why it matters because if we know that we have a remainder of zero we can now rewrite this polynomial that we did not know what its factors were we didn't know how to graph it and now we can rewrite it and we know for sure right now that hey this dividend is now a product of a factor we know it's a factor it has a remainder zero and the quotient so we could write it as x minus one two x squared plus x plus three now what would you do now uh well that's a quadratic you could try to factor it further you could try a quadratic formula but if you do that your discriminant is negative it says that's an irreducible quadratic check it if you want to pause the video check it try the quadratic formula you'd get b squared minus 4ac and that's going to be negative there's no x-intercepts the same irreducible quadratic that's fantastic if you do quadratic formula and you get i or a negative inside your square root you have an irreducible quadratic you can't factor it you're done this is completely factored over the real numbers that means that you had really no idea what was going on here besides that's a positive cubic so it should look like this it should have at least one x intercept think about that if your graph looks like this here's your leading term here's your degree max turning points of 2 that's a positive odd looks like this that means that you have to cross the x-axis well you know what we just found it we cross the x-axis at x equals one multiplicity one it is a cross and this is an irreducible quadratic and we have no more x-intercepts that's pretty neat but that's the reason why we need to learn how to divide so we can get this far so we can understand okay that's really what this graphics can look like it probably has another turning point but it's not one that causes a different x-axis intercept so we um we're done that's that's about as much as i need you to know so we're plugging in a value we're making sure that we get a zero if we do cool we create a factor we divide it and we write this as a factored polynomial can you continue past this yes but you need to try another x-intercept in our case we had a quadratic and you'd go let's just do quadratic formula because that's easier than guessing and checking but if you had like a power 4 still power 3 still you'd need another x-intercept to create another factor and that's the whole process in two videos we're going to have a list of numbers we'll get an x-intercept create a factor divide it find another x-intercept create a factor divide it we keep on going now i'm going to show you synthetic division it's really cool i mean it's really really useful but there are some special circumstances that you have to have i already explained it but i want to go through it one more time this is what you have to have number one you have to have that your divisor has a one in front of your x honestly you need to basically solve for x i'm going to show you this in just a second you want this to be x equals some sort of a value it can't be a fraction it can be a fraction that's okay but you need to have solved for x here basically second thing you need to have every single one of these exponents of x represented just like you did for long division polynomials and that's pretty easy so here's the way that synthetic division works we're going to use just the coefficients of our polynomial and we're going to put them right here so we're going to say that our coefficients are 2 negative 1 2 and negative 3. we can include the constant even though it's not a coefficient we include that and we leave ourselves a space right below then what we do is we take the x intercept one not negative one i see so many students make that mistake and they go oh yeah you get your factor and you do this you're going to put negative one here no synthetic division is very special synthetic division when you divide it has the special circumstances so that you can just take this value and divide with it so we're going to take one we're going to divide we're going to use one as the thing that we're dividing with synthetic division so we just put our 1 here so you take the x intercept not the factor the factor you is used when you're actually dividing that's what we're doing we're taking the factor divided by the factor but with synthetic division you don't do that you take what x equals this is why i started this way this is why i said this is what we're checking this is the x-intercept this is what you divide by if you make and put negative one you're going to run into a whole lot of issues and you're gonna get very frustrated because you're ah never works darn you leonard hey maybe make sure that you have the x-intercept there and here's what we're going to do it's it's a process it's an algorithm it's extremely fast we bring down the first coefficient so we're going to bring down the two oh yes i forgot the other special condition with synthetic division you have to have solved for x which means you cannot have x to the second power here or x to the third power so that division works as you solve for x completely x equals a constant and that's what you're dividing by right so if you don't have x to the first power you haven't solved this yet and therefore you can't put that number there unless you solve for x so um this is a very special case thing where you have x to the first power equals an x-intercept it's just for x-intercepts and it gives you a factored version of it in just a minute so that's what we're doing just make sure that you've actually solved for x and you're set so we have x equals one we put the one we bring down our first coefficient we put two and the whole process the whole algorithm is multiply put it here add multiply put it here add multiply it put it here add and this will be your remainder the last number you get is your remainder so let's go ahead and do that i'm going to now multiply 2 times 1 i'm going to put it right here then when i add i'm going to get 1. i'm going to multiply 1 times 1 and i'm going to put it here 1 times 1 is 1 and i'm going to add well 2 plus 1 is 3. i'm going to multiply 1 times 3 well that's 3. i'm going to put it here when i add notice you're adding here you're going to get 0. this last piece is your remainder well wait a minute that zero is exactly like that zero that's your remainder we knew we had to get a remainder of zero that's what we did when we checked for an x-intercept at the very beginning now this might look like just gobbling  but that right there are the coefficients of your quotient 2 1 and 3. so because we're always dividing by x to the first power while dividing by something that's equal to x to the first power really what we're doing is we're just lowering our exponent of every term by one and what that means is that no matter what you do here you just look back at your original okay because i start with x to the third power and i'm practically dividing out an x to the first power what i'm going to get is lower all of these by one this would be two x to the second power plus one x to the first power plus three well that three doesn't have an x to a power because that's a constant that right there is your quotient and this is pretty cool it's pretty cool because we got the same exact thing as this we got our quotient but we spent a whole lot less time on it and that's not just because i was explaining this fully it's because that's much quicker but for certain circumstances again that will not work if you're trying to factor out quadratics and this will which is why you need both of them so the last thing we do is say all right we're going to go ahead and factor our polynomial like we did over here we know that 2x squared plus x plus 3 is part of it that's an irreducible quadratic we already explained that but now i have a factor and this is the second place where some students can't get confused on this so keep this in mind what you did right here is you set and found an x-intercept of one and use that one you need to make sure that you subtract one to find your factor you can see this right that a lot of students go oh yeah my factor is x plus 1 because that's positive no no it's opposite of that sign so think back to what you're doing this right here gave you that number this right here is not your factor you have to subtract one to get that factor so our factor is x minus one and that's exactly what we got here can which one do you do which one's better um honestly i'm pretty quick at this and i never make mistakes with signs because it's right there so i actually prefer this and it works all the time but don't let that don't let my opinion influence what you choose a ton of people love this because it's extremely fast i'm going to be doing both of them pretty much all the time just so you can get good at it and i want to always reinforce the content so you're going to be seeing long division of polynomials and you're going to be seeing synthetic division it doesn't take that much longer for me to show and so i'm going to always do that for you just to get you prepared you even use long division and calculus like help one count to calc 3 on occasion where you have to divide a polynomial by something and sometimes it's useful to divide it even if you know you're going to get a remainder that's not zero so we have two more examples to do the next one we're missing some exponents and the one after that where we don't have a remainder of zero and just what you do with that this would be like a four-layer sort of an idea so we'll see in a second all right let's keep on going shall we so we have a honestly really nasty uh polynomial there and we're going to try to factor it as much as we can or at least we're going to get one factor out of it and then we're probably gonna stop because it would take a long time to keep on going but this idea is is important uh however i have not taught you how to get the list of numbers so we'd have to really guess and check to keep on going after this so we're gonna try to factor that thing now before we get going if you have a degree 5 or higher there is no general way to factor that by using the coefficients so there's no formula to plug in to factor that thing you have to know something about this function in order to factor it that's where the rational zeros theorem is going to come in in about two videos i know i'm over i'm kind of playing it up so you'll have to watch it but this is what would happen you'd have a list of numbers and you would say all right which of those are x intercepts so you plug them in you go i'm going to plug in something easy like one does it work uh no 3 plus 82 plus 27 that's that's not one that's not zero plugged in negative one uh no that's not your word either and eventually you get through your list and you get to something like negative three so that's where this would come from i'm not making it up i'm not really guessing at it i would have a list of numbers given by a technique i'm going to show you in two videos that would give that to you and so here's our job once we have that okay i'm going to check negative 3. we're going to plug in negative 3. we're going to evaluate this and we're going to see what it gives us if it doesn't give us 0 then that's not an x-intercept and it will not create a factor for us if i evaluate for negative 3 and it does give a zero think about that evaluate something it gives you 0 you're on the x-axis it is an x-intercept it will give you a factor and then we keep going and then we divide so that's the process of doing this that's what we're going to get to in just a couple videos so let's uh let's evaluate g of negative 3. so um did this already that's pretty hard to evaluate you're definitely going to want your calculator because negative 3 to the sixth power is already pretty big and then you multiply by 3 add 82 times negative 3 to third power and 27 and you are actually gonna get zero so we'd spend the time to do that and we'd say hey because i evaluated negative three and it gave me zero i know a couple things about this function right now number one thing i know is that that's an x-intercept now that's fantastic you know why don't you stop there because that could potentially have five more and so you're going to want to know what this function looks like in order to figure out more x-intercepts now what should this give you if i start dividing by x plus three which is a factor should give us two things number one a remainder of zero number two it should give us some degree five polynomial remember i have x to the sixth i'm going to be dividing by x to the first it should give us a degree 5 polynomial as a quotient and that's important to understand that we're just going to be lowering the degree by 1. that means we could potentially have 5 more x intercepts to find and so that's the reason why we don't just end here like i am good uh we have to keep going to give ourselves some quotient to see what's next if you go well why don't you just try all the numbers on this apparent list that you're going to give me and just be done with that well because the list is only rational zeros it won't show up any square roots so any radical zeros or other types of numbers and so it is important for us to be able to use this to get a polynomial that we can do for the work with that's why we're doing it there's not really a great way around it and so here's our thought process we plugged in negative three we evaluated that it gave us zero it says this that's an x-intercept we know that if we have an x-intercept we did a few videos ago that i can set this equal to zero by adding three and x plus three is a factor it has to be a factor of that polynomial and it has to give us a remainder of zero this is what our remainder should be this is what we're going to get when we divide so we're going to put x plus 3 where we put our divisor and we're going to put our polynomial inside of our our division symbol it's where the dividend goes and so what we're going to be doing though is we're going to make sure that we have a power of of x for every potential exponent less than 6. so 6 is our degree we're going to start with that but we have to represent the fifth power the fourth power the third power it's there second power first power and then our constant it's there how we do that is with a zero so we'd say zero x to the fifth it's kind of like a place value holder 0x to the fourth we actually have an x to the third we don't have an x squared or an x but we do have a 27. and so we now have let's make sure six five four three two one constant and we filled that out completely it looks pretty um pretty tedious and honestly it is there there's a lot of work here we have lots of steps i'm going to go through them fairly quickly man you should be doing the same thing on your own all right we really really should be checking this along with me so what we would do though is basically the same thing we did in last example take your first term and divide by x that's always our first term if our first term is not just x this will still work even if you have a quadratic or something like that you're trying to divide so 3x to the sixth divided by x is three x to the fifth i'm not gonna be writing this off to the side i'm doing this in my head three x to the fifth times x we're gonna get three x to the sixth we distribute and we get nine x to the fifth now i always put parentheses around it because we're subtracting and i know that when i'm subtracting polynomials my signs change so three x to the sixth minus three x is six that's zero uh zero x to the fifth minus nine x to the fifth not plus minus your sign changes that's negative nine x to the fifth and i bring down my zero x to the fourth and i continue then we start with our next first term so z not negative nine x to the fifth divided by x basically you're just subtracting one from the exponent that's really all you're doing that's negative 9x to the fourth power so i'm going to put minus and then i'm going to distribute make sure you distribute with your sign negative 9x to the fourth times x well that's negative nine x to the fifth that's fantastic uh that's we we're always checking this if that's not the same we've made a mistake the negative nine x to the fourth times three is negative so i write minus 27 x to the fourth double checking my work okay i know that's right now i'm going to subtract again keeping in mind that when i'm subtracting polynomials my signs change in my parentheses so negative nine x to the fifth minus negative nine that's zero zero minus negative 27 that's positive 27 and i bring down my next term and again we start with our first terms 27 x to the fourth divided by x well i'm basically just subtracting from my exponent because my coefficient is 1. 27 divided by 1 is 27 and x to the fourth divided by x to the first you subtract exponents you get to the third and that's what synthetic division division is kind of based on anyway but here i get positive so 27x to the fourth divided by x is positive 27 x to the third and i distribute so 27x to the third times x is 27 x to the fourth 27 x to the third times 3 is 81 so positive 81 x to the third i hope you're seeing the reason why we had to have a place value for every potential value of x otherwise we would have no no where to put that where do i put it i don't know there's no spot for it that's what we had to have that so i'm keeping in mind that when i subtract all my signs change inside my parentheses is why i put my parentheses 27 minus 27 is zero my exponents match up that's fantastic 82 minus 81. remember we're subtracting positive 81. that's one x to the third i bring down my 0x squared x cubed that's our first term divided by x that's our first term of our divisor is x squared positive x squared when i distribute we get x squared times x is x to the third x squared times three is three x squared we put our parentheses we do our subtraction we're getting a little tedious here but that's okay it's going to work out well x cubed minus x cubed that's zero zero minus three remember our sine shape zero minus three is negative three x squared and i bring down my zero x we actually know it's going to work out because we already checked it so that's kind of cool that's that's encouraging that we know what we're going to get and we take our first term and divide by the first term of our divisor so negative 3x squared divided by x is negative 3x so we put minus then we distribute negative 3x times x is negative 3x squared that looks great because it matches up with our first term that always has to be the case and negative 3x times 3 is minus or negative 9x we put minus 9x and we subtract your signs are going to change negative minus negative so negative three minus a negative is zero x squared zero minus negative nine well that's zero plus nine that's nine x and bring down our 27 that's exciting uh 9x divided by x hey those x's would cancel you just get 9. when we multiply 9 times x is 9x 9 times 3 is 27 when we subtract 9x minus 9x is 0. 27 minus 27 is 0. we know what we should have got 0 and now we've confirmed that we got it so we're for sure that we have this stuff all correct that's why you go all the way to the bottom plus you figure all these coefficients and constants anyway so this is what this says to us this says that this polynomial has a factor and this is what's left over after you've factored it out so in other words yeah run already write this get your function name right we have x plus 3 as one factor that's a linear and then we have this power 5 polynomial 3x to the fifth minus nine to the fourth plus 27 x cubed plus x squared minus three x plus nine now are we done we are done but what would happen later is that you would have some more numbers on the rational zeros list that you would plug into this power five polynomial to see if it gave you an x-intercept to see if you evaluate it gives you zero that means you're dealing with an x-intercept that gives you a factor and you would redo this until you got down to one or two types of factors linears or power twos that the quadratic formula does not work for in other words it gives you complex numbers that's when you're done so if you have a power 5 i guarantee you there's at least one more x-intercept why because it's an odd that right here is an odd function it has to cross the x-axis one more time it has to not just bounce cross it there has to be a cross there so this would not be fully factored guaranteed we're not going to spend the time to find the the other x-intercepts because we don't have that list of numbers and i haven't talked to you how to do it that's not this video but just understand that once you find this is the process here is for you to understand that once you find an x-intercept you get a factor and you divide it now we're going to do synthetic division it's much much quicker you're going to really like it here and then you'll see that that we get the same thing so let's write it out how we do it is basically the same as this but you don't include any x's so you still have to have all of those coefficients so you look at your polynomial and say all right there'd be a 3x to the sixth then you have no x to the fifth and no x to the fourth you have a 82x to the third you have no x squared you have no x and you have 27 as your constant we know that our remainder should be zero let's make sure that that that happens so what we're going to do is we're going to do synthetic division here um it is a little bit different than long division because you don't take the factor you take the x-intercept and use that in the algorithm so we're going to take negative three now when we go ahead and do it the first step is to bring down your first coefficient so we're going to bring down the three the reason why that works is because with synthetic division you always have to have x that solve for so no coefficient so basically you're counting on that you're dividing the first term by one x to the first it's just lowering your exponent by one and it's keeping your coefficient that's why that works now we're going to multiply and add multiply and add multiply and add so bring down the 3 this is negative 3 times 3 is negative 9. add 0 plus negative 9 is negative 9. multiply negative 3 times 8 minus 27 0 plus 27 is 27. multiply negative 3 times 27 is negative 81. add you get 82 plus negative 81 is 1. multiply negative 3 times one is negative three and add zero plus negative three is negative three multiply negative three times negative three is positive nine add zero plus nine is nine do you see it that's exactly the same coefficients that we have there multiply negative three times 9 is negative 27 if you add 27 plus negative 27 is 0 go to the end make sure you have a 0 there if you don't if you did this right here and it says you do have a zero and you don't get it there something happened that was bad and now the last thing we would do is understand that you're dividing out x to the first power you're just going to take all of those exponents and subtract one from them that's what you're dividing out does dividing exponents you subtract so we'd have three x to the fifth minus nine x to the fourth plus 27 x to the third plus one x squared minus three x plus nine and everybody agrees that that's way faster and that's fantastic do it all the time if you want to just when you can't do it it's nice to have something that works for like quadratics and things of that nature so this would be exactly the same as what we have right here we'd say hey that's that's our quotient we know what a factor is a factor would be that's an x-intercept never forget this this is not x minus 3. this is x equals negative 3 therefore x plus 3 equals 0 your factors x plus 3 not x minus 3. that's the same exact factoring that we've got right here so either way you want to go on that for now again i'm going to be doing both that's obviously a little bit a little bit a lot quicker i have one more example when you what to do if you don't have a zero but you still need to divide so hang on for that one okay one last example of what to do if you don't have a remainder of zero but you still need to divide what you do with that remainder i want to bring it back a long long time ago what happens if you were to divide 49 by six you know well it doesn't divide you're right you need a remainder of one actually so six goes into 49 eight times if you multiply you get 48 and if you subtract you get one and that remainder of one creates a fraction if you divide your whole it goes into 49 eight whole times and you get one over six or in other words your remainder over your divisor and this can be added added to it eight plus one six is 8 and 1 6. that models what we do with the remainder that's not zero so i'm going to show you that right now so let's uh let's first check to see what the remainder is you know hey x is 2 that's on my list and so here's my um here's my polynomial here's a number that i'm checking so i figure out what happens if i evaluate 2 so i plug in 2 and i go right let's see 2 cubed is 8 8 times 4 is 32 2 squared is 4 this is 12 13 12 is 20 minus 16 that's 4 plus 4 is 8. go oh great i'm going to get 8. yay wait is that an x-intercept no because if it was if you evaluated it x-intercepts give you 0 on the x-axis when you evaluate them so this is clearly not an x-intercept what that means is that x minus 2 is not a factor if i divide this polynomial by x minus 2 it is not going to divide evenly i will not be able to write as a factor but i can write it as a quotient plus some sort of a a remainder and so that's what i'm going to show you how to do sometimes you have to this is not often but sometimes you do so we're going to write 4 x cubed minus 3x squared minus 8x plus 4. there's no missing exponents that's kind of nice i'm going to take the potential factor we know it's not going to be and i'm going to divide it i'm going to go very quickly here so 4x cubed divided by x is 4x to the second that would be 4x cubed minus 8 x squared when we subtract we need to make sure that our signs are changing our parentheses this gives us 0 that's great negative 3 plus 8 is 5x squared i'm going to bring down my minus 8x and we're going to do the whole thing again so 5x squared divided by x is positive 5x i'm going to distribute 5x squared minus 10x so 5x times negative 2 is minus 10x i'm going to make sure that my parentheses because when i subtract over parentheses my signs change 5x squared minus 5x squared zero cool negative 8 minus negative 10 that's 2. and lastly 2x divided by x is 2. so put 2. 2x minus 4 and you go oh that's 0. it's not 0 because when you subtract 2x minus 2x is 0. that's great but 4 minus negative 4 is 8. that says we have a remainder wait a minute that's exactly what that is exactly that's great that's fantastic it's what we wanted to happen we knew that it was not going to factor well that's not a factor of this so here's what you do with it much like the 1 over 6 the remainder over your divisor you take this if it's positive you write plus if it's negative you write minus so here we write a plus your remainder over what you divided by and that's how you can take and divide a polynomial by something that's not a factor and still write something relevant this is useful on occasion when you get to something like calculus 2. sometimes we have to do this to do some integrals and make things a little bit easier you'd end with it if you did this you know the integral of ln uh x minus two but that's um that's way beyond where we're at i'm just letting you know this is what you do when you when you get there so if you don't have a roommate honestly if you plug that in it doesn't give you zero in this class you're pretty much done but if you have to do it then this is the way you go and do it you have a remainder you put if that's negative it would be a minus here minus 8 over x minus 2. okay synthetic division is very very similar we take our coefficients in our constant four negative three negative eight and four we have no missing exponents so that's cool and we take what x is equal to not our factor but what x is equal to our potential x intercept and that's 2 and then we go ahead and we do our synthetic division synthetic division based on the factor dividing by x to the first power brings down your coefficient multiplies four times two is eight and adds negative three plus eight is five multiplies two times five is ten and adds negative 8 plus 10 is 2 multiplies 2 times 2 is 4 and adds it doesn't subtract it adds and you get 8 you get a remainder of eight and this says okay this would be four x squared plus five x plus two plus eight over don't get confused your factors not x plus 2 x would equal to x minus 2 equals 0 your factor is x minus 2. that is what your quotient would be if you divide it let's see i think that's about all that i want to tell you that's what you do when you have this this remainder and how you represent that could you write it it's a little awkward but you could if you had to write this as a sort of factored form you could still write x minus 2 times your quotient but it gets really awkward and that's not going to help you at all with any further factoring so i hope that makes sense and i'll see you for another video you 

Transcript for: Descartes Rule of Signs (Precalculus - College Algebra 33)
hey there i hope you're doing well hope you're ready for another video we have kind of a short video on a not simple but easy to understand concept that is very very useful is it uh imperative not really but you're going to find that descartes rule of science can really save you a lot of time in the next concept that we're going to learn which is how to solve uh rational functions sorry polynomial functions using the rational zeros theorem so factoring creates the ability to solve by the zero product property and that's what we're getting to but i wanted to throw this concept in there because i'm going to be referencing it in the next video and it's important for you to understand because i want to save you time i don't want you to waste a lot of time checking things that you don't need to because they don't exist it'll give you a better understanding of what is going to happen when you start factoring these polynomials so we're going to get right into the descartes of science i'm not going to prove it for you i will tell you the idea behind it though so as we go through it i'm gonna explain to you why is it that you can have three positive x-intercepts or one but not two and not zero or two or zero but not one or three why it decreases by an even number and so here's what you're going to learn in this video you're going to learn that if you have a polynomial in order and you just count the number of sign changes from left to right it will tell you the number of positive x-intercepts you have for real it's going to tell you either have like three or one or that's it or maybe six or four or two or zero well that that might not be that powerful it's powerful when you start combining it with rational zeros theorem when you start finding zeros it'll tell you how many are left or maybe it'll tell you there's no positives or no negatives and that's very important because we can eliminate checking checking values that would not be x-intercepts anyway and so that's what we do then we change the signs of our odd exponents why because you're going to evaluate for negative x all it does is change the sign of your odd exponent terms and do the same thing only this time it's going to tell you the possible number of negative x-intercepts that's what the decart's rule of signs basically does so we're going to get right into it so what we're going to do we're going to put your polynomial in order every time now if we're going to count number of sign changes that's very important you want to make sure they're in order we do that anyway for basically everything we do but it's super important here so make sure your polynomial is in order before you start any of this stuff then we're going to count the number of sign changes from left to right so let's look at our first example from well first we check order order means your exponents are decreasing until you have a constant if you have a constant it should be a last so seven three two zero that's fantastic that's what we want then we count the number of sign changes from left to right so we go okay well what is what does that mean you look at your signs so i gave you starting with a negative so that you can see that that is a signed term if that negative wasn't there we would consider that to be a positive and we might even write a little plus in front so that you can see what's going on so this is a negative that is a plus a minus and a plus so as you're counting from left to right you say okay that's a negative we have not started really counting changes yet because you start somewhere so we say that's a negative what's the next sign is it the same or we can say is it is it could it be written as a negative or is it a positive or a plus so we say that's a negative that's a plus this counts as a sign change you go okay think of this as negative or minus think of this as positive or plus this would be negative two positive that is a sign change one positive to negative that's two negative to positive that's three there are three sign changes here one two and three so here's what we're gonna say we go right there are three sign changes what that means is that in this polynomial if you were to graph it or you were to solve it you were going to have either three that's what this says right here it's very wordy now when you read the first time you have decimate intentional um you're going to have this number of sign changes or an even number less than that amount what does that mean even numbers are two or four or six so all you really do is you count the number of sign changes hey there's three you could potentially have three sign changes or keep subtracting two from this number until you hit either one or zero and then stop and you will have a list of the number of positive x intercepts you could get so we said all right and i know that this can be confusing the first time you hear it um so i'm going to kind of repeat myself several times in slightly different ways so that it clicks in your head put it in order we got it count the sign changes that's the most important thing besides interpretation so okay once i change two sine changes three sign changes you write that number down that number that we write down represents the number of positive x-intercepts or any even number less than that represents the number of positive x-intercepts so there could be three positive x-intercepts if you remember this is the x-axis and this is the y-axis this would be considered the positive x-axis and the negative portion of the x-axis what this says is there will be three or one positive x-intercept it's either going to cross or bounce one time or three times not two not zero one three or one now how to where to get the one from so there will be three or one positive x-intercepts where do i get the one from that's where this comes in right here that or an even number less than this so you write down the number of sign changes like three you go okay start subtracting two from that two is an even number and every multiple of two is an even number so you go okay if i have three sign changes there's three or subtract two one positive x-intercept let's say you started with seven if you had seven sign changes you go okay there there are either seven positive x intercepts or five take away two or three take away two or one that's the potential number of positive x-intercepts that we would have now it's not going to be all of those it's going to be one of those either seven or five or three or one what if you had like six like six sign changes well you'd have either 6 positive x intercepts or take away 2 4 or take away 2 2 or take away 2 0 so you come up with sort of a list of how many positive x intercepts you could get so count the number sign change is three write that number down and just subtract two until you get down to one or zero depending whether you have an odd number of um sign changes or even number sign changes so what this says is that we can either intersect the x-axis on the positive portion of it one time or three times three times or one time that's it now here's why that's important we know for sure that we're going to have at least one positive x-intercept so when we go check numbers uh in the next video i'm like what numbers are going to work we would want to include positive values because you are going to have one this is why we can't get to zero this is why we don't put zero up here because one minus two is it surpasses zero you can't just subtract one and go oh it's three or two or one or zero you're going to have either three or one right that's that's your guarantee you're gonna have either three or one positive x intercepts you're gonna have at least one of them possibly three of them no more than three no less than one and you're not going to have two so it's one or the other so you would want to include those because you know you're going to hit somewhere over here at least one time possibly three times but that's the only options for you now a common question is why in the world do you subtract two why why two or four um what that has to do with is irreducible quadratics so irreducible quadratics like x squared plus 25 you cannot factor that that does not give you any additional x intercepts but what it does is subtracts from your your degree so if you remember this and you do need to know this your degree represents the total number of x-intercepts you could possibly have so this says you could potentially have seven x-intercepts are you going to have that many not necessarily why well because irreducible quadratics give you complex zeros but no x-intercepts they do things like they create these these local maxima and minima is somewhere above the x-axis where it doesn't cause an intersection or below the x-axis and so what that does is this counts for if this is a factor up here i don't even know but what this would do is this would take away two from your degree if you start factoring it but give you no x intercepts and for that reason that's that's basically the reason why you subtract two from this number sign changes because if you're going to miss one x-intercept you're going to miss two at a time you're never going to just miss one x intercept at a time because of those irreducible quadratics that's why we subtract two from the number of sign changes i hope that makes sense i might mention that one more time as we go through so all right i'll run down one more time put in order we gotta count the sign changes cool you're gonna have that many or two less than that as and you write the whole list so three or one positive x-intercepts then what we do is what we we evaluate for negative x kind of like evaluating for an even or odd function we say all right what about f of negative x now some people get really confused on this you know i'm really bad at evaluating i'm going to give you a trick for this don't even worry about it don't even evaluate don't even plug in negative x just change the signs of your odd powered terms and here's why if you evaluate negative x into an even negative anything squared gives you a positive it's not going to change that sign constants never change sign you can't you can't evaluate that but odds when you plug in a negative there it will change the sum so if i plug in negative x to x cubed it'll give me negative x cubed and i'll change that sign if i plug in negative x to x to the seventh power that'll give me negative x to the seventh power and we'll change that sign so how to evaluate this easily just change your odd not your even not your constants your odd powered terms change the sign in front of them so if i want to evaluate f of negative x i'm going to this is an odd powered term i'm going to change this to positive x to the 7 4x to the 7th this is an odd power term i'm going to change it to minus x cubed i won't change this even power term because even powers don't change signs when you plug into positive or negative they're even i'm not going to change my constant because there's nothing to evaluate there and so i just look at it change my odd power terms the signs of those odd power terms and then i do the same thing but what we're going to get here is we're going to get the number of potential negative x intercepts so positive cool gives you a number positive that's pretty convenient change the sign of your odd power terms that's evaluating for negative x and then do the same thing the number of sign changes here are and this is what i was saying earlier maybe write a little plus for the positive that way you can see the sign change that's a positive or we can think plus that's a minus but we can think negative the sign change positive 2 negative oh that's 1 negative 2 negative that does not change so positive to negative that's 1 negative to negative that did not change do not count that negative to positive that's two there are two side changes here what does that mean because we evaluated for this negative x and we repeated this we counted from left to right we said all right there are two sign changes then this number represents the number of negative x intercepts or an even a number less than that will represent your negative x intercept so here's what this says it says if i have two sign changes after evaluating negative x i will have either two or so start subtracting two and get two lists down to either one or zero i will have either two or zero two minus two is zero two or zero negative x intercepts that's it that's all we can possibly have now why am i teaching this to you well because if you use some beautiful thinking this can really help you later i want you to think about this what's the degree of your polynomial right now you should look up finger that's seven that says potentially the most we could have are seven x-intercepts that's it seven x-intercepts are we gonna have that many no and i guarantee it here's why we did the cartoon assigns and it says are positive x-intercepts there's either three of them or one of them notice how we subtracted two to get that list so we stopped at one because you can't subtract two past that so we have either three or one positive x-intercepts we change the sign over power terms and essentially evaluating negative x and we did it again we said okay there's either two or zero negative x intercepts you are either going to have positives or negatives you can't factor out an x and so there's no um there's no zero there's no x intercept right at zero that doesn't that's not going to work so you either have three or one over here two or zero over here you could potentially have no x-intercepts and negative x-intercepts none of them but you definitely don't have seven look at this at most you could have three positive and two negative that's only five that's only five so if our degree's seven and we say we can have at most five then what's the other two the other two something like x squared plus twenty-five it will give you an irreducible quadratic that does not give you x-intercepts that's valuable to know so we know that when we factor this when we get down to factoring that one we're going to end with at least one irreducible quadratic again the irreducible quadratic because that is a power two that starts taking away two at a time from your degree and the same thing would happen two at a time from your positive and or your negative x-intercepts that's why you subtract two to get this list it sounds really weird to say subtract some even number less than that well what they mean is yeah subtract two then subtract two again what do you subtract four subtract two then two then two would you subtract six that's why it says an even number it basically what it does it says just give me a list start with the number sign changes give me a list by subtracting two until you get to one or zero like this or that and then you're done this is the potential of positive x-intercepts through one or potential of negative x-intercepts two or zero it also says one more thing if you find a negative x-intercept you know for sure that you have to have another one because you're either zero or two so if you find one of them there's gonna be another one because you know you have to have zero or two you can't find one they go i have zero doesn't make sense you can't find one ego i guess i have one it was wrong no no it's going to be either zero or two so if you find one negative x intercept there is going to be another one there according to at least this polynomial so that's the main idea that's the cultural science as we move forward to the next section i'm going to be refreshing your memory on this we're going to do it every single time someone say hey remember to cultural science let's make this easier let's see what we could potentially have i'm also going to refresh your memory that in the last video that you watched we had those two examples and i hope that you remember uh what we got out of them you might pause and go back and just kind of think about uh what those what those were when we uh when we checked started checking with long division and synthetic division on what we got out of them so i'm going to refresh your memory as we go through but this is going to be interesting because i'll put this in the into play for you so let's go ahead and let's practice the cartoon sign two more times just on these last two and we're going to call it good so g of x hopefully you see what's wrong with this before you start checking the cartridge signs or anything that i tell you with polynomials you have to have it in border you see if we go right from here go oh hey yeah this is a negative that's a positive that's 1 that doesn't change two sign changes hey there's two sign changes that means i would have remember i had not evaluated negative x i would have two or zero positive x intercepts that's wrong why well because this is not an order and in order might change some signs around and so when we put this in order when we put that in order it is different so let's think through everything i want you to know about polynomials at this point number one they should be in order number two uh well when you look at the degree that's like the first thing we look for is the leading term which has your degree has your end behavior has a lot of stuff in it that we've talked about already but your degree also says there will be at most three x-intercepts total i need you to get that that the degree gives you the maximum number of x-intercepts so when i say hey three this will have at most three x-intercepts is it gonna have all three i don't you don't know without doing a little bit of work and we're gonna do that work right now but the cultural signs will answer that question for us and it's pretty cool so this will have at most three x-intercepts what if it doesn't have three then pairs of two will be wrapped up in irreducible quadratics and pairs of two will be complex solutions we're going to talk about exactly why that is when we get two complex solutions let's say why do they come in pairs why do they come in conjugate pairs as do the quadratic formula and you have plus or minus and negative inside of a square root well then you get the same value but plus and a minus you're going to get a conjugate pair they always come in twos let's say that one more time this degree tells you the maximum number of x intercepts it tells you the total number of solutions if you have complex numbers so we could potentially have three x intercepts if we don't have three x intercepts then we will have one x intercept they will have they will be in pairs of twos if we don't have them so let's go ahead and let's let's go through our rule signs so i'm going to put a little plus here so you can find that i start with a positive positive to negative that's one sign change negative to positive that's two sine changes positive to negative that's three sine changes what that means for us is that we are going to have three x-intercepts on the positive side of the x-axis or subtract two from that number create a list that goes down to one or zero we'll have three positive x-intercepts or one positive x-intercepts nothing else those are the only two options that you have here so over here we either hit it once or we hit it three times no two no zero we know for sure that we're going to have a positive x-intercept at least one and so what we do in the next video is we would start checking positive numbers see which one works um if you remember we did that actually and we plugged in i think it was positive one we said uh two minus one is one one plus two is three three minus three is zero oh yeah hey one worked one one is a positive x-intercept and we said that was a zero therefore gave us a factor and we did long division on that and i taught you synthetic division on that so we knew we had one positive x-intercept now what we got out of that well you know i'm won't ruin suspense if you if you watch it back what we got out of that was in not gonna ruin this events it was an irreducible quadratic when we got that if you take that and you do synthetic division and just divide out one uh use one as your x-intercept what you're going to get is an irreducible quadratic wait a minute do irreducible quadratics give you x-intercepts no that's the whole point of subtracting two it was an irreducible quadratic that gave you no more x-intercepts so we found one positive x-intercept what we did is we divided it and we found an irreducible quadratic that had no other x-intercepts so you can't have 3 here 3 is the maximum but we got an irreducible quadratic that was fascinating now let's go ahead and finish this thing off if we had evaluated g of negative x what we would do is we'd change our odd powered terms change the sign of those things so we're going to have negative 2x cubed we leave the x squared alone minus 2x we leave the constant alone and you'll please think about a second negative negative negative how many sign changes do you have none zero sign changes now this is where i think the cartoon of science is very powerful this is my opinion this is where it's most powerful if you have no sign changes then that tells you something huge that tells you in this case because remember we're on negative x here this is talking about negative x-intercepts you are going to have how many none not potentially two not potentially four none you will have zero negative x intercepts hundred percent guaranteed now if you're curious as to why that's so important in the next video you're going to be learning something called the rational zeros theorem where i tell you how to find a list of numbers that are potentially or that contain all of your rational zeros well um if you know that you have no negative x-intercepts don't check negatives that's huge that saves you half of the work that you would otherwise do because you got to check negative and positive normally if you know you don't have negative x intercepts you eliminate half your list of numbers to check that's fantastic that saves you so much time because you're just going to be focused on the positives so wrapping this whole thing up with this example we put in order we checked our sign changes you say you have three or one positive x intercepts you change your odd power terms by evaluating negative x and you have zero side changes this says you will have no negative x intercepts so you either touch once or three times here you are not going to cross over here that's that's good to know and then you start dividing you all right when again when we divided out that that one or that x minus one is the factor we got an irreducible quadratic what that means is that we are not going to have any more than one positive x intercept we found our one right it was one but when you divide that out and get an irreducible quadratic it says well you can't have you can't go to three you can't have two that irreducible quadratic is why this happens while you go you're either gonna have three or one because that irreducible quadratic while it took two away from your degree if you were to divide it it doesn't yield any more x-intercepts that's pretty interesting i hope that that makes sense to you it's very powerful and as we continue you're going to see this thing play out right now it's just kind of a introduction on how it works and you're going to see it in the next video let's do the last one so h of x is 3x to the sixth plus 82 x to the third plus 27. it's in order that's really good and so the first thing we do with the cartridge rule of science is we count the sign changes the way that it is and that will represent a list of positive x-intercepts you go wait wait a minute uh that's a positive that's a positive that's a positive there are no positive x-intercepts what that means is that we have sorry no sign changes that means we have zero positive x intercepts none this graph guaranteed will not intersect the positive half of the x-axis then what we do is we we evaluate h of negative x essentially that leaves your even power terms and your constant terms alone it changes your odd power terms due to the reasons we already talked about so i keep my positive 3x to the sixth that's an even power term i change my 82x to the third i change the sign because that's an odd power term so even doesn't change odd does change constant was plus 27 i'll leave it constants do not change and so we now check our sign changes again uh positive to negative that's one sign change negative to positive that's two sign changes now what's it mean i hope you were listening to the whole video i gave you a lot of explanation about why this stuff works how it works i don't just want you to be able to do it i want you to understand it once you understand the interplay between irreducible quadratics the degree and why we subtract two i want you to get that so two side changes means we will have either two or subtract two from that number until you get down to one or zero so two minus two is zero two or zero negative x intercepts now if you remember back to the previous video we evaluated negative three negative three was an x-intercept remember that negative 3 if you don't maybe go back and look at your notes look at the last video negative 3 worked we we factored out x plus 3 remember at negative 3 would give us x plus 3 as a factor or synthetic division we used that negative three and we got another another polynomial it was a power five it was a degree five polynomial that we got out of that we know for sure that odd poly polynomials have to cross don't they they have to somewhere at least once so let's wrap this whole thing up this last thing i'm going to talk about that's a degree 6. it potentially has 6 x intercepts that's the most it could have does it have six of them well no this has zero positive this has two or zero negative so the most it could have is two now what did we learn in the last video we learned that negative 3 is an x-intercept here so wait a second we found an x-intercept that was negative so it's not zero therefore it has to have two exactly two did you get that if we found one negative three then it can't be that one it's got to be this one there will have to be another x-intercept um on this besides the negative three and we we kind of sort of knew that because we ended with a degree five polynomial if you factor out x plus three from here maybe try this on your own synthetic division or something then you're going to get an x to the fifth uh 3x to the fifth something something something something well that is still odd that means it would have another x-intercept and so that bears this out no positives we found one negative x-intercept negative three we know there's another the degree five says that but after we find it we're going to be done why because there's no positives and there was at most two negatives maybe listen to that that last explanation this a couple times until the interplay between degree most number of x-intercepts zero positives and zero or two negatives and what we found makes sense we found negative three that's a negative x-intercept that means you can't have zero you have to have two we also if you divide it out we get x to the fifth power what that means is that we would have at least one more x-intercept because that's an odd it has to cross and then that would say yeah that's your other one but after that you're done there's no zeros and there are no more negatives than the two that you would find that's how the cultural sign is going to work for us um you we're going to use this a lot as we go go forward into the next video every every example that i do i'm going to reference this so you're going to start seeing it as we as we uh work it out as we actually do the long division or synthetic division so i hope it makes sense uh maybe watch the last section a couple times until you really get that to click if it hasn't already if it has awesome and i will see you for the next video 

Transcript for: How to Use the Rational Zeros Theorem (Precalculus - College Algebra 34)
welcome to another video i hope that you are ready to learn one of the most powerful powerful things that i teach you in in this course uh which is the rational zeros theorem while i won't be going over a proof of the rational zeros theorem uh man this stuff is so useful it's kind of like a culmination of the last several videos where we put decarteural science we put long division of polynomials or synthetic division we put degree we put not necessarily rational number of turning points but we put the multiplicity together this idea of how to factor things when you don't have a general form it is extremely powerful so i'm going to talk a lot about factoring i'm going to talk about how the rational zeros theorem works uh what you do with it how it can help you and then we'll be doing a lot of synthetic division i'm not going to show you long division any longer i said i would do it every time for the video that we were in but at this point i'm going to do synthetic division when we're factoring out linears i will refresh your memory from time to time on long division polynomials because we'll need it later but i'll show you i'll show you some big division time and time again because it's so much faster and you're going to really appreciate it as we're going through this so let's get right into it what are you supposed to learn with this what you're supposed to learn with the rational zeros theorem is that if you know your coefficients from an ordered polynomial where you have a leading term and you have a constant term you can come up with a list of all the possible rational x-intercepts for that function and that is incredible now there's a couple pros and just a few cons that you have had to deal with number one the pros the pros are that this is going to give you factors without you knowing how to factor it that's awesome because factor means you can divide by it and so we can start dividing our function by factors so that we can factor the function and therefore graph it find x-intercepts do a lot of the things with it that's the major pro the cons are is that it can be quite tedious because you have a list of numbers it can be like 30 numbers long and you don't know what your x-intercepts are but they're on the list somewhere and so there's a lot of guessing and checking of course on this video this is going to be a long video firstly but on this video i'm going to know what those those zeroes are so it's going to seem like it's easier than it is because i'm not going to be checking 10 numbers before i get to one and that could potentially be the case uh the other drawback of the con is that this only gives you a list of possible rational zeros this does not give you square roots like radical zeros it doesn't give that to you so or complex zeros so if you have any complex zeros this list is not going to contain it if you have a zero like hey you cross out the square root of five this list is not going to contain it so those are the drawbacks but it's a great starting spot for us it's very very useful very very important um the other thing that i want to mention right before we get going is that oh my goodness remember your goals your goals here are to factor this polynomial that's the goal that's what we'll be getting to we started with factory polynomials we said oh multiplicity this multiplicity that we know end behavior we know how to graph it that's great but what if it's not factored that was the main question do you remember like that was the main question like what if it's not factored that's what we're answering so if your main goal is to factor this polynomial and i'm giving you a great technique for it if that's your main goal you should always try to factor this first i get this question a lot like well wait a minute what if i don't have a constant ha this technique doesn't work then well you're right because if you don't have a constant then you end with x and that means you automatically have a c f and you can factor out x therefore you should always always try to factor out x first every single time or factor something first or grouping or some other factor technique that's your goal your goal here is to get a factored polynomial completely factored so that you can find x-intercepts so that you can graph it with multiplicity and behavior and things that i've talked about already that's your goal so that's your goal try to factor first so here's the way the rational zeros theorem works firstly we got an ordered polynomial that's always an important thing and then we're going to do is we're going to find the factors of your constant term remember you should have one if you don't have one then you can factor it and your resultant polynomial that you get in parentheses that will have one and then you treat that as what you're dealing with so this works after you factor something that there's a correlator there if you factor out like a linear factor the rest of your polynomial can be redone with this that's pretty cool so we're always going to try factoring first we have an ordered polynomial find the factors of your constant that's it find the factors of your leading coefficient that's it and make a list of possible fractions from that your constant factors over your leading coefficient factors that's basically what this says in a nutshell here is a little more specifically if you have your your polynomial in order you have a constant uh that constant term will be last we typically call the the factors of the constant term this letter p why i don't know just sounded cool i guess so we we uh we write out that list of factors of our constants and then we have a leading coefficient you have to have one of those and you're going to find the factors of that leading coefficient remember a sub n just means the lead coefficient a sub 0 is just your constant then we typically call that list of factors q and then we say all right we've got this whole long list of numbers for p we have hopefully less numbers for q and then we take every sort of permutation of p divided by q so one divided by one one divided by whatever it is and we come up with this a list of this list of numbers and this list of numbers of p over q both positive and negative is a list of all the possible rational zeros that's basically it so let's go ahead and let's start i'm gonna go slowly through the first one i'm gonna remember why it's important to factor for the second one and then i'll have two more examples one of which uh both of which are long the last one i'm gonna do two different ways so you see there's sort of not multiple outcomes but multiple looks for an outcome every polynomial is uniquely factorable over linears and irreducible quadratics so there's no hey i got a different answer it might look a little different and i'll explain that when we get there so let's take a look at it uh f of x is 2x cubed plus 11x squared minus 7x minus 6 and you go all right the first thing i want to check is just a general overview of a couple things that i want you to know number one is it in order answers yeah that's an order could you tell me what the degree is you should be able to you should say yeah the degree's three okay cool could you tell me the end behavior could you tell me because the leading term is 2x to the third that that's an ah that's an odd power function that's positive it should look like that could you tell me your y-intercept y-intercept if you plug in zero would just be negative 6 your constant so we should have those things in the back of our head this is odd now what's that mean that means that you have to cross the x axis at least one time have to cross it not just bounce it you have to cross it at least one time that's interesting because odds have to end like this or like that you're going to have to cross it the next thing we'd say is that because the degree is 3 i will have at most 3 x-intercepts not 2 well sorry i could have two but not four not five i have at most three x intercepts that's it now i will have three solutions if i include complex numbers but at most three x-intercepts i don't have to have all three but at most three so i want to check those things the last thing i want to check before we get into rational zeros theorem is a way to save us work it's called the descartes rule of science and we studied it in the last video i do that every time because it can save us work is it imperative i said that last video that it's not necessarily imperative to do but if you want to save a lot of time it's very helpful so i start thinking about it the way it is in order the number of sign changes so this is positive positive to positive is not a sign change positive to negative is one sign change negative to negative is not a sign change there is only one sign change in this polynomial i hope that you see that there's only one sign change descartes rule of sign says that i am going to have exactly one positive x intercept had it been like five sign changes i'd write well i could have five positive x intercepts or three i subscribed to or one positive x intercept that that list was talked about in the last video so i would have five or three or one but that's the only options since i have only one sign change i can't subtract 2 from that that means that that's it that's the only positive x-intercept that i'm going to get and there's going to be one of them so there's one positive x-intercept 100 guarantee that's going to be there then i go through the process of evaluating for negative x again this is just the car to assign in motion what that lets us do is just change the the signs of your odd power terms so negative 2x cubed leave your evens alone 11x squared plus 7x leave your constants alone so change your odds leave your evens change your odds leave your constants and then we do the same thing how many sign changes negative to a positive is one positive to a positive is not a change positive negative is two there are two sign changes here what that means is that i will have either two or zero negative x-intercepts now let's see how this works out does it make sense with your degree i'm going to take a look at it does it make sense with your degree let's take a look how many can i possibly have for positives oh wait i'm going to have one how many could i possibly have for negatives either zero or two both of those would work one plus two is three that's the max one plus zero is one hey that's under our degree of three that actually makes sense now what we're going to do we're going to come up with our list and we're going to start finding out what our potential x-intercepts are so let's go ahead and do that here's the whole whole process do not do it from here it doesn't really you can it's not going to make a difference but do it from up here i want to always be looking at our original function we're doing most of this stuff so our original function says our constant term our a sub 0 is negative 6. let's find all the factors for a sub 0. so basically 4 negative 6. now does it matter if you have negative 6 or positive 6 no you're going to get the same list of numbers why well because if i tell you 6 both 1 and negative 1 divide that what else divides 6 well we know they come in in pairs so 1 times 6 gives us 6. think of the next number is 2 a factor of 6. yes and because we can divide six by two and get three three is also a factor of six that's the only factors that we have for six uh plus and minus one plus or minus two positive negative three positive negative six you go well one i know the constant's negative six it doesn't matter one still divides negative six and negative one also divides negative six so the signs aren't that important that's why it doesn't matter which one you use but we always just wanna make sure we're going back to the original so 6 or negative 6 does not matter you get the same list of numbers now how about uh how would our leading coefficient that would be 2. so this stands for your p and this stands for your q that's what that is if you're going out of a textbook they oftentimes will call the factors of your constant p and the factors of your leading coefficient q and then you make your list of p's over q's mind your p and q's my dad you should always say that to me i have no idea what that meant i guess i do now makes sense get your p's in order get your keys in order now for two this is positive two but it doesn't really matter because the factors are both positive and negative so what divides two well only one or two those are all the factors of negative six all the factors of positive two p and q and now we make our lists so our p over q the list of all the possible uh rational zeros rational means integer or whole numbers or well positive negative whole numbers or fractions that's what rationals mean so they wouldn't include square roots there are no square roots up there it wouldn't include complex there's not complex up there it's just positive negative whole numbers or fractions so let's go ahead and write it here's the way that we do this we start taking a combination of every p divided by every q so one divided by one two divided by one three divided by one and six divided by one that will give us a list of the first four uh possible numbers now when you see positives and negatives divided by positive negatives and that can be a little confused in our heads like wow what do i put just remember that a positive divided by positive is a positive as is a negative divided by negative and a positive divided by negative or a negative divided by a positive is negative so you don't need like four different signs just understand that this divided by this is either going to be positive or negative one two dividing positive negative two divided by positive negative one is either going to be positive or negative two and the same thing for three and the same thing for six i often get asked this question um are you always going to get just a repeat of this list down here the answer is yes because you're always going to have one as a factor for any number aren't you always one divides every number so one divides every leading coefficient so all of this list gets divided by one and basically just repeats where it gets a little bit more challenging is if you have a coefficient that's not one you'll have additional factors and this is where our fractions come in so we're going to start taking remember it's p over q one over two two over two three over two and six over two so we divide all of that so we took one divided by two two divided by two three divided by two and six divided by two if you um if you have a long a long list of factors this can get really tedious the way that i check my work is i look at how many factors i have so here's four here's two four times two is eight one two three four five six seven eight i haven't missed any so i take every combination every permutation of p divided by q and then we simplify them and we're going to get a little bit more of a truncated list because you oftentimes have some that are repeated for instance 2 divided by 2 is 1. we already have 1. 6 divided by 2 is 3. you already have 3 so you don't need to repeat that all we get is this positive negative one two three six one half and three halves what this is is a list of 12 numbers 1 and negative 1 2 and negative 2 3 negative 3 6 negative 6 and so forth and so on that contains all of the rational zeros if you have any and that is the biggest issue that students kind of get confused on they go that's all my zeros no that's a list that contains your zeros how many zeros could you possibly have in the real number system three that's it that's your degree you can only have at most three at most three not twelve that's just a list of what they are so if we know nothing about our function this gives us what is called a starting place so the starting place where you check to see if you have zeros or not so here's the process going forward and it is tedious i'm not lying to you about it and i don't want to sugarcoat it that it's easy it's not here's the process that i go through if i'm trying to find zeros the first thing i do is i check my departure real signs why because my decontroller signs might eliminate some positives or negatives so i have one positive i gotta keep the positives i have two or zero negatives okay i could have two negative x-intercepts that means that i can't eliminate anything from this list right now so then i go and i start checking values i see what which of these actually creates a zero in my function remember it's this one it's not this one check this one so i don't really want to be looking at this anymore i just want to be looking at that that's why i always teach hey go back to your original focus on doing that practice that that way you don't make a mistake and start putting values into your your negative x evaluated function so we're going to start with well what would you start with i'd start with one and if one does not evaluate and give me zero then it's not an x intercept i don't want to mess with that i just check negative one after that then i check two then negative two then three to the negative three and then six then negative six i won't check four it's not in my list or fives on my list then i'd start going to my fractions because often times especially out of textbooks um it's usually one or negative one if it's not it's some it's typically a whole number uh an integer sorry an integer a whole number integer and then you you rarely get to fractions hopefully if you do then you spend a lot of time doing that and it's kind of frustrating so that's the way that we go through this so i'm going to start by evaluating one remember the whole principle of the is called the remainder theorem and the factor theorem basically if you plug in a number and it gives you zero it's an x intercept and it creates a factor that's the whole point so we're gonna start with the easiest numbers to plug in let's start with one so i'm gonna evaluate f of one is one always going to be on your list yes yes it is because you always have a constant that's divisible by one and a coefficient that's divisible by one so one is always on your list unless it says you have no positive x intercepts and then negative one would be on your list one of those is going to be under this so let's evaluate if i plug in negative oh sorry if i plug in positive one let's see uh this would be two so two plus eleven is thirteen thirteen minus seven minus six is zero oh hey we win we win because it's convenient because they gave you an easy problem this is zero and here's what this says it says x equals one is an x-intercept that's fantastic don't check the rest of them use this one because 95 of the time what happens is if you factor out x minus 1 if you do that well then what that does is creates another polynomial that's typically factorable if not you might have to do this one more time but then what's left is almost certainly factorable like oh nearly all the examples that we work with because otherwise this takes forever to do this is too much guessing and checking so there's a lot i really want to say about this as we go through and am i going to forget about it but i'm going to sort of give you pieces of information as we go through that i really need you to glean i i need you to get that this list not all of these are x intercepts we start with the easy ones to plug in like positive one and we evaluate that and see if it equals zero if this equals zero that means that x equals one is an x-intercept it is an x-intercept for sure now pause here's one of the things i need you to get now really focus here i need you to understand this how many positive x-intercepts do we have in the entirety of this function one did we find a positive x intercept yes we found the only one that exists so what's the next numbers you would check after we do our long division if it doesn't factor the rest of time after we do that what would you check not positives not positives because you're not going to have any more that's where the cartoon of science is very important so you go hey i checked one it worked great i only had one positive x-intercept i just found it the rest of the values i would check would be negatives no more positives i don't need to do that i just found it i hope that makes sense to you i really hope that makes sense to you so we have done oh man we have our list we checked one it actually gave us zero if we checked one and it hadn't given us zero we don't ever check positive one again we go into negative one and we see if that gives us zero if that's an x intercept and then if that creates a factor so we evaluated for one it gave us zero x equals 1 is an x intercept therefore x minus 1 is a factor do you remember that if x equals 1 is an x intercept x minus 1 equals 0 that gives us a factor now what do we do with that we either choose to do long division in which case we take this polynomial and divide out x minus 1 or reduce synthetic division i'm going to really push you to synthetic division when you're dividing by linears like we are right now like x to the first power equals a constant do that it's so much faster so i'm going to go over here and i'm going to write out my original polynomial as far as the coefficients are concerned and i'm going to write out the x-intercept that i just found which is positive one the way that synthetic division works if you don't remember you should like two videos ago is you bring down your first coefficient you multiply you multiply correctly and you add you multiply and you add you multiply and you add now if you have checked this correctly and this is an x-intercept this always has to be zero if that's not zero you've either done this wrong or you've done that wrong it has to work so what this does for us is this says okay i've just divided by x to the first power basically or at least a factor that contains x to the first power i've lowered my degree by one so we already knew that x minus one is a factor for sure this positive one would create a factor that's x minus 1. but the quotient is the the the factor that's remaining that's 2x to the second power not third we reduced it by a degree positive means plus 13x and then plus 6 that's what we get now we're not done so here's your options and listen carefully this is the other piece of information i need you to understand you're not done you need to factor this completely into linears or irreducible quadratics not every quadratic is irreducible you spend an entire class in intermediate algebra basically working with quadratics and factoring the heck out of them which means that not every one of them is irreducible that's not irreducible so you have an option here's the appropriate choice as you determine what which option to pick you can either factor or you can use this list of numbers again to keep going on this polynomial so what do i mean by that you'd start by plugging in more numbers now now using everything that you just learned would you start by plugging in 1 again no but not because you found it already because you don't have any more positive x-intercepts listen very carefully this is the next piece of information i need you to get is that if you plug in one and it gave you an x-intercept you have to check to plug that in again because it could work twice wait how that's how we get multiple roots x minus one squared or three times to the third or four times to the fourth that's where multiplicity comes from is repeated roots and so you have to check it again you don't cross off your list the only time you ever cross a number off your list is one of two cases number one you exhaust your possible x entered positive or negative x intercepts then you cross off positives or negatives or if you try a number once and it doesn't work it will never work again so if i try one so like let's let's just try one because i know it's not going to work let's try it uh 2 plus 13 plus 6 that's not 0. so i know that x equals 1 is no longer an x-intercept for this part of the that function that means it's not a repeated 0. i will not be getting x minus 1 squared i hope you're following me on that so you have a choice you can either factor or you can start trying other numbers since i've exhausted all my positives i'd start with negatives they'd be like ah negative 1 maybe negative 2 negative 3 negative 6 negative 1 half negative 3 halves and i'd go in that order what's the appropriate choice factoring if you can the list if you can't or quadratic formula if you can't probably in this work factoring then quadratic formula then list that's the way i would do it so i'm going to try to factor this uh 13 and 12 hey that looks like 12 and 1 because that adds a 13 that multiplies to 12. if i use my sort of quick factoring i would divide both by a that would give us 6 over 1 and 1 over 2 and that creates two additional factors for us that's x minus one that's what we found already but then we have one x plus six and two x's plus one that's completely factored that's it now if you're thinking well wait wait a minute what about all these this list of numbers oh does this list of numbers play into this somehow check this out if i set this equal to zero and i solve it this is all of my x-intercepts x would equal one multiplicity one that's across x would equal negative six multiplicity one that's across x would equal let's see if i subtract one and divide by two that's negative one-half that's x equals negative one-half that's multiplicity one that's across wait a second here's x equals one that's on my list here's x equals negative six that's on my list here's x equals negative one half that's on my list here's one positive x intercept right there here's two negative x intercepts right there what here's degree three one two three it all needs to work you should be like math chills on that that's freaking awesome that really is cool all this stuff should work together so the long story i made sure before we go on to the next example here um is put this in order try to factor first if it does you're set you're set if it doesn't it's going to be some work due to cultural sciences see what you're working with have the degree in the back of your head then what you do create your list of potential x-intercepts hopefully you can eliminate some or at least think about what you're going to be doing if you find a positive or negative x-intercept what that means if i find a positive in this case i'm done with the rest of the positives if i find a negative in this case that means i have another one i'd have to find because you can't just have one in this particular case then what you do is once you find one x-intercept you stop you don't check anymore once you find one x-intercept you use that with synthetic division to factor it after that you kind of restart the idea you write it down and you try to factor what's left if you factor what's left you're good to go if this hadn't have worked do you realize what we would have done we would have had to check this because we would have been done with the one if you have to check more numbers you don't check it here again you check it just in this part and you start and you go okay what would i check next i wouldn't check positives unless you didn't use the cultural science and then you'd waste a lot of time i wouldn't check positives i'd check negative one you know what it's not going to work then i check negative two you know what it's not gonna work i check negative three it's not gonna work i check negative six that would be the first one that would work so i'd have to check one two three four numbers before i actually found one that would divide the rest of this polynomial that can be kind of frustrating would i honestly do that no i wouldn't what i would do is i'd factor this first if it didn't factor because it's a quadratic i'd use quadratic formula and then i would determine what my factors would be from that remember this list does not give you radicals quadratic formula will and so that would be a better way to go so i hope that makes sense i hope that i'm starting to put this in this sort of bubble that you understand that is combining the ideas of descartes and degree and factoring and rational zeros theorem and using this stuff because if you can do that together this is so effective uh like really really a lot quicker than not understanding that stuff hope makes sense going to go into the next example okay now i gave you this example for only one reason and it's to point out that my goodness you really should check factoring before you do any of this stuff please your main goal remember your goal your idea behind this is you want to factor stuff like you want to get this factorable so that we can do what we just did which is solve it for our three x intercepts multiplicity one which are all crossy that's great so we're trying to just factor stuff now this is going to give us a lot of information about um a piece of information that i haven't shown you more than twice before so we have this in order it looks good all polynomials should be especially polynomial function polynomial functions we should have in our head that this is an odd degree three odd and it's positive should look like this it should cross the x axis at least one time because it is odd we we could do the cartridge signs and say positive to positive no sign change positive negative one sign change negative to negative no sign change this has exactly one positive x-intercept for sure if we changed our odd power terms we have negative and positive that'd be negative to positive one uh positive positive no positive to negative let's see i lost track i should write it down one no two so this is it's kind of the same exact situation is here we'd have one positive for sure and either zero or two negative x-intercepts let's go ahead and see if that plays out now what i mentioned to you was that you should always try to factor things first here you do have a constant so you can't factor out just an x but look at your coefficient 3 6 negative 15 negative 30 you can factor out three i'm going to say something to you right now that's really important to understand the list of numbers that you get is not dependent on whether you factor or not here's what i mean if you get all the factors of 30 and start dividing by all the factors of 3 you're going to get the same list if you factor out the 3 first and do the list from there this has fewer factors and it's going to give you the same list do that factor if you can first i'm not lying to it every single time this is easier to find a list than that one is why they're smaller they're smaller numbers and that is actually true so that will work for you believe me now the next thing that you would would try is before you can find a list try to factor it why wouldn't we do something like grouping so if we factor out x squared from the first two terms and we factor out minus 5 or negative 5 for the last two terms we do it correctly we get x plus 2 and we get x squared minus 5 and we bring down our 3 this is a factored version of h of x now is it completely factored no now be careful this last thing i really need to talk to you about before we move on and really start getting into rational zeros there are some pretty hectic polynomials this is not completely factory wait a minute that's not a difference of squares that's a quadratic that's an irreducible quadratic because i can't factor it no no it's it is a reducible quadratic because you can factor it had this been x plus five yeah you'd be done that's that's irreducible that's not a difference of squares but there's something i brought up twice before that even if you don't have a perfect square here you can factor this i'm going to show you right now i know that if i gave this to you you all would say yeah you can factor that that's x minus five and x plus five but how did you get it you got it by saying okay what i really do is i take the square root of x and i put it here and i take the square root of 25 and i put it here that's where that comes from and you see oh that's x minus 5 and x plus 5 because the square root of 25 is 5 and so you have plus and minus 5. you do the same thing with things that aren't perfect squares so with x squared minus 5 we're going to repeat this process we're going to say oh hey x squared minus 5 can i treat that like a difference of squares yes x minus the square root of 5 and x plus the square root of 5. and if you want to look at it this is x squared plus x root 5 minus x root 5 and then minus square root of 5 times square root of 5 is 5 minus 5. it's the same exact thing i need you to be able to factor that so this is not your additional quadratic this does give us x-intercepts and this is completely factored how do we know that well they're all linear that's the power 1 power 1 and power one you cannot factor linears any more than a gcf which we've already took care of so you're done so let's see if this beared out to the cartridge rule of signs and then we'll find the list of numbers we're gonna do it anyway just so you can see what i was talking about as far as these not being on it so what are x intercepts well we have by the zero product property three little equations it would say x equals negative two and the square root of five and the negative square root of five wait a second that's one sign change one positive two sine when we did the issue of negative x that was two sine changes that was two or zero here's our one positive x intercept here's our two negative x intercepts interesting now what about the list had you done this by the list that p over q the p's would have been factors of 10 negative 10 but it doesn't really matter so you get 1 and 10 and 2 and 5. for our cues you would just get one that does my factor of one is plus and minus one so basically one over one two over one five over one ten over one gives you this list of numbers again if we had had to check this we'd start with one it wouldn't have worked we would have tried negative one because we knew we had a positive x intercept and we possibly had negatives so you would try your negatives you try one and negative one then you try two then you get to negative two and that would have finally worked then you would have factored that out then you would end up with this this is exactly what you would have had you might have a fraction here but this is exactly what you would have over here you'd have x squared minus 5. now check it out if you try any of these numbers you know what it's not going to work in there why because this list does not contain square roots do you see it we have two x-intercepts that are square roots it's not here it would never will be there that's why it's so important for you to understand how to factor this or to use quadratic formula because your quadratic formula will factor all of the quadratics that you get so if it's reducible quadratic formula if it's not quadratic formula will show you that it's kind of a nice little trick of difference of squares great use it but do not count on this list to give you everything it gives you a starting spot it can give you two starting spots if you have to use it twice that's fine but at some point when you get quadratics at the end then you need something beyond that and that would be factorization like this or quadratic formula i hope that makes sense i hope you see what i'm talking about put in order due to cultural signs but certainly try to factor it's going to save you a ton of time like it did right here and that factoring is uh much more relevant when our list is exhausted and we can't we can't use it for anything else so i'm going to come back with a few more examples we're going to start getting into it it's going to take a little while but i'm gonna show you um some pretty cool stuff all right here we go uh that's a long problem and it's gonna take us a while uh there's something you probably know about me that i do not like to shy away from the hard problems why because that happened to me when i was going through school i'd have these these professors who would just give the idea and a really easy problem to go i'm gonna do it i'd run that and go this doesn't look anything like what we did in class and it was very frustrating so i sometimes get comments like your videos are too long i understand that but i'm also trying to get you to see the main things and and not shy away from doing hard stuff so that you are able to and you gain some confidence in it so that you can because you can you are able to do this stuff it's not all that bad but you do need to see it right in order to be able to uh to learn from it so here it is this is the second longest example that we're probably going to do in this class because it takes a long time to do we're going to walk through everything like descartes will assign how it works with this example why we would use it here we're going to come with our list of numbers because i cannot factor that neither can you because it's degree five and there's no general way to do it we need to know an x-intercept in order to factor them so we'll talk about that uh we're going to go through and uh and use synthetic division twice and the the final quotient that we get there is going to be factorable so we're going to do everything that i'd expect you to be able to do like on a test or something so let's take a look g of x the first thing to check is is it order and it is looks really good in your head you'd say that's a degree five that's a positive degree five that's an odd power function the end behavior looks like this and you are going to cross the x-axis because all odds with at least a power function leading term of 5 is going to have degree 5 is going to have that so we think this is degree 5 it's odd looks like this it's gonna cross at least one time next thing we'd say is that is degree five i can have at most five x intercepts at most i will have no more than that do i have to have all five no those things should run in your head every time you interact with one of these problems the next thing we would try to do is we would try to factor it so we'd say hey is there a gcf nope uh is there like an x or a number i could factor out no can i use grouping now there's too many terms there's uh one two three four six terms i can only group four terms can i do quadratic formula or no it's not quadratic so we're out of options the only thing we can do at this point is find an x-intercept so the way we start that is with descartes rule of signs to see what our list of numbers uh or well to see how we can use our listed list of numbers appropriately that we're about to get so to cartridge the signs we start by just counting the number of sign changes let's see one two three four there's five sign changes what that means is there will be five four three four one x positive x intercepts five or three or one y pairs of two or why subtract two well because complex solutions from irreducible quadratics always come in pairs always so um if i have one complex i have another if i have an irreducible quadratic that's a power two so we would have five x-intercepts positive x-intercepts if we have no negatives and no irreducible quadratic factors we have all five but what if we have an irreducible quadratic well then we'd have three and then what if we had another one then we'd have one that's it so we know there's at least one positive there could be three that could be five positive x-intercepts now we're going to evaluate this for negative x essentially what that does just change the signs of your odd power terms don't change the evens don't change the constants so negative don't change the evens minus 19x cubed don't change evens minus 60x don't change the constants and do the same thing so how many sine chains do we have uh no no no no zero zero sign changes when you evaluated for negative x that means there are zero negative x intercepts so if i don't have positives i don't have the x-intercepts that also means one more thing when we do the list of rational potential rational zeros that we get we don't have to do any negatives yay why because you know there's not any that's why descartes will assign is very important because that eliminates half of your list of numbers that's fantastic that's going to save you so much time so now we do is we take our constant from our original we don't have to look at this anymore we don't really want it we're going to take our constant and our leading coefficient that's 36 don't even worry about the negative it doesn't really matter as far as finding your factors you're going to pick positive factors anyway right because you don't have any negatives so you're just going to pick positive factors of 36 and 1. so our p is 1 and 36 2 and 18 3 and 12 ran out of space four and nine and then six one thirty six two and eighteen three and twelve uh all of those pairs multiply 36 and then six is the last 6 times 6 we want to list it twice why i'm not including negatives here is because the cultural signs told us we will have no negative x-intercepts we don't have to worry about it the negative divided by negative if you thought about that would give you positive anyway as far as our q well that's coming from one we don't need the positive or negative again for the same reason but our coefficient's one there's only one factor one it's one so our list of p's over q is just this list of numbers again it's just that list of numbers again so we have 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and 36 for the last time this is all these are all the potential rational x-intercepts that we could have for that function now we already know there's at most five of them and they'd all be positive so there's at most five or maybe three or one positive x-intercept that would be on this list why do we have negatives it says we don't have any so we don't check things that we don't have why do that that's a waste of time that's why the cartoon signs is used for for that and the other reason that if you had one you know you don't check them again if you had one or three and you found two you'd have another one so that that's why we do it to to guide where we focus our attention that's what it's mainly used for now we all obviously know that not all these work because we have at most five so that's that's something interesting to know as well so where do we start once we've done all of this stuff and we have our potential list of numbers no natives don't have any start with one and just plug it in see if it works so let's evaluate let's evaluate g of 1. so when we evaluate g of 1 we plug it into this so we evaluate it there one minus seven let's see that's uh that's negative six plus 19 is 13 minus 37 is negative 24 plus 60 is 36 36 minus 36 is zero hey look it works zero now what's that mean what that mean and by the way uh lots of teachers i've seen make it so that's either one or negative one and at most like two or three something like that rarely do you get to 36 uh so just keep that in mind check the small numbers it's probably going to be one of the first couple that's not you had to cheat at your test uh so anyway what that means is that if i evaluated for x equals one and x equals one equals zero when i evaluate it that means x equals one is an x-intercept this graph is going to hit x equals one on the x-axis hey that's positive look at that it works we have no negatives anyway it's gotta be what that also means is that x minus one because x equals one would yield x minus one equals zero x minus one is a factor so now you have a choice to make you have to divide you have no other way to factor besides using long division of this polynomial that point by that factor or doing synthetic division which gives us the same result so you pick whichever one is fine it doesn't really matter i'm going to do synthetic because it's way faster and because we're dealing with linears for quadratics we have to do long division i'll refer to that when we get there but for right now man let's do synthetic division so synthetic division takes this polynomial as far as the coefficients are concerned and and uses one not negative one that's a real big point of confusion for a lot of students with long division you use the whole factor x minus one with synthetic you use one the x-intercept and one so we bring down the first coefficient we multiply and we add we multiply and we add we multiply and we add we multiply and we add we multiply and we add and that last value is your remainder you must end with a remainder of zero or you have made a mistake somewhere either that's not an x-intercept you messed up in your evaluation or you did that wrong probably the evaluation because sometimes it can get pretty tricky especially when you're not just plugging in one but like negative one-half that can happen a lot so what's that mean what that means is that this right here represents the quotient upon division by this factor of that polynomial in other words it says that we already knew that we got one factor x minus one by the way i'm about to rewrite this polynomial as a semi factor form do that every time please do that every time i've seen a lot of teachers even say well now just find another number and do this again well you start losing track of your factors that way so every time we do a division you're going to write the factors so the factor is x minus some of you right now are like no i'm not can't make me you're right i can't make you but it's a good idea so x minus one not x plus one that's why we do it to focus on the factor that we just factored out because i've seen x plus one too many times with other method uh then x to the fourth minus six x to the third plus 13 x squared and so forth and the reason why i want you to do this part of it because you know what's there right you know you know that is so that you can evaluate the rest of your list now listen carefully please the same list that you used for this will work for this don't recreate your list you don't have to that's way too much work you don't have to this is the list for the polynomial it's all of them so don't redo it in fact if you look you're going to get the same exact values don't redo it also make sure you check the number the last number that you were that worked that came out bad but here's what i what i mean by it so if we checked one and it worked you need to check it again over here it very well might work that would give you x minus one to the second power a repeated factor a repeated zero so you you don't just it's not one and done you always check it until it doesn't work now on the on the other hand if you check one and it doesn't work don't bother checking it here because it won't work ever so once you exhaust a number it never comes back into play if you use a number and it gives you a zero it might be another zero it might be a repeated zero so you have to check it so once we factored once we go okay can i factor this with another technique can i do grouping uh no no i can't does it factor in either way no it doesn't refer back to your list and try the last number that worked so try one all right well how about one uh one minus six that's negative five plus thirteen that's um eight minus twenty four that's no no that's not going to work that doesn't give me zero so i know that one is off the table so i'm going to cross that off my list one is no longer going to work for us i tried two i've already done this so two does not work for us but you would try it you say okay plug in two two to the fourth power 16 minus 6 times 8 plus 13 times 4 minus 24 times 2 plus 36 and it's not going to give you zero so you would say hey this if i evaluate for 2 kind of g it's not really g but g ish is not going to give me zero that's not going to work so let's say all right two doesn't work crossed off my list i try three g of 3 this isn't going to be 0 but if i plug in 3 here this actually is you might want to try it take your calculator out and evaluate this part of it for 3. it is going to give you zero and since this if i evaluate three is zero zero times two if you evaluate three is still going to be zero so g of three does give you zero g of 2 did not that's why we crossed it off g of 3 does and so we're going to say all right since g of 3 is 0 i am now going to say two things about it i'm going to say that x equals 3 is another x-intercept because when i evaluate it it gave us 0 that's what x-intercepts do and therefore x minus 3 is another one of our factors so i always do that every time i say what the x-intercept is i say what the factor is because when i continue to factor this i will have a factor of x minus 1 and then i'll also have a factor of x minus 3 not x plus three x minus three and then we do synthetic division again so we take the quotient from our last synthetic division and we use our x-intercept that would be positive three remember all of our x-intercepts have to be positive oh wait here's a good check for understanding see if you understand this because i found let's see one positive x-intercept and i just found another one that's two positive x-intercepts are there necessarily at least one more and you should be not a yes because i know i have one or three not two so i found one of them i found another one of them there's gotta be at least one more maybe even three more could be and then we do our synthetic division so bring down your first coefficient multiply and add multiply and add multiply and add multiply and add and you must get a zero and here's what it says our g of x is now factored as we had an x minus 1 factor we now have an x minus 3 not plus 3 and the resultant factor that we get this quotient here says remember i used reduce my power again this is the other reason why we write this out every time so you can keep track of your degree of that factor now we'd say this is 1x to the third minus 3x squared plus 4x minus 12. so what now what would you do now well you do one of two things you'd start over with your list now i'm gonna go through that right now so you see what you would do would you have to check one here no because you tried it here and it didn't work would you check 2 again no because you tried here it didn't work would you try 3 again yes you would it's not going to work but you would it might work actually you try 3 again and if it works you'd factor out again what would i do before that though i would try to factor the remaining polynomials so i would try to factor this by grouping if we factor out x squared and four we get x minus three and x squared plus four i'm gonna talk i gotta talk about that i gotta show you i gotta show you um i'm gonna write down the the result of this because this is what we're gonna be ending with but i really need to talk about this for a second so if we factor that we go okay we had one factor of x minus one one factor of x minus three check this out this is what i want to talk about we factored another factor we got x minus 3. get the same factor twice what do you do with that well you should write it as x minus 3 squared that's repeated 0. here's what this says what this says is that if i tried one here no it wouldn't work if i tried two here no it wouldn't work if i evaluated for three here yes it would have worked so let's see three cubed is 27 minus 27 is zero plus 4 times 3 is 12 minus 12 is 0. oh that's an x-intercept that would say that g of 3 gives me 0 again x equals 3 is a fact is a x-intercept again x minus three equals zero again for this part of the polynomial x minus three would be another factor and if we had done synthetic division yet again with uh one negative three four and negative twelve thank goodness is fast and i i used my positive three x-intercept again that we know is gonna work one three zero zero four twelve zero bring it down multiply add multiply add multiply add and you get x squared plus zero x plus four that's where that factor comes from this is the reason that you don't just check once and you're done we checked one it worked we checked again it didn't work then we're done check two it didn't work it's never gonna work check three it worked we used it it worked again we used it again that's why we don't just check it once and and say we're done with it because it can possibly give us another factor so what's that mean what's it mean well we look at it and go this is that's linear that's linear that's linear can you factor x squared plus 4 x squared plus a number no that's an irreducible quadratic even quadratic formula here would show us that our discriminant is negative saying you don't have any x-intercepts this is going to be a complex solution that power 2 is the reason why we have 3 and not 5 positive x-intercepts that degree is 5. we could potentially have 5 but this screws it up this power 2 takes away 2 and says ah that's going to be complex so i have 1 2 3. i kinda have i really only have two um but one of them is repeated that's giving us a balance so the way we write this completely factored into linears and irreducible quadratics is like that and here's what it says x equals 1 is an x-intercept and it's a crossy due to that multiplicity 1. cross c's not really a math word it's just my word we have another one at x equals three and that's a bouncy due to the multiplicity of two that would be that even multiplicity so we cross at one come back down bounce at three and have still this sort of end behavior what we don't do is we don't have any additional x-intercepts so we have three x-intercepts they're both positive one of them is repeated though so that kind of wraps it up into this bounce instead of a two crosses so i hope that you're with me on that one i'm going to come back with one last example we're going to do it twice because i want to show you two different approaches to it so that you can see that the way in which you pick some of these some of these numbers to choose can impact uh the amount of work you have to do so i'll show you that in just a minute all right let's get into the last example i know i have it written twice because we're going to do it two different ways so i can show you the choice actually matters not that your process really should change but just that it matters um as far as what you're checking in your evaluation for your rational zeros theorem or rational roots theorem so we're going to do the whole thing but i'm going to be pretty quick about it we're going to do cartoon signs we're going to get our list but we're going to pretty much fly through the rest of it so here's the deal the first thing we check every time is order then we get an idea of degree and end behavior this is in order and the end behavior is going to be a positive odd like most of the ones we've done today in this video then we're going to check the cultural signs and see what we're working with so the cartridge sign says 1 two three no four sign changes so we have four sign changes here that's going to be four or two or zero positive x-intercept intercepts we change our odd powered terms by evaluating with negative x so change this one leave this one change this one leave this one change this one leave that one that would be no sign chain one sign change and then not another one so that's going to be one negative x intercept hundred percent guaranteed we have one and only one negative x-intercept we could have zero or we could have two or we could have four positives now does that make sense yeah degrees five we have at most five x-intercepts in total we have at most four plus one that would be five total are we going to get all 5 no we're not because i designed the problem that way but we could get 5 potentially i think we get 3. so anyhow we use that though to limit our our work so we know we're going to have a negative we're going to have to check negatives we know we might have positives we're going to check positives on the list of p's over q's that we're going to get right now so the next thing we do because we're in order we look at our constant term and we start factoring it so our list of factors for 25 1 and 25 let's see two doesn't work three no four no five yes but that's it so 1 5 and 25 both positive and negative for our cues we have just one and two because two that coefficient has just two factors prime number so p is over q we take one over one five over one twenty-five over one we'd also take one over two five over two and twenty-five over two none of which simplify it this is very rare that that happens most of the time we get something to simplify so we have one two three times two is six one two three four five six you should have six expressions of fractions or whole numbers before you start simplifying you can't eliminate some of those but here we can't do that so we have a list of numbers that are the potential this contains all of the rational x-intercepts for that function now are all of them x-intercepts no we know there's at most five but if they're if we have any rational x-intercepts they're there do you have to have rational x-intercepts no you don't like x squared plus 5 is a parabola that floats above the x axis it's a degree is 2 but it has no x intercepts so what that means is that this does not include any square root x intercepts or any complex intercepts that we might have so just keep that in mind it's just a starting spot for us okay so what do we check first well the first thing we're gonna do is reject one that that's where we always start if we have any positive x intercepts or potential positive x intercepts we check one so let's try that if we evaluate for one let's see that's two uh two minus one that's one one plus 48 is 49 49 minus 24 is 25 25 minus 50 is negative 25 and negative 25 plus 25 0. hey that worked good that means that x equals 1 is an x-intercept that also means that x minus 1 is a factor so you kind of a choice right now you choose to either use x minus 1 and do long division of polynomial or you choose positive 1 and do synthetic division we're going to choose that so the way this works we tried one it worked as if x is an x-intercept we know that that's an x-intercept this is the coefficients of our polynomial we bring down the first one we multiply we add we multiply we add multiply and add multiply and add multiply and you must get zero there if you don't something went wrong and we're also gonna do one more thing we know that we have a factor of x minus one not x plus one oh man x minus one now we have this resultant polynomial as a factor and we reduced it by one degree so what's the next step well the next step is you try to factor that that's a degree for we're not going to factor it but we would try it so well there's no gcf there's nothing i really do there's no grouping no general formula that i know no quadratic formula if that had been a power two and you didn't see the factorization you just do quadratic and you end with a rash a radical zero that would not be on that list so what we do now is hopefully you know you start back with your list now should we check one again yes we should we should try one again so try one uh two plus one well i can tell you right now that all of these numbers are way more than twenty-five so two plus one plus forty-nine plus twenty-five minus twenty-five and that's not gonna be zero so one worked once but it's not going to work again we never tried positive 1 again for this problem should we try negative 1 yes we should because we potentially or we definitely have at least one negative x intercept now i don't know if it's negative 1 but we would try it so we evaluate for negative one and all we have to do is evaluate here it's not going to be zero here it doesn't matter evaluate here so with negative one that would be 2 minus 1 that's 1 plus 49 is 50 minus 25 is 25 minus 25 is 0. so x equals negative 1 that's great that's another x-intercept that means x plus 1 is another factor again long division or synthetic division and we're just using this part of our polynomial now and we're using negative one be careful with synthetic you have to use the x-intercept so we're gonna bring down the first coefficient we're gonna multiply and add multiply and add multiply and add multiply appropriate remember negative 1 times negative 25 is positive 25 and add hey that looks great and that gives us another factoring so we keep on writing this every time we write the entire polynomial we had an x minus one we just gained a factor of x plus one and now we have reduced the power one more time now what should you do should you go back to your list you can if you don't see how to factor it you can you would not try one you would try negative one again it's not going to work well i don't think it's going to work we should try it though uh so 2 let's see that would be negative 2 minus 1 is negative 3 minus 50 remember trying negative 1 again that's negative 53 no it's not going to work there's no way that's going to give us a zero but you try it so negative one wouldn't work you'd try five next and then if that didn't work negative five then you tried 25 that didn't work negative 25 then you'd go to your fractions the better idea is to see if you can factor that so if we try to factor by grouping that works that's great would that mean if you do it right that's great now i'm a double check so 2x to the third minus x squared this would be 50x minus 25. if we continue to factor that that's 2x minus 1 and then x squared plus 25. so what's that mean that means that we have factored this as x minus 1 x plus one two x minus one and x squared plus twenty five let's see if this matches what we thought would happen this factor would give us a positive x-intercept at multiplicity one that'd be across at x equals one this would be a negative one that's across the at x equals negative one that's our one negative x-intercept there can be no more this would be positive one-half add one divided by two positive one-half so a crossing and a crossing those are our two positive x-intercepts there's zero there's not zero there would have to be two or four here's one here's another one here's our one negative can you simplify that anymore no that's an irreducible quadratic that right there would be complex solutions we get to in the next video what if it had been negative what if it had been x squared minus 25 then you would factor that again and you would get x minus five and x plus five now by doing that you change some of these signs and this would no longer hold true but that's what would happen so if that was the case then you'd continue to factor it you have x minus 5 and you have x plus 5. i hope that makes sense you hope you're seeing i'm going to change it back but i want to reference that so that would be completely factored over linears and irreducible quadratics we have one two three x-intercepts and it fits what the cartridge sign says about that now let's do the last this example again but do it sort of differently i've never shown that i've never really seen a lot of people show how to do synthetic division with fractions so i'm going to show you that it actually works i'm going to leave that and believe it for one reason i believe it for that reason you see i know that that's an x-intercept and i'm going to show you with synthetic division that you can divide that out and get this the same thing and in fact it's a lot quicker so i'm going to show you that and i'm also going to show you that you might get a different look for your solution so let's say that we uh we somehow know that there's an x-intercept of one-half can you do synthetic division with one half the answer is yes now here's the deal that factor you would have to solve for one half to be able to do it remember synthetic division does not work if your factor has a 2 in front of it so what you'd have to do is say hey 2x minus 1 equals 0 add your 1 divided by your 2 x is one half that's what you would use there to factor this out that's what you have to do so here's how it works we bring down our first coefficient cool we'd multiply two times one-half is one then you add wait negative one plus one is zero that's okay one half times zero is zero then you'd add that's 48 one half times 48 is 24 then you add negative 24 plus 24 is zero that's okay one half times zero is zero you add that's negative 50 one half times negative 50 is negative 25 and sure enough you get zero just be careful what your exponents are you see what this does is this says that this factor is x minus one half notice that this factor is now x minus one half would equal zero can you have two different ways to represent the same factor yes two x minus one and x minus one half is identical it doesn't matter so this represents the factor as x minus whatever your x intercept is and this one doesn't who cares it doesn't who cares it does not matter what does matter is we get our exponents right so this would be 2x to the fourth we reduce by 1. 0x cubed don't write it 48x squared cool minus 50. now i'm going to show you what the difference would be between these these results here it is if you continue to factor the first thing you do is you would try to factor that what factors oh wait a minute 2 2 and 2 go into all three of those terms factor the 2 out and where we put it is all the way in the front so you'd have a 2 you'd still have a factor of x minus one half but when you factor out that 2 and you put it here you get x to the fourth 24 x squared minus 25. now can you factor this yeah that's a very special form of a quartic you could do a substitution if you want you could say hey let's call u equals x squared and you do u squared plus 24u minus 25 you could just straight up say hey that's a three term polynomial and i know that factors as negative 1 and 25 that adds to 24 that multiplies the negative 25 and because i'm familiar with my exponents i know that we can put this as 2 x minus one half and then x squared minus 1 and x squared plus 25. you could show grouping with that you could do anything you want we've covered all of those things before and you can see it works x to the fourth uh 25x squared minus 1 is 24x squared minus 25. that doesn't factor that's an irreducible quadratic this one does factor that's a difference of squares now here's the question do you get the same x-intercepts well that gives you one that gives you negative one there's those that gives you positive one-half there's that that's the same reducible quadratic why do they look different they look different because we sort of forced a factoring out of two and if you force this to factor out two you get the same thing or if you distributed this so that you don't get fractions when you distribute a factor like that you don't do it everywhere you do it just to one of those factors this would give us 2x minus 1 for that particular factor it's the same thing so which way is better honestly getting to the one half would have been just a random guess so you'd go through like i showed you on the first example but i do want to tell you that choosing a factor can have a bearing on your later factor ability like whether it's easier whether you have to pick another number from a list so i want to make sure you understand that uh last thing i wanted to say is please please don't forget that if this hadn't been x minus 1 but like x minus 7 x squared minus seven that that is technically still factorable that would be x minus the square root of seven times x plus the square root of seven that would be square root of seven and square root of seven so keep that in mind this is not an irreducible quadratic okay i know that's a very long video i hope it made sense i hope that in but you need to see it all at once um hope that you followed it and i hope that you are ready because we we're basically done with everything you need to know about polynomials you know how to graph them you now know how to factor them so that you can find x intercepts with multiplicities all crosses so that you can factor it the next thing we're doing is talking about complex and then we get into graphing with rationals so i hope you're following me i'll see you for another video

hey there welcome to another video in this video we're going to have a brief introduction of complex zeros of polynomials we're going to be using them in the next few videos to take some complex zeros and build polynomials from them and how to factor polynomials completely over complex numbers so let's explore a little bit about it what a complex zero is where they come from what you can do with them and how far we can factor polynomials if we allow complex numbers so um one thing that we i've been speaking of i never wrote it down but one thing i've been speaking of is this this fact of polynomials is that every polynomial can be factored over the real number system into linear or irreducible quadratic factors linears giving you x-intercepts like either crossings or bounces touches touchings where we have a multiple root multiplicity would be even there or irreducible quadratics which do not yield x-intercepts because they give you complex solutions and that's what we're going to start talking about is those complex solutions just a little bit right now how they work and next few videos will unpack that and go into creating functions from them so effective polynomials is that they can be factored into linears and irresistible quadratics over the real number system now if we allow complex solutions then we can continue factoring and if you had a polynomial you could factor that into all linear factors if you allow complex solutions which is fascinating and here's what that means here's the whole thing that you really need to get if you're going to allow complex solutions for a polynomial then the degree of your polynomial no longer means at most this many x-intercepts and that's what we had before if you had a degree 12 you could potentially have 12 x-intercepts some might be repeated some might be crossing some might be bouncings but you could have 12 of them but that's not a guarantee that you will have 12. if you allow complex numbers then if we factor that into linears here's what it means your degree equals the number of factors you're going to get because they all be linear every linear has a power 1 as its largest power so if you had a degree 12 then you would factor that into 12 factors some might be repeated but you would get 12 factors if you allow complex numbers for those solutions so the degree now means number of linear factors if you love complex and it means number of solutions so if you saw a degree 12 polynomial you are going to be able to factor that into 12 factors and get 12 solutions exactly but that is over the real the complex number system so you have things like with i in it so we're going to review that a little bit like what complex numbers look like what a conjugate means and then this nice little fact i'll talk about so what a conjugate means is two terms with basically a different sign in the middle the first term doesn't change its sign the second term does change its sign so if we had a plus b then a conjugate would be a minus b if we had a plus b i then the conjugate would be a minus b i now why do we need to know that well that's that's what a complex number looks like it's a real part plus or minus some imaginary part and an imaginary number comes from a square root of a negative number and that's where that comes from so complex numbers are huge so here's the main thing that we need to understand about complex numbers every complex solution is going to come in what's called a conjugate pair so if you get this solution 3 2 minus 3i we are guaranteed that there's another complex solution 2 plus 3i that is what is called a complex conjugate pair so notice how the real part doesn't change notice how the imaginary part does change sign we're going to talk about why that is in just a little while but they always pair up like that you might remember from last few videos so i said well you know what if we're factoring we might get these irreducible quadratics now what do they do they create two solutions that are complex what are those two solutions they're repaired every irreducible quadratic creates a complex pair of solutions complex conjugate pair just like that every irreducible quadratic is going to do that why why is it irreducible because you can't factor it over real numbers because you can only factor irreducible quadratics over complex numbers they're still going to have two solutions quadratic is a power two similar two solutions but they're going to be complex solutions and they're going to look like this real part plus an imaginary and minus that same imaginary so uh let's do another one if you had negative seven plus five i the complex conjugate would be negative seven you don't change that but you change the middle sign minus 5i those are what are called complex conjugate pairs now i want you to understand why they exist i just told you that these complex conjugates come from irreducible quadratics so think about what a quadratic would look like a quadratic would be ax squared plus bx plus c and if you set it equal to zero you'd say okay if i wanted to find solutions i would try to factor it you know well what if it's not factorable i'd use quadratic formula you go okay so so get this if every polynomial can be factored into linear or irreducible quadratics linear gives you x-intercepts over real numbers that's what it does that's all it does um if they're to the an odd power they're crosses and if they're to an even power their balances that's what they do irreducible quadratics give you complex solutions now here's why so this is true and it is true that we can get all the way down to linears and initial quadratics no power fours no power threes no part of fives only factored into linears power ones or quadratics power twos then when we got here and you go well it's not factorable what would i do i would use the quadratic formula for irreducible quadratics well now i don't want you to worry about the linears those are already factored we'd have x-intercepts from them but if you think about the quadratic formula here let's really look at it if i had a reducible quadratic something that i could factor i really wouldn't do this i would just factor this normally or if i if i use the quadratic formula because i wasn't able to factor this over integers or rationals or something like that well then i would have at least negative b plus or minus some positive number in here and that would create two more linear factors over real numbers so wait a minute what causes something to be irreducible it's irreducible if this number is called the discriminant the number inside of your square root if this number were negative i'll just use negative number in here what happens if there's a negative number inside of your square root well this would yield an imaginary number it would yield this something i like square root 7i or 3i if you had like 9 square root of 9 negative 9 in there you get 3i you're going to get something with an i in it now take a look at this this negative b that's a real part this does not change signs at all there's no plus and minus in front of that that negative b this is your real part it's like the two it's like the negative seven it's the first part of a complex number but look at the second part the second part would be plus and minus this square root of a negative number something imaginary remember you can't combine a real part with an imaginary part without a sign in the middle you can't say hey what's 3 plus 2i but it's 3 plus 2i it's like apples and oranges you don't get up oranges that sounds weird you just get a complex number it's two numbers sort of mashed together but it's that plus and minus the quadratic formula that guarantees that we get pairs of complex numbers you'd have this being something plus or minus the same number it's not going to change but you are going to get two different signs there that is what creates these complex conjugate pairs if we can factor a polynomial into linears that gives us x intercepts irreducible quadratics gives us something we use the quadratic formula for that has a real part plus or minus an imaginary part that's why they come in pairs that's why irreducible quadratics always give us complex solutions and irreducible sorry and conjugate pairs for those complex solutions so this part would basically be wrapped up as if i split that fraction some real part let's just call it a whatever it is plus or minus some sort of a number that has i in it i know i'm kind of messing up with my b here this this b is a different b than that i really shouldn't use it but i wanted to model that up there and so this is where it comes from is the this quadratic formula saying this first part if i split the fraction would be the real part plus or minus some imaginary part but the a and the b themselves would not change value that's why they always come in pairs it's just because of that plus and minus so what does that mean for us and this is where we're going to end our our lesson today is that if we understand all this stuff if we understand that when we start using complex numbers we can take those irreducible quadratics and we can factor them further over complex numbers x minus two plus three i x minus two plus three i i think i said the same thing twice x x minus that one and x minus that one so you can have these two different factors if we use complex solutions well those are both linear and what that means is that if we allow complex we can get whatever your degree is that number of factors and that number of solutions well let's look at a degree 6 polynomial if we have a degree six polynomial then we are going to have to have six solutions or six zeros some of which though might be complex however if you have a complex they always come in pairs so let's look through it if i have this degree six polynomial i need six solutions two is a real number you don't mess with that and that's done two plus i is a complex number so i'd be looking for its complex conjugate to also appear if it does cool if it doesn't well then i know that i have an initial an additional zero that's not being listed so i would say degree six one two three four i'm missing two zeros i have to have the equal number of zeros for the degree if we are including complex numbers which we are here so the two that's a real solution that stands for an x-intercept in this case and it's a cross in this case the two plus three is two plus i says i also would have to have its complex conjugate so 2 minus 3i negative 3 minus i says well wait a minute i also need those to be paired every complex solution will be paired up guaranteed i just explained why it's because quadratic formula the plus and minus creates that pair automatically for any irreducible quadratic formula irreducible is only over real numbers start a lot of complex well then we do reduce them but they come in pairs that would be negative three plus i and then zero zero is also a real solution so we would look at this and go there's one two three four five six zeros that's six solutions including complex numbers and that's a degree six that will always match if we are using complex solutions again if this is over reals we say that degree is the maximum number of real solutions we could have not necessarily all of them will be real in this case four solutions will be complex is it true that you'll always have an even number of complex solutions yes because they always come in pairs so if you have one you have two if you have three you have four at least um or well if you have some pairs you could have a pair and then one and another one so this is probably an act this is an x-intercept that's crossing an x-intercept that's crossing and then four complex solutions how i know those are crossing is because we have six solutions for that degree six therefore none of these can be repeated so that's kind of interesting let's move on to the last one we're gonna be done so degree seven polynomial in your head right now you should be thinking degree seven polynomial is going to have seven solutions if i allow complex numbers it will have a maximum of seven solutions if i'm talking about real numbers so let's look at it oh hey so we see some complex that means that every complex solution has to have a pair with it according to the quadratic formula because when we evaluate the quadratic formula with an irreducible quadratic we're going to get a complex number we are going to get a real plus or minus an imaginary that creates a pair of complex numbers so what are they well let's start with this one 3 minus 2y would have to have a pair 3 plus 2i negative 2 plus i has to have a pair negative 2 minus i notice i'm not changing the sign of the real number this doesn't change this a is the real part the plus and minus the where the sign changes is in the second part the imaginary part so 3 stays that sign changes negative 2 stays that sign changes negative 4 is a real solution those do not have to come in pairs that's just negative 4. why well because if this is not negative and we just erased that then that's a real number and that's also a real number and you can combine them and so especially if they're integers or something like that you can combine real with real it's only when that is imaginary that you cannot combine these two parts and so therefore when we have a real solution it wouldn't show up as a pair only complex do that because you have a real part and an imaginary part that you're kind of sort of mashing together with a plus or a minus that's where the pair comes in and so we'd leave the negative four the only other one that we have to deal with is this i so this i would happen if you had let's see a zero plus or minus the square root of negative one so zero for your b plus or minus square root of negative one but it is a complex number we just have to understand that this is probably best thought of as zero plus i so we'd have zero which is your real part there is no real part here there's just an imaginary part zero plus i the conjugate would be zero minus i so the conjugate to this would be negative i you don't need the zero but that's the way that i'm gonna explain that to you and so these would be our seventh solution so i would yield a complex conjugate pair of negative i that's a pair that would be like zero plus or minus square of negative one that'd be uh zero plus i zero minus i hey that's where that comes from we'd have 3 minus 2i 3 plus 2i negative 4 does not yield a pair because i just explained that to you real numbers get added and subtracted and create another real number and then we'd have negative 2 plus sign negative two minus sign that's one two three four five six seven there's only one real solution here it's just negative four there's only one real x intercept here that's negative four the rest are complex zeros or complex solutions so that negative four would be a cross this would have to be a degree seven seven solutions degree seven that's odd every odd polynomial must cross the x axis at least one time it can cross and never come back again but it would have to cross i've been saying that for a while but now maybe you start are seeing that picture i also said that with the cartridge signs you reduce by two because of the irreducible quadratics that irreducible quadratic basically takes two away from the degree at a time why well because if you are having an irreducible quadratic and use a quadratic formula it yields two solutions that are complex every single time that takes away two solutions from the degree in pairs conjugate pairs for every time you have an irreversible quadratic so i hope that's starting to kind of gel in your head kind of solidify about how complex solutions work with our degree how we get the equal number to the degree for our solutions and for our factors and we factor over complex numbers so in the next few videos we're going to start building functions from these uh these complex solutions we're going to basically take this and create a polynomial from it so i'll see you for that 

Transcript for: Creating Polynomials from Complex Solutions (Precalculus - College Algebra 36)
hi welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about how to create some polynomial functions if we know a couple complex zeros that sounds really familiar because we've done this before with real zeros we said well wait a minute if we know that an x-intercept is say like x equals four and we can say x minus four equals zero and x minus four would be this factor of a polynomial that we're creating and we're going to do something very very similar but now with complex zeros here's the main thing that you want to learn in this video is that if you have one complex zero or complex solution then you automatically have another by this this theorem that says that complex solutions always come in conjugate pairs and so if you have one you have two if we have two what we can do is create two factors and when we multiply those factors so distribute we're going to get what's called an irreducible quadratic factor and that's part of this function that we're going to build so we're going to discuss that we're going to see what it is one of the the main things i want to teach you in this video is how to multiply uh factors linear factors that have complex values in them an easy way because that's probably one of the main things that students get confused on is how in the world you do that so i'm going to teach you how to do that because we use that in the next few videos so let's get right into it let's talk about what degree means again let's talk about if we have one complex we have another one create some factors like we did before and then i'll show you how far i would like you to distribute and then if you have to distribute all the way i'll show you how to do that as well so let's go right into it if we have a degree 4 polynomial what that means is that we are going to have four linear factors across the complex number system so polynomials can always be factored into linears and irreducible quadratics across the real number system but if we go into complex numbers like we have right there we're going to have four factors now some of those factors might be repeated so that's like a multiplicity idea but in general for every degree we have that many factors and that many solutions in complex numbers not necessarily all real real numbers we have at most four real solutions but we have exactly four solutions of our complex so what we're going to do here is we're going to find four factors and some of that's going to be wrapped up in a multiplicity the second thing we're going to hopefully understand is that if we have one complex solution we also have another one that's sort of hidden but they always come in complex conjugate pairs so 3 minus 2i that's great that's one solution for us it's giving us that this has 0 is a 3 plus 2i and 4 with a multiplicity 2. we could build a couple factors from that if we have 3 plus 2y we can get an additional factor by understanding that 3 minus 2i the complex conjugate also has to be a solution that was due to this the quadratic formula working on an irreducible quadratic here's what the whole thing is if you can factor a polynomial into linears and irreducible quadratics over reals then that irreducible quadratic is only unfactorable because it has complex numbers in it and that plus and minus gives us a conjugate pair for complex solutions that was in the last video that we talked about so if we have 3 plus 2y we have 3 minus 2i also basically by the quadratic formula and so here's what we're going to do number one we're going to match up and make sure that we have four solutions for degree four we have one we have two we have three but this says you basically have four twice as a solution that's where the multiplicity comes in then what we do is we start building our factors please please don't skip what i'm about to do it's very common for even teachers to say hey just go straight to your factors or do you like x minus four easy just switch to sign don't do that and the only reason why not is because what i want you to do with your complex solutions is very specific and it will i promise help you and it's much easier to understand if i have you start the way i'm about to show you so here's what i want you to do i want you to make each of these solutions an actual solution for instance i want us to say hey x is going to equal 3 plus 2y and x is going to equal 3 minus 2i and x is going to equal 4. start that way list out all of your solutions because by adding or subtracting respective of what signs we have we're going to get factors set equal to 0. it's going to make a lot more sense that we can use a zero product property or reverse to create factors of some polynomial also what i'm about to do especially with our complex solutions here is to build them in a certain way that makes distribution easier otherwise you have three terms and you have to foil oil it it's really annoying so i'm going to do this so that it's structured easier and if you go straight to your factors you're going to have a sign error at least i see that like 95 percent of the times i teach this and i go straight to the factors students mess up a sign and does not work out well so we're going to say hey degree 4 we have four solutions well one of them's repeated do that multiplicity 2. so really we have three solutions one of them just repeated all right list them out x equals 3 plus 2i x equals 3 minus 1 because complex always come in conjugate pairs we have x equals 4 and now we're going to build our factors so let's start with the real uh the real solution here if i subtract for x minus 4 equals 0 that's fine and here's what that says and i'll start building my function right now what that says is that if i have x minus 4 equal to 0 then x minus 4 is going to be a factor of some polynomial with an x-intercept of 4. it's going to be a factor for us and if this looks familiar it should because we've done this before but we had all real solutions now a couple things i want to say this is where your multiplicity comes in so if x minus 4 is a factor and it says well check out what your multiplicity is x equals 4 was a solution sure it was a zero sure but it had a multiplicity too what that really means is that x kind of equaled four twice you know what's what's that mean that means that really we're not showing it but you would have this other factor x minus four and you have x minus 4 and x minus 4. you would have a repetition of that solution well we all know that if i combine that i would get x minus 4 squared and that's really how we use our multiplicity you don't have to show this this is this is uh redundant because multiplicity wraps up this idea and says uh yeah you're repeating that factor twice so we would have x minus four two times and that multiplicity stands for the power of the factor from where you get your solutions that's what that is and so when we really go okay here's uh here's x equals four cool here's x minus four equals zero okay by the zero product property sort of in reverse i know that's a factor of some polynomial where four is an x-intercept and it's told me that's a multiplicity 2. that stands for two x-intercepts that stands for two of our degrees so we need to we need to have this kind of add up to four as far as our our degree the last thing we've seen this already i'm not giving you a point here um i wouldn't say there's no point but there's a point to this which means that you can't say that this is the only polynomial that's that's creatable with these solutions and so we put an a out there even if i had given you a point you'd still put the a because we'd use that point to solve for a later and i'll talk about that when we get there so we go okay real solution we've done this before x equals 4 cool we have this factor of x minus 4 multiplicity 2 says you've got power 2 on it and this could stand for a lot of different functions that have these x-intercepts but we don't have a point so we can't really solve for a even right now now the complex this is where it gets i'm going to get this more complex it gets a little more complicated so we're gonna solve this for zero just like we did right here we're gonna subtract three we're gonna subtract 2i i want you to do it that way i don't really wanna see x minus three plus 2i in parenthesis that is what you would have if you went straight to your factors you'd say all right this is x minus 3 plus 2i and you might have seen that you might have topped that before but in order to distribute well you actually have to redistribute the sign and then regroup x minus three it's a little more difficult to do than what i'm gonna show you so solve for zero subtract three subtract two i so we get x minus 3 minus 2i equals 0. now this right here is a factor just like x minus 4 was a factor but we're going to think of it a little different here's how i want you to think of it i want you to think of it as x minus 3 is one factor and so we're going to group that notice that when we group the first two terms we're not affecting this sign there's no redistribution of a sign or anything we just want to think of this as x minus 3 minus 2i here's why so you get there when when or you understand when we get there we're sort of treating this like two terms because we know that distribution with two terms is a lot easier than distribution with three terms and three terms so two and two is easier than three and three also our first two terms are going to be the same here why because with complex conjugate pairs your first number is always the same 3 and 3. the second one has the change of sign so if we group the first two terms we're basically going to get x minus 3 times x minus three and we know how to do x minus three squared it's not that hard but that's why we're thinking of grouping them and that doesn't really show up very well if you try to distribute three terms on three terms or if you go straight to your factors which is why i'm teaching you this let's do the next one we're still going to solve this for 0. so x minus 3 plus 2i so we're setting that equal to 0. and again likewise we're going to group the first two terms this is the factor that i want you to have in your polynomial so long story made sure if you have a degree 4 you're going to have to have 4 factors now some of those might have a different multiplicity which counts this counts as two factors so we have one two three four and since these are all set equal to zero we can use that zero product property say hey this would be some polynomial with these three factors set equal to zero based on the fact that you have those three solutions i can't say x-intercepts anymore i can say zeros but i can't say x-intercepts anymore and the reason why is because that is an x-intercept these ones are not that's a that's an x-intercept that bounce if you remember at x equals 4 we balance either this way or that way because we don't have an a there's no really way to know but that is an x-intercept these are not x-intercepts they're zeros they're complex solutions so we're going to say hey there's one factor in multiple c2 and we have two more factors so we're going to write with some brackets here's the first one x minus 3 minus 2i and x minus 3 plus 2i these are all the factors that we have based on our degree so we have x minus four here's one two here's three here's four factors it's a degree four and that always matches up there's four solutions uh one's just repeated so here's four and we would have repeated that twice i showed that already here's another one here's number four now we gotta distribute i'm gonna give you the minimum distribution and sort of the maximum distribution of what you would do here the minimum distribution is you have to at least distribute your complex factors you've got to get it into linears and irreducible quadratics well we don't have that we have basically a repeated linear and we have two sort of linear factors of complex numbers in them because we have a degree one we have degree one so we lose some of that terminology but that's basically what we have this is not acceptable to leave for like anybody even me who's sort of loose on uh distribute that whole thing because i wanna punish you it is punishing if you have to distribute like with a degree seven or something that can get pretty nuts um so at least distribute the complex factors and that's really what i'm giving you these for is because in the next few videos you have to know how to do that in order to find all the solutions if i'm giving you a complex solution so you have to know how to do that so let's practice it this is the whole reason why i want you to write this solve it for zero entry this is your factor with the first two terms grouped the reason why is because you're going to start here when you distribute not here start with your complex that's the the least you need to do right so start with the least you need to do and when you distribute it we're going to treat this like two terms and two terms so when we distribute because we've grouped those first two terms in each factor we're going to think of this as x minus 3 times x minus 3 but what is that really well that's x minus 3 squared now notice what else happens because we group this sort of intelligently because we grouped it instead of three terms and three terms you you have this sort of difference of squares idea do you see it like you have the same you basically have conjugates you have the same first two terms x minus three that's we're treating that as a term and then minus two i and plus 2i what's going to happen when you distribute well i'm going to show it one time but i'm never going to show it again if you were to continue to distribute you would get x minus 3 times positive 2i and you would get x negative 2i or minus 2i times x minus 3. even though they look weird remember that those would be your middle terms and they're going to cancel every single time that's the second reason why i want you to write it this way is because you create for yourself and this will always happen with conjugate pairs you get sort of this difference of squares or conjugate factors where your first two terms are the same uh in both cases you have a different sign and your last term is the same and so when you distribute your middle terms will always cancel out and that's that's nice so setting up this way is really convenient we have x minus 3 times x minus three oh okay x minus three squared plus and minus the same thing we really never show that and then lastly we just need to distribute the last two and be careful with it this will be minus 2 times 2 is 4 i times i is i squared you need to know how to multiply this complex so i times that would be an intermediate algebra class but i times that would give us i squared what we need to understand about i is that the square root of negative 1 gives us i and because of that i squared is always negative 1 so whenever you see i squared you go oh that's negative 1. essentially what's that do so if i squared is negative 1 it doesn't really change the value of 4 multiplying 4 times 1 is going to give us 4. but because i squared is negative 1 it's always going to change this sign to a plus so here's some truths about complex numbers think about these maybe write these down number one complex solutions always come in pairs for polynomials always because they're always from irreducible quadratics and they're always by the quadratic formula going to give you plus and minus the same thing so same thing plus and minus the same thing well that always creates for us these sort of conjugate factors which means two things for us number one when you just maybe three things when you distribute your middle terms are always going to cancel that's great it also means you're always going to get a minus here no matter what no matter what because you'd have a conjugate idea minus and plus when you multiply that's going to give you a minus every time different signs give you minus you multiply you're also always going to get an i squared so if this is always a minus and that's always going to be i squared the i squared is negative 1 it's going to essentially just change that sign so you should always end up with some sort of a linear factor that you have to square so you're gonna do x minus three times x minus three that's uh x squared minus six x plus nine but you're always going to end up with plus some constant if i squared is really negative 1 then this would really be negative 4 and subtracting negative 4 would give you plus 4. those are some facts about those uh those complex complex solutions i always give you this idea middle terms are going to cancel you get minus something with an i squared the i squared is negative one it'll change that sign to a plus every time check that check for that so uh this is really what we want to distribute now so off to the side maybe we do x minus three times x minus three you can do this in your head what you can't do is you can't go oh yeah uh x squared plus nine or x squared minus sign that doesn't work what we get is this x squared minus six x plus nine and don't forget that we have this plus four that plus four is this tacked on thing because this is still in this sort of factor like this is what we're creating we're creating an irreducible quadratic factor and that's it so we end up getting x squared minus 6x plus 13. and that actually is an irreducible quadratic if you try to factor that you can't do it quadratic formula is going to give you oh wait a minute uh complex so basically we're going up we're going opposite of that so the last thing that we need to do as far as the minimum work here would be to bring down our linear factors that came from our reals even if they're repeated so like x minus four multiplicity two bring down our a because we really don't know uh what that is and then that's that's good enough for me that's fine now some of your teachers or instructors or maybe you you want to distribute this a little bit more so what you would do here and this is the only time i'm going to show you this but what you would do here is you would distribute this x minus 4 times x minus 4. very similar to what we did over here you'd get x squared minus 8x plus 16. and then you'd spend the time to distribute three terms onto three terms notice if you don't use my technique that's exactly what you'd have to do up here if you didn't group those and that's that's a pain in the rear see lots of stuff flipping around lots of sign errors happen lots of little mistakes happen so hopefully you agree with the distribution complex numbers when i'm doing it it's easiest way i've ever come up with to do that then you distribute this what i'm going to do is just give you the final final answer what you would get for your polynomial so some math magic happens and you get you get that after you distribute so we take this term times all of these and then this term times all of those and then this term times all of those and combine like terms and that's what you would end up with so what do you do with a number one don't distribute a not right now at least what you would do is if you're not given another point you're done this this is a polynomial that would have the this would be a degree four degree four this would be a degree four polynomial that would have these zeros and that's a the only real zero with a multiplicity two this is it if you had to refactor it you have to go through all this work again so don't do that so if you don't have a point you're done here if you get a point so if someone gives you a point like hey i'm going to make this up this is not a point for us you would say if we had one point that's not on the x axis so you can't use something we already have let's say it's like one comma negative three if it was 1 comma negative 3 what'd you do here you plug in 1 for your x's you'd plug in negative 3 for your y or your f of x you'd simplify this divide and a would equal whatever you have so x goes for x y goes for y or f of x and then you solve for a once you have that number then you can rewrite it with a whatever the a happens to be then you could distribute that a through it even if it's a fraction it can be very nasty but that's something that you could do i hope that makes sense i'm going to leave it here this is the basically for a polynomial here if you had a point you'd have to go through and do that you could leave it here and do the same thing like put in one here here and here simplify put negative 3 here and divide you can still figure out your a from that part so that's fine as well this would be the very minimum of what you'd want to do this is factored into linears and irreducible quadratics with an a in front you could if you had a point you could plug it in here even and still suffer a by the technique i just showed you if you have to distribute this is it so you want to go all the way down to that okay let's move on to the next one we're going to go a bit quicker on these because i've already sort of given you the whole idea so we have two more examples this one and then a degree five on work through with a different multiplicity so we see a degree four and what that means is a few things number one we would we will need to have four factors some of which will have some complex numbers and we need four solutions so they've only given us two well what that means is that we're going to find the other two and build some factors from that so when we look at them and go hey they're both complex we know that complex numbers our complex solutions come in conjugate pairs so let's work on that if they give you 1 plus 2i then 1 minus 2i also has to be a solution by the quadratic formula if they give you positive i the negative i also has to be a solution remember that positive i really is 0 plus i there's no real part here there's just an imaginary part the conjugate would be 0 minus i or just negative i because you wouldn't have to write 0 for the real part now as i mentioned before we really really need to write out those those solutions as x equals that so that we can get an appropriate factor much like we've done over here it just makes it a lot easier to see otherwise you have to sort of manipulate signs we all know sign errors are real kind of a bugger uh for us so we want to do it this way to make sure our factors are just perfect so we're going to write out that x has to equal i and negative i x has to equal 1 plus 2i and minus 2i so that represents our four zeros we have i negative i 1 plus 2i and 1 minus 2y so i'm just checking my work i'm going to make sure that i have 1 2 3 4. it's a degree 4 there's no multiplicity at least not with these complex solutions so we're we're good then what we're going to do is we're going to set all of these equal to 0 and that's going to give us our factors so subtract i add i subtract 1 and subtract 2i so x minus 1 minus 2i equals 0. subtract 1 but add 2i and x minus 1 plus 2y equals 0. then what we're going to do is these look pretty good if you notice because there's no real part this is going to be a little easier to distribute there's really only two terms and two terms you don't have to group anything we grouped over here because we had a real part that was the same so three and three we grouped it with x minus three so that we could get x minus three squared when we distribute that was really nice because we don't have that real part that's not really an issue for us so we're gonna have two factors x minus i and x plus i because both those factors equal 0 by the zero product property we know those are two factors of a polynomial that has those things as solutions i can't say x intercepts because those aren't x intercepts but they are solutions now for our other complex solutions we're going to create some factors by just grouping the x with the real part and like we did before what that does for us because the real part's always the same in the complex conjugate pair that is going to create an x minus 1 squared when we distribute we treat this like one term and distribution so we have two terms two terms we're going to treat this like two terms and two terms so let's go ahead let's write out our polynomial we are going to give us an a because again it's not giving us a specific polynomial it's saying find me a polynomial that has these solutions you're all right well all i have to work with is factors i really don't have a point to work with but because i have all these factors set equal to zero i know that i can create this polynomial that's going to have those solutions by just using those factors if it's a degree four you should have four factors that includes some multiplicity but you should have four factors so this was each of these factors that equals zero i could have created a polynomial equal to zero by the zero product property or just gone straight to my function said this is a function that would have these solutions because by the zero product property i get all those factors equal to zero there's one two three four of them for a degree four it's looking really good all we have to do now is go through the same process and distribute our linears that have complex numbers in them these are these conjugate pairs so we're going to distribute that we're going to leave it there if you need to go further you'd have to keep distributing so i'm going to start with this over here i always like to attack the the hardest looking ones first so i'm going to distribute and think of these as two terms times two terms we notice it basically is a conjugate right here if you think of this as one term this is same thing same thing with a different sign between them that creates like this difference of squares idea for us where we're going to get first term times first term x minus 1 squared if you went ahead and distributed you'd get plus and minus the same exact thing they're gonna sim they're gonna simplify what they're gonna cancel out i don't even write them what we do have to realize is that because these act like conjugates you're always gonna get a minus some imaginary number squared so you're gonna get negative 2i times positive 2i well well that's minus 2 times 2 is 4 but i times i is not just i you're going to get i squared and we walked through this before where what that i squared is that i squared is negative 1. so 4 times negative 1 is negative 4. subtracting negative 4 is really just adding four it's exactly like this even down to the number so that's plus four if we do that x minus one you could do in your head just don't give me x squared plus one or x squared minus one remember that this is x minus one times x minus one so that's going to be x squared minus 2x plus 1 and then we also have the plus 4. let's not forget about that that needs to be added to that constant so we've distributed this it was this piece but then remember we have the plus 4. and that right there is an irreducible quadratic over the real number system that's the irreducible quadratic for our factored polynomial all of this would be in some sort of factor and then we're going to do the same thing here it's just be a little bit easier because we don't have this distribution of these two terms squared so when we distribute this you can really see this as a conjugate if we distribute we're going to get x squared but we get plus ix minus ix well when you add those together they cancel out so we don't write them that is a conjugate the middle terms are gone and then minus i squared notice negative i times positive i is negative so we write minus i squared but what is i squared well i squared is negative one uh so this would be x squared minus negative one that's what i is it looks like this sounds weird that is that's what i is so you're really subtracting negative one the same exact idea over here this is not a really awkward thing this is saying what you're really doing is subtracting four times negative one that's what we're doing here we're subtracting or subtracting negative 4 that's what we're doing here so we're subtracting negative 1. and that creates this other factor it's also an irreducible quadratic it has to be that's what these irreducible quadratics create is factors over the complex so uh well factors with imaginary numbers in them over the complex so these linear factors are complex so if we have two linear factors of the conjugate pairs and we start distributing them it's going to give you something that's an irreducible quadratic over the reals if we put our a down here and say hey this is a function that would have those four solutions this is actually a degree four think about it x squared and x squared would be a degree four polynomial just like we said with these as zeros they're not x intercepts but they are zeros these are two irreducible quadratics we're done if you have to distribute after this you'd start and just take your two terms times your three terms combine your like terms after that and leave your a in the front just like we did here if you wanted to solve for a you could certainly do it here but you need a point to do that so if we had an x and a y plug in your x's here your y here simplify the side and then divide to solve for a then put your a right back do the same thing if you distribute uh you just put your a in front and then distribute the rest of the way so i hope that makes sense i'm going to come back with one more example dude it's quite similar but i just want to make sure that we see it one more time all right let's give it a shot actually what i strongly recommend is that you pause the video and you try this on your own so try setting up these factors try getting the one real factor that we have creating the the uh or one real solution we have created a factor for it using the multiplicity creating it as part of our polynomial function then check out your conjugate pair take and set those equal to to x and then make it a sum factor equal to zero use that distribute those complex conjugate factors that you have and then see as far as you can make it with your distribution remember we have to at least distribute so that we don't have any more complex numbers in there we need an irreducible quadratic from those so let's go ahead and get started if we have a degree 5 that means we're going to have 5 factors and multiplicity might count for a couple or three of those factors but we definitely need to have five added up together if you will we also notice that we have one complex solution one complex solution always comes with a pair so right off the bat we're going to say this also has a solution of 1 minus 2 minus i now let's go ahead and set these equal to zero so our solutions are x equals one x equals one plus i and x equals one minus i that's really it that's all the unique solutions that we have now why we don't set this equal to one three times is it's just redundant multiplicity says yes you do have three factors each of which would give you the solution of x equals one but we know a little bit more than that that that multiplicity really just stands for the exponent of our factor because that's the same thing x minus one and another x minus one another x minus one would be x minus one to the third power and that's exactly what we're gonna get here so we set our our x is equal to our unique solutions that are given to us and then we solve them so x minus 1 equals 0 that looks pretty good we're going to solve both of these x minus 1 minus i equals 0 and x minus 1 plus i equals 0. but we're going to be smart about it because these are going to create some complex factors for us we're going to group the x and the real part because that real part doesn't change for your complex conjugate it can't change so that when we distribute and this and this are factors x minus 1 gets multiplied by x minus 1 increase x minus 1 squared it's a lot easier to work with that way you're only thinking of two terms times two terms and you can use a lot of the advantages of the conjugate pairing that we saw otherwise you're doing three times three it's way over complicated so now that we have these three factors we're going to start building our function we know that this is just one of many functions like a family curves they could have these as solutions so we're going to say what each of the factors is we have an x minus 1. we have x minus 1 in parentheses minus i and likewise plus i you can see it right if we set this equal to zero we get this and this and this equal to zero by the zero prime property we're just going backwards the only thing i've left out hopefully you you notice it is that that x minus one that came from a a zero that had a multiplicity of three so so what that says is that if this x equals one has a multiplicity three really there are three factors that each of which would give you this x equals one it's still a crossing of the x-axis but we need to represent this as a power three we've gotta make sure our degree matches so this factor counts for one two three factors it's just written more concisely that's what exponents do four five factors looks really good here's one solution two solution and because it has a multiplicity of three that really counts for three solutions because you could have written out x equals one x equals one x equals one it'd be redundant but you could have done it now what we're going to do is distribute at least the factors that have complex numbers in them because we wrote these appropriately and grouped our our x with a real part it makes it really nice because these are these are legit complexes or sorry conjugates right now so we think of this as one term and we get x minus one squared again this idea is used a lot in the next video or whenever you have to multiply some complex factors together and we're going to do that and then do long division in the next few videos so x minus 1 squared great we get plus and minus the same exact thing and what we've come to expect we're going to get minus some sort of imaginary number squared now what that imaginary number squared does is gives you negative one okay well if we have a constant associated with that like four times i squared that'd be negative four here this is literally just negative one so we are going to get this x minus one squared minus negative one or x minus one squared plus one that's really what we have when we distribute this and combine it with plus one we get x squared plus 2x sorry minus 2x plus 1. that's going to give us x squared minus 2x plus 2. that's going to be our irreducible quadratic factor at the end of our problem we really don't have to distribute that unless you absolutely have to and they say you must distribute then what you really have to do is do x minus 1 times x minus 1 times x minus 1. which gets really tedious distribute this one get some sort of a quadratic not irreducible some sort of quadratic and then distribute another x minus one across it and combine some like terms then you'd have to take a three term sorry a four term polynomial times a three term polynomial you get 12 terms then you have to combine them and you're going to have some like terms but that becomes quite tedious for me it's not necessary if you have to then you have to personally i like this because i've already taught you how to find a leading term by doing that sort of fake distribution thing i've already taught you what to do with our linear factors with multiplicity that's going to have an x-intercept of one multiplicity it's across this is an irreducible quadratic it doesn't give you any additional x-intercepts there so this is a factor that would have the solutions as they told us it would again if you had to distribute you do this then distribute this don't distribute a if you have a point this is when you plug in plug in your x plug in your y over here and solve for a then put it back then you distribute that a through after you distribute all of this stuff that's about as far as i want to go on that i hope it makes sense especially the how we write these complex factors and distribute that's the biggest thing i wanted to show you and to make sure that our degree actually matches for instance if we did this we know our leading term is going to be x to the third times x squared fake distribution we talked about that already that's going to be an a x to the fifth that's the leading term of this polynomial it matches the degree that they've told us and depending on the a we have an end behavior that is odd or odd or negative odd so i hope you're with me i hope you're enjoying the videos next time we're going to do is we're going to start talking about how to find all the solutions of polynomial functions including some complex so sort of some similar ideas here we're just going to really flesh it on out and make sure that we really understand how complex works polynomials so i'll see you for that 

Transcript for: Finding ALL Solutions of Polynomials (Precalculus - College Algebra 37)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to try to find all the zeros all the solutions to a polynomial including some complex ones so i'm going to walk you through about six examples uh the first two were given a complex solution we find the rest of them including real solutions then we're going to remember to not forget about factoring and then lastly we're going to start from scratch and find every single solution that we can i'll show you exactly how to go through and do that from a polynomial so um i do want to admit that the first two examples are sort of contrived because i'm giving you a complex solution first and while that is possible to do it's not very likely so i'm going to admit that the first two are are kind of like would these would these really happen probably not we'd probably find real zeros first if there are any but if there aren't any then we're left with the idea of find a complex solution first the the reason why i'm going through these is because this is going to teach you how to do long division of polynomials without a linear factor with a quadratic factor an irreducible quadratic factor and that can be an important concept as you get into something like calculus 2 when we do some of the uh like a partial decomposition fractions right before that you learn how to do long division and so we're going to be doing that sort of as a preface and if you happen to get a problem like this where you do have a complex zero how to structure it so we're going to start right away with this example x cubed minus 4x squared plus 4x minus 16. and i'm going to tell you that it has a 0 of 2i or a solution a complex solution of 2i and that's a complex solution of course it'd be 0 plus 2i that would be the real part plus the imaginary part and we're going to find the rest of them so here's a couple things to refresh your memory about polynomials if you have a degree 3 then there are going to be exactly three solutions to that now some might be repeated but there will be three solutions given one we should be able to find the other two in complex numbers this is always true so we if we have a degree of three for a polynomial you are going to have three solutions so here's the idea for all we're gonna do today number one we're gonna find a zero if they give you one awesome if not we're probably gonna have to fall back on the rational zeros theorem to find our own zeros number two we're going to create a factor if you have a real zero well then you're going to create a linear factor and you're going to use synthetic division and that's really quick if you don't have a real zero if you have a complex zero then the thought process as we learned in the last video if you have a complex zero they always come in complex conjugate pairs they come in pairs so we're going to take a pair of zeros get a pair of factors distribute that and get an irreducible quadratic factor so create a factor for linear this comes from a real zero using negative synthetic division a quadratic for a complex pair so two complex numbers give you two factors you distribute to get rid of the complex that's why we practice that and then we have to do long division because synthetic division will not handle that after that we try to factor the rest or you repeat this find another zero create another factor or pair of factors which gives you an irreducible quadratic and divide again or synthetic division so that's the whole thought process also on this first example we're going to sort of ignore that you can factor that but in real practices you would never you would not do what i'm doing you would absolutely group this factor by grouping and you'd be done i'm just showing you on an easy example so that we get the idea of what to do with that what to do with long division with something that number one is a little easier number two students make a lot of mistakes on not because it's not easy but because they don't know what to do when you distribute and you're missing a term so i'm going to show you how to do that it's a very important example for that so let's get started number one we're going to find a zero and if it has one awesome if it's linear oh sorry if it's a real zero you create a linear factor so if we would have got like hey it's negative 4 then we write x plus 4 and we have ourselves a linear factor here we have a complex solution and so we have 2i but we also know that complex solutions or complex zeros come in conjugate pairs so we automatically get one for free so 2i we also know that negative 2i which is the conjugate 0 plus 2i and 0 minus 2i are conjugates that's also a solution complex solutions always come in pairs like that and so now what we're going to do is we're going to create some factors we've done this before but we're going to create x minus 2i equals 0 and x plus 2i equals 0. this is the way we go from solutions to factors it's sort of using the zero product property to say hey listen if these are zeros well then you can subtract 2i and get x minus 2y equals zero but that would come from some polynomial factored being set equal to zero and using zero product property so we basically go backwards and say that's a factor and that's a factor what we do here is quite important you see with long division of polynomials or a synthetic division this doesn't work with complex numbers and so we have to at least distribute to get rid of those complex numbers what we're going to do is we're going to distribute this this is pretty nice this is already set up in conjugate form it looks like a difference of squares sort of and so when we distribute we get x squared we would get plus 2ix and minus 2ix well those are going to cancel this is always the case when you're multiplying complex conjugate factors like this and then we're going to get minus 4 i squared remembering what i squared is i squared is just negative 1 that's all it is so x squared minus 4 i squared is really x squared minus four times negative one or x squared minus negative four well that's x squared plus four what i squared does is essentially just change the sign of that term that's really all it does this right now we think through it we said okay hey that's a zero complex conjugate pair says that also gives us a zero now that we have these two zeros we can create some factors no problem we got it now they have complex numbers in it let's distribute to get ourselves an irreducible quadratic that irreducible quadratic is a factor of this polynomial right there it has to be because it came from the zeros it's a must so this is what we're going to factor out or divide out from our polynomial i'm going to show you how to do that synthetic division will not do it and this is why i taught you long division so we could do this and why i'm doing this is so that later on when you get to some things that you have to do long division for you're at least prepared a little bit and so we're going to divide our original polynomial by the factor that we got from multiplying our complex linear factors or our fact of the sort of linear factors factors that have linear factors that have complex numbers in there we have to distribute those and then we get a irreducible quadratic factor now let's go ahead and divide it this works the same way as any other long division it's just that you're not dividing by x you're dividing by in this case x squared so let's go ahead and divide what we're going to do same as always is take our first term divided by our first term i'm going to show you for a couple times so x cubed divided by x squared this is what we're doing x cubed divided by x squared the rest of this is just going to play along and that gives you x to the first power and then we're going to distribute remember that this is the way long division always works you divide and then you distribute and then you subtract so when we distribute we get x to the third power plus 4x that goes under here you'll wait a minute what am i x squareds well you don't have any in this case you see you're missing that middle term because this is one of those sort of special irreducible quadratics that came from a 2y minus 2i rather than like a 3 minus 2i case in which that's going to have a middle term i'm going to show you that one as well as well we have two examples here so when that happens i always give myself a little place holder saying hey here's my x to the third power that has to match i don't have any x squared because there's no x to multiply and then plus 4x so i'm always matching up what my my terms are and the reason why i do that is because on the next step we're about to subtract so you've seen this before you see me do this parentheses this cues my brain into i'm subtracting each and every one of those terms so i'm taking x cubed minus x cubed negative 4x squared minus 0x squared and this is the reason why i put that 0x squared if i don't do that it's often that i'll subtract these and get 0. subtract these and get zero and go i have nothing left what did i do wrong by putting that there i make sure that i'm actually performing a subtraction concept and i basically bring down that term but if i don't do that most of the time i forget so negative 4x squared minus 0 is negative 4x squared 4x minus 4x is 0 minus 16. so i'm going to put 0x there just to keep my my term i don't necessarily need it but i put it there just to keep that like a place value holder and so then i'm going to take my first term and divide by my first term again so negative 4x squared divided by x squared we're going to get negative 4 and so we're going to write minus 4. and that basically completes our division we're just going to go through the distribution to make certain that what we do gives us a zero remainder if it does then we've done this right if it doesn't we've made a mistake on our division because we already know that that has to be a zero and that has to be a zero these have to be factors and if we've distributed correctly then that is an irreducible quadratic factor of what we've been given so it has to work it has to give us a 0. so let's distribute make sure that happens negative 4 times x squared is negative 4x squared i don't have any x's so there's still a 0x and then negative 4 times 4 is minus 16. and this looks perfect because when we subtract we're gonna get negative four x squared minus negative four x squared that's zero zero x minus zero x is zero i made a mistake i don't know why that's fourteen weird negative 16 minus negative 16 is also zero well that's that gives us a lot of confidence that what we did is perfect division and that's that's fantastic so here's what this means for us what this means for us is that we have now found a quadratic factor we've divided out and we're left with our quotient of x minus four that's a linear factor that means that we can't really go any further and this says that our polynomial if you needed to write this in factored form you could write it a number of ways so the first way that you could write this you could write this as factors with complex this would take our degree three and say you now have three factors you have x minus four that's a that's including a real solution you have x minus 2y we have that here x plus 2y you have that here this is factored over the complex number system if you have to show factor over the real number system then you just say well you know what we've done that when we go ahead and distribute these complex factors we get an irreducible quadratic but that irreducible quadratic is only irreducible over the real number system and that would show factorization over the real number system that's good and lastly if you need to show all of your zeros so if you show all your solutions we already really had one we got another one for free and lastly we know that if we set x minus four equal to zero we can use the zero product property again so x minus four would equal zero x would equal 4. that'd be a multiplicity 1 that'd be a cross that fits our paradigm that that's an odd that's an odd polynomial odd power function it has to cross the x-axis at least once and it does right there that's our only x-intercept it is a cross look at the multiplicity one that's got to make sense to you and then we have two complex solutions this probably gives us some sort of turning points that don't interact with our x-axis so that's what i want you to know about this so the main things here are if you're even complex you automatically have another multiply those factors first to give yourself an irreducible quadratic then divide it out and deal with what you have here sometimes you'll have to continue to factor that if you don't you're good like here this is this is fine we had basically two factors wrapped up here here's our third factor that's a degree three degree three means three factors if you factor over the complex degree three means three solutions all the time if you include complex solutions and sometimes multiplicity so let's go on to the next example here this next one is g of x this is clearly not factorable they don't have we don't have a gcf in there this is not going to work with factoring by grouping so we're really left to we need to know a factor in order sorry a 0 in order to create a factor in order to divide this so the zero that we have either comes from like rational zeros theorem this is the most often case like where you have you know nothing about it and you start plugging in numbers and those numbers come from that list that we learned about go okay well that would work and then i divide out a linear factor by synthetic division it's actually fairly quick that's the last two examples we do today in this video but here they've given us a 0 3 minus 2y and so we're going to go through the same process just please be aware with one complex solution you really can't do much as far as factoring that you can't because you can't do long division polynomials with a complex number it doesn't work and so what we're going to do is we're going to use the idea of if you give me one complex zero i automatically know another one they always come in pairs by the quadratic formula they have to they always come in pairs and so we're going to take those complex conjugate pairs build a pair of factors so find a zero we got one create a factor hey a quadratic comes from a complex pair let's get a pair let's cut let's let's distribute them let's get a irreducible quadratic and let's factor that out so we're going to start with that so we look at it we go okay i want to find all the zeros of the polynomial in your head right now you should be thinking there's gonna be how many there's gonna be four of them that's a degree four there should be four zeros and four factors over the complex number system can i factor it no i can't do i have a zero can i find zero yep i have one that's three minus two i and when that's complex you have to find a pair if it's real you're good if it's a real number like i said over here it was gonna be four so if it's a real number well then x minus 4 is your factor and do synthetic division or long division and you're good but with a complex you need a pair of them so uh 3 minus 2i oh yeah the pair would be 3 plus 2i and we're going to go through the process of of creating those factors i showed you this in another video where when you have a complex solution really take the time don't just go straight to the factor write these as equal to zero and then group your first two terms to create this sort of two term times two term multiplication so we're going to subtract three and add 2i subtract 3 and subtract 2y and these right here become our complex factors but i hope you remember that this is really difficult to distribute if you just take three terms times three terms that gets really nasty and so what i taught you in another video was just group these first two and group these first two on a complex conjugate pair your real part is the same the three and the three it's always the same and so when we subtract that you're going to get the same exact expression on both of your complex conjugate factors both of them are going to have in this case an x minus 3. group that group that and then these become your factors and we treat them like they're one two terms one two terms so when we distribute it's much nicer it creates this conjugate factor for us where the middle terms cancel when we just have x minus three squared it's a lot easier we've studied in another video so i'm not going to go into it fully right now but this is the way that we're going to go ahead and distribute because it's so much nicer than treating this as three terms times three terms okay so we had a complex zero we got another one for free we created complex factors regrouped the first two terms and now we have this sort of conjugate not really sort of i guess it is sort of because this is not really one term but a conjugate look to our factors when we distribute this we're going to distribute x minus 3 times x minus 3 we get x minus 3 squared if you were to distribute you'd get minus and plus the same exact thing that's going to cancel it's going to give you 0. so then we're going to distribute 2y times negative 2i that's minus 4i squared we talked earlier about a couple things that refresh your memory number one when you are doing this and multiplying complex conjugate factors like you're doing here you will always get a minus you'll always get an i squared which will change this to a plus every single time also why we're doing this again is that you cannot divide this on a polynomial over the real number system it doesn't it doesn't work so we basically have to have a pair we have to have these two factors we have to distribute and we have to simplify this into an irreducible quadratic so when we do that this gives us x squared minus 6x plus 9 minus 4i squared just remember that that 4i squared is really plus 4. that i squared is negative 1. and so subtracting 4 times negative 1 well that's really adding 4. so here's what we know about that we know that this right here is an irreducible quadratic but we also know because it came from two things that we were assured were solutions to this polynomial that the factors we created created another factor for that polynomial in other words this has to divide that for sure so we're going to show that and so we're going to do long division because synthetic division is certainly not going to take care of that for you synthetic division works only for linear factors and only when your x it has a coefficient of 1. so let's go ahead and let's divide we've already got this set up appropriately where every single power less than our degree is represented including a constant if there was no constant you could factor that because everything would have an x in it that of gcf you could lease back to that we have our irreducible quadratic yes you must have that to do long division polynomials it is an irreducible quadratic linear factors with complex numbers do not work and so now we're going to divide again it's just your first term divided by your first term and here this is actually a little bit easier than this one because everything matches up term for term so we're going to see that so when we start dividing we're going to take x to the fourth divided by x squared x to the fourth over x squared gives us x squared so when we multiply we're going to distribute your first term should always be the same when you distribute if not you chose the wrong thing x squared times negative six x is minus six x to the third and then plus thirteen x squared we always put parentheses we always subtract we always remember that i'm subtracting term by term x to the fourth minus x to the fourth is zero that's what we need to happen negative nine x cubed minus a negative so that's plus six x to the third is negative three x to the third 21x squared minus 13x squared that's going to give us 8x squared and we're going to bring down 21x and do the same thing again so we take our first term negative 3x to the third divided by x squared well it's going to give us negative 3x so we write minus 3x and we're going to distribute again so x squared or negative 3x times x squared is negative 3x squared that looks good negative 3x cubed i meant to say then negative 3x times negative 6x is positive 18x squared negative 3x times positive 13 well that looks like negative 39x we have to be really careful on signs here so negative 3x cubed minus negative 3x cubed that's zero that's perfect 8x squared minus 18x squared that's negative 10x squared 21x minus negative 39x so that's adding 39x that's going to give us 60x and our last step so we're going to take a look at this and we're going to divide our first term by our first term again notice how the long division of polynomials is really just based on the first term and everything else just gets distributed and plays along that's how it works looks really confusing the first time you see it you know what am i supposed to do with all this just focus on your first terms you're going to be fine so negative 10x squared divided by x squared gives you negative 10. we're going to put -10 we're going to distribute one last time and just make sure that our remainder is 0. negative 10 times x squared is negative 10x squared negative 10 times negative 6x is plus 60x looking good negative 10 times 13 is negative 130 and we can tell when we subtract when we subtract something from itself we get zero and so that's perfect that's exactly what we want now what do you do from here well what we've just done is we've reduced this polynomial we've we've factored it into two quadratics now we already know that one of them is irreducible this is an irreducible quadratic you cannot break that down anymore but this one's not this can be factored so there's the first step in how we factor this polynomial we have two quadratics this one came from our linear factors that had complex numbers in so we're not going to be able to factor that in any other way factoring is unique to a polynomial so you're done for this one this one came from these two unless you want to break that down into linears that have complex which you can do we're just going to leave that we basically use that quadratic to figure out what was left now this one you need to go a little bit further on that so x squared minus 3x minus 10 that's factorable as x minus 5 and x plus 2. this would be completely factored over the real number system so this is good to go as far as real number system if you have a factor over the uh the complex number system well then you would go back and you'd say all right there's x minus five there's x plus two and we actually already have those factors x minus 3 minus 2i and x minus 3 plus 2i that came right from here this would be completely factored over the complex number system so you have 1 2 3 four factors that's a degree four that matches up how many solutions do we have well using the zero product property going kind of quick on it we'd have x equals five and negative two and x equals three minus 2i and 3 plus 2i we already knew this one we got this one for free and then we just figured out these two from that quadratic that's the process of going through and solving these so we have a degree four we have four complex factors we have a degree four we have four complex solutions we have a degree four over the real number system you have an irreducible quadratic because that gave you complex solutions i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing the interplay between this stuff the last thing i need to mention to you about this before we go any further what if that was not factorable most of the time it's going to be because you're working out of a textbook or something but what if that's not factorable then what you would do is you would use the quadratic formula so you do quadratic formula it will give you two solutions whether they're real or complex i can't guarantee you it could very well be the case that you have a degree for with all complex solutions that's possible what if you have a degree four could look like this where it doesn't intersect the x axis at all you're going to have four complex solutions here we know we intersect the x axis and it's a multiplicity one multiplicity 1 so we cross the x-axis at those two x-values we know that it goes down and it comes back up and it probably does something some weird little loop that doesn't interact with the x-axis we get a picture of that because we know about graphing that's why i taught you that stuff so i guess long story short your degree has to match up with your complex solutions not necessarily your real that's the the maximum number of real solutions you could have it's the exact number if you include complex that's the maximum number of factors you can have for real numbers it's the exact number of factors if you have complex so here we have one two three factors but one of them is here additional quadratic here we have one two three four again that could be if you cannot factor it that could be something you need to do with quadratic formula it can look a little nasty when you start using the quadratic formula for that because your if you have to write factors because your factors could be x minus something that comes from a quadratic formula and x minus the other thing that comes from a quadratic formula like like this this came out of nowhere but if i had a quadratic that gave me this solution and that solution notice x minus and x plus x plus and x minus one plus square root of three over two that does not come from this i'm just making this up then you write x minus that and x minus that but that looks a little bit nastier doesn't it it's still a real number i mean it doesn't have an i in it it's still a real number so it's factored over reals but that's what we would get out of that so i hope that makes sense uh the next two examples we're going to talk about don't forget to factor like what we should have done on that example so i'll be right back with that all right let's keep on going so one thing is that a lot of times when students are in section uh they focus on the technique of the section and it seems like everything they've learned before just just goes out of mind the way that i teach i always try to do what's called spiral i always try to look back at stuff you've learned incorporating what you're learning and not so so as to not forget about it because the things you learn first tend to be easier and if you can use them why not use them and this is two examples just to reiterate that factoring is very useful and as far as easiness it trumps what we've been doing because using the rational zeros or something like that is just way overkill when you can factor it very easily same thing for that so we've learned some techniques just don't forget about them so when you're going through this i really don't care what they tell you to do if it says yeah use rational zeros theorem but you can factor why are we using rational zeros theorem there's other ways to practice that so let's factor when we can factor so if we take x to the fourth minus one and you're tasked with finding all of the zeros of this well we could use rational zeros they're going to give us a hint but notice how we're not given any zeros around the bat we're not given a complex like we were in the previous two examples then we could build another pair two pairs of factors distribute for a complex a irreducible quadratic and do long division that's great we're not given that here so we're starting from scratch we could start with rational zero's theorem but why why when we could factor so if we set this equal to zero and that's how we find all solutions ever set that equal to zero well then that's that's a power four but it's model on a square of a square x squared squared so you probably have seen the uh like use of substitution i know we've done it in this this series where u equals x squared you do that you can just straight up think hey you know what that's a difference of squares with x squared minus one and x squared plus one and that's a true story x squared minus one x squared plus one that's x to the fourth plus and minus x squared is zero minus one that looks like a difference of squares why not factor it like a difference of squares if you want to see a little better you can think of this as x squared squared minus one equals zero that's x squared minus one and x squared plus one okay well how about that well let's keep on factoring can you factor x squared minus one no no that's an irreducible quadratic can you factor x x squared plus one no sorry x squared minus one yes that's not irreducible that's it that's a difference of squares legitimately x minus one and x plus one and then you'd still have x squared plus one equals zero now here's what i'm going to tell you this is completely factored over the real number system you have a linear which is going to give you a real solution and it's going to be a crossing because we have a multiplicity 1. we have another real solution a linear factor gives us a real solution multiplicity once is we have another crossing this right here you do not say it has multiplicity because multiplicity comes from the power of the factor not the power of the term so that x squared plus 1 it's not factorable the the quadratic formula would give us an i in there this is an irreducible quadratic so this is not giving us real zeros this is not giving us x intercepts but we still need to know how to find complex solutions so how do we do that well we start with the easy factors all right how do we find factor or sorry how we find zeros is by using the zero product property we have these factors set equal to zero we have two linears and irreducible quadratic where we go from there is using the zero product property to say well yeah x minus one equals zero and x plus one equals zero and sure enough x squared minus one plus one would also equal 0. now this is really nice x equals 1 and x equals negative 1. what you do with irreducible quadratics is one of two things listen carefully how you solve these is factor if you can find a factor if you can't with with a real stereotypically or like i used earlier a complex zero where you find a pair create your visual quadratic and divide so find a factor okay great factor it okay great factor as much as you can over the real number system it should be linears and irreducible quadratics set your linears equal to zero by the zero product property but also set your irreducible quadratics equal to zero these are very easy to solve these are both crossings multiplicity 1 they're real x intercepts the graph is going to cross the x intercept twice for irreducible quadratics this falls into one of two cases number one something like this where you can solve for your x squared and simply take a square root yes you will get eyes you know what for all your irreducible quadratics you get i's so we're going to subtract one x squared equals negative one when we take a square root oh don't forget you gotta have a plus or minus don't forget that we get x equals plus or minus the square root of negative one well wait a minute the square root of negative one by definition is exactly what i and what i is is imaginary number so we get plus or minus i that gives us two solutions we get i and negative i that's case one if you have x squared plus some number then you solve it just like it showed you said it uh solve it for your your x squared take a square root plus a minus you get a complex number out of it if it's x squared minus a number you better factor that even if it's like x squared minus five remember you can do x minus square root of five and x plus square root of five so x squared plus a number yes complex x squared minus a number no not complex real numbers that's factored you'd have two solutions you'd have 5 square root of 5 and square root of a negative square root of 5. now what if this well if this was an x squared plus a number but something like x squared minus 6x plus 13 what then well then you would do the quadratic formula it will show up your zeros for you and you can write them as factors if you need to so we're going to do both of those things right now we've found for the degree four are one two three four solutions this is all we're asking for is uh is those four solutions next if you have to write this as completely factored over the real number system this is it this is factored over the reals if you have it factored over the complex then you just simply go back and from here you create your factors we already know these two x minus one and x plus one from these two factors you can get x minus i this looks really familiar because we've done it x plus i and those would create two additional factors for you that include complex numbers this would be completely factored over the complex number system degree four four factors but some of them are complex so i hope that makes sense the biggest thing here is don't ignore factoring if you can use it it's way quicker let's look at the next one so x to the fourth plus 13x squared plus 36. if we remember we've done i'm going to use this substitution so we can sort of spiral that into for things that have a power here that's twice the power here you can do a substitution so we're going to call u equal to x squared what that means is that x to the fourth would become x squared squared or u squared remember x to the fourth is x squared squared plus 13 x squared so we can call this x squared and that x squared this u some some dummy variable so u squared plus 13 u plus 36. i'm going to speak a little bit about this when we're done we're going to come back and say well what if you couldn't factor that try again because almost always they're factorable but what if you what if you really can we'll talk about that this is factorable so g of x really it's g of u at this point would become u plus nine and u plus four that's u squared plus four u plus nine u that's plus 13 u plus 36 that's the way the substitution works if you set this equal to zero and we're solving this now so u plus nine would equal zero and u plus four would equal zero okay that's i i suppose that's fine uh u would equal negative nine and u would equal negative four that also looks okay well uh but then we have to go back to our x's you see we start in terms of x's and you use our breadcrumbs to get back to our x's so if u equals negative 9 we knew that u equaled x squared x squared equals negative 9 x squared equals negative 4 and we run into exactly the same situation where we can take a square root with a plus minus and we get x equals plus or minus 3i square root of negative 9 is 3i and x equals plus or minus 2i square root of negative 4 is 2i and this gives us our four solutions degree four four solutions if you need this to be factored over the real number system um it's it's a little more difficult because we did substitution there's a different way you could go about it if you just recognize that this is a three-term polynomial and you can factor it then you'd get down to here and you'd go right back and say wait a minute that's really x squared and that's really x squared and this would be an irreducible quadratic in each of those cases so you could stop right here and say that is factored over the real number system and you'd be correct that's two irreducible quadratics is the case i just spoke about where degree four can certainly give you two irreducible quadratics over the real number system these cannot be factored anymore you can't factor x squared plus sign you can't factor x squared plus four if you wanted to go further and do complex from here that'd be fine you do x squared plus nine equals zero and x squared plus four equals zero and hopefully you can see that's the same case as this you'd subtract nine subtract four and end up right here get the same exact solutions so this would be factored over the real number system these are all of our solutions there's four of them for degree four if you needed to give these factors as complex factors well then we can create a factor from each of these solutions so we have x minus 3i and x plus 3i respectively this would be minus because you'd subtract 3i and plus because you add 3 that would give us two factors x minus 2i and x plus 2i that's four factors degree four four solutions degree four two factors over the reals because those are irreducible over the real number system now i mentioned to you what if this was not factorable like this then what you would do it would get a little more complicated what you do is you would from here you'd solve for u with the quadratic formula you would take you would take that and you would simplify it down now this of course would give us some really easy numbers but if it didn't what would happen eventually is you would get u equal to some sort of an expression that looks like this and then you'd say okay as soon as i simplified this all the way as much as i could then we'd do our substitution back and you'd say all right x squared would now equal this expression which i'm just modeling the form for you and then you take a square root and you take a square root with a plus and minus and you can see that this would get a little bit crazy you get x plus or minus some big square root that also has a plus and minus in it would look like that and so do you have four solutions here yes you do you take positive square root of number plus square root of a number then negative square root of number minus so that say that wrong on the second one you take positive square root of number plus square root of a number you take negative square root of number plus square root of a number then you'd say positive number minus square root of a number and negative square root number minus square root of a number you'd have four iterations here some of those are could be complex numbers so you have to really think about that it gets really nasty i don't foresee that you would see that many times but this is what you would do if you get there i can't think of an example that would be put in like a textbook for you but it could appear somewhere so anyway i hope that makes sense if this is not factor which almost certainly is then you do quadratic formula and when you get to here when you simplify this quadratic formula then you say oh yeah u is x squared how to get rid of x x squared you take a square root with a plus or minus and you get positive positive for one solution positive negative for another negative positive for one solution negative negative for another you get four solutions where we get crazy is for your factors uh so you'd write x minus each of those four really nasty looking solutions as factors so i hope it makes sense uh the next two examples we're going to start from scratch i'm just going to give you a polynomial that's not factorable we're going to go through rational zero step we're going to factor out with synthetic division we're eventually going to get down to things that we have to use a quadratic formula for or have some complex zeros i'll see you in a minute all right we're going to get to it we get just two more examples and they look kind of crazy we're going to find all the solutions to these polynomial functions we're going to start with rational zeros theorem we're going to factor out my synthetic division and eventually hopefully factor down and get some complex solutions as well so a couple things to understand is i'm going to be going as quick as i really can while explaining this well to you because everything that we're going to be doing on here we've learned already i'm just giving you two examples to wrap everything together that way when you get there you go oh yeah okay i know what to do now i know how to put it together put all the pieces together so let's take a look at these number one we have f of x equals x to the fourth and that's in order and this says that we have a degree four polynomial how many solutions we should get is four are they all going to be real i don't know could they yes the degree is the maximum number of real solutions you get it's the exact number of solutions you get if you talk about complex numbers as well so we should get four solutions because we're factoring for all solutions here four solutions four factors over the complex number system how we start try to look for factoring that's five terms we're done uh you're not gonna be able to factor five terms unless you have a gcf which we do not have here we have a constant which eliminates our ability to factor in x we have a degree coefficient our leading coefficient of one which says we're not going to have a a um a greatest common factor that includes some sort of a constant so so we're done as far as that goes the next thing we do is try to look for a zero there's none given we don't have a complex zero they're not giving us a real zero here so we're gonna have to go through and find a zero the best way to approach that is to get a list of numbers that you can sort of guess and check so we're gonna do that we're to say all right how we develop this list rational zeros theorem it says we're going to take our last term our constant figure out the factors first term constant sorry our constant coefficient leading coefficient find all the factors and then create a list of numbers that are potential zeros for our polynomial so for 75 that's our p we get 1 and 75 not 2 that's not going to work but 3 and 25 4 is not going to work but 5 and 15. six doesn't work seven no eight no nine no ten no eleven no twelve no thirteen no fourteen no fifteen yes so we're in the board we're done that's how you go through and do it as soon as you cross this sort of bridge and you get from one factor to one you already know then you're done this is all the factors 75 and we have to include the fact that they could be positive and negative one thing we might consider doing is to cartridge the signs right now to determine what if if any we can eliminate so when we look at this we have zero zero zero one sign change what that says is there will be one positive x-intercept well that's that's interesting because that's a degree four it doesn't even have to have one but we know for sure this is going to have one positive x-intercept so maybe keep that in the back of our head if we want to change the signs of our odds so make that a minus and that a minus then we'd have one two three three sign changes so there's either gonna be three or one negative x-intercept if you don't remember that maybe go back and watch the card rule of science because i explained all of that in there how to change your your odd exponent to terms and then counter signs again sign changes again so one sign change two sign changes three sign changes that's not a sign change so it would be three sine changes gives you either three or one negative x intercept so keep that in the back of our head honestly what that means though is that we have to keep both positive and negative because we're going to have one positive we have at least one negative so we're going to keep our positive negative as far as our first term goes the coefficient there's one and the only factors of that are one and negative one which means that our list of numbers we take the p and divide by the q and so every sort of um permutation of that we can arrange we're going to get some we usually get some fractions out of this but here's all the numbers we need to check positive negative one one over one three over three five over five fifteen over one sorry one over one three over one five over one fifteen over one twenty five over one seven pi over one gives us this list same list as our ps here's what this represents it represents all the possible rational zeros of that polynomial it does not include complex it does not include square roots all it does is the rationals it's a good starting spot now if we go through all of this and exhaust it really kind of out of luck as far as what we know in this class so far so we check and we start with one start with the easy ones if you have fractions leave those last so start with one uh okay so one plus two plus 22 that's uh that's 25 plus 50 is 75 minus 75 to zero how high we're having i'm looking we know that one is a zero because when we evaluated it when we evaluated it when we plugged in one you get zero what's that mean if you plug in x equals one that means that your function height is zero you're on the x-axis that's exactly what we're looking for we're looking for zeros x-intercepts in this case and so we know that one is an x-intercept and that's going to create for us a factor we always show what we've done we always show what our x-intercept is we always show our factor here because this is what we're going to use to factor this the first thing we're going to write is f of x equals x minus 1 something something something something whatever that polynomial is and then we're going to continue so we know x minus 1 is a factor then you choose to either use long division with this dividing into this or you choose to use synthetic division with positive one not negative one we're going to use synthetic division so synthetic division we use the coefficients of our polynomial and we use the x-intercept not the factor the x-intercept so we use positive 1. and how this algorithm works is you bring down your first coefficient you multiply and you add you multiply and you add you multiply and you add you multiply and you add and you should end with a remainder of zero if you have authentically found an x-intercept this has to happen here's what it means we've reduced because we're factoring out remember since the division only works with linears only and so it's always reducing your degree by one for your polynomial that you're finding your quotient so we have reduced that power by one this is now going to be x to the third so we know our function a couple things about it we're going to have a factor of x minus 1. notice how a lot of students put x plus 1 because they go oh i factored out the plus 1. it's right there positive 1 x 1. no this is why i have you do this x equals 1 is your x intercept and that's what you use for synthetic division but x minus 1 is your factor this is why i taught you all those times to create your factors so that you have that pattern in your head the remaining part of the polynomial is factored as x to the third plus three x squared plus 25 x plus 75. so let's talk for a moment about this this is going to be factorable and we're going to factor by grouping in just a second it's really quick if it's not factorable by grouping we we talked about this in the rational zeros third video where you'd go back to your list and you'd try you'd actually try one again you'd say hey can i can i factor out a one well one plus 3 plus 1 no that's not going to work so i get a 0. can't try a negative 1. no can i try 3 negative 3 well maybe one of those will work if it's not factorable you go back to the same list and you start going through it again until you find another factor and you use synthetic division again on this polynomial same exact thing keep this factor you get additional factors because this is factorable by grouping we don't have to do that so always check that's why the last two examples are there always check factoring it's much quicker so when we look at four terms in our head we should be thinking let's factor by grouping if we can let's factor out an x squared let's factor out a 25. hey that's perfect that means that we have another factor of x plus 3 and then x squared plus 25. we already know that we have a factor of x minus 1. this is factored over the real number system this is completely factored we have a linear done linear done quadratic but it's irreducible you cannot factor x squared plus 25. now had it been x squared minus 25 yes difference of squares had it been x squared minus five absolutely that's still technically a difference of squares if you use the square root of five so yeah you could or if this was x squared um let's say minus six x minus thirteen yes you could do that quadratic formula so with those quadratics you run into one or two one of two cases either you can factor it or do quadratic formula or it's actually that's all that's all you can do you can factor or do quadratic formula you're either gonna get real numbers or you're gonna get complex numbers so as soon as you see a quadratic here try to factor it i can't all right well then set it equal to zero and do what the situation necessitates in other words setting this equal to zero we get by the zero product property x minus one equals zero and x plus three equals zero and x squared plus 25 equals zero and this gives us two real solutions oh think about it what are those are those crossings or are those bounces you should have that in your head that that's a multiplicity one multiple c one those are real solutions those are actual x-intercepts and they have to cross and cross due to the multiplicity then we get this x squared plus 25 and move it up here we talked about this in one of the last examples that if you have x squared plus some number it's not factorable but you can isolate the power 2 and simply take a square root if you have a middle term in here and you can't factor it firstly try to factor it again but if you still can't factor then just use the quadratic formula and the quadratic formula will work for any quadratic that you can't factor whether it gives you real numbers or not it'll work if you get some i's in there by a negative discriminant a negative inside your square root well then you know that you have some complex numbers if you don't they need real numbers and you have four real solutions here we are able to subtract 25 take a square root and get x equals plus or minus 5i and that gives us two additional solutions 5i and negative 5i if you were kind of curious about what i was saying before if you had like x squared minus 6x minus 13. that's still not easily factorable so you go um yeah i don't know how to factor that use the quadratic formula you're going to get real numbers here what about x squared x squared minus 6x plus 13 i still can't factor it what would you do there quadratic formula again but you're going to get imaginary numbers in that case so that's the way that i would say go through and do that so factor as much as you can when you get to the quadratic try to factor it but if not then quadratic formula will give you whatever you want now if we do need to continue to show all the solutions we've done it we have a degree four we have one two three four solutions if we need to show it as factored over the complex we can do our x minus one x plus 3 x minus 5 i that's from this one and x plus 5i remember you can set this x equals 5i subtract 5i get a factor x equals negative 5i add 5i and get another factor this is completely factorably complex if you had to do the quadratic formula on this like with a middle term or something in there then your complex numbers can get a little bit more complicated and this can be sort of nasty but it's possible don't give up on it so that's about all i want to say as far as that goes let's go into our last example and i go through the same process okay so here we go we have a degree four we should end with four solutions we know know the solutions right now so we're going to find out we're going to do the rational zeros theorem we're going to take our p and we're going to look at this and go hey there's one sign change that's one positive x-intercept one two three sign changes there's either three or one negative x-intercept very much like that's that example if you looked at it here's one positive here's one negative and two imaginary solutions so we're going to take a look at this as we go through and make sure that works so we're always using the card's rule of signs sort of as a a work saver and a work checker and then we're going to take our factors of our constant that's the p and our leading coefficient that's our q so 18 has factors of one and 18 2 and 9 3 and 6 and because we have both positive and negative x intercepts we're going to have to include both positive and negative factors for that if uh decartel assigned said hey you have no sign changes you have no positives then we'd just be looking at negatives and make it a lot easier for q we have one and three those are the only factors and so our list of things to check is going to be 1 2 3 6 9 18 1 3 2 3 1 2 3 and 6. so we get a lot of repetitions here so those are the whole numbers when we do our fractions we get one over three we get two over three we get three over three but that's one six over three but that's two 9 over 3 but that's 3 and 18 over 3 but that's 6. so we don't need to include those twice that's just redundant and then we're going to check so we're going to check g of 1. we're going to plug in 1. there's no way that if i plug in 1 that's going to give me 0. we'd try negative one but that's not going to work we try uh two two's not going to work we try negative two actually negative two is going to work if we evaluate g of negative two it gives us zero i've done this ahead of time to save time so i'm not gonna sit here and play a calculator but i have i actually tried one and negative one and two and then negative two and i finally got to one that worked so g of two sorry negative two gives me zero now what does that say what that says to us is that x equals negative 2 is an x-intercept awesome we don't know yet if it's a bounce or a cross but we know it's an x-intercept that also means that x plus 2 is a factor so that's what we're going to factor out so how do we do that how do we factor that out if you have a linear factor man i'm really going to suggest using the synthetic division so we're going to take our polynomial with our coefficients and our x intercept it's got to be the x intercept not plus 2 minus 2. and we follow our synthetic division algorithm we bring down our first coefficient we multiply and we add we multiply and we add we multiply let's see and we add we multiply and we add together well that looks pretty good what that means for us is that we know we know one factor we know that we have a factor over the reals of x plus two that's why we wrote that right there we also know that synthetic division reduces the degree of our polynomial into uh by one into a degree of this inside factor polynomial so three x to the third minus x squared plus 27 x minus nine that again is factorable that's a that's a four term polynomial this is something we should check for grouping every single time now if it wasn't factorable by grouping then we'd go back to our list you would not try one negative one or two again you try negative two again just to make sure it doesn't work and then you go through your list the next one we'd find would be uh one-third so it would take us a long time to get there which thank goodness this is factorable by grouping so factoring out x squared you get three x minus one and factoring out nine you get three forgot my x three x minus one and this is perfect this is what we want to see for fraction by grouping we have three x minus one and then we have an x squared plus nine if we bring down that factor of x plus 2 this is completely factored over the real number system but that's not what the the question is asking the question is asking for all of your zeros and so because this is completely factored over the real number system we're able to set this equal to zero and by the zero product property say x plus two would equal zero and three x minus one would equal zero and x squared plus nine would also equal zero even though it's a quadratic that's fine you can't factor that anymore you try you would try if it was x squared minus nine you're good to go you just use difference of squares or x squared minus two even minus two x plus two and x uh minus square root of two and x plus square root of two that's fine or if it was um yeah pretty much that's it if it's factorable you could do that it had three terms and you factored you could do that but we'd without that you said all these factors equal to zero so x plus two equals zero that's x equals negative two and x equals positive one third we add one divided by three that'd be way over there good thing we have to find that one and then x squared plus nine for the last time there's a couple cases here if you have something like this where you can isolate the power 2 do it take a square root you just get a very simple imaginary number if not if you can't factor it no matter what use the quadratic formula it will give you all the solutions because you can factor this into linears and irreducible quadratics so linears very easy irreducible quadratics quadratic formula it will still give you complex numbers no problem so we're going to subtract 9 take a square root with a plus and minus and get positive or negative 3i that's x equals 3i and x equals negative 3i those are the four solutions that we have hey look at that there's two reals we know we know we had to have that there was one sign change here that's one positive here's our one positive right there one third uh we had when we changed our signs of the odd powered terms we had one two three sign changes that's three or one negative x-intercepts here's our one negative x-intercept so there's two x-intercepts one on the positive one and the negative both of which are crosses because of our multiplicity and then there's two complex solutions that don't give us x-intercepts one two three four if you had to show this factored over reals this is it that's an irreducible quadratic if you had to show this factored over complex we just write factors from every solution there's four factors for degree four one last thing and then we're done please keep in mind that if you were to somehow know that one-third was a factor and you did synthetic division with one-third firstly it's going to work secondly this can look a little bit different so i'm going to show that to you and then be done if you were to factor this by taking that one-third this is good practice because we rarely see it this actually works with synthetic division of fractions just most people never get there so it's never practice so when you run into it you go bring down your your leading coefficient and multiply one-third times three is one when you add that you get six one-third times six is two when you add that you get twenty-seven one-third times twenty-seven it's nine when you add that you get fifty-four one-third of fifty-four is eighteen and when you add that you get zero it actually does work and it works fairly well even though it's a fraction they kind of scary at first but it's it's almost always a case unless you have another fraction there that you you end up getting these very simplifiable fractions when you start multiplying so that's that's pretty nice what i mean by this is that this factor can look a little different this right here would be x minus one third instead of three x minus one those need to be the same in your head so x equals one third if i multiply it by three and subtract one i get three x minus one if i just subtract one third i get x minus one third those are the two ways that we can write that factor so you'd see it this way or like that where you have a 3 that's been forcefully factored out of that if you distribute you'd get 3x minus 1. which way is preferable probably that one because there's a fraction in it but it doesn't really matter in terms of what we deal with so i hope this video i know it was a long one oh it makes sense but it had to be long because it wraps up pretty much everything we've learned about polynomials in terms of solving for their zeros whether the complex or the real and now i feel like i've given you a very very thorough explanation of what you do uh when you get into this even to the point of hey what if you can't do that what if this is not factorable or solving for x squared using quadratic formula and i've shown you how to do that as well so i hope this made sense uh we're going to switch gears now we're going to start working on rational functions how to uh how to graph those it's going to be very cool we're going to use multiplicity to do some pretty neat things so see for that hope you guys doing well 

Transcript for: Finding Vertical Asymptotes of Rational Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 38)
hi welcome to another video so in this video we're going to start talking about rational functions and they're exciting they're fractions but they're kind of exciting because we get some very cool pictures out of them we can graph them and i'm going to teach you some great techniques on how to graph rational functions as easily as i can make it for you and how we start with that is understanding really what a rational function is that they are fractions and fractions can cause some domain problems when we're talking about functions that polynomials couldn't so here's what rational functions really are rational functions are fraction functions where we have variables on both the numerator and the denominator the denominator is required to have variables on it otherwise you really get a polynomial because you could just divide every term on the numerator by a constant on the denominator and create this polynomial that had fractions as coefficients that's not really what we're talking about we're talking about a polynomial divided by a polynomial that has variables on both the numerator denominator those can cause some really interesting things to happen so when we're talking about these these fraction functions we really need to understand that because we do have variables on the denominator we can get some domain issues now you should remember about domain like when we talked about fractions you oh yeah the denominator can't equal zero and if it does equal zero on the denominator or bottom of a fraction we get some problems what we're going to do is start defining those problems as graph issues you see we get two types of graph issues so what you're going to learn in this video is that when your denominator equals zero we are either going to get a hole in our function graph goes along misses a point exactly one point and continues it actually kind of meets that hole we'll use that we will absolutely use that when we're graphing or we get what's called a vertical asymptote it's like a force field it's like this graph goes along goes oh no and then or off and it can't touch it there's no way for this graph to interact with that vertical asymptote well i won't say interact touch this vertical asymptote and so we get get one of those two ideas so our job is really to discuss when you get a hole and when you get a vertical asymptote the hole only looks one way there's a hole you just kind of miss a point don't miss the point and then vertical asymptote what those things are vertical asymptotes is plural a vertical asymptote that individual is one and you might have several so that's what we say there are can be several vertical asymptotes it's not called a vertical asymptotes don't do that i've heard lots of students say that but asymptote like that is an individual so we're going to talk about the kind of the four ways you can see those i'm not going to give you anything definitive on oh you're always going to get this or this or this which happens to be my four favorite dance moves but uh but we will talk about that you will get those and i'll show you later when we get to sketching and graphing rational functions when those happen so let's get right into it so if fractions cause domain problems and if the denominator of a rational function equals zero and we know that we get those domain problems what those really are called is a discontinuity it's where your graph goes along and then you miss a point or you get this place where you can't continue like a force field like a vertical asymptote those things don't happen in polynomials polynomials are smooth fully continuous curves for the entire domain which is all real numbers so they go forever and ever creating these really smooth curves rational functions can have some some hiccups uh some missing things so if your denominator equals zero if the denominator of a rational function equals zero we do get a domain problem and discontinuity at that value of x the x that makes that denominator zero it has very little to do with the numerator so what do you use the numerator for really x-intercepts the numerator will give you x-intercepts and it will also tell you whether your denominator is a whole or a vertical asymptote so we'll be comparing that now these things these domain issues these values of x they will also cause graph issues we're going to jump right into what those are so if your denominator equals 0 at this x then at x there's going to be one of two types of discontinuities the first is a whole or what's called a removable discontinuity now why they call it removable is that if you define your function with just one additional point you can put that point in there and you can fix the discontinuity that's what's called a removable discontinuity as you get into calculus you might hear that it means nothing more than a hole in your graph so don't let this phrase really confuse you you can call it a whole and everybody's understand what you're talking about um the removable part of it is you can fill the hole with one point that's it so what happens when the factor and so here's what here's when you get these you'll get a hole when the factor that is causing your denominator to equal 0 can be cancelled now what would it be canceled with well it would be cancelled with something on the numerator and you heard me say about a minute ago that the numerator will tell you whether your domain problem is a hole or a vertical asymptote so here's the whole rundown of what we do with these first thing we do is we look at our fraction function our rational function and we factor the whole thing then what we do is we look at our denominator we take those factors that we have um and we set them equal to zero and we discovered that hey all those factors that are equal to zero are going to cause so some domain issues for us the ones that you can cancel stand for holes the ones that you can't stand for vertical asymptotes now here's the deal you can't just cancel them and say i don't have a hole anymore i fixed it you can never fix domain problems it's oh man it sets the world it's kind of like baggage and relationships it never goes away it's always hidden it says it's right there right and sometimes it pops back up you can't get rid of that stuff like it follows you and so that's kind of what a hole does it's going to look like it's gone you're going to cancel it but all that's telling you is that what you just canceled out is a hole in your function it's going to go along like this you're going to go long you're going to be missing a point and then it's going to continue that's what a hole or a removable discontinuity looks like is it continuous no it's not you go like this and you go oh i can't continue on without lifting my pencil off the paper it's not you're not allowed to do do this you go around you that circle's there so you're missing a point so you're going you jump you miss a point that's called a hole uh one thing about this what's very interesting is that in calculus we talk about limits and the limit would actually exist here from left and right it goes to the same value the value itself is not there which is why it's disk it's a discontinuity it's not continuous but the limit actually does exist we get there interesting uh so we're going to use and actually these are really useful because we're going to use these as tight a type of point i know the point's not there but it is something your graph has to interact with so if we can find the location of a hole we know the graph has to sort of touch it not complete it and leave it so we're going to use that we're going to use it kind of like a point so the whole rundown about holes is we factor and you look at your factors on the denominator if you have more than one if you have one fine that's whatever that is we look at them and if you can cancel them then that domain problem is going to be a whole so we factor we find our domain problems and then we define them i'm going to show you how to do that after i talk about a vertical asymptote and what that means so if we can cancel it then what you just defined is a whole and we can find the value of that whole find out where that is so what happens if you can't cancel that factor well vertical and vertical asymptote happens when the factor that's causing your denominator equal to zero it can't be cancelled and here's what they look like they kind of man i like star wars so it kind of reminds me of force field or like a star trek or whatever it's it's like this thing where i always used to picture it now i'm going to really maybe date myself here but like star wars episode 6 when they're going to the death star if you haven't watched it spoiler alert here and there's always one dude that that doesn't pull up in time like they hit the foreshore up make the force of every movie that has force field that happens well this is kind of like a force field so this graph is going to have to pull up before it hits it or go down before it gets it and it cannot cross it why because at that value your denominator would equal zero we know that that is not okay so if your denominator equals zero here you're just frankly missing a point if your denominator equals zero here and you cannot cancel out that factor then what you end up getting is you end up getting this going to infinity sort of idea and that has to do with when you're dividing a number that's uh that's very close to zero you either get positive or negative infinity for instance take like a hundred and divide it by one you're going to get a hundred take a hundred and divided by point one you're going to get a thousand point zero one you're gonna get ten thousand take a hundred and divide by point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one and you're gonna get something that's really really really really big or really really really really negative depending on whether you're divided by a positive or negative number and so that's kind of what happening if this value equals zero on your graph then something just to the left of it and just to the right of it is either going to cause something really close to positive infinity or really close to negative infinity and for that reason i'd kind of just described limits to you here's what happens you're going to get one of four looks your graph is going to look like this or this like this or like that those are the four cases that you're ever going to get with a vertical asymptote and you can have several on one graph here's the main points a whole happens when you have a factor that causes your denominator to be zero and and you can cancel out vertical asymptote happens when the denominator has a factor in it that creates it let me repeat that happens when there's a factor on the denominator that causes your denominator equals zero and you can't cancel it you're gonna have one of four cases here you have all of these things in one graph uh what we're going to be doing here is when we start identifying those factors that cause your denominator to be equal to zero we're going to identify whole or vertical asymptote you're going to have one of four cases where these four cases happen this is kind of interesting man i hope you remember about multiplicity if the multiplicity of the factor that's causing your denominator to equal zero is even you're going to get one of these two looks if it's odd you're going to get one of these two looks so odd multiplicity had a lot to do with whether we're crossing the x axis or even had to do with withered bouncing for vertical asymptote a vertical asymptote or vertical asymptotes the the multiplicity of the factor that's causing your denominator to be equal to zero is going to tell you whether you're doing this odd opposite or even symmetrical sort of a multiplicity you're going to either opposite infinities or the same infinity so these two are going to happen when you have odd multiplicity for your denominator factors odd multiplicity when you have the same sort of symmetry that comes from evenness and this is going to come when you have even multiplicity for your denominator factors that's about it what we're going to do right now is i'm going to give you some examples because this this is not vague i've explained it well on what these things are but it's still sort of sort of out there we haven't made it concrete yet in terms of examples so the long story hopefully made short is you are going to be looking at your denominator you're going to factor you're going to set it equal to zero and you're going to identify that you have several one or several domain issues then what you're going to do you're going to look at the factors that are giving you your domain problems you're going to look to see if that particular factor can be cancelled if it can be canceled then the domain problem you just identified is a whole you cancel the factor out you plug in the value you find the hole and it gives you kind of a type of point you're going to use a graph if you look at the factor and you cannot cancel it then what you've just identified is called a vertical asymptote we put a little dotted line actually force field we absolutely do use our graph to interact with this it's a very strong graphing tool but your graph cannot touch it it causes discontinuities in either case it's just a different type of discontinuity you can have one of four types of vertical asymptotes with odd multiplicity you're either doing this or you're doing this with even you're this or you're doing this and it kind of depends on the sign around it so we're going to be looking at that as we get into sketching i can't tell you right now oh you're always going to get this one with odd it that's not true it really depends on how your signs are interacting around that vertical asymptote the reason why this one goes to infinity and infinity and these two infinities is because when you divide by zero it's undefined you cannot plug in a point and do that but something just to the left and to the right of zero is dividing some number by a number that's very very very very very small dividing any number by a number that's very very very very very small that's going to give you a very large number either positive or negative that's why we get these infinities so let's take a look at some examples and get a feel for uh holes and vertical asymptotes a little bit more clearly all right so we're ready to identify whether or not we're going to have some domain issues and what those domain issues are one thing i want to caution you on is just because you have a rational function these are all rational functions we have a polynomial over a polynomial and a fraction so that means variables on both the numerator and the denominator just because you have that doesn't mean that you have to have domain issues it just means that if you do have domain issues where your denominator equals zero and that's the only type of demand issues that we are going to have and rational functions there's no square roots here no logarithms nothing like that if you're going to have them we can define them furthermore if you know how to define them you can use them to graph so it's kind of nice to have these things and understand what they are because we use them to graph very easily so let's take a look at the first example if you heard what i said in the first part of the video we're basically just going to factor everything both the numerator and the denominator we're going to do that first so we look at f of x we have x plus 3 over x minus 4 that's already totally factored so when i teach you to sketch what i'm going to be doing is telling you we're going to find x intercepts y intercepts vertical asymptotes horizontal asymptotes oblique asymptote if there is one there's either horizontal or oblique and then we're going to find a few points and we're going to be using that to sketch or graph these rational functions right now or just on like the first step so we're going to factor we're going to look at our denominator first and you're going to say hey let's set that set that equal to zero and see what we get out of it so what we do first we factor everything we say okay we're done let's set the denominator equal to zero and you're going to solve that so we're sort of using the zero product property after we factor this already factored so it becomes its own factor we set that equal to zero and then go okay let's solve that would be x equals four then what we do is we we're adding four to both sides then what we do is we look at the factor from where we got that discontinuity this right here says one thing about this function this is if you allow x to equal four you're gonna have a serious problem you're gonna have seven over zero wait a minute can you have zero on the bottom of your fraction no you can't why it's undefined like there's no way to get that it'd be saying you're taking seven real pieces out of something that doesn't exist it's impossible for us to define that scenario it's it's we cannot do it so that is something that's in undefined that's a domain problem so we know on our domain that we would say all right uh domain would be all real numbers except that x can't equal four if it does equal four we have a big problem so from what we know though we're going to look back at that factor and determine whether we can cancel that or not because what that's going to do is say okay yeah you ca kind of weird statement that yeah you can't allow x to equal four so at x equals four what you have one of these two things where you can't allow x to equal four you either have a whole or you have a vertical asymptote in what way can't you let x equal four where you're simply missing a point or whether you have sort of a force field like a vertical asymptote this is where we look back at our factors all right look at x minus four and look at x plus three can you cancel the x minus four if you see another factor of x minus four in the numerator the answer's yes and this would become a whole well we don't see that we look at x minus four you go well the only other factor is x plus three can i cancel x minus four with x 3. no i can't and that right there defines what this is so so again we factor everything got it we look at our denominator and set those factors equal to 0 and we solve them first no matter what you do not cancel first we solve them first this gives us their domain it says hey i can't have these values okay how can't you have them uh well i can't have them because i i can't cancel this that means this is a vertical asymptote so at x equals 4 we have a vertical asymptote more than that we're going to look at the multiplicity of the factor that gives us that vertical asymptote holes don't really have a multiplicity you don't really care that much about them but for vertical asymptote or vertical asymptote vertical asymptotes we do so we look back and go okay that had a multiplicity of one that's odd i don't really care about the value of that that power i care that it is odd here's what that means at x equals four we are going to have either this or that in this one case just because we have a positive out front there's nothing fancy going on we're going to have this case it is certainly going to look like this that's what's going to happen around that x equals 4. we have an odd vertical odd multiplicity vertical asymptote gonna look like one of those specifically this one in general you can't tell unless it's sort of a simple rational function if there was a negative up front we would switch that around so it looks like that and that's pretty much the whole thing so we're going to move on we're going to do a few more of these to get the real feel for how vertical asymptotes interact with our graph and then we'll be good to go so let's look at the next one we're looking at g of x we got negative 2 over x minus 1 to the second power we're going to go through the same process so we're looking to go all right we're going to factor both the numerator and the denominator well the numerator is factored and the denominator is factored i've kind of made these easy because we know how to factor we're going to spend a whole lot of time doing that so we look at that and go okay that's factored the next thing we do is we take our denominator and we set the factors equal to zero i don't need you to set x minus one squared equal to 0 i need to treat this sort of like we treated x-intercepts and go all right what's the real factor the real factor is x minus 1 you just happen to have it twice which is where we get multiplicity it's a repeated asymptote in this case so we're going to set x minus one equal to zero and we're gonna solve it so we get x equals one now here's what that means so we take a look and i go okay what was the purpose in us setting our denominator equal to zero or the factors of the denominator equal to zero we're basically saying that's a problem that's a real problem because if you know this you know that if your denominator equals zero we have some domain issues we just never defined those before you've known this since uh intermediate algebra when you did rational functions usually it's like chapter seven in that that class uh so you do this you go all right uh that's a problem i just know that domain-wise i can't have one now we're saying how we can't have it i know that's a weird statement but it's going to fall into one of two categories either a whole or a vertical asymptote so we look back at this we go right i know that x cannot equal one so at x equals one we have one of two discontinuities that actually needs to make sense to you if you can't let x equals one which is true you cannot have that then at x equals one we have a problem you're defining the problem do you see how we make a little switch there you can't let x equals one for the function and so we have one of two problems at x equals one so then we're going to look and see what we have so we look back at our our factor here we look at our numerator and we see whether we can cancel this factor with anything on the numerator and you go uh yeah no there's there's no factor up there besides two or you can consider it negative two but there's nothing that will allow us to cancel the x minus one so you simply say no i can't cancel it if we cannot cancel the factor then we do not have a whole we have a vertical asymptote so we're gonna write that so we have a vertical asymptote some something like a force field where your graph cannot touch it certainly interacts with it but it cannot touch it now we're going to define a little further look back at the factor from where we got that vertical asymptote okay this came from the factor of x minus one that has a multiplicity of two that's an even vertical asymptote even multiplicity even vertical asymptote so what that says to us is that this vertical asymptote is going to look like this or like this when we graph it it's either going to do that due to the nature of even is typically symmetrical about the why even functions are so this is sort of symmetrical about a type of y a vertical asymptote is a type of y it just sort of shifted over wait a minute do you remember that adding or subtracting inside of a function is a left shift or a right shift that's actually actually a shift of the y equals one over x squared graph shifted to the left one spot and reflected wait what that's a vertical asymptote it looks just like this that's what that is in the next video we're going to graph some of those with transformations it's going to make this stuff really gel together you just need to understand a vertical asymptote before we actually get there which is why we're doing this so this is a vertical asymptote it's going to be even so we're going to have this going to the same sort of infinity either positive or negative i know because i've done the transformations already that that negative makes it go downward so it's going to look just like this around that x equals 1. we're going to have the vertical asymptotes so you might have a question right now um what what are the numerators have to do with anything well the numerators will let you know two things number one if you can cancel that factor it's going to let you know that you had a hole if you can't it's gonna let you know you had a vertical asymptote for this particular x value for which you got a domain problem and you look at the the exponent of your factor from where you got that it also tells your x-intercepts so it is valuable it's just not going to give you any specifics for a vertical asymptote what other than it is one or it's a whole so here your x-intercept would be negative three you set your numerator equal to zero for those here you don't have an x-intercept so negative two can't equal zero so this would say you're not crossing the x-axis ever how could that look is it possible to have this vertical asymptote without touching the x-axis the answer is what this graph really looks like it's about like that now i haven't found the y-axis y-intercept that's gonna be negative 2. uh i haven't found that but that's about what that graph looks like we're going to study that next time okay let's move on a little bit so we're looking at h of x we're saying hey 2x over x squared minus 4. the first thing that we're going to do in graphing or finding any sort of discontinuity is we're going to factor everything so we look at our numerator and go okay that's factored look at our denominator you go all right i can factor that as x minus 2 and x plus 2 due to the fact that it's a difference of squares then what we do is we define our domain you don't start looking to cancel right now you're defining right now so we look at all of our factors on our denominator that have variables so we see x minus two we see x plus two we're going to set both of those equal to zero sorted by the zero product property if you set your whole denominator equal to zero then you can set each factor equal to zero right that's the zero product property we're just sort of shortcutting that we're going all right i'm gonna set all of my factors equal to zero because if any of these factors that have a variable are equal to 0 on my denominator it makes the whole denominator equal to 0. that's why we factor first because it lets us identify this stuff and we're going to keep going and say all right i'm going to add 2 i'm going to subtract 2 and these are my two domain issues these are values that i cannot plug into my function right now if i do i get something divided by 0. i get a real number either 4 or negative 4 divided by 0 in either of these two cases try for yourself if you want to that means that we have domain problems this is an issue so our domain says we cannot let those happen if you want to write your domain that's pretty much it there's other ways to write that but that's pretty much it so yeah i can't let that happen and by the way we've studied interval notation for domain we studied set builder notation for domain so we've done that before this is just saying you can't let these things happen keep that in mind please understand this when you find your domain problems like this these are values that you're not allowing this and this just defines how you're not allowing it are you not allowing it by making it a whole that's if you could cancel them or one or are you defining it by making it a verbal asymptote that's if you can't you get a force field out of it so we're defining now what these domain problems are going to create graphically did how do you see that i hope you see that these values can't happen now we're defining graphically what that looks like so we look back at the factors that gave us these domain issues we look back at x minus two we go oh that had a multiplicity of one what that means is that this factor with the multiplicity one gave us this discontinuities that x can't equal two so we're going to define how that looks at x equals two graphically so at x equals two what type of discontinuity did you have what type of i can't equal this do you have well because it has that's you cannot cancel that factor so i can't cancel x minus 2 i look at the numerator can't cancel it so at x equals 2 and because of our odd multiplicity i have a vertical asymptote with odd multiplicity so i know right now that at x equals two we sort of get this sort of force field where we're going to be interacting with it in one of these two ways the same exact thing is going to happen here so we look at that and say yeah i can't allow x to equal negative two how can't you allow it with a whole or vertical asymptote let me take a look at my factor at x equals negative 2 i got that from x plus 2. that factor cannot be canceled there's no x plus 2 factor in the numerator it also has a multiplicity 1 so this is also a vertical asymptote with odd multiplicity and we're going to do that every single time you get a lot of vertical asymptotes with odd multiplicity just saying that's very very very common if you want to look at your numerator you should right now start to kind of be thinking do i have any x intercepts there and you do actually x 2x would equal zero x equals zero is an x intercept so your y intercept is zero and your x-intercept is also zero here so that's kind of neat now the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to do this one that's the last one we have we're going to see both a hole and a vertical asymptote let's show you where we get the the whole idea from and how to define that missing point all right so let's go for it the first thing we do whenever we get a rational function we're trying to graph it or trying to find the asymptotes or we're trying to find the x-intercepts we basically factor everything we define our our denominator our domain first always first and then we start defining um what that domain means graphically after that we do x-intercepts and the reason why we don't go the other way is because occasionally like here you'd start to find x-intercepts first and then you'd cross them out and go well what happened i crossed that x-intercept no that was actually a hole you just didn't realize it because we did it backwards so we factor everything first on the numerator that means x minus three and x plus three on the denominator that means x plus seven and x minus 3. that's x squared plus 4x minus 21. so here's the here's what to do and what not to do what not to do first don't run off and say oh i have x intercepts at 3 and negative 3. no you don't um here's what also what not to do i'm just going to cancel this to make it easier don't do that define your denominator first this is your baggage even though you can cancel these and you will just be patient even though you can cancel those that baggage stays with this function this says you can't plug in three you ain't never gonna be able to plug in three ever like you could define the function differently and allow one point but you cannot let that three happen ever in the function the way that it's written so trust me we're gonna factor first and then we're gonna define the domain how we do that is to look at the factored denominator and set each of those factors equal to zero pretty much by the zero product property so x plus seven equals zero and x minus three equals zero and that's going to give us two problems or two two discontinuities on this graph so if we subtract seven we get x equals negative seven if we add three to x equals three now keep in mind what that means these are values that are not allowed in this function if you allow x to equal negative seven you're gonna have a value over zero if you allow x equal three you can have zero over zero zero over zero isn't that one no it's not a one it's a problem it's a problem anytime your denominator equals zero so these guys are here they're kind of bad guys like these are things as far as our functions are they can't handle so we have just found our domain x cannot equal negative seven and x cannot equal positive 3. those are not okay those are discontinuities in both cases do this first let your denominator define your domain for you first then we start defining what these discontinuities look like you go okay i know i can't allow x to equal negative seven and i know i can't allow x over three but what's that mean for us like how does that look this is where we go back and we go okay let's take a look at the x equals negative or can't equal negative seven first that came from a factor of x plus seven so we're gonna look at that factor can you cancel out that factor with the numerator no i don't see any x plus seven factors up there so what that's telling us is that because i cannot cancel out this factor that's going to create this thing where i get a number over 0 and i any anything that's really close to that zero so like if i plugged in 7.000001 i'd get a number over something very very very small that's going to give me either a positive or a negative infinity depending on the signs if i plugged in six point uh negative six point nine nine nine nine nine so negative seven point zero zero zero zero one or negative six point nine nine nine in either case i'm going to get like number divided by something super close to zero well what that's going to do is that's going to give me something that's going to positive or negative infinity that's why this thing is a vertical asymptote so this cannot be canceled it says you're going to get something that's that you can divide by really close to zero giving you a infinity sort of concept so all that to say at x equals negative seven we have a vertical asymptote and because the factor has a power one it's an odd odd multiplicity vertical asymptote looks like this or like that so that's we're going to get graphically then we continue go okay we also know that x equals 3 is a problem we already defined our domain you do this first every single time you define your domain first for rational functions then we go right because i can't have that in what way can't i have it do i have a whole or a vertical asymptote i'm going to look back at my factor x equals 3 or x can't equal 3 came from x minus 3 that factors right here so i look back at my function oh look at that i can cancel that factor what that does is that says at x equals 3 you are going to have a hole now here's what to do with that hole a lot of textbooks and and teachers i've seen just say oh you have a hole there great but it's very confusing as to what that hole does is that hole in the x-axis is the whole like where where is that hole you need to find where the hole is you need to find that missing point don't miss that point like you need to do the next step here's what to do and do it in this order factor define your domain define what those domain issues are like we've just done for a vertical asymptote you're defining what type you have either odd or even this or this or the reflective version of those depending on the multiplicity of your factor when you get to a hole cross it out and this will allow you to redefine your function you see the reason why we don't do this first is because a lot of times if you let students cross these out first they miss the fact they have a hole but the fact that this does simplify leaves you with a simpler function now this is quite interesting and this is where students come up with a very common misconception like oh well can't i plug in three here now like if i that doesn't have a domain problem anymore yeah exactly that's what it looks like that's why you define your domain first because here it certainly does look like you can plug in three in fact we're going to but here's what we're gonna do with it this says you can't plug in three you already know that you defined it don't change it this never changes you can't ever make the the domain better you only make it worse so this does not get fixed you can never plug in three but if we allow ourselves to plug in three here listen carefully this will show us exactly where that hole is on our graph the thing that our function must intersect with so it's basically finding a point so if i plug in 3 so allow this to plug in the thing that you can't plug in we would get three plus three is six over ten three plus three is six over three plus seven is ten if we simplify that we get uh what three fifths so divide by two we get three-fifths here's what that means for us there will be a hole at exactly the point three comma three-fifths now we'd use that we'd say all right i'm gonna go to the the value or graphical value if you want the point three comma three fifths so over one two three up like just a little bit and i'd put a hole there i'd say at that value right here you're gonna have a hole so your graph looks something like this it's going to come to that missing point and that's going to continue it's kind of an awkward looking graph but it's very valuable here's the last thing i'm going to say to you and then we're going to end this graph will look exactly like this graph that's hard for students understand this cancelling out it does make this graph look like this graph the only exception between these two is that this will have a missing point right there so this graph looks like this one this graph itself would not have the missing point but because it came from this one we defined our missing point we said okay now what to do with this hole plug it in to get the value of where that hole is it's right there and this graph is going to look just like that one we'd graph them the same exact way hey does that still have a vertical asymptote at x equals negative seven yes it's still odd yes does the house still have an x intercept at three or negative three yes just like that one this does not have an x-intercept positive three that was cancelled out so these graphs will look identical beside the fact that it has a missing point or a hole so i hope that makes sense i hope that you have an idea of when you get vertical asymptotes and when you get holes that's about all i want to do right now we'll continue with different types of asymptotes and talk about graphing a little bit later have a great day 

Transcript for: Graphing Rational Functions with Transformations (Precalculus - College Algebra 39)
hey there everybody welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about some rational functions as they relate to transformations the main thing i want you to get out of this video is the interplay between two new functions and their vertical asymptotes or each vertical asymptote that these these functions have the oddness and the evenness of multiplicity what that looks like this is a great video that gives us kind of a a stepping stone onto graphing rational functions because these two graphs are going to help us really deal with how a function kind of interplays with a vertical asymptote when we get to rational functions and we deal with those vertical asymptotes as a whole so we're going to study two new functions we're going to look at their asymptotes there's a horizontal and a vertical we'll deal with some key points we're going to try and do some transformations but as we go through this remember what i want you to get out of it i want you to see how the the function interplays with the vertical asymptote that's what i'm trying to get you to see here so let's take a look at the first first two functions we have two functions f of x equals one over x and then f of x equals one over x squared this first function is called the reciprocal function sometimes they're both rational functions but this has a special name called the reciprocal function so if you ever ask for that that's what they're referring to and we're going to go ahead and graph them the first thing i want to do is what we practiced last time dealing with a vertical asymptote you know this that the first thing we do in graphing is look at the domain so let's take a look at the domain of one over x and right off the bat we see that if x equals zero we have a pretty serious problem you remember this that we'd factored this it's already factored it set every factor on the denominator that's just x equal to zero and that defines our domain so we'd say okay we cannot allow x to equal zero so at x equals zero we have something that's not allowed either a hole or a vertical asymptote that's the way in which we can't allow x to equal zero so we're going to say it that's kind of what we're doing so we'd set x equals zero and say that's a problem that creates this domain issue for us and that defines a graph issue so we look at x we say hey at x equals zero that factors uh that factor is causing a problem for us so let's see if we can cancel the factor out if we can then that's a whole if we can't then that is a vertical asymptote and we say well we can't cancel out x there's no way to do that so at x equals zero we have what is called a vertical asymptote it's going to abbreviate va for vertical asymptote and then we notice that the power of x is 1. that gives us an odd multiplicity vertical asymptote and as we studied in the last video we know that odd vertical asymptotes behave like this or like this depend on some signs so this is odd here's what i want you to associate with odd vertical asymptotes that the odd means opposite so odd or opposite infinity so if you can remember that odd multiplicity for vertical asymptotes means opposite infinities that's kind of the same idea for odd x-intercepts that was opposite sides that's why they had to cross here we have opposite infinities you don't cross anything with them because they're it's not continuous but they go to opposite infinities and we talked about why that was in that video so here's what we know about this we know right now that at x equals 0 we have a vertical asymptote we're going to show that with a vertical dotted line and so what that sort of is is like a force field this graph cannot touch that and but it's going to interact with it it's going to come up to it and either go up or down depending on some signs we're going to figure this this out in a minute but it cannot cross it that's why this this function is not continuous across the entire x-axis it is on its domain because the domain excludes x equals zero but not on the entire x-axis let's go ahead and do the two of the things we need for transformations number one i'm just going to tell you right now that this thing has a horizontal asymptote we're going to study this in the very next video like when you would get a horizontal asymptote i'm going to show you right now that end behavior can give you a horizontal asymptote this horizontal line that your function actually can cross but ultimately at the end behavior is going to tend to to that value and so this horizontal asymptote is at y equals zero horizontal remember y equals a value vertical as x equals horizontal is y equals and this is going to be zero how i know that is because if you let x increase without bound or decrease without bound so in other words it's this idea of a limit a limit is take x and let it approach never really get there but approach some value get really really really really really really close to or get closer and closer and closer to some value if we let x increase to like positive infinity and one stays the same well then one divided by a number that's really really really really really really really big is very very very very very very very close to zero does it ever equal zero no it doesn't and that's the idea of a limit in as simple as i can make it for you let's let x go to negative infinity well one divided by something that's really really really really big in absolute value but negative is still going to be close to zero but sort of a negative approaching of zero so this graph has that horizontal asymptote at y equals 0. we're going to show that with another dotted line and so we know this has two asymptotes it has a vertical it's got a horizontal at x equals 0 and y equals 0 respectively now we're going to talk about some key points so the key points here are well really just found by trying to plug in some values now we know we can't evaluate zero why not well that's a domain restriction but we can evaluate at x equals one and x equals negative one and you remember that key points are really important for our transformations we're gonna use them here too and they're really just trying to plug in one zero and negative one if we can't plug in zero we just plug in one negative one so let's evaluate let's put in 1. 1 divided by 1 is 1. so we're going to have this key point of 1 1. and likewise if we evaluate for negative 1 1 divided by negative one is negative one so we have negative one negative one and you might have kind of guessed by the exponent that multiplicity was one and so we might assume that this is an odd function well our key points bear that out and the way that our signs interact also bear that out so even an oddness is usually just power functions of polynomials but when we take a look at this this at least that's where you get the name from this is an odd function and so we do have the symmetry about the origin so if you take this picture and rotate 180 degrees you're getting the same picture what that means is that when we graph this we have to interact appropriately with our asymptotes and still make it through our key points so here's how this function absolutely has to to look and if you think about it if you plug in positive values you're going to get positive values you're going to be in this first quadrant if you plug in negative values of x you're going to be getting out negative values you're going to be in the third quadrant so how this function looks it's about like that it gives you a very very good look at what nearly every well not near i can't say nearly every asymptote looks like but all odd asymptotes are going to have this sort of relationship either this or if that was negative it would reflect notice how the signs would reflect if you had a negative here negative 1 over x then positives would give you negatives negatives would give you positives it would reflect this image so this right here is how every single odd vertical asymptote multiplicity one or three or five or odd is going to look odd means opposite infinities it's a very good practicing tool for us when we get to graphing rationals understand that a odd vertical asymptote is going to look like that odd means opposite infinity so keep that in the back of your head now let's move on to the next one we're going to do the same thing but but pretty quick so we're going to do kind of likewise what we did over here we're going to take our domain and say all right let's look at our function and it's completely factored all right how we deal with domain is we take every factor in the denominator and we set it equal to zero well there's only one factor there's x it happens to be repeated but there's only one factor so we say hey if we take that factor and set it equal to zero we are going to have a domain issue x can't equal 0. now we look back at that that x can you cancel out the factor that's giving you the domain problem if you can you have a hole if you can't you have a vertical asymptote well we can't so we define our domain and using the domain and the fact that we cannot cancel any factors helps us to find to define what happens at that value of x for which this function is not defined so at x equals 0 we have a problem this says you can't allow x equals you can't allow x equals zero and now we're saying how you can't allow it are you not allowing it by it being a whole just a missing point or are you not allowing it by a vertical asymptote and for the same reason we had over here we are going to have a vertical asymptote however the multiplicity matters multiplicity of a vertical asymptote will tell you how it behaves so when we look at that go hey that's a that's a multiplicity 2 for the factor that gave us a domain problem for the factor that caused a vertical asymptote that multiplicity 2 is even well an even vertical asymptote does something different than an odd vertical asymptote odd has opposite infinities even has this idea of symmetry across this vertical line it has this idea of same infinities either both up or both down so when we take a look at that all right well we know we have a vertical asymptote we're going to do the same thing we're going to draw that vertical line at x equals zero so that's x equals zero just like this one was this also has a horizontal asymptote for the limit ideas but i want you to look at it if i start plugging in really really really really big positive numbers by the way i'm trying to preface our next our next video on horizontal asymptotes here just to get your your brain kind of rolling on it if i start plugging in really really big values of x i'm going to get really really really little numbers and a fraction so one divided by like a billion is close to zero a billion's not even close to infinity so like one divided by a billion squared oh my gosh that's like super close to zero one divided by a trillion squared that's even closer to zero so as i go this way for a long way this function is going to get super close to zero even faster than this one did now let's plug in some negative numbers if i plug in negative numbers but wait a minute i'm squaring them if you take a negative number and you square it you end up still getting a positive well that's true so if i take really negative numbers like negative a billion and i square it i'd still get one over a billion squared it's going to be a perfectly symmetrical graph man i need you to see that i need to see that this graph has symmetry across the y-axis y because that's a vertical asymptote because if i plug in positives and negatives x squared takes the same value for those if i plug in one or negative one negative a billion or positive a billion i'm going to get the same exact values out it's a mirror image so this models perfectly how an even vertical asymptote works it's going to say well well yeah i mean if it's symmetrical you have to be going to the same infinity if this is opposite you have to go into different infinities the signs would be different here so we know that this is going to look like this if this is positive or if i put a negative in front i get all negative values so no matter what if i plug in any number here right now is the way it is i'm getting all positives if i put a negative in front of that and i square it and then make everything negative i get all negative values so we know what that's going to look like this also has a horizontal asymptote for the same reasons that one did um and i just explained that so as we go to positive and negative infinity a limit idea says what's the value of the function approaching what's it getting to as your x gets to this value so as our x gets a negative infinity this function is getting close to zero as x gets a positive infinity this function is getting close to zero it's doing the same thing on both sides it has that symmetry now we're going to do our key points so key points work the same way as this did if i plug in 1 hey 1 divided by 1 squared is still 1. we can't evaluate zero we have already talked about why it's not even defined there but we can evaluate negative one if i evaluate negative one negative one squared is one one divided by one is positive one and we get the same look for even functions that we got for odd functions here we have that if now i hope you remember this for every odd function we had the key points of 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 negative 1. now we're missing the 0 0 because of the domain restriction but we have the same key points as 1 1 and negative 1 negative 1. for even we always got 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 positive 1. well we're missing 0 0 again for domain restriction but we have the same key points at least these two key points is every other even function giving us that symmetry across that vertical line which i want you to see as an asymptote now we're going to go ahead and evaluate so or sorry how to graph it so when we graph it we have to behave with both our vertical and horizontal asymptote it's going to be a little bit more dynamic of a graph than this it's going to get smaller quicker about like that kind of mess up that side but you should get the feel for it so before we move on to transformations i just want to make sure that you see what i'm trying to get you to see number one that these functions model what an odd vertical asymptote and an even vertical asymptote will look like all of the time yes you can reflect this yes you can reflect this so even vertical asymptote will always look like this or like this depend on sign issues odds will always look like this like this depending on sign issues they all look like that and i need you to know that so we're going to practice that right now i'm going to show you the transformations we're going to be transforming with our shifting remember up down left right reflecting uh using our key points we're going to be doing that that's why we get our key points here but i always i'm going to be referring to hey take a look at your vertical asymptote and see how this is relating so that's what we're going to do all right let's get started so we have f of x equals one over x squared plus three how we deal with transformations even on rational functions is to based on some sort of a basic graph shape and these two are now in our library of functions we have the reciprocal function and 1 over x squared we know odd variable asymptote and we know even that's basically what that's doing for us so this is based on this sort of x squared one over x squared idea we should kind of know that we're either doing this or doing this depending on what sign we're given since that's positive we're probably gonna do this we have this even vertical asymptote but we have this plus three what we learned a long time ago and if you wanna refresh your memory go back and watch transformations video that plus three is a vertical shift anything after the function outside of parentheses after like the function's been dealt with uh plus or minus plus means up and minus means down so that's a vertical shift up three units this uh would does not have a vertical sorry a horizontal shift left or right that would happen in parentheses like that one so all this plus three is doing the same hey take this function shift it up three spots and that's about it so if it doesn't shift left or right but it does shift up what that does to our function it takes our asymptotes and it moves those as well well wait a minute that means that's a really nice way to graph and this is why i taught you the transformations that i did a long time ago is because it's modeled right here perfectly so what that plus three does it says well wait a minute if i had a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero like i did here but i'm shifting up three units let's just imagine that my horizontal asymptote is going to be shifted up three and you know what it is gonna be shifted at three well hang on is it what about our vertical asymptote are we shifting that left to right and the answer is no that x squared there's there's nothing being added or subtracted inside parentheses before we square it so i'm not shifting my vertical asymptote at all so he looked at we said okay this is going to be this type of a graph i'm shifting it up three i've moved my horizontal asymptote up three i didn't have to move my vertical asymptote at all and now i just need to put in my key points and i can graph this so my key points are usually 1 1 and negative 1 1. why well because it's even we already figured out this is an even function and it has the same key points as every even function that's an odd function all of these are going to have the key points like that odd function unless you start manipulating them like reflecting them or multiplying by some sort of a constant coefficient so let's go ahead and plot that here's one one and negative one positive one but we're going to plot it in relation to where we shifted this horizontal and vertical asymptote we don't want to go down here and put one one that's not going to work because we shifted everything up you're going to put this at 1 1 and negative 1 1 in relation to like your new x y axis i know this doesn't exist here like this is not your actual x-axis this is your horizontal asymptote we did shift that so that's what that is use your key points in relation to that just wherever your horizontal asymptote is that's where your key points fit so 1 1 and negative 1 1 in relation to that that uh that horizontal asymptote the real points are 1 4 and negative 1 4. that's true also i want to make this this mention if you want to be a little bit more accurate with this do things like find the y-intercept now we can't here because x is equal to zero it gives us this domain problem so we can't do that uh but what we could do is plug in something like one-half uh negative one-half or plug in one-half and use symmetry if i plug in one-half one-half squared is one-fourth but one divided by one-fourth is four four plus three is seven so if i plug in one-half i get seven now remember this is even function it has to be symmetrical across that vertical asymptote i'm going to start saying that very specifically that it's symmetrical across your vertical asymptote because as we shift you're going to lose that thought of symmetrical across the y because we're shifting that asymptote but it will be symmetrical across the vertical asymptote so if i plug in negative one half i would have to get the same value that gives us a little bit better of a graph we know that we have to behave with our asymptotes and we get an x one over x squared graph just shifted up three units and that's a very solid graph for very minimal work that's what i would expect for you to do is be able to look at this and think oh that's one of x squared that's going to look like this or like this oh that's a vertical shift up three great that's not reflected because it's positive i'm not changing my my key points at all i'm going to shift use my key points and then i'm going to graph now let's take a look at the vertical asymptote to make sure that it models what we thought it would model so if i take a look at this domain wise and i look at hey let's look at our denominator our denominator is uh just as a factor of x if i set that equal to zero that defines a domain problem for me so i look at my my factor can i cross out the x or the x squared no i can't so at x equals zero i have a vertical asymptote and the multiplicity is even that gives us the symmetry that's exactly we said here and that's why this picture looks that way here's our vertical asymptote x equals zero here's the evenness of it it's going to the same infinity and that's what i want you to know let's move on to the next example okay so we got g of x equals one over x minus one squared minus 2. the first thing that we want to do if we're going to do this transformation wise is we're going to identify our shifts so that minus 2. notice how here's our function it's based on this power 2. man i need to see that this is like based on the one over x squared it's just it has a shift and another shift we always want to deal with the vertical shift first because this gives us just an easier way to identify what the horizontal line is frankly so i'm going to look at that go okay that minus 2 that is a vertical shift down 2 units after the function we identify that as a vertical shift down what that does for us let that move your asymptotes so here's our negative 2. that's going to give us our horizontal asymptote at y equals negative 2 now so we just shifted it down two spots now what's the minus 1 do anything in parentheses including here even though it looks weird anything in parentheses is a horizontal shift in your function and so here we have that minus one the problem is is that it's opposite so minus one is a shift to the right not a shift to the left i know we kind of want it to be but we studied that in transformations we identified why that was so that -1 is a shift to the right one unit well now what that does it says hey if you had a vertical asymptote at y equals zero but this entire function is shifted to the right it's going to shift that vertical asymptote to the right as well it's not going to change the fact that it's even it's just going to move it and so we've moved this horizontal asymptote down to sure that we'll function shift it down to and right one should the whole function shift to the right one and now from there because your key points interact specifically with your asymptotes we're going to plot our key points but we're going to do it in relation to where this stuff ended up so we're going to plot our key points of 1 1 and negative 1 1 it's an even function it has to be that it's even in relation only to that vertical asymptote though notice how it's not an even function anymore so like in relation to the y-axis it's not going to be symmetrical about the y-axis but it is going to have symmetry across your vertical asymptote by showing it by doing it this way you're actually showing the axis of symmetry automatically so again down to move your horizontal asymptote uh left right one move your vertical asymptote you've shown axis of symmetry you will have symmetry about that vertical line but no longer the y axis and now we're going to plot it so we're going to use the same scale but plot our key points from our of our new horizontal and vertical asymptote that's from here that's 1 1 and negative 1 1. if we wanted to be a little bit more specific on where things happen we might want to plug in some other values like you could plug in one half or uh one and a half if you wanted to use some symmetry there you could plug in the value like three you could plug in a value like negative one and get a more specific curve out of it now since we know the shape of this we can we can sketch it pretty accurately we know that because this is even we have these key points you've already shown your key points this graph has to look like this has to interact with their asymptotes in a certain way every even asymptote vertical asymptote will look like that or reflected and going downward now let's take a look at our our vertical asymptotes specifically from a domain standpoint make sure that it matches and we're really good to go so how we would deal with domain is you would take the factor on the denominator after everything's factored set all the factors on the denominator equal to zero you're using the zero product property in a way that says if your denominator equals zero you got a problem well every factor can make that happen so x minus one equals zero says at x equals one you have a problem that is your domain you can allow any value on the x-axis except for one well now use that and what the factor well sorry what the function says about the factor to define what happens at one do you have a whole or a vertical asymptote so we look back and say hey x equals one is a problem that's why it's excluded from our domain comes from a factor of x minus one so can you cancel out x minus one uh no so that means it's a vertical asymptote so we're using the factor to define what's happening at this exclusion so you can't allow one so at x equals one you have some sort of a domain problem a discontinuity either it's a hole or a vertical asymptote well at x equals one we know that that's going to be a vertical asymptote due to the fact you can't cancel out the factor but we also know that the factor has a multiplicity 2 that is giving us an even and even vertical asymptote even vertical asymptotes have to have at least a symmetry of infinity along that vertical asymptote that's going to be both go to positive infinity or both good and negative so we know for sure that this fits our model so we have even hey you're going to positive infinity from as x approaches 1 from the left and the right so as we get there from the left we're going yeah we're getting closer and closer from the right yep we're getting closer closer but it's positive and i want you to look at this just think through and this is how we sort of start talking about limits think through if you plugged in numbers that were real real close to one but positive stick with me here don't lose focus if i get really close to one from the positive values so i'm talking about like one point zero zero zero zero one one point zero zero zero zero one minus one is point zero zero zero zero one if i square that it's even smaller point like point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one one divided by that value is huge take it on your calculator if you want one divided by point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one is really really really big now subtract two from it you still get something that's freaking huge so as i get closer to one from the right hand side i'm getting epically large values do the same thing from the left hand side plug in something like 0.9999999999 0.99999999 minus 1 is point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one but negative well square it oh wait squaring negative numbers gives us something that's positive one divided by that really small positive number is going to do the same exact thing as the right hand side did it's gonna give you epically large numbers even if you subtract 2. so that's why this looks the way it does is when we're getting close to a value that's giving us 0 on a denominator think about this really focus here use your critical thinking if i'm getting close to a value on the x-axis that's giving me zero then just to the left and right is going to be really close to zero but i'm dividing by that number any constant divided by something that's approaching zero not zero itself you can't divide by zero but something approaching zero really close to it is going to give me very very very large numbers one divided by something super close to zero is still going to be super big try to calculate a few times if you want take one divide by like point zero one divide by point zero zero zero one divide by points and put as many zeros you can and then a little one and you're going to see those those numbers get really large that's why this looks that way we explored a little bit when we talked about vertical asymptote in last video but now that you're seeing it you should it should be kind of gelling on why this is looking the way that it is why they're going to the same infinity because you're squaring both a negative and a positive number and getting the same output we're going to come back with two more examples we'll deal with one of these and one of these again and then we'll be done all right let's go ahead and start the next example so let's take a look at h of x equals negative 2 over x plus 3 squared minus 4. first thing i want you to notice is what the function is based on so this is based on that 1 over x squared idea it's just been shifted around a lot and then reflected and the outputs have been multiplied by 2. that's what we should have learned when we got into transformations a whole bunch of videos ago we're just applying it here and taking a look at how this relates to a vertical asymptote so i'm going to start the same way i'm going to start by saying that right there says we have a shift down 4. so let's go ahead and do that let's move our horizontal asymptote down 4. next we say well what's that do inside of parentheses in your function with your variable when it's right next to the variable in parentheses what you have is some sort of a horizontal shift plus means left and minus means right so this is a shift left three units well that also shifts our vertical asymptote we're going to have symmetry here for sure but it's around the vertical asymptote and now we're going to identify our key points so how this function the one over x squared function works it's based on an even function so it's based on the fact that we have to have negative 1 1 and positive 1 1 as key points however if you remember the coefficient of your of the parenthetical expression of your factored function in this case that's factored and this is this x is your coefficient that negative 2 that factor it acts as a factor it is a multiplier of your output so basically what happens is you plug in a value add 3 to it that's going to shift left you'd square it and then you'd multiply that by negative 2 before subtracting 4 so that that that product that negative 2 what that does is that affects your output so we multiply that output by negative two including the output of our key points so that's going to shift that well it's going to transform a little bit it's going to stretch that and reflect it so we'd get okay take the negative two multiply your outputs not your inputs just your outputs and that gives us sort of a manipulated key point here so what have we done we've shifted down four yeah move your horizontal axis uh sorry horizontal asymptote we've shifted left three yeah move your vertical asymptote we had key points but we know that negative two affects the output so let's multiply that we're still going to get symmetry we still have an even base function it's not even as far as related to the y-axis anymore but it is related to your axis of symmetry or your vertical asymptote they're the same thing when you deal with these these transformed rational functions based on just a a sort of a power function for rationals so when we do this we're going to say all right let's use the same scale and plot 1 negative 2 and negative 1 negative 2 from here so here's 1 negative 2 1 2 and negative 1 negative 2 1 2. this is going to give us that look now remember we have to interplay with our asymptotes so we know that we still have a vertical asymptote there is no way that we're going to be able to do this up here and still maintain our horizontal asymptote so we're going to have to come up and go down so this is decreasing and then increasing as we go from left to right it still has to be symmetrical about that vertical asymptote now this function is a little bit off because i didn't check for the y intercept so if we wanted to we could do stuff like that so if we wanted to plug in zero zero is always going to give us a y-intercept is it going to be a y-intercept on this no no no this is the axis of symmetry this is our vertical asymptote if you plug in zero you will get the y-intercept so let's let's try that plug in 0 and add 3 you're going to get 3. 3 squared's 9 negative 2 divided by 9 is negative 2 9. minus 4 is negative 4 and 2 9. so i have this a little off it looks like i went right through negative five it really should be a bit higher missed it again and then we could use that symmetry to do the same thing over here so we'd say this is one two three units away from the y axis go over one two three away and you'd have to go through negative four and two nights as well now let's take a look at the vertical asymptote from the nature of a domain standpoint make sure it matches and then we're gonna be good to go so if we had to do this by just studying the domain what we would do is we we'd look at our factored function which we have and we'd set the factors on the denominator equal to zero by the zero product property checking for domain issues you go well there's only one factor yeah it's x plus three so when we've discovered our domain say yeah you cannot allow x to equal negative three we haven't there's nothing on x equals negative three some students get confused and say well i thought you couldn't intersect the y-axis well you can if you start shifting these these um rational functions around you certainly can it's just that if your domain says x cannot equal zero and you shift it well where you shift to 2 x kind of cannot equal that value we shifted left 3 units that's why we cannot allow x equals negative 3. how we can't allow it is look at your factor if you can't cancel it it's a vertical asymptote so at x equals three we have a vertical asymptote the multiplicity of which is two that means it's even that means it has to go to the same infinity either both oops positive or both negative that's a must and so here we're going to both negative infinity as we approach negative 3 from the left and right if you want to go through that that's sort of um not really a proof but an exploration of why it does that do it do it right now take something like negative zero zero zero 3.000 one uh negative three point zero zero zero zero one plus three is negative point zero zero zero zero one squared is positive but very small negative two divided by a very very small positive number is a very very large negative number and the same thing would happen if you plugged in negative 2.99 2.99999 plus 3 is 0.0001 squared is even smaller negative 2 divided by a very small positive number negative divided by a very small positive is going to give you a very large negative number that's why they approach the same infinity if you didn't catch that think through it a couple more times before you continue trust me it's important if you understand that idea all right let's look at our last example we got g of x equals negative one over x plus one and then plus two some students have a hard time seeing what that is related to well what i'm going to show you is that when you deal with the reciprocal function and the transformed versions of it it really helps to show factors on your denominator so when we factor this you go well 1 you can't factor or even negative 1 if you think about that you can't factor and x plus 1 is already its own factor well wait a minute if x plus 1 is already factored enough let's just call that a factor and then it's a lot easier to see what's going on oh there's my parentheses there's my power one so this is based on the reciprocal function of one over x it just happens to be shifted how is it shifted you should think through that right now how is that shifted what's the plus two do what's the plus one in parentheses do well the plus two shifts up two units that also shifts our horizontal asymptote that plus one shifts left one well that also shifts our vertical asymptote do we have key points yes of course but remember this is now based on an odd function there is no even power there anymore this is based on odd functions this is one over x so the key points for one over x or any odd function are one one and negative one negative one that's what we would normally graph however just like we had in that example that negative 2 affected our outputs this negative 1 is also going to affect our outputs you know that that's a reflection so instead of doing this this graph is going to do this it's still gonna have opposite infinity so we know one over x does but we're going to have to reflect it so this negative one actually changes our key points a bit we're going to get 1 comma negative 1 and negative 1 comma positive 1. it's reflected that and we're going to graph that in relation to our sort of new x y axis or if you want to think about this way our asymptotes these are related to our asymptotes so we know that we're going to get 1 negative 1 in relation to where these asymptotes cross so based on that scale here's 1 negative 1 and here's negative 1 positive 1. so one negative one one negative one and one negative one positive negative one positive one this gives us that sort of opposite signs for an odd it's going to yield opposite infinities we are still going to have symmetry but it's no longer symmetric about the y-axis sorry the origin the original origin it's symmetric about the new origin now this is not really the origin of the graph but this is where we shifted to so we do have symmetry but it's about that point no longer that point because we shifted now let's think about what this would have to do in order to obey our asymptotes and still hit these key points we have to look like this and we are sketching if you want to be a little bit better about it we plug in some values like um negative one-half we do something like that we plug in maybe negative one and a half if you want to plug in something like negative two well it's not negative two we already have that point but something like uh one or negative three you could do that you can still use symmetry here as well so if you wanted to you could plug in something like one and so let's see let's do that so if i plug in one i would get one plus one is two uh negative one over two is negative one half plus two is positive one and a half so i know that this has a point at one comma here's one and a half right about there well what that means is that if i if i take this symmetry please watch carefully where's the symmetry happen across the y or across the axis of symmetry and it's got to be the axis of symmetry that vertical asymptote this is one two units away from the axis of symmetry if i go two units away on the other side one two and then i take this as all right this was half a unit below the horizontal asymptote at this value i need to be half a unit above the vertical asymptote and that's it right right there then we can use the symmetry remember how how odds work you do opposite values equals opposite values so if i was two units away from the axis of symmetry and i have an odd function one's below and one's above the same exact sort of spacing if you will on that horizontal asymptote so we can do that use uh use symmetry as well and get a fairly good looking graph for at least minimal work now let's take a look at the domain make sure that actually works domain would say from a factored function in this case a rational we're going to take every single factor on the denominator that has a variable and set it equal to zero that's going to define what we can't have in our domain you can't allow negative one we haven't uh so how can't you have it can you cancel the factor no if you can't then you have a vertical asymptote and in this case the multiplicity is odd ah means opposite infinities in one of those ways depending on the sign of the function which we talked about so this is model perfect this says hey at x equals negative one we can't allow it how can you allow it sort of like a force field this vertical asymptote you can't touch that how it's going to interact is it's going to give you opposite infinities now focus on the why why is it doing this if we start plugging in some values that are getting really close to negative one this is called a limit so as we're approaching from the left and from the right what is happening from the right hand side as we get closer to negative one from the right hand side this is like negative point nine nine nine nine nine nine focus on this if i plug in negative 0.99999999 negative 0.999999999 plus 1 is positive positive .00001 to the first power that's still positive 0.000001 but a negative constant any constant really divided by a super small number is going to be an epically large negative number and that's an octave one but an absolute value is really big it's just negative so a negative divided by a really small positive is very very negative that's negative infinity even when you add 2 it's still going to be approaching negative infinity that's why this graph has to do this now focus on the other side stick with me if i go from the left this is from the left hand side if i plug in something getting really close to negative 1 like negative zero zero zero 1.000000 zero for a whole long time and a little one and i add one what's going to happen negative one point zero zero zero zero one plus one is still negative point zero zero zero zero one now i take the first power oh my gosh it's still negative but wait negative to 1 divided by a negative really small number negative divided by negative is a positive but it's going to be huge a huge positive number so as i'm coming this way i'm starting to get really really really really really big numbers and i add 2 it's even bigger that's going to explode to positive infinity this is why these have opposite infinities odds always do this because they have opposite signs for values that are on opposite sides of a vertical asymptote that's why evens are different than that evens have the same sign for opposite sides of a vertical asymptote i hope that makes sense i hope now you have a very good connection between the transformations and these rational functions and seeing what a vertical asymptote will do it's a hugely important thing because we're going to be graphing these we're not going to do specifically with key points but we're going to be using the fact that odds do this or this and evens do this or this and now hopefully you have a better understanding of why so next time we'll talk about horizontal asymptotes we'll talk about oblique asymptotes and then we'll start getting into graphing rationals hope you're doing well 

Transcript for: Finding a Horizontal Asymptote of a Rational Function (Precalculus - College Algebra 40)
hi welcome to another video so in this video we're going to discover how to determine if a rational function has a horizontal asymptote that's about it uh the next video will study oblique or slant asymptotes then we'll talk about end behavior we'll just kind of practice finding all the asymptotes and wholes of the function and then we're going to put this thing all together and graph would be the longest video in this uh this series so in this video when we talk about a horizontal asymptote it's very similar to a vertical asymptote that we we discovered vertical asymptotes like a force field and you cannot touch it with a with the function it will not touch horizontal asymptotes are not of course vertical they're horizontal and there are some different qualities so here's how to determine if or when you have a horizontal asymptote of a rational function so here's what we're going to do we're going to look at our function and we're going to look at the rational part as a polynomial over a polynomial that's what defines a rational function anyhow we're going to look at the leading term of the numerator and the leading term of the denominator if you remember the leading term is the term of the largest exponent in a polynomial so basically you want your rational function in order of both polynomials and order and then we take a look at basically the first two terms and we look at the degree remember the degree is the power of your leading term of a polynomial if the degree of the denominator the bottom of your function is larger than the degree of the numerator you are going to have a horizontal asymptote at zero y equals zero just like this right on the x-axis no matter what if the degree of the denominator equals the degree of the numerator you're going to have a horizontal asymptote at whatever the leading coefficients say whatever the ratio is we're going to practice that now this is a really easy way to remember what to do as we go through it i'm going to explain why this actually works because a lot of times students get this they try to memorize it they get it all screwed up so i'm going to explain to you why this is the way it is so we're going to be looking at degree of denominator degree of numerator those are both polynomials we're going to consider the two cases that we can have for greater than or equal to so a horizontal asymptote will exist if the degree of the denominator is greater than or equal to the degree of the numerator we're just kind of determine which is which if the degree of the denominator is bigger than the numerator then you're going to have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero if the degree of the denominator is equal to the degree of the numerator we're going to have a horizontal asymptote at y equals the leading coefficients so that's basically what i intend for you to learn in this video learn that what we're doing is putting polynomials in order on numerator denominator looking at the degrees so the first terms your leading terms basically just saying hey end behavior is determined by leading terms that's our second note right here and then looking at the degree and saying all right what what's going on here if the degree of the denominator is bigger than or equal to the numerator you're going to have a horizontal asymptote we're just defining which one it is if the bottom degree the denominator degree is larger than the numerator it's going to be at 0 on the x-axis y equals 0 on the x-axis if it's if it's equal so if the degree of the denominator equals the degree of the numerator you're going to have it at whatever the leading coefficients say we'll use that ratio we'll talk about why we'll talk about limits a little bit the two notes i really need you to know i mentioned this just a minute ago we'll do number two first end behavior is always determined by leading terms well that's true for rational functions as well except that on a rational function you have two polynomials one in the numerator and one of the denominators so you basically have two leading terms and that determines the end behavior of rational functions as well as we move on this video really could be a lot longer if i included every possible end behavior but i'm breaking it up i'm breaking up these videos as horizontal asymptotes oblique or slant asymptotes and then this end behavior where those don't exist that is all types of end behavior functions a horizontal asymptote is an end behavior so as you go to the end of your function what's happening is it tending to one y value well that would be a horizontal asymptote as we go to the ends of our function are we tending to be along a diagonal line well that would be oblique or a slant asymptote or as we go to the ends of our function are we tending to be like a parabola or maybe a cubic well that's also end behavior it's all one idea we're just kind of categorizing two specific types so here's what i want in your head right now i want that end behavior or rational functions can be basically one of three things number one you could have a horizontal asymptote in either of these cases number two you could have a slant asymptote that's a diagonal if the degree of the numerator is one larger than the denominator that's what's going to happen or you could have it where you don't have that case where the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator in that case you're just going to get straight up end behavior like a cubic or quadratic they're all end behaviors but you fall into one of those three cases let me make this very clear you will never have both a horizontal asymptote and a slant asymptote it can't happen it's either horizontal or slant or neither and you have some other end behavior so keep it in your head for the next few videos so let's go back to this end behavior is always determined by leading terms i'm gonna fill this one out in just a second well let's look at f of x f of x is four x cubed minus seven x plus one over seven x to the fifth plus two x cubed minus three the leading terms are the terms of the biggest power so the largest exponent in a polynomial if you put them in order they're always first so when we look at our leading terms leading term of the numerator is four x cubed and leading term of the denominator is 7x to the fifth now here's what we learned we learned that end behavior is basically modeled by that well for this bottom polynomial it's basically modeled by that so for our function itself our function's end behavior is going to look approximately like 4x to the third over 7x to the fifth now i want you to think about this for a second if you just think about this and do this it's going to work this is a nice shortcut on how to determine number one if you're going to have a horizontal asymptote and number two which type it's going to be so we can do that really quick we can literally go hey the the degree of the numerator is three the degree of the denominator is five so let's go through it is the degree of the denominator greater than or equal to the degree of the numerator yes it is this is five that is bigger than or equal to three okay very good now classified so number one we know we're going to have a horizontal asymptote now classify it is the degree of the denominator strictly greater than numerator or are they equal let's see 5 is not equal to 3 so we know that the denominator is larger than the numerator as far as its degree so 5 is bigger than 3. what that says is that we are going to have a horizontal asymptote at y 0. so along the x-axis as we go to infinities that's kind of a weird concept it's called a limit as x gets closer to negative infinity and positive infinity this graph is going to get to zero either let's see probably like this because it's like a 1 over x sort probably like this this is going to tend to be really really really close to zero as we go to infinity that's what's going to happen so we're going to identify that right now we're going to say all right there is a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero on both sides so as we get to positive infinity and negative infinity on the x-axis this graph is going to approach the x-axis y equals 0 is the x-axis getting really close to that now we're going to graph that as we move forward we're going to see what that looks like but in our head we know that's going to happen now i want to show you why so that's kind of a shortcut on how you do it you oh yeah look at degree gray is it bigger than cool y equals zero is it equal all right y equals the leading coefficients we'll talk about that now why is that well if you think about end behavior as being the leading terms notice what you can do here we took a leading term of 4x cubed over 7x to the fifth we said yeah our end here is going to look about like that well let's simplify that if we simplify that right now we would simplify and get x to the second power that's 4 over seven x squared and then we do a little bit of imagining um you think you think critically you think if this is how our function is going to behave as we get really really big and really really small on the x-axis so really positive and really negative this is how it's gonna be it's gonna follow this for sure positively and we can simplify it to make it easier to think about now the reason why we simplify it's really difficult to think about x getting very large in both a numerator and a denominator when they both have variables that's very difficult so with our leading terms really focus here with our leading terms we should always be able to simplify so that either our numerator or our denominator x's disappear that is always the case now here's why that's the case we have we have leading terms which are always power functions power functions always have one variable raised to an exponent if we have one of those in the numerator and one of those on the denominator and you're in the same variable you can always simplify them so taking your rational function and your leading terms of both polynomials putting them in a ratio you can always simplify them so do it and then think about it this is much easier to think about think about what's going to happen when you really think stop do not fast forward this video really think about this when you take x and make it very very large positively or i know it's kind of oxymoronical but very very large negatively think about that what's going to happen to the 4 if i start taking x and putting in really big values for x what's going to happen to the 4 nothing the 4 is going to stay the same what's going to happen to 7x squared as x gets close to like a billion a trillion like way more than that well close to infinity is what we would say positive infinity four divided by a number that's enormous like really really large four divided by a billion i mean that's all already really small imagine this imagine taking four dollars and dividing it amongst a billion people are those people gonna get a lot of money no they're gonna get hardly nothing they'll get basically nothing you don't have like a a monetary value for that we don't even have stuff that small okay now a billion's not even close to infinity not even remotely close so take four and divide it by a billion billions what's that value going to get close to not equal that's not what limits are about limits are about what's your function getting close to as x gets to this value close to it what's your function getting close to well as x gets close to infinity this function is getting really close to zero oh that makes sense as x gets close to positive infinity our function gets close to zero as x gets really really really big man if you understand this limits and calculus could be a breeze as x gets really really really big this gets bigger and bigger and bigger 4c is the same that's why we simplified it so you can see that 4c is the same this gets huge 4 divided divided by huge is close to 0. it's not zero it will never equal zero it's never going to intersect that x-axis it can't i hope you listen to that it can't ever equal zero four divided by huge numbers are never actually equal to zero but getting so close that you couldn't even slip a piece of paper in between them like it's that close this is going to what we call approach 0. it's going to get super close so as to tell no difference but there is a difference so as x approaches positive infinity our function is approaching zero it's never gonna equal there but it's approaching that's what the arrow is signifies is this word approaching what about negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity does that do the same thing well let's think about it uh four would say the same remember that that's why we simplify so you can see that four acts as a constant here and this denominator is what is growing larger and larger that's why we get the zero so the denominator grows larger and larger imagine negative fig plug in like negative a billion okay then square it oh that's positive a billion four divided by seven times a positive billion squared or whatever that is uh that is that's also really close to zero so as x approaches negative infinity we're taking and squaring that number aren't we so uh let's see four divided by another huge positive number is going to be close to zero in calculus we go a little bit further we define these as limits we talked about taking the limit as x approaches positive and negative infinity seeing what the signs do this will also tell you in which way your function is approaching zero is approaching zero positively it's approaching zero negatively in this case we're approaching zero positively on both of these cases but we talked about that a little bit later when we started getting into graphene you really won't even need it the way i'm going to teach you but in calculus it's kind of important to know so this is the basis behind why in the world we get a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero i know i'm going very deep into this and i know that most textbooks go just do this yes but when you get to calculus you're going to want to know why this is this is the why when you take a leading term divided by a leading term you can always simplify it that simplified leading term the ratio of leading terms is going to tell you your end behavior so all we're really doing is we're saying okay what's happening as x is getting really big and really really really big positively and negatively we use that sort of terminology what's happening when x is getting really positively big are really negatively big well that's called end behavior that's at the end of our graph in this case 4 stays the same this gets enormous 4 divided by enormous is close to zero approaching zero that's the idea of an asymptote it's really really really close but does not ever touch it that's what we're doing that's why this is here hopefully you can see it now hope you can see that well yeah every time the degree of the denominator is bigger than the numerator what am i going to get i'm going to get constant over variable that's what i'm going to get if the degree of the denominator is larger than the numerator then i will always be able to simplify this power function it will always give me a constant over a variable if the degree of the denominator is larger than the numerator that needs to make sense to you try to even change it if you want to if we change this to a 4 well then i would just get x to the first power does this still hold true yes yes it does it approaches zero more slowly but four would stay the same x would get really large four divided by really large is close to zero as x gets really large positively the function gets close to zero a constant divided by something approaching zero or sorry infinity is going to get close to zero like this now what about as x approaches negative infinity seven of four divided by 7 times something really really really out there large negatively that's still going to be close to 0 4 divided by like negative a trillion or something or negative 7 trillion whatever you want to say 4 divided by that is super close to 0 but it's approaching it negatively so this graph looks like positive close to 0 and negative close to 0. it's sort of doing two different things oh my gosh that seems like an odd vertical asymptote kind of flipped on its side wait a second that's odd what same stuff do you remember this one like five seconds ago i said it probably looks like this why because that looks like one over x squared or something very similar to it the end behavior is modeled by that so i'm studying this stuff because it's really quite interesting that that happens so back to here this will also still approach zero you'll still have a horizontal asymptote at y zero for sure without a double so i hope that makes sense i hope that you understand that we're taking leading terms we're simplifying and we're just thinking we're just using our critical thinking hats and saying what's happening as x is getting big positively or big negatively are we getting close to zero are we getting close to a number and it will bear out and if you understand your end behavior it's going to bear out it's going to actually be modeled a lot by the reciprocal function this um this one over x sort of thing or the one over x squared a lot of times or reflected if you have um negatives in fact i want to talk about that right now what if this were a negative would that change this no it would not so negative four divided by something really large is still close to zero uh no matter whether you have positive or negative this is still going to be a horizontal asymptote y equals zero now your graph will change of course it will be reflected so so think about this man i hope that you're thinking with me here if i took x to positive infinity just plug in something's huge negative 4 divided by something really really really big positively is going to be close to zero but it is going to be negative a negative divided by a positive even if it's a huge number it's close to zero but it is negative this this is going to go to a horizontal asymptote this way from like from the negative side of the x-axis remember this is the x-axis y equals zero is the x so we're getting there from the negative side now divide a negative by something getting really big negatively like negative 7 trillion negative four divided by negative seven trillion negative divided by negative is a positive it's still close to zero but it's going to get there from the positive side of the x-axis if that makes sense you are going to be a rock star when we get to graphing rational functions and we need to calculus because we do the same exact thing and the idea of a limit that's one of the fundamental concepts in calculus one is just getting your head wrapped around what a limit is that's it a limit means what is the function doing what's the value of the function approaching as we get closer and closer and closer to some x value that's basically what it means all right now the other thing that i need you to know is that because end behavior is as x gets really large and really small we actually can cross a horizontal asymptote we can do all sorts of stuff between a um a limited number of x values but as we get closer to infinity that stops happening and then our end behavior takes over so this is different than a vertical asymptote i need you to really get this in a vertical asymptote that value is completely undefined you can never touch that's like m c hammer doo doo doo doo doo doo can't touch this like never but a horizontal asymptote is different you can cross a horizontal asymptote horizontal asymptotes take kind of effect after you get outside of a certain range of values and i can't tell you exactly what that's going to be it just happens as x is approaching positive and negative infinity so think way out there so keep this in mind you can cross a horizontal asymptote that is absolutely possible i will show you an example where that happens kind of difficult to deal with actually but i will show you that you can't cross a vertical you can cross a horizontal all right let's get on to our last example here so we got g of x equals eight x to the third minus two x plus three all over uh two x cubed plus x squared minus seven x plus five and we're just talking about horizontal asymptotes right now we're not even talking about vertical we're not talking x intercepts just whether or not we're dealing with a horizontal asymptote and here's the class that falls in a horizontal asymptote falls into a class of what is called end behavior what's happening is a function is going left and right forever so positive infinity and negative infinity we talked about it in polynomials we knew that odd was like this and even was like this we're going to deal with quite the same thing only now we have these other two we have like a 1 over x it's going to look like this one over x squares like this or reflected one over x or x squared we can one over x cubed would look a little different than that so we can have those things as far as end behavior it's just going to bear that out a little bit um so what we do here is we take a look at our leading terms so when we look at our leading terms of polynomials in this case we have 8x to the third and 2x to the third those are our leading terms respectively just the first two because they should be in order now we want to come over here let's let's make sure this actually works so are we going to have a horizontal asymptote here well all we've got to do is really look at our degree so the degrees are 3 on the numerator and 3 on the denominator just right there and those happen to be the same so big thing through it is the degree of the denominator greater than or equal to the degree of the numerator yes yes it is they're actually equal but yes they're greater than or equal and so we know right now that we are going to have a horizontal asymptote for sure that is going to be the case now let's qualify what type that is is are we going to have a horizontal asymptote at y equals 0 well that only happens if the degree of the denominator is strictly bigger than the numerator and it's not they're equal okay they're equal what's that mean degree of the denominator equals degree of the numerator then we're going to have a horizontal asymptote at y equals and this might be a little confusing but the fraction of leading coefficients wait a second the leading coefficients come from the leading terms okay so let's walk through our end behavior our end behavior says g of x should look a lot like that it should be modeled by that at the ends of the functions it'll appear to be this the leading coefficients are just the numbers in front of your leading terms so like 8 and 2 so what this says it says hey look the degree the denominator and numerator are the same you have equal degrees you are going to have a horizontal asymptote but it's not going to be at zero that only happens when the degree of the denominator is larger than the numerator in this case you just go all right well what's going to happen here well our horizontal asymptote is going to happen at y equals just take your leading coefficients make them a fraction and simplify that means we're going to we would take eight over two so at y equals four remember that y equals four is a constant a horizontal line just like this so y equals four a divided by two is four we are going to get this horizontal line and your function will approach that it'll never equal it at infinities maybe it'll cross it sure but as x approaches positive infinity and as x approaches negative infinity this function will approach it'll get really close to the value of y equals four the function's value will be really close to four for sure now let's study why that happens because i want you to really get this so if if end behavior is determined by leading terms and we have two leading terms one from the numerator denominator we can make a ratio hey we've done that let's simplify that and go we'll wait wait if these are power functions all of the variables can simplify right same thing here we can simplify power functions very easily in this case though if your degrees are equal what is going to happen to your variables if your degrees are equal you're going to cancel them out they're going to be completely gone if your degree of your denominator is larger here you're going to get constant over variable variables can grow constants can't that's why this one went to zero because the constant stayed the same as the variable was growing that's why it happens that's why if the degree of the denominator is larger you're always going to get y equals zero for your horizontal asymptote but wait if your degrees are the same they're going to all cancel out do you see it do you see like if i have a 3 over 3 x to the third over x to the third it's going to cancel or x to the fifth or x to the fifth or x to the degree over same degree this is always going to cancel out and give me a constant and what that says is that g of x is going to be um about four that's the end behavior for it well what's what's that mean if that's a a constant value that means that you have a horizontal asymptote at that value it's not zero because there's nothing to grow larger than the numerator here you're basically saying as as x approaches positive and negative infinity they're approaching at the same sort of rate and the coefficients take over here so we go all right uh well what happens as we go x positive infinity well you're getting close to four how about negan infinity you're still getting it close to four what we do end up losing a little bit is what direction we approach it we'll need some more math to do that it's not it's not like this one you still haven't actually go okay i can kind of deal with signs here well that's positive but it's not telling you what direction you're approaching that that horizontal asymptote all we know in this case is that we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals 4. that's pretty much it as far as how to determine whether you have a horizontal asymptote we're going to deal with this throughout the next like five videos is when we have a horizontal and when we don't when you have a horizontal asymptote and it's actually quite easy to do i over talk this because i want you to understand it i hope you get that like i'm not just getting you to do it i want you to fully grasp what is going on i'm trying to tell you limits so as x approaches positive infinity if you want to write this as x approaches positive infinity g of x approaches four as x approaches negative infinity g of x still approaches four it is a constant it can't change that's why um that's why we have that that just horizontal asymptote f4 because it it can't change it's going to be there the function is going to approach that so i want you to get that i want you to understand that really the basics are look at your degree just compare them if the degree of the denominator is bigger than the numerator you have a horizontal asymptote at zero if they are equal you have a horizontal asymptote at the coefficients of your leading terms that's it if the now you probably should have a question right you have a question um what happens if the degree of the numerator is larger than the denominator well we have two more cases and that's the next two videos the next video is what if the degree of the numerator is larger by one well then we have well wait a minute what would happen think about it what would happen if the degree of the numerator is larger by one you take end behavior just like this and just like this but you'd simplify what would happen if you get i'm just making this up a numerator larger by one well your power function would still simplify and you would get 4x well what's 4x wait a minute 4x looks a lot like slope intercept form the slope is 4 x to the first power would be a diagonal line that's called an oblique asymptote that's we're going to study in the next video what if the degree of the numerator is larger by more than one so what if it's like x to the sixth well then you get x squared do you know what your end behavior should look like a parabola that's all there is to it we're just making end behavior where it gets a little complicated is these are two end behaviors you haven't seen before where we have a horizontal asymptote of zero horizontal asymptote at a constant that's basically it so i'll come back with another video about oblique or slant asymptotes they're sometimes called and then we'll continue you 

Transcript for: Finding an Oblique Asymptote of a Rational Function (Precalculus - College Algebra 41)
hey there now that we have a good feeling for what a horizontal asymptote is and why it happens how they work we're going to talk about what's called an oblique asymptote sometimes called a slant asymptote due to the fact that it's a diagonal line now we're also going to talk about this so plea please have a couple of these things in your head as we go through number one you you really got to know what a horizontal asymptote is and when you get them um this video the last video and the next video are all dealing with what is called end behavior of a rational function and there's really only three cases you have a horizontal asymptote either at zero or a constant you have a diagonal line asymptotes called an oblique or a slant or you have just regular old end behavior we're going to model that so we're kind of in the second second phase of this so when we talk about an oblique asymptote of a rational function there's a few things i want you to know one was i just told you the second thing is you're going to have to know how to do long division of polynomials not just synthetic division so if you ignored me when i showed all that stuff it's time to go back and rewatch that because you can't do this with synthetic division you have to have long division which is why i taught it to you most of the times we did i did both when possible so here's when you're going to have an oblique asymptote and we talked about end behavior last video we understand hopefully that a horizontal asymptote happens horizontal asymptote happens when the degree of the denominator is larger than the numerator that's y equals zero x-axis or equal to the numerator that's going to be a constant the leading coefficients will tell you that so what happens when the numerator starts being larger so notice horizontal asymptote takes care of all the cases where the denominator is equal to or greater than the numerator the oblique asymptote and end behavior take care of the cases where the numerator is bigger than the denominator as far as degree if they're equal remember if they're equal you get a horizontal asymptote at a constant that's not zero if the numerator starts being larger we really only have two cases the first one is the oblique asymptote and the next one would be just straight up end behavior so what happens when the degree of the numerator is exactly one more so degree of numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator by exactly one this is when you're going to get an oblique asymptote an oblique asymptote is a diagonal line that your function is going to approach so as x gets positive infinity maybe you have diagonal lines just like y equals x or something as x is positive infinity this function is going to get closer to a diagonal line and as x approaches negative infinity it's getting closer to a diagonal line it's going to follow that diagonal line for infinity and beyond so that that's what an oblique asymptote does it's very much like a horizontal it's just it's just a diagonal line the same thing why that is think about this for a second before we get into it if the degree of the numerator is larger by one then what we're going to have by our leading terms you'd have something two power functions that you could simplify and you'd end with like three x to the first power three x to the first power is a line has a slope of three we also have one more step long division but that's why this is happening is because the degree of the numerator is larger by one you divide you get a line and that's going to model the end behavior of this function that's why it happens a couple notes i mentioned a couple of number one we really have to know long division of polynomials i'm only doing one example in this video because we'll be practicing it later on i'm just going to show you how to do that one time but we've already talked about long division polynomials also you might hear this called a slant asymptote from time to time that's informal the formula is oblique asymptote that's what i'm going to be using but you might hear it called a slant or a diagonal asymptote because it is just a diagonal line horizontal was already taken care of now we're on diagonal so let's go ahead oh yeah last one kind of covering it up i make a better door than a window i guess um you can't have both a horizontal and an oblique now think about just the degrees for a second and that's going to make sense to you if your degrees are equal you have horizontal if degree of denominator is bigger you have horizontal at y equals zero if the degree of the numerator is larger by one you have oblique you can't have both a numerator that's has a larger degree than a denominator and at the same time have equal or denominator larger that that's impossible so you went to a contradiction therefore you cannot have both a horizontal and an oblique it is one or the other or none and then you just have end behavior so you fall into one of three cases here horizontal constant or zero oblique diagonal line or just straight up and behavior you're not going to have all of them you have just one of them and it's based on the degree so it's based on end behavior so let's take a look at it we do something different with an oblique asymptote than we do with other end behaviors you see normally we take a look at this and go all right well what's going to happen our end behavior is going to be modeled by our leading terms we studied this in the last video and because leading terms are always power functions the variables will always simplify see all right well yeah this is going to give us just simply 3x well well what what is that what happens as x approaches infinity oh as x approaches infinity positive infinity our function approaches let's see plug in big numbers here uh three times really big positive numbers are really big positive numbers this also approaches positive infinity okay as x approaches negative infinity what's our function doing we're doing limits by the way this is a the introduction to sort of what limits do what happens is x gets really big negatively well three times really large negative numbers i know it's kind of backwards but we're going to use them that that terminology for now as x gets really big absolute value negative numbers well this is going to get to negative infinity three times really big negative numbers are really really big negative numbers that's going to be negative infinity and it will follow this line with a slope of 3. remember 3x has a slope of 3 power 1 would be a diagonal line that's exactly what this function is going to follow however there's one more step we have to do to get the the actual line you see this is this has the slope right this is three that's great but we're missing a y-intercept so you can't draw this diagonal line without knowing the y-intercept the y-intercept comes from doing long division so long story made short this is still end behavior it's obviously not a horizontal asymptote because as x approaches infinity our function is not getting close to zero it's not getting close to a constant it's getting close to infinity and negative infinity just going to happen along the diagonal line so we're going to look at how to deal with that dagger line so this all comes from our our long division of polynomials if you do notice this makes sense by the way if you look at our degree the degree here is 4 the degree here is 3 4 is exactly 1 more than 3. if you have a question right now because i know it pops into my head what if this were 5 well then you'd get x squared x squared is not a diagonal line x squared is a parabola that's going to be our next video on end behavior so we'll deal with that this is only the case when our degree on the numerator is larger by one what if this was three well then you get just three oh wait that's a horizontal asymptote at y equals three that's the last video right now again we're just dealing with one degree here is one more than that one that's why i'm only doing one example because there's really only one thing that we do with this now what we do with it is we take and we're just going to divide it so we take our look at our numerator that's three x to the fourth minus x squared long division polynomials needs like kind of like a place value for all of your missing exponents of x so we're going to start with three x to the fourth we don't have any x cubes but we need a place for it just like we need a place for the zero x and the zero because there's no constant as well we actually could factor the numerator but that's not the point of what we're doing here we're trying to figure out what our oblique asymptote is going to look like what the the function is of that asymptote now on our denominator this is what we're dividing by if you remember long division of polynomials works just with your leading terms and here's something else i'm going to tell you while this looks really crazy i know it's intimidating to go oh my gosh this is going to take absolutely forever it's not please please listen but man rewind the video and pause it or be happy just really focus here here's what you're trying to get what you're trying to get is y equals m x plus b so we only need to do this exactly two times you're going to divide your first term by your first term and you're going to get 3x you'll distribute subtract and divide your first term by your first term and then you are done i'll show you exactly where to stop you need to go no further at all so don't worry about it you're not i don't care what the remainder is i do not care all we're trying to get to is what the mx plus b form or the slope intercept form of our oblique asymptote is so it's just two iterations of long division it's not that hard so we're going to take our first term so 3x to the fourth divide by x cubed and you're going to get 3x let me ask you a question and see if you're thinking are you always in this case are you always going to get constant x to the first power constant x to the oh well constant coefficient x to the first power in other words are you always going to get a power one for your first term here yes because you would not be doing this unless this degree was exactly one more than that one if this degree is exactly one more than that one every single time you divide long division for an oblique asymptote every time this will be one more than this and you will get something to the first power there every time that's why if the degree is one larger you're going to get no bleed asymptote for sure because if this is one larger than that when you divide it you'll get a power one and a power one is always a diagonal line hey that needs to make sense so are you always going to get something the x to the first power here yes you are otherwise you shouldn't be doing this because oblique asymptotes only happen if the degree of the numerator is larger by one than the denominator and if that's not the case you have horizontal or other end behavior you don't even have to do this so yes now we're going to distribute so we don't have an x to the oh sorry we do have an x to the third good thing we put that there and then we have we don't have an x squared we have a 3x so i'm going to double check this 3x times x to the third is 3x to the fourth that looks good 3x times negative x squared is negative 3x to the third got that 3x times 1 is 3x not x squared so i'm leaving that as a 0x squared when we subtract what we're going to get is remember that when we subtract we're subtracting term by term so 3x to the fourth minus 3x support that's zero that's what we want to happen but zero x to the third minus a negative that's adding you're subtracting a negative that's three x to the third honestly i don't even care about this it does not matter it doesn't make a difference because here's what we're in if you want to you know what i just really want to be complete so minus x squared and minus 3x yeah great but it doesn't matter all we are looking for is this next term that's it i promise you that's all that matters so when you take a look at 3x to the third you really don't need this you go okay here's my first term remember long division polynomials works first term divided by first term 3x to the third divided by x to the third that will simplify and that will give you positive three you're done don't distribute don't subtract this is irrelevant all you're looking for is this right here so our oblique asymptote our oblique asymptote is y equals three x plus three here's what that means if i were to graph three x plus three it's a y intercept of zero three that's a slope of three over one so about three over one that's about like that our graph our function right here is going to follow that as we get toward x equals positive negative infinity it's going to look like a diagonal line so most of the time this is going to have a at least one vertical asymptote so also going to cross the x-axis so what we're going to get right here is we're going to get sort of a look like probably i can't even do it with my hands like this it's going to it's going to kind of come up and then do this at the end behavior so it's going to follow that diagonal line as we get way out there to be doing this that's what's going to happen so we know this line that way we can put it on our graph and we say oh yeah my function is going to follow that now here's another point that i wanted to make and did it with horizontal asymptotes um can you cross an oblique asymptote yes you can it's not a vertical asymptote it acts kind of like a horizontal flipped on it's it kind of tilted a little bit slanted a little bit so yeah you can you can cross it as many times as the function allows but at the end behavior it's going to be following that so that's why we wanted to graph this so that we know what our function looks like as we go toward the ends of our our x-axis positive and negative infinity and that's exactly how we do it so long story hopefully shorter is uh take a look if this is bigger than this by exactly one you know you're going to get an oblique asymptote but you have to do long division it's only two steps first term divided by first term distribute subtract and first term divide by first term and then you're done don't even distribute don't need to subtract this is your oblique asymptote so i hope that makes sense we're going to come back do another video on end behavior just end behavior when oblique and horizontal asymptotes are out of the picture and then we're going to start um practicing for one video and then we'll do some some graphing all right hope you having fun you 

Transcript for: Finding End Behavior of Rational Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 42)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we are going to talk about the last case of end behavior of rational functions as a little deceiving because the title is end behavior rational functions i do want to tell you that horizontal asymptotes or an oblique asymptote that is also end behavior they're just special cases so this is the case where what if a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero or y equals a constant or an oblique asymptote at y equals some sort of linear function does not happen so what would that look like well a horizontal asymptote we know happens when the degree of the denominator is equal to the numerator or bigger than the numerator you're going to get constant or zero respectively we know that an oblique asymptote sometimes called a slant or diagonal asymptote happens when the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of denominator but by only one well what if we have the degree of the numerator larger than the degree of the denominator by more than one then we're just going to get some straight up end behavior it's not hard it is going to look very similar what we did on horizontal asymptotes when we found those things so when we do this when we deal with just end behavior we would look and go okay let's first just identify some degrees because that is a nice way to at least understand where what we're gonna be getting out of this thing we look at the degree of the numerator is five degree of denominator is three so remember denominator has to be bigger or equal for us to get horizontal numerator has to be bigger by exactly 1 for us to get oblique more than that we just have end behavior so this degree is five that degree is three the numerator outpaces the denominator by more than one so there is no horizontal there is no oblique we're just getting end behavior remember you cannot have all of them you're either horizontal you are oblique or you have end behavior that's different from those things so we're just going to take a look at this by taking the leading terms that's what end behavior is defined as is taking the leading terms of your polynomial in this case we have two of them so we take the leading term of our numerator and denominator in the previous videos we talked about how leading terms are power functions and so when you put power functions and ratio either your numerator or your denominator is going to completely cancel out as far as the variables are concerned well if we have a numerator that's larger in degree by more than one our denominator is going to completely disappear as far as its variables so we would say all right here's x to the third x to the fifth notice you'll never get a one when you do this unless you have an oblique asymptote and this would give us 4x squared ladies and gentlemen that that's exactly exactly what this graph is going to look like as we get end behavior so just picture in your head what that even positive power function looks like this is 4x squared it's narrow it's upward opening it looks like a parabola this is going to do this now of course we're going to have some things that happen in the middle like x-intercepts or some vertical asymptotes but we will not have a horizontal asymptote we will not have an oblique asymptote this function will actually be modeled by 4x squared as x approaches positive negative infinity you can see it take x make it really large as x approaches positive infinity four times really big numbers squared are enormous numbers this function would also approach positive infinity now think about x approaches negative infinity take some really big negative numbers on the x-axis square them oh wait that's positive okay multiply by four that's even more positive that's also positive infinity so if i take really big numbers squared multiply by four i get really big numbers if i take really negative numbers square them multiply by four i get really big numbers so this function would also approach positive infinity that's why we get that look that's why even functions do that so this is the the model of this graph as we approach the end behavior that's that's all it is now of course you know me i like to cover lots of cases with one example so what would happen if that were negative so let's imagine that's negative that's negative that's negative really nothing you do would change except now positive numbers times a negative would be negative infinity and positive numbers because a large negative number squared times negative negative infinity as well so this would go negative negative and our graph would look you yeah i should probably do a different case i don't want to confuse you let's do it down here let's suppose that g of x looked like that in its end behavior then we would just end up getting a negative a negative even power function just a downward opening so this cool this no big deal one more case let's say that we did all this and this happened to be like 4x to the sixth over x cubed so if that was the power six we'd get something like that how would that look well when we simplify remember power functions can simplify that would give us a power three so this would be four x to the third well just think about what that power function looks like and that would be the modeling of our original rational function if we had started with 4x to the sixth power like we have here well that's an odd okay an odd a cubic in this case and it's positive so let's see odd power functions look like this when they're positive so this end behavior would be very close to that it would mirror or model for x to the third that's what that's going to be again if we change it to negative all that really happens is we reflect that graph and then that would model the end behavior of this function so if i just made that negative and made that a six negative four x to the sixth over x to the third would give us negative four x to the third the end behavior would look just like that things can happen in the middle we can have x-intercepts vertical asymptotes things like that uh but this is what the end behavior would look like so i hope that makes sense hope that you all uh you know understand end behavior a little bit better than we started next example the next video we're going to practice about six examples just really hammering through what do you do first what do you do second what what do our where do our vertical asymptotes come from horizontal asymptote where does it come from oblique or a whole and what to do with that after that we'll we'll practice graphing a lot of examples it'll be a huge video uh kind of intimidating in its length but you need to watch it because this is it's one of the capstones of this course is being able to graph rational functions appropriately so i'm going to teach you that next video we're just going to practice putting everything together so i'll see for that you 

Transcript for: Finding Asymptotes and Holes of Rational Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 43)
hey there welcome to another video so this video is all about putting together the ideas that last like four or five videos we are going to just basically be practicing i'm gonna give you an outline of structure on how to find all the asymptotes and holes in a function we're going to basically do six examples as fast as i can i can while still explaining the concepts but i'm not really teaching you anything new that we haven't done just the order in which you go to make this most efficient can you go out of order yes but i found this order really keeps things structured well and limits the amount of work that you have next time next video longest video in this series is going to be practicing graphing this so right now this would be like the first few steps in how to graph rational functions so here's what we're going to get into what i expect you'll learn from this is how to appropriately find a horizontal asymptote an oblique asymptote vertical asymptote and holes if they exist so we're going to put all that together so uh the first thing we want to do find your end behavior first your end behavior includes either a horizontal asymptote or an oblique asymptote or just straight up end behavior you're not going to have all of them just one of them we're going to use leading terms to do that after you've done that then factor the reason why we do the end behavior first is typically your rational functions come as polynomials in that standard form first and that's easiest just to find your leading terms rather than having to factor then redistribute or go backwards we really don't want to have to do that so i'm making this in order for you after that we factored great define your domain say what x values can't happen and then say how they can't happen that would be determine whether your domain issues create a vertical asymptote or a hole whether or not you can cross out that factor or not and then determine where that hole is if you have to if there is a hole you need to find kind of the point that's missing and we're going to use that graphically in the next video and if you have a vertical asymptote whether that is even or odd based on the multiplicity so we're going to get right into it again i'm going to be going very quickly i'm teaching you this this lesson on this assumption that you've watched the last few videos and you know how to find a horizontal oblique or asymptote or end behavior and vertical asymptote if one exists so let's go here the first thing we're going to do with any function if it's not already factored is we're going to find the end behavior so when we look at end behavior and behavior deals with the leading terms of your polynomials both the numerator and denominator because they are power functions your variables at least on one of the numerator denominator will always cancel out fully in this case they both do and if we think back to a horizontal asymptote the first thing you might do is go oh yeah hey those have the same degree i am going to have a horizontal asymptote at the leading coefficients in other words three over one we can see that by end behavior i always show end behavior every single time because by simplifying you are going to find either a horizontal asymptote or an oblique asymptote or end behavior every time you just have to interpret it so in this case you go yeah you're just giving it 3 what does that mean that means you are going to have a function that gets toward y equals 3 as you approach positive and negative infinity that's a horizontal asymptote at three so that's pretty much done so all right that that's great if you want to just do the uh kind of the i don't know cliff notes version of it you look at your degrees if they're the same take your coefficients and that's your horizontal asymptote if your degrees are the same you're going to get a horizontal asymptote at the leading coefficients if not you either have a numerator that has a higher degree or denominator numerator higher you get oblique asymptote or end behavior that's not one of these two things if the degree of the denominator you get a horizontal asymptote at zero so we'll talk about that in just a minute all right the next thing we would do is factor now when we look at the numerator and the denominator this is already factored completely so 3x plus 5 is linear and x minus 6 is linear i'm going to do this just to make sure that we see that that factor that is one factor and then we're gonna set our factors on the denominator equal to zero to see what our domain restrictions are so we go all right x minus six is our only factor if i add 6 we'd say well x with x equals 6 x equals 6 is a problem so x equals 6 is something that i need to restrict you see if i allow x to equal 6 i get zero on the denominator that's a big issue that's undefined so we say on our domain our domain is any number except for six we can't allow that now we determine how we can't allow it this is either going to create a hole at x equals 6 or a vertical asymptote at x equals 6. so and remember you need to know about vertical asymptotes from a previous video so we we do this it's all stuff we've done before we go all right our factor equals zero by the zero product property we know that we're defining our domain denominators cannot equal zero or we have undefined values this is an undefined value so we cannot allow x equal to equal six now what that creates for us depends on whether the factor that gives us this undefined value can be cancelled therefore creating a whole or can't can't cancel therefore creating a vertical asymptote so we look at x minus six can you cancel that factor with something on the numerator uh no then at x equals 6 we have an undefined value but at x equals 6 that undefined value is created for us a vertical asymptote so this is what we can't have and what we do next is how we can't have it it's kind of a weird statement it's either gonna be a missing point we don't have anything there or a vertical asymptote we don't have anything there just two different things so at x equals six we have a vertical asymptote kind of like a force field vertical force field and we're going to define whether or not that is an even or an odd vertical asymptote and that depends on what our our multiplicity is for that factor we're going to get odd or even depending on what that power is which is why we put in parentheses to create a factor well that power is 1 so that would be an odd power or odd multiplicity vertical asymptote and that tells us that this vertical asymptote is going to look like this or like this depends some signs that we deal with at the next video so we've done and we okay end behavior we have a horizontal asymptote of 3. we've looked at our powers determined that we were going to have a horizontal asymptote at leading coefficients we found that by taking our leading terms and simplifying or just recognizing kind of that shortcut y equals 3 is our horizontal asymptote we defined our domain and then said what that's going to give us this is the first few steps on how we graph rational rational functions let's go ahead and let's deal with our next example so next example we're going to do the same thing just very quickly the first thing we're going to do is find end behavior how we do that and i do this every single time i take my first two terms my leading coefficients of the numerator denominator respectively and we make a ratio and because those are always power functions your variables on either the numerator or denominator or both are going to disappear in this case we know that we can simplify and get 1 over x now think critically about it what is going to happen at the ends of your functions think back to the video horizontal asymptote well as x gets positive or x gets negative 1 divided by really big positive numbers or really big negative numbers a limit idea one divided by really big values either positive or negative is getting close to zero this is going to have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero we learned that in horizontal asymptotes that if your degree of your denominator is larger than your numerator you will have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero so as x gets bigger this function approaches zero i'm not going to write out that limit i did that on that video as x approaches positive infinity g of x approaches zero and as x approaches negative infinity well g of x still approaches zero just from positive and negative places that's what we're doing so we will have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero the degree of the denominator is larger than the numerator it outpaces it so we have constant over some number getting really really big that's getting close to zero after that we have to factor everything now the numerator is factored but that x to the fourth minus one we've seen it a couple times that's like a difference of squares wrapped up in another difference of squares so i'm going to take a moment and think of this as x squared squared so x squared squared minus 1 squared would give us x squared minus 1 and x squared plus 1. but that's also a difference of squares this one's not that's an irreducible quadratic you cannot factor anything more that is done but this is a reducible quadratic you can factor that as x minus 1 and x plus 1. so our function becomes x cubed already factored over x minus 1 x plus 1 and x squared plus 1. now if you remember doing this this exact factoring was in well it was when we talked about complex solutions to these these polynomials we are not worried about complex solutions when we are graphing polynomials or rational functions they're not going to create anything for us they just kind of hang on in this class calculus one they typically will create some sort of a turning point or a local maximum local minimum that doesn't interact with your x-axis so that's typically what they do so in our case here we go okay we've already found our end behavior notice it's a lot easier to find end behavior here than it would be from a factored polynomial or factored rational function this you'd have to redistribute or at least fake distribute if you remember that x times x times x squared is x to the fourth you'd have to do that again so that's kind of annoying that's why we do end behavior first now that we have everything factored we're going to define our domain so our domain says hey look at your denominator take all the factors that are there and set them equal to zero all right so we know that if our denominator equals zero that's a problem so x minus one equals zero would create a a problem for us an undefined value of x uh based on the zero product property of setting your denominator equal to zero same thing with x plus one now x squared plus one equals zero that would be another factor set equal to zero by the zero product property but this is not possible to solve over the real number system so this basically gives us nothing that we have to worry about as far as our domain here's the point you can't plug in a real number square it add one and get zero that's impossible so that's not giving us any sort of domain restrictions in the real number system which is how we're graphing so this basically does nothing for us these two however if we add one and subtract one respectively this is giving us some values that are causing zeros on our denominator if i plug in one that's zero times i don't care and plug in negative one that's zero times i don't care it's going to give you zero on the bottom of your fraction it's a problem so our domain says you need to restrict those those are two values that you can't have now how can't you have them do they create a hole at those values of x or do they create a vertical asymptote we look back back at our factor for that so we look back at here's 1 came from x minus 1 the factor that said hey if i can cancel out x minus 1 that's a whole or a removable in other words say that if you can't that's a vertical asymptote there's nothing on our numerator to cancel that factor so this is defining a vertical asymptote at x equals 1. that can be kind of confusing the notation you're saying wait a minute i thought x can't equal 1. it can't so at x equals 1 we have something that you cannot allow and that's what we're saying here at x equals 1 you have a vertical asymptote that's a disallowed value of x that's that's why we define it that way it's kind of like saying hey at x equals one that vertical asymptote says yeah you can't have one you can't let the function uh have an x value of one it's just showing how we're disallowing it so at x equals one we have a vertical asymptote and we look back at the exponent of the factor that's giving us that vertical asymptote it's one that means that it's odd one is an odd number and you're either going to do this or this odd means opposite infinities the same exact thing happens at x equals negative one at x equals negative one we cannot allow that x value so we look back at the factor that's giving us that i can't cancel it that means that at x equals negative one we have another vertical asymptote also has an exponent of one meaning that's odd so we're going to have a kind of an interesting graph here uh this doesn't do anything for us as far as a vertical asymptote or a hole because this can't equal zero so it's not creating a domain problem for us domain problems are what gives us those graph issues of vertical asymptote or whole so in our case we're going to have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero that's the x-axis and we'll have two vertical asymptotes okay you can cross a horizontal but you can't ever touch a vertical that's why they're undefined and we're sort of saying how they're undefined so we'll have this at end behavior and we'll have vertical asymptotes in the middle at 1 and negative 1. so this graph and they're odd so this graph does something like this or this and something like this or this at both of those asymptotes because they are odd that's what i need you to focus on and get out of this lesson is what we're doing and the structure of how we're doing it we have four more examples again i'm going to go quite quickly through them i'm going to start showing you uh what would happen if we have a numerator larger than a denominator um whether we have an oblique or just end behavior so we'll get to that just a second all right let's get right to it so we got a couple more examples let's take a look at g of x we are always going to find end behavior first on our rational functions if they come in standard form which is everything that's distributed if not we have a chance to go out of order but we're going to get to that when we start graphing rational functions that's kind of the exception to the rule so we're typically going to start by having a distributed or standard form rational function and we're going to find end behavior we look at our leading coefficients that's the first two terms and if you want to kind of get in your head what's going to happen consider the degrees we have a degree 4 over a degree 2. the numerator is larger than the denominator in your head right now you should be thinking that means that we cannot possibly have a horizontal asymptote those only happen when they're equal or the denominator is bigger we also can't have an oblique because the numerator is larger for an oblique asymptote but only larger by power one this is more than power one so this is going to have end behavior that's not oblique and not horizontal asymptote so what we're going to do is we're just going to take the leading coefficients simplify them and it's going to show us how this function is going to behave in this end behavior all right so when we take our leading terms we have this x to the 4th over x squared power functions are always reducible by the variables so we're going to say all right this is really just giving us x squared that is how this function is going to look so draw a picture of it when you have just end behavior draw a picture of it so x squared is a parabola that's upward opening because that is positive x squared and not negative x squared so this picture is going to look something like that now some cool stuff you have in the middle like a vertical asymptote or things like x-intercepts so y-intercept stuff like that yep this could have could have that uh actually no i can't have a y-intercept so we're going to have a vertical asymptote at zero we'll see that in just a second but when we when we do this we have at least a picture of outsides that's what's going to happen it's going to follow x squared as we get to positive and negative infinity on the x axis that's going to happen you can see that if you did like the limit idea take x let it go really big it's then square you're going to get this take x let it get really negative and square it you're going to get positive infinity again it's going to look like that next thing we do is factor everything so on our numerator sort of like the last example we think of this as x squared squared minus 4 squared well when we factor that that's going to give us x squared minus 4 and x squared plus 4 it is a difference of squares while that's not factorable that's an irreducible quadratic again x squared plus constant you can never factor that x squared minus constant you can always factor that so we can factor that as x minus 2 and x plus 2. so we've taken this we've factored it we've factored it completely a polynomial is always factorable as linear and or irreducible quadratic factors so we have that that's irreducible quadratic that's linear that's linear so we're good on the denominator well we see that we have a gcf hopefully we have gcf we have a gcf of x so we can just simply factor out x don't forget that that's possible always look for gcf first if we factor out x then we get x minus 2. and i want to pause right here and tell you that the order of these steps is really important especially these three steps you can sort of do this one out of order sometimes it's fine you can simplify first you get the same end behavior but this right here is very important factor then define domain then say what the the domain causes graphically so we factor now before you cancel stuff out you are going to define your domain it's very important to not just oh it's gone because you're going to miss a hole which is ironic really when you think about it we're going to factor this and we're going to define the domain by looking at your denominator again and by the zero product property setting every factor equal to zero before you cancel so x would equal zero and x minus two would equal zero you see both of those are factors that if we allow them to equal zero the entire denominator equals zero you go yeah set that equal to zero zero product property would say okay this would cause that and this would cause that and we're going to solve them so x equals zero is great x equals two if we add two and here's what this means those are two issues that cause something undefined in our function so as far as our domain is concerned you might have wondered why do we spend so much time on domain for this so that you understand that we've been talking about domain for two classes now so domain says you cannot allow x equals zero and you cannot allow x equal two if that happens you have problems now we're going to say what problems they cause so we're not allowed to plug in 0 and we're not allowed to plug in 2. we're going to have missing things there either a whole or an asymptote that's how we're saying that we have a missing thing well let's look back at the factor so x equals 0 came from x the factor x can you cancel out the x no you can't all right well if you can't then that defines a vertical asymptote at that value of x and because that's an exponent one multiplicity one that's an odd vertical asymptote so x equals zero is the y-axis so on the y-axis we have an undefined value we have a vertical asymptote that's why i said earlier you're not going to have a y-intercept you're either doing this or this on the y-axis you will not cross it you won't touch it interesting now at x equals two so let's look back at the factor x equals two came from the factor x minus two so look back at that can you cancel out the x minus two yes but wait what's what's that mean when you can cancel out a factor that's causing a domain problem a zero on your denominator that defines a removable discontinuity or in other words a hole a missing point so you can't let two go in there to your function evaluate because it causes this problem but it's just going to be one point that's removed from your from your function so at x equals two we have a whole now here's what i need you to do for a whole so this is like your step five if you have a hole you do one more thing you simplify which we've already done you rewrite your function and here's the whole point of a missing point this graph will look exactly like this graph with one exception this graph has a hole in this function so here's what we're going to do i know that i just told you hey you can't plug in two you still can't plug in two it's gonna be a whole you need to identify where that hole is so in your simplified function plug in the two we already know that we can't have it it's allow me to find the domain that way but you're going to show where that missing point is you see by saying you can't plug in 2 and say here's the hole where i can't plug into you are defining that you can't plug in that 2. you're saying there is a missing point here so we have to evaluate our simplified function at the missing value to see where the missing point is so we're going to plug in 2. already know we can't have it we're now showing that we can't have it and that it is a whole so plug in let's see uh that would be two plus two that's two squared plus four over two four times four plus four is eight four times eight is 32 that's 16. we are going to have a hole a missing point at 2 comma 16. we're going to use that when we get to gravity we're going to go over 2 on the x up 16 on the y and we're going to put a hole we're going to say oh hey our function is going to come to this hole and leave this hole but it's going to be missing a point here here's the whole thing about holes this function is exactly like this function except it's going to be missing that point that's why we define it so that's how holes interplay with these functions that's just about it all right let's go ahead to our next example so f of x equals polynomial over polynomial first thing we do because this is in standard form we're going to find end behavior now we might just look at this and go hey the degrees are equal in your head you need to be thinking if the degrees are equal i have a horizontal asymptote at the coefficients so the ratio of the leading coefficients that would be two over three or two thirds so we should get out of this that y equals two-thirds is a horizontal asymptote now we're always going to practice doing this end behavior end behaviors takes our leading terms they're power functions they should simplify at least your variables and this says no matter what you do your function as you get to positive and negative infinity is going to be two-thirds what's it mean two-thirds is a horizontal line well that would be a horizontal asymptote so no matter what you do you're gonna get to two-thirds so we define that as a horizontal asymptote at y equals positive two-thirds remember you can cross a horizontal asymptote but this function is going to tend to that value as we approach positive and negative infinity approach means as x gets closer to one value the function does that's a limit idea as x approaches some value the function gets closer and closer and closer to what value in this case as x gets to positive infinity and as x gets negative infinity the function is going to approach or get closer and closer and closer to the value two thirds point six six six six six six uh it's never going to touch it let's get closer and closer after that man we factor everything so we're going to factor the numerator and the denominator do it as quickly as you can effectively we should know factoring pretty well so i'm looking at that as negative 8 and 3 that multiplies to negative 24 that adds to negative 5. i always like to divide by my a and simplify and i know that my numerator will be factored as one x minus four and two x plus three you can factor in whatever way you're comfortable with i don't care we just need to be able to factor i probably checked my work too this would be 2x squared plus 3x minus 8x minus 5x and then minus 12. so i know i'm right it doesn't make sense to go any further unless you're actually sure about factoring if this is just a little side note if this is not factorable then we have some issues uh with a quadratic you do the quadratic formula and you'd have to factor with a quadratic it's quite annoying you're probably not going to run into that but you have to do that if it's a over a power two then you'd go back to rational zeros theorem you'd find a factor and two division like synthetic division to factor that out so it can get very very tedious you're almost certainly not going to run into that in this class but i want to prepare you for it so that we're not just limiting your ability okay uh this 3x squared minus 11x minus 4. i'm going to do that right here take my negative 11 and negative 12. that's negative 12 and 1 that adds an 8 11 multiplies to negative 12. if i divide by my a and simplify we're going to get 1x minus 4 and we're going to get 3x plus 1. and now before we go any further we're going to define our domain so we take a look at our denominator which is factored now looks great we do not cancel those out what we do is we say all right by the zero product property if x minus four equals zero we'd have an undefined value if three x plus one equals zero we'd have another undefined value let's solve those so these two values define our domain we can have any value of x as long as we don't allow 4 or negative 1 3 those would cause undefined values inside of our function that's a problem and now we're going to define what those problems create graphically so let's look back at the four four comes and factor x minus four x minus 4 we're just going to ask can you cancel that yeah and if you can then at x equals 4 we add a whole in just a moment we're going to simplify that and we're going to plug in 4 to figure out where the hole is where the missing point is where the undefined value is in our graph now at x equals negative 1 3 that came from comes from three x plus one can you cancel three x plus one uh no there's nothing to cancel there so what that says is that at x equals negative one third we're gonna have a vertical asymptote because it's a power one multiplicity one it's going to be odd so like this or like this around x equals negative x equals negative one third so we said we can't plug in that value therefore there's going to be nothing there but it's a vertical asymptote in this case we can't plug in four there should be nothing there but to be a whole in this case in both cases vertical asymptote or whole there is a missing value of x now we're going to simplify this and say all right if we cancel out x minus 4 this function is going to look exactly like this function except it's going to have a missing point we need to show where that missing point is stop for a second notice though do you notice that this function has exactly the same end behavior as this one so if you divide here's power one power one that says horizontal asymptote at coefficients that's two thirds that's exactly that do you notice that this has exactly the same vertical asymptote as this does negative one-third this says something if some and sometimes this benefits you if you have a hole sometimes you can find your end behavior easier if you cancel out the hole the problem is you don't know if you have a hole until you factor it so you might want to risk that if you think factoring is going to cancel out a factor for you then you might want to find your end behavior later because it's just a little bit easier and your vertical aspect will still appear here's the one thing you can do you can't go oh i'm just going to cancel it and this doesn't matter this absolutely matters and you need to evaluate your simplified function to find the value of that whole to find the value of that missing point so we're going to take and we're going to evaluate this for four so we're plugging in four now if i evaluate 4 that's 2 times 4 plus 3 let's see if it's 8 plus 3 that's 11 over 13. so we're going to have a missing value on our function at 4 comma 11 13. you are always going to do this here's why i've seen a lot of students go oh i have a hole at x equals four then they go to the x-axis and they put a hole that is not at all what this is saying this is saying that at the value four comma eleven thirteen so almost four comma one there is your missing point your function is going to come to that missing point it's going to leave that missing point it's going to leave that point empty this graph will look exactly like this graph except it will be missing that point so how do we do it we graph this and we take out that point that's what the hole does and it gives us that graph and that's kind of cool i'm going to come back with two more examples where we uh deal with some oblique asymptotes and then we'll be done all right here we go let's take a look at g of x first thing that we do with standard form polynomials and rational functions is find end behavior and so we're going to do that right now if this had all been factored we would fake distribute and find end behavior first anyway so that's usually the first thing we do almost all the time so we're going to take and say hey g of x in its end behavior is going to look a lot like x cubed over x squared our leading terms in ratio and simplify them this is just x to the first power here wait a minute x to the first power is a diagonal line if you think back to that video on oblique asymptotes if your numerator is larger than your denominator in terms of degree by exactly one you will have a slant or diagonal or oblique asymptote we have to find that so you have an option here with oblique asymptotes there there's kind of two cases one where you can cancel out a factor and one where you can't so if you know that you're going to be able to cancel a factor you might try to factor first and i'll show you that in that example if you don't i have no idea uh well which i do but you might try to to just do your long division to figure out your your slant asymptote um it's kind of up to you try both ways and see which one works works for you what i'm going to show you is both ways so firstly if you don't know if you're going to be able to cancel something out you're just going to have to straight up do long division right now as soon as you determine hey my end behavior is x to the first power pause that's not horizontal that's not just x equals power one you need to go a little further so we're going to take and we're going to divide x cubed minus eight by x squared minus five x plus six remember that synthetic division does not work here but we only have two steps we need to do we take first term divided by first term we distribute we subtract and we're pretty much done we don't have to bring this down i do not care all we need to do is take first term divided by first term 5x squared divided by x squared is just simply 5 plus 5. don't worry about distribution this right here this is your oblique or slant or diagonal asymptote so we'd say we have an oblique asymptote at y equals x plus five i only did one example in oblique acid fields they don't actually happen all that often for us but you only need to do two steps on your long division so as soon as you determine that is one degree more than that one do your long division do only two steps divide first term by first term we did that would be x distribute subtract term by term zero minus negative five is plus zero minus six is negative six and then do first term divided by first term five x squared divided by x squared is just positive five x plus five you're done you don't even really need to subtract this one this is your oblique asymptote for sure that's going to help us graph in the next video the next thing we do is we factor everything so that can be sort of difficult if you don't remember some of the factoring techniques like x cubed minus eight well that's a difference of cubes difference of cubes works kind of funny what we do is we take first term minus second term so x minus two and then inside the next set of parentheses you take first thing squared minus multiply them sorry plus multiply them together plus second things squared which is four we've done that a couple times but not very often so it has this formula you might want to look up this pattern that says you have the same sign and then opposite sides and then always a plus so first minus second first squared plus multiply them together and then second thing squared that would be 2 squared this thing squared this comes from the 2 times the x and this comes from the first thing squared that's how that works on our denominator well we have a fairly simple quadratic that we can factor that's negative 3 and negative 2 dividing by 1 doesn't change those so this is a pretty nice one x minus 3 and x minus 2. after that man we go right to define our domain so zero product property says x minus three equals zero x minus two equals zero x equals three and x equals two those are problems so our domain says you can't have that that bad now define what they create if you can cancel out the factor that's giving you your domain restriction as a whole if you can't it's a vertical asymptote so we look back at three comes from x minus three i cannot cancel that factor there is no x minus three that's an irreducible quadratic you could check it real quick if you want to but if you tried quadratic formula it's going to give you 4 squared minus 4 times 1 times 4. 4 squared minus 16 well that's going to give you negative 12 and you can have that and i inside of your your polynomial if you want to graph it so we know that's irreducible so this comes from this factor you cannot cancel it therefore at x equals 3 we have something we can't have but it's a vertical asymptote and because that multiplicity is 1 that creates an odd at x equals 3 we're doing this or this odd means opposite infinities for vertical asymptotes now x equals 2 comes from the factor x minus 2. so we ask can we cancel x minus 2 yeah sure enough we can what that means is that we can't allow two it's going to create for us a missing point a whole at x equals two we're going to define where that is exactly later so we know at x equals 2 there's going to be a hole we're going to have to define where that hole is so now we're going to simplify this and i want you to notice something this is i said you can sort of go back like a sort of order with oblique if you knew that that was going to cancel which some most time we don't know that you can still find your oblique asymptote from here if you wanted to divide this by this you could even do synthetic division and you get the same thing so synthetic division would say positive 3 remember positive 3 would act like an intercept here positive 3 would be 1 3 add them together 5 and that gives you right there the remainder doesn't matter doesn't matter at all this would be x plus 5 just like that is x plus 5. it actually works if you want to do long division of polynomials here you'd see the same exact thing but your end behavior cannot change if you simplify your function you're going to have the same end behavior two and one still says numerator is higher by one you still have an oblique i even showed you right there the same oblique so the same vertical asymptote you'd still have the same x-intercepts they're not going to be any here so all of that is possible after you simplify it just depends on what you start with so if you start like this sometimes easier to find end behavior just right about alright so now that we have a simplified rational function we're going to plug in that 2 to see what we get so if we evaluate g of 2 that would be 4 2 squared is 4 4 two times two is four and four so four plus four plus four i think that's 12 over two minus minus three which is negative one so we would have a hole at 2 comma negative 12. this function and this function are identical so we graph this one and then just remove one point we have a missing point the function will hit 2 comma negative 12 it will go right over it and then continue it will miss that point that's why we have this domain restriction first do not cancel out first to define your domain first and then say what that does for your graph that's what we're doing all right last one h of x equals nasty stuff well we do end behavior first and we just look at the degree we go okay then hey that's degree two over degree one the numerator has a degree one larger than denominator we will have an oblique asymptote can we do long division of polynomials of course we can could you factor this maybe because it's easy to factor yes but you have to define your domain first so make sure you do that so i'm going to show you that right now this one i showed you this way to say what if i don't know i can factor it like i showed you over here i don't know then do long division if you know that you can factor that maybe spend 10 seconds trying you might want to do that first so i'm telling you this is a little malleable these three steps are not and you have to evaluate for your whole if you do have one so we're going to show that here too but what if you know you can factor that for instance i've taught you well you're all very smart you're very good at factoring if you go yeah i can factor seven and negative three that's pretty easy i mean that that's negative 3 and 10. i know that adds a 7 that multiplies to negative 30. i know if i divide by my a and i simplify so 2 goes into 10 and sorry um and i simplify 2 goes into 10 5 times and 6 3 times three goes into three one time and six two times so i know that my numerator can factor as two x minus one and three x plus five there's a letter you tricky guy what do you do well i knew it was factorable number one because i made the problem but number two because i'm really good at factoring because i made you practice so much you guys are good at it too so maybe try to factor it why well because now we can identify right now that this which is completely factored you can't factor that anymore that right there is going to create a hole for us so we've kind of shortcutted the whole long division of polynomials uh began because of this so we go all right well what's what's that going to what's it going to do well what that does is that says okay set your denominator equal to zero and we'd say our domain says you cannot allow negative five thirds all right let's determine what that does if we look back at three x plus five the factor where we got negative five thirds you can cancel that that means that at x equals negative five thirds we're gonna have a whole now we're going to plug that in and figure out where that hole is but notice that we can simplify our function now we just get 2x minus one now i'm gonna pause because there should be just this question in your head like you should be going but wait wait you said that's two that's one you should have no oblique asymptote where'd they go oh no this is your oblique asymptote this function rides that line 2x minus one forever it is an asymptote it just happens that this function this function is going to be on it the entire time the only difference between this graph and this graph is that this graph is going to have a hole somewhere on that line that's it so can you intersect an oblique and a or a horizontal asymptote yes i made a strong point that you could in fact this function is on that oblique asymptote the entire time it is that graph if you graph two x minus one then you're going to get this function the only thing you need to exclude is one point you need to exclude negative five thirds comma whatever we're gonna get so we're gonna evaluate right now so if i plug that in negative ten thirds minus one that's going to give us negative thirteen thirds and that's where our removable discontinuity is so here's the main point in this example if you were to graph this sorry if you were to graph this function and remove this point you will get that graph that's what this means so can you graph two x minus one easily go down one that's your y intercept negative one uh go up two over one to the right that's your slope take out exactly that point and you will get exactly that function i hope that interests you i hope that's fascinating if if you want to have a minute or so if you want if you want to do this differently if you don't like the fact that i went out of order because you're like me and want everything in order i get it in the same way he said i just really want to do end behavior first that's totally fine if you want to do that and go hey look this degree is one more than that one if i thought about my power functions and simplify that you're going to get 2 x is it a coincidence of that 2x is that 2x it's not a coincidence that's the first thing that you're going to get when you do long division think about that first thing you do with long division polynomials is take first term divided by first term in it it's going to give you exactly that by the way you could do this with synthetic but you have to use negative five thirds which is a little bit awkward to use so i'm just going to do this because it's easier if we divide 6x squared by 3x we get 2x if we subtract we get zero and we get minus three x i don't even care about the minus five now you can put it and it's going to show you something else i really don't care because if we divide negative 3x by 3x we get negative 1. if i distribute which i don't even have to do this right here as we know that is your oblique asymptote we'd say oblique asymptote happens at 2x minus 1. later on we'd go and cancel this go wait a minute that function is 2x minus 1. can the oblique asymptote be your function yes but only if you're missing a point which is what that tells us that's the point so if you want to do this this would still bear out as an oblique asymptote later on you would factor this and cancel and go okay my oblique asymptote is my function it's just this function has a hole in it so oblique asymptote is your function perfectly you just take out one point which we have found anyway i hope that makes sense that's a cool question not a hard example but quite advanced because you have to understand a lot about it to get that so i hope i've made it make sense i hope i'm explaining this well enough for you next video we are going to do everything we're going to graph a whole bunch of examples it's going to be a very very long video i need you to watch it it'll be fun it'll be good times but it's going to put everything together is one of the cornerstones of this course and it leads you into calculus one and graphing functions very very well so i hope you're doing well and i hope to see you for the next video 

Transcript for: Graphing Rational Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 44)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we are finally going to graph some rational functions we are going to do everything that we've learned about but we haven't really put it together and so that's what this is going to be about uh we've learned all the little pieces so we know how to do things like find a hole find a vertical asymptote find a horizontal asymptote x intercepts y intercepts but i'm not showing you how to graph them and there's there's a lot of cases here and so we're going to get a lot of examples but it's going to be a good video so i'm going to give you the steps we're going to go through about six examples five of them going to take a little while one can be pretty quick then two examples of some special cases special instances we can see so we're going to get right into it how we graph rational functions i want to put in your kind of your head what the steps are in order to do this really really accurately and as efficiently as possible so a little bit of speed here but uh but accurate so that's what we want so the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to find some horizontal asymptotes or well there's only one or an oblique asymptote or just straight of end behavior and it's going to be one of those three cases so we're going to talk about finding those first the reason why is because if we factor first well then we have to go backwards to find that so typically your rational function doesn't come factored that would be easiest to find your horizontal asymptote first in that case not too bad these are leading terms from the numerator denominator and we find it if one exists or we do long division for oblique asymptote or we just find certain end behavior so we're going to talk about that first then we're going to factor and find a vertical asymptote or asymptotes or a hole if we have one and we're going to find out whether that is multiplicity odd or even that has to do with how our graph has to interact with our vertical asymptote and if we have a hole we're going to find out where that hole is an ordered pair signifying where that exists or doesn't exist i guess so we're going to do that second after that the next next two are pretty quick we're going to use our numerator set equal to zero to find x-intercepts we're going to plug in zero to find the y-intercept and then kind of a special case if we have a horizontal asymptote that is not zero so a horizontal asymptote equal to zero we wouldn't do this that's what that little note says right there but if we have a horizontal asymptote equal to a constant that's not zero or an oblique asymptote we have to check to see whether our graph intersects that and so we set them equal and we try to solve it if we run into some sort of nonsense statement mathematically well then it doesn't intersect but sometimes these do intersect an oblique asymptote that's a slant asymptote or a horizontal asymptote that's not zero why don't we care about the zero well if we set our function equal to a horizontal asymptote that equals zero we're going to find x-intercepts which was already done right there so we really don't need to do that twice this doesn't happen super often but it can't happen after that what we're going to do we're going to make a number line that has all of our relevant points on it all of our x-intercepts all of our vertical asymptotes on on the x-axis that's what those things would do we're going to make a number line that represents that x-axis and then we're going to plug in some extra points so for every interval that we have we're going to evaluate something and that's going to give us a much more precise look of our graph we haven't done this in the past we've been sketching this is getting closer to graphing it's still sort of sketching but we're moving closer to that because we'll have a little bit more accuracy after that we're getting ready to graph and we're going to we're going to get right to it so let's go ahead let's start again i'm not really trying to teach you how to find a vertical asymptote i'm just teaching you when you would do it i'm not teaching you how to find a horizontal asymptote i'm just showing you how you check to see for an intersection and put on your graph so this is going to be quicker as far as my explanation of these concepts we've already talked about them you've already learned them trust that trust that you have that we're just going to show what the pictures are as we graph them so number one the very first step that we're going to do just to get a feel for how these steps work is we're going to find the horizontal asymptote or oblique asymptote if those exist or end behavior if they don't and how we do that is from an unfactored form it's it's a lot nicer to do that when it's not factored because you don't have to do that sort of fake distribution and use your leading terms already have them so that's what we do at first so we don't have to factor and then sort of undo that so when we take a look at it our leading terms are x for the numerator and x squared for the denominator which means that our end behavior is going to look like the ratio of those leading terms and if you remember what we do is we take those leading terms we simplify it we just think about what in the world that would do as x approaches positive infinity and as x approaches negative infinity that's a limit idea i showed that to you one time really i'm not going to show it to you again we're just going to be thinking through it but really what we're doing is think about this what happens to this function as this variable gets closer to this thing and we do positive and negative infinity actually but the idea is as x gets bigger and bigger and bigger or smaller and smaller not smaller negatively so absolute value larger in both directions what's happening to my function well the one would not change but that number is getting real real big well that means that this this fraction is going to approach zero this is the idea of end behavior it's the same idea it's always just end behavior but the way that we refer to it can be a horizontal asymptote an oblique asymptote or sometimes we get like a quadratic look or some other end behavior like even or odd so in this case so when we have one over x and x is approaching infinity if you ever have a variable on your denominator and a constant on your numerator you're going to have a horizontal asymptote at zero at y equals zero we're going to write that so we're gonna have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero we're gonna put that on our graph in just a little bit once we figure out the rest of our our steps here so that's our that's our first step we take our our first terms our leading terms we put them in a ratio and we think we think what's happening yes there are sort of formulas kind of quasi formulas that says if you have a constant over a variable you have a horizontal asymptote zero that's true but i want you to understand why i want you to go yeah that's zero i want you to think what happens when x gets really big once is the same x gets really big it's it's zero the graph is going to be closer to zero somehow that's why that's there so we have a horizontal asymptote and y equals zero the second thing we're going to do is we're going to factor this entire polynomial we're going to factor the numerator as much as we can we're going to factor the denominator as much as we can and so we get this x minus 1 over x minus 2 times x plus 2 due to that fact it's a difference of squares and then we're going to start thinking about this in terms of do we have a hole or a vertical asymptote do we have some sort of denominator issue that's causing that when we look at it we see two factors on the denominator both of which do not cancel with the numerator otherwise we would have had a whole and both of which would cause the denominator to be zero at 2 and negative 2 respectively so what those things are is those are vertical asymptotes we learned about that so i know that at x equals 2 i'll do a little bit more work i'll show it to you x minus 2 and x plus two both equal zero and we're just going to write a little bit about what that means so we said if our denominator equals zero we have these discontinuities either a vertical asymptote or a whole in this case because our factors don't cancel we've got some vertical asymptotes we have two of them and we also want to know what they are we want to write what the multiplicity is so we're thinking about it going you know what because these come from factors that are one and one as far as their exponents are concerned those have a multiplicity one each that means they're both odd vertical asymptotes so we're going to write that out we're going to write a vertical asymptote and that it's odd vertical asymptote and again odd it's going to be very important for us to see how our graph interacts with the vertical asymptote whether we're hopefully remember this even would match up on both sides go to the same infinities from both directions as we approach those asymptotes from either side odd is opposite so odd opposite somehow we're going to see that bear out in our graph so we've done our horizontal asymptote we've got our vertical asymptotes we've already listed them our multiplicity was one so we just need to understand that's odd and that's going to be opposite as far as our infinities go on step number three we're going to find our x-intercepts this is typically not all that bad once you have this factored your numerator is going to tell you the factors that this that let this fraction equal 0 and that's exactly what our x-intercepts are is when our function equals zero so think about this if our function is set equal to zero so this whole thing set equal to zero if our denominator equals zero those are problems we already did that so the only place where the function can actually equal zero is where the numerator equals zero also i want to say this point it's real important for you to do these steps in order and the reason why is because we don't really want to find an x-intercept before we've taken care of finding a whole why is that well if we find an x-intercept before we've taken a hold you remember that the holes cancel out so you'll find an x-intercept and then later if you found your whole and you cancel them out like wait a minute didn't i cancel my x-intercept yeah kindly kind kind of that's why we we cancel the whole factor and write down what that that whole is before we do x intercepts so at this point you should have taken care of the whole you should have something that's simplified as possible and then we just set our numerator equal to zero it's the only part of the fraction that can actually let the function equal zero so we look at and go all right from this step let's set our numerator x minus one equal to zero and x equals 1. that's our x-intercept oh don't forget this also has a multiplicity to it so it's going to tell you whether it's a cross or a bounce you know what maybe i'll draw it again up here if we set that equal to zero only the numerator has the opportunity so we do that but we also remember that x minus one is its own factor that's where we're getting the x equals one that's where we understand that this has a exponent of one that's a multiplicity one that's an odd multiplicity and when we talk about x-intercepts that means that we're crossing the x-axis here and that's about it so that's the only x-intercept that we have to pay attention to because that's the one that there is so we're going to be crossing the x-axis at x equals one the next thing that we do step number four we're going to go down we're going to find our y-intercept this one's pretty easy you can do it anywhere in the function you can do it at the very beginning that's probably actually the easiest you can do it here when it's factored that's fine you do here when it's simplified not a big deal anywhere you want to go just plug in zero uh which also says that the whole does not if you have one does not affect the y-intercept it doesn't matter where you plug that zero in it's honestly not that bad to do so when we plug in 0 here or here you'd get 0 0 0 minus 1 is negative 1 0 minus 4 is negative 4 negative 1 over negative 4 is 1 4. so when we evaluate we just are evaluating x equals zero notice if you do it here you'd still get negative one zero minus one and here you get zero minus two that's negative two zero plus two is two negative two times two is negative four still you're basically getting the same thing negative one over negative four is still one fourth it's still the same so it doesn't really matter where you go what does matter is after you do this to put it accurately on your graph we really don't want to make mistakes there now you'll see i'm missing step five and here's why if you have a horizontal asymptote that equals zero this step is irrelevant if you don't have a horizontal asymptote or an oblique asymptote this step is irrelevant it doesn't matter and so what we're going to check for is if we don't have a horizontal asymptote that equals 0 or end behavior that's not an oblique asymptote we're going to check for intersection i said it one one i'm gonna say just one more time if you were to go and set your function equal to zero right now so if you took your function right here or right there and you set it equal to zero that's exactly what we have there it would just give you x-intercepts again you don't have to do that but if the horizontal asymptote is not zero you would need to do a step five here in step six all we're going to do is we're going to take these important points that we found put them on a number line and plug in some additional values so here's what we mean by that we're going to take every vertical asymptote and every x-intercept we're going to put them on that number line what this does it models the x-axis for us and lets us go straight to a graph pretty easily so x equals negative 2 that's one of our vertical asymptotes i'm going to put odd vertical asymptote odd x equals one remember this is a number line it's got to be an order that's an x-intercept so we're going to put cross and by understanding the context we understand that's a vertical asymptote i'm not really touching x-axis here it's giving me a vertical dotted line in which i'm going to interact with somehow this is going to be an x-intercept that's what the cross is we are touching the x-axis and then crossing at that point and then x equals 2 is our other vertical asymptote that's also odd probably the most time consuming thing that we're going to do is the next step what we're going to do is we're going to evaluate the reason why is we want some pretty decent graphs all of this stuff has to mesh together like this this horizontal asymptote and the vertical asymptotes and the x-intercept and this y-intercept they all have to work so i'm going to show you how to sketch and then i'll show you how to graph a little bit better one way to graph versus sketch is to introduce a couple extra points so for every interval this is why we do this number line for every interval like this one this one this one this one plug in a value plug in something that's hopefully easy to evaluate into your function and find an ordered pair you can do it anywhere you can do it here from the original you can do it from the factored or if you simplify you can do it from the simplified version of this that's probably the easiest to do so i'm going to evaluate for a few ordered pairs here so we don't want to do 0 because we already have a y intercept so something like negative 1. something like one and a half and something like three so here's what i got when i evaluated these i evaluated negative 3 into my function here or here and i got negative four-fifths i evaluate evaluated negative one and i got two-thirds point five i got negative two sevenths three and i evaluated i got two fifths and you can use decimals that's fine but some of those are not gonna be very nice decimals like negative two sevenths is like negative point two eight or something so our and then two thirds is point six six seven it's it's good enough for us uh but just be aware fractions are sometimes a little bit nicer now we're ready to graph and put everything together so the way that we graph this is the same way that i put these steps forward for you so number one thing we're going to do is we're going to understand our end behavior in this case our end behavior is a horizontal asymptote at y 0. so we're just going to have a dotted line now you've mentioned i've heard i've mentioned this before you've heard me mention it that we have to check for an intersection of a horizontal asymptote keep this in mind you can intersect a horizontal asymptote that's why we have x-intercepts here so we we do cross this it's not the same as a vertical asymptote you can't ever touch that but a horizontal asymptote or an oblique asymptote is something the graph can cross so don't don't make that misconception it's really common for students to go wait a minute now i'm crossing the x-axis yeah that's fine it's okay what happens is we're thinking about x approaching positive infinity that's way out there that's that's not here okay this is not even close to positive infinity so things can happen with this a finite region then afterwards we approach an asymptote so that's what's really happening we're just going to show the dotted line at the ends of our x-axis then we're going to go ahead we're going to plot our vertical asymptotes we have two of them negative 2 and 2. and we're also going to signify that these are odd that's going to help us when we're graphing in just a moment cue our brains into what's going on around them so we're going to put odd and odd do you notice how i'm making lots of little notes to help myself like do that it's really hard to have all this in your head and get it right it's a lot better to put little notes like oh that's odd what i mean in my head right now is that this is either going to interact this way or this way depending on how are our points and how our graph is shaped same thing with that one then i'm going to put down our x-intercept or x-intercept is at x equals 1 and i know it's across so i know we're crossing there remember that i came up with something that little dotted line if it's a balance or we call that a touch sometimes we're not going to use that signify we are crossing x axis after that what we're going to do is we're going to put our y intercept our y intercept is 0 comma 1 4. it's about there we just want to make sure it's on the correct side of the x-axis so it's positive i want to make sure that i put that not accidentally put it down here a real hard time making a graph work if we did that and now the last two steps this and you can probably see i must talk about the difference between sketching and graphing you're going to see that the sketching is quicker but the graphing is going to the graphing to really help you we're getting closer to graphing by using some points here's the idea if all of this stuff has to work together there's really only one way that this graph can be shaped and that is based on where your y-axis is in relation to your x-intercept is in relation to your x and here's why you see these have to have opposite infinities so this way or this way but if we trust that we have all the x intercepts down which we do and that our y intercept is accurate which it is and we found the vertical asymptotes and have their multiplicity correct which we also do and you have your horizontal asymptote which we have then this graph has to interact a certain way so there's no other x-intercepts there is no way for our graph to come down anywhere in this range we cannot do it in this interval we can't do it so because we have our y-intercept there and we do not have any other x-intercepts here it would have shown up this graph has to do this it must hit this from going from positive infinity downward hit it it's got to go and cross here we know cross and therefore because it's a cross we have to interact with this vertical asymptote going toward negative infinity it's the only way this graphing look furthermore because we have an odd vertical asymptote this graph has to now come from up here it can't cross the x-axis we don't have any other x-intercepts and it must interact with our horizontal asymptote on this side because this was from positive infinity and this is an odd vertical asymptote the other part of this graph has to end this way there's no x-intercepts it cannot cross it has to interact with the horizontal asymptote and the vertical asymptote and the opposite because it was odd that's a lot to think about right now so that's the reason a lot of people like me use some points here you see if we put these points on and say hey uh yeah at negative three we got negative four-fifths negative three comma negative four-fifths is right about there negative one comma two positive two thirds here's negative one there's two thirds at one and a half we got negative two sevenths one and a half negative two sevenths and at three we got two fifths it's like point four by putting those extra points do you see how it takes a lot of the maybe not guesswork because we weren't guessing about the sketch but it gives you not only some more accuracy because you have some some actual points but it really shows you where this graph goes like there's no guessing about it now that's why i'm going to encourage you to do that yes it takes a lot of time and i just wrote them up there you have to take the time and evaluate on your function sometimes it's really nasty but hopefully you see it's going to make a better graph for you so now we we have no guesswork we have all of the x-intercepts down we have all the vertical asymptotes we have our horizontal asymptote and we have our points so we graph it trust that you found everything don't accidentally go what if it does this it doesn't because it would cross the x-axis if it did it can't so our graph must look like that it's got to look like that there's no other way for this graph to interact with the x-axis and the vertical asymptotes other than what we've just shown because this is odd i know that now i have an opposite infinity because this is odd it'll have an opposite infinity and we're still going through the points that we just found we also have to interact with a horizontal asymptote we know that we don't cross it because those guys would have been other x-intercepts and we didn't have any of those so is it still a sketch yes it is it is still a sketch because we don't know exactly where this goes we're kind of modeled pretty well but we have a lot more points than we would otherwise but it's still sketchy it's closer to graphing because we're using some of those points we also don't know exactly exactly where like a point of inflection would be um or any sort of and that's where we change concavity it's a calculus one idea we don't know exactly where that is we find that in calc one and so we're getting but we're getting closer to that we're getting much closer so i hope that makes sense this was the first example just going through all of our our steps here unpacking the next five examples we're going to talk about what happens when you don't have a horizontal asymptote that's zero when it's some constant or an oblique asymptote if they intersect where they don't how to deal with a hole and then how to go backwards on some graphs okay here we go we're going to get right into it do another example so as we move through i'm not going to be pausing as much to explain some of the concepts we've already covered the only times i'm going to stop and go a little bit slower is when we've done things we're doing things we haven't done yet such as our end behavior here so i'm going to explain that a little bit when we get there but this is mostly just to get things in your head so that this is all gelling together so uh first thing we do now we're going to look at this and go hey is there an end behavior yeah what is it end behavior takes the first two terms so the numerator's leading term and the denominator's leading term puts in ratio simplifies is what it and we get a picture what it does so we take our x to the fourth over x squared those are our leading terms we simplify we get x squared and then we think about what happens so this right here our numerator sort of outpaces our denominator we get x squared when we simplify and that says our end behavior should look like whatever that power function is that power function is x squared it is going to look like a parabola as x approaches positive and negative infinity so our limit means as x gets bigger and bigger and bigger to positive negative infinity that function says take positive infinity square it take negative infinity square for u positive infinity square positive big square you're going to get this parabola shape to it well that'll bear out when we graph this so we know this is not a horizontal asymptote we know it's not a an oblique asymptote this is just our standard end behavior we're going to draw a little picture of that so x squared looks like a parabola with some things that happen in the middle after that step number two we're going to factor all of this so when we do notice the numerator is a power 4. it's also a difference of squares so we just have to do it twice so on our numerator we can think of this as x squared minus one times x squared plus one over our denominator is x minus two and x plus two it's a difference of squares but that also factors again so we can factor this as x minus one x plus one x squared plus one does not factor anymore that's done over x minus two x plus two and now we're ready to find a vertical asymptote or a hole if we have one so vertical asymptote says look at your denominator look at the factors that are causing your denominator equal to zero write them down and then see if you can cancel them if you can that factor created a hole for you if you can't that factor created a vertical asymptote and then identify the multiplicity of that so our denominator says uh yeah at x equals two and negative two we're going to have some issues i always write down the factor from where i'm getting those it's very very easy when you have different exponents to confuse um where that that domain issue is coming from if you don't write down your factor so i'm writing down x minus two equals zero that way i can follow this back and say oh that had an exponent one i cannot cancel that so this domain issue right there is causing a vertical asymptote which has an odd multiplicity so vertical asymptote odd and the same thing happens here this is coming from the factor x plus 2. i can't cancel it so it's not a whole it's a vertical asymptote and it has a multiplicity 1 stemming from that exponent and so that's also vertical asymptote odd after we've done that what we're going to do is we're going to take this factored form we've factored we would have simplified if we could that would have given us some holes we don't have we're going to take our numerator and set our numerator equal to zero the numerator is the only place that the function can actually equal zero the denominator can't even equal zero that's where we got our vertical asymptotes from so in the numerator we take i'm sorry on this this next step in step three we take our numerator we set it equal to zero and we solve it hopefully you notice it's nice to do it from here because after you've factored and simplified it it's really easy to use a zero product property and say if my numerator is equal to zero it's already been factored i'm gonna set every factor equal to zero and solve so i'm going to set x minus 1 equal to 0 x plus 1 equals 0. this one i could but it's not going to give me anything x squared plus 1 you can't factor that anymore that would give you some complex numbers since we're looking for actual x-intercepts complex numbers don't help us here if we did though if we set the equal to 0 we'd have to list out something like this is no real solution therefore there's no actual x-intercept at least not from that factor that's an irreducible quadratic but the other two the other two are very clearly solvable so we can get one we can get negative one and we understand that because those factors have this power one that's an odd multiplicity and that says those are going to be crosses so we've done a lot of stuff so far we have our end behavior we have a vertical asymptote in two locations we have two x-intercepts two locations we know that they're crosses that's great we know that this doesn't do anything for us the next thing we're going to do is evaluate for zero so we plug in x equals zero you can do it anyway you can do it here on your factored version uh simplified version you can do it here i think honestly it's easiest to do at the beginning so if we plug in zero there zero minus one over zero minus four we get the same y-intercept that we do on the previous graph this graph is going to look decidedly different but it does have the y-intercept of 0 comma 1 4. now again we don't have a horizontal asymptote at all in this case definitely not one that's equal to a constant we don't have an oblique asymptote we have just our standard quadratic sort of looking end behavior what that means is that there's no function to set equal to or that there's nothing to set our function equal to and solve we don't have to worry about that step the next couple examples we will show you show you that but right now we say there's no step 5 because there is no horizontal asymptote equal to a non-zero constant there's no oblique asymptote at all you don't have to worry about it it's not going to intersect this x squared end behavior not to worry step number six says let's take everything we just learned let's put it on the x-axis as a number line let's plug in some additional points and then we'll get a good graph so what that means is that in order we're going to take our x intercepts and our vertical asymptotes and we're going to put them here so x equals negative 2 and 2 those are odd vertical asymptotes we're going to write that down our x-intercepts are negative 1 and one we know that those are x intercepts and they're going to cross then what we're going to do and this is kind of tedious part we're going to plug in some values for every interval and there's one two three four there's five of them here so think of the x-axis as a loaf of bread you just slice it one two three four times you slice a loaf of bread once you have two pieces we sliced it four times we have five pieces five intervals we need a point in every one of those so i'm going to model that right now so i have some values here i've got three and positive negative three positive three negative 1.5 positive 1.5 i'm not plugging in anything here because i'm going to show you that the y intercept can work if you have one what we get if we evaluate for negative 3 we get 16. now sometimes using the stuff i've taught you can be helpful because if you think about it real well man i i hope that you're seeing it is that even or is that an odd function if you think about it that's even because all i have is those even exponents if i evaluate for negative x i get the same thing out that's even what that means think about it even means opposite inputs give you the same output if i evaluate negative 3 and 3 i'm going to get 16 that just saved me a whole lot of work i don't have to evaluate for that that's because we know it's even even a symmetric about the y axis opposite inputs equal outputs if we evaluate for negative 1.5 we get about 2.3 negative and we already know that our y intercept is zero comma one fourth now we're actually ready to graph we're gonna go in the same exact order as our steps here so number one thing we're gonna do is check this out this is pretty cool we can put our end behavior of x squared wait a minute what yeah if we picture this as x squared so just remember that this is a this is kind of a a squished graph because my scale is wrong so i would have to plug in two to get four that's a little better i'm going to put that in here end behavior up there i'm going to show you that this is going to work with that end behavior so we do that first we get the horizontal asymptote oblique asymptote some sort of end behavior then we take a look at any vertical asymptote we have we have two of them we've got one at negative two and one is positive two they're both often so we're going to draw those but we're also going to put that this is odd and odd so we're going to interact with that that asymptote at opposite infinity so one's going to go to positive infinity the other side is going to go to negative infinity as far as a function is concerned so we've done that now we go ahead we graph or we plot our x-intercepts our x-intercept has to be negative one and one they're both crosses so we don't put a little dotted line these are not balances these are crosses we put our y-intercept of 0 1 4. remember this is 4 and so this is really really down there close to the x-axis now we're almost ready to graph notice something this this might be quite difficult to do if we didn't have any of these other points so we have to think about this going what on the world set look like well it's definitely doable if you interact with this your graph would have to have that as a y intercept notice how important that is if you didn't know that there'd be multiple ways to go and do this you can cross end behavior don't worry about that you can't cross vertical asymptotes and so how this graph would have to look if these are all the x-intercepts which they are and all the asymptotes and behavior we have which we have that then this graph has to go like this that's a must it has to cross hit that and cross only way to do it is to do this with those vertical asymptotes so if it's doing this and we have two odd vertical asymptotes this infinity is opposite of this one so this would go this way this graph would do this it would follow that end behavior but also have to pay attention to that vertical asymptote this graph would also do this due to two reasons number one it's symmetrical so this part and this part have to look identical it's symmetric about the y it's an even function but also it's got a it's got to work with it's got to mesh with this end behavior and with our points now putting the points on there's going to make it a lot better so 3 negative 3 comma 16. and positive 3 comma 16 those are symmetric values we already knew that one and a half comma negative 2.3 and likewise and now this clears up a whole lot for us so we know that this graph is going to firstly do this take care of the intervals that have the physical points in there and x-intercepts a lot of them that's oftentimes easier to do so we know that this has to follow those values now there's no question because this goes to negative infinity and we have an odd odd verbal asymptote we have to have opposite infinities we also have to follow that end behavior here's the things we don't know about it that's a fairly decent graph here's the things we don't know we don't actually know where our local minima are here they don't have to be at that value they could be they don't have to be we need some calculus we want to figure that out so that's why this is still a ski we are still sketching that's getting closer to the graph by the techniques i'm showing you but that's about it so hopefully it's making sense like the order works these steps work just do your end behavior first then your vertical asymptotes then your x-intercepts y-intercept make your number line do some additional points that will really help you and then everything has to work together if you find out that man when your points is off and you cannot make your odd vertical asymptote work where your point is now up here or something well then you you've messed them down and so that's the time to check your work ah screwed it up and that'll happen it'll be okay but hopefully these these steps are making sense to you you're able to follow what you're able to see like what we've done in the past now come to fruition like oh yeah hey all this stuff we've done little chunks now we're putting it together i'll see you in a minute for another example okay let's work our way through another example so we have this next one definitely a rational function we're going to see in this example now i'm going to slow down for a little bit when you have a horizontal asymptote that is not zero you have to set your function equal to it and see if we intersect i'm going to show you how to how to do that so number one when we have a rational function the first thing we want to do take our leading terms put them into ratios simplify and find our end behavior sometimes it's going to be a horizontal asymptote so we take our function and we say this is about equal to as far as our end behavior goes can be modeled by our leading term of 3x squared over x squared now keep in mind what we're doing our leading terms give end behavior so when putting in the ratio we're finding out the end behavior of our rational function and if we simplify we just get three so what's that mean well that means that as x approaches positive and negative infinity 3 is a constant 3 does not change 3 means oh yeah my function will get closer and closer to 3 as we continue on this is what end behavior does and beaver says as x gets really really big our function kind of gets closer to this value so this takes over the the leading terms take over and so this says we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals three a constant of y equals three at which our fun to which our function will be closer and closer and closer as x gets bigger and bigger and bigger that's what that means now formulaically uh you could do oh yeah when my exponents are the same you just get the coefficients or leaving terms and it's three that's true but i want you to understand why the why is that as you simplify your leading terms which have your end behavior you get a constant out of them that means that the function the numerator generator with really really big numbers are going to get closer and closer to that ratio three over one three over one three more let's get closer and closer to that it's getting closer to this value of y equals three that's why we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals three so right now in my head i'm thinking oh that's a horizontal asymptote that's not zero i'm gonna have a step five in this step i'm gonna be setting my function equal to three and solving it we're gonna find an intersection there we'll slow down for that in just a little bit on step two factor everything as much as you can because this is where we're gonna look for a whole or a vertical asymptote so on our numerator we can factor out a gcf of 3x on our denominator we have that sort of a dynamic problem or a quadratic that we can factor honestly you could do quadratic formula here um if it's not factorable by something easy but that would lead to some seriously awkward vertical asymptotes it can happen but probably not so don't go quadratic formula right away try to factor in this case we have x plus 4 and x minus 3. now since we're looking for a vertical asymptote or a whole we first check out our denominator we say hey these two these two factors here if they equal zero that's a problem for us to identify that they're a problem that we know that at x equals negative 4 and x equals 3 we're going to have some issues either we're going to have a hole or a vertical asymptote now we look at the factor to say x plus 4 from where we get this discontinuity this does not cancel therefore that x equals negative 4 is going to be a vertical asymptote if it cancels it's a whole if it doesn't it's a vertical asymptote furthermore because it has a power one it's odd here we have also this three came from a factor x minus three it does not cancel therefore it's a vertical asymptote it has an odd exponent therefore it's odd now we're on a roll next up is our x-intercepts so once you have a factor it's really nice we take our numerator we set it equal to zero and we solve it the numerator is the only place where a function can actually equal zero the denominator equal to zero gives us discontinuities those are vertical asymptotes in this case so when our numerator is equal to 0 i told you to put some some parentheses around any factor that has a variable in it and what that does that says our real factor here doesn't involve the three the three is telling us that this is going to have a horizontal asymptote of three also says it's kind of a vertical stretch but that x equaling zero when you do it this way shows you have a multiplicity of 1. oops had that one in my mind having x equal to 0 with that parenthesis and that exponent says you have a multiplicity of 1. that's going to be a cross same thing here x minus one equals zero x equals one and because this comes from a factor that has a very exponent of one you have a cross odd multiplicity gives you crosses now for our y intercept so when we take our y intercept we just plug in zero pretty much it's easiest to do that here you certainly can do it here in your factored simplified version it doesn't really matter so we're going to evaluate x equals zero here we get zero over zero minus zero that's zero over negative twelve well zero over negative twelve is zero remember zero in the numerator and a constant on the denominator is going to give you zero so we have found a horizontal asymptote of three we've found our vertical asymptotes our x-intercepts are pretty easy once you have it factored our y-intercept we just evaluate for x equals zero we got it now step number five if you have a horizontal asymptote that's not zero if you have an oblique asymptote at all you have to set your function equal to that and solve it and the reason is it's because a horizontal asymptote takes over as x approaches really big numbers positive and negative big numbers things can happen in the middle in fact our function can cross that horizontal asymptote and it does here i'm going to show you that so when we have a horizontal asymptote that's not zero again why why not zero well if you have a horizontal asymptote that equals zero that's just the x-axis and you've already found x-intercepts so setting your function equal to the horizontal asymptote of zero is just redoing work it's just redoing finding x intercepts it's got to make sense if we don't have a zero we're going to find some additional intersects and intercepts of but not of zero of y equals 3 in this case so take your function set it equal to this if it's not zero when we do that a lot of things should cancel out we typically if we don't get an intersection we get something nonsensical like 0 equals negative 2. if we do get an intersection we're going to get x equals some value and you're going to see that right here how we deal with equations when we have fractions multiply your denominator both sides you would have already simplified this in fact you could do it here it doesn't doesn't really matter where you do it multiply both sides i like to do it from the original or the simplified version if you've cancelled factors that's easiest here we didn't do that so we're going to multiply both sides by x squared plus x minus 12. so both sides get multiplied no problem if we distribute you're going to see it right away you're going to see that a lot of things are going to cancel out like these x squares we have some these do not but if i subtract 3x squared those would cancel if i add 3x and add 36 we get notice i'm adding 3x to both sides at 6x i'm adding 36 that's 36 if i divide by 6 we get 6 we get x equals 6. that right there when you still have an x and it says x equals sub constant you are getting an intersection you're going to have to find that somewhere so we're going to take that six plug it in and find the point of that intersection now what i said is if you still have an x what's that mean if you don't have an x if all of your x terms cancel that is what tells you that your graph is not intersecting your horizontal asymptote that's what says it so solve it if you still have an x yep you have an intersection you're going to right now find where that point is so we're going to evaluate 6 comma whatever in our function if it comes down to here and you get like something like negative two equals zero and you go all my x's disappeared you go yep it sure did that means that your graph does not cross this that's a nonsense statement says there's no solution to that it's no solution means that your graph does not crawl this graph doesn't cross that graph that graph is a horizontal line that's your horizontal asymptote if you come up with this it means these don't intersect if you come within x's they do intersect find out where now the where should not be hard plug in this six player where well you could plug it in here you know what you're gonna get you're gonna do the same thing as if you plugged it in here wait a minute really yeah because you just set these functions equal didn't you so you said they're equal so if i plug in 6 here and i plug in 6 here it's going to give you the same value it's going to give me out 3. notice what you're doing you're trying to figure out where your graph crosses this horizontal line right the horizontal line is always at 3. so if you figure out oh i'm going to cross it at x equals 6 but it's got to be at 3 because that's a horizontal line so this is going to be 3. and if you want to take the time if you don't believe me plug in six here i really don't want to do it uh i'd like you know what i do i plug in six like here so if i did six minus one is five five times six is thirty three times three is ninety six minus three is three six plus four is ten that would be thirty ninety divided by thirty is three but that was much harder to do than just saying it's three yay that right there is where we're going to intersect our horizontal asymptote at six comma three next what we do is we put all of our important values on here so we're going to have a few x intercepts a few vertical asymptotes we're going to put some more points on there too so i know that at negative four and three we have odd vertical asymptote i know that x equals one and x equals zero we have crosses those are x intercepts and now we have to plug in some other values uh you might be able to get away with this as the point in this interval no no problem you could do that uh probably be better to put something else on there but that's kind of up to you i would definitely recommend plugging in some points on these other intervals so i plug in negative five i plug in negative one you have to plug in something here because you don't have a y-intercept it's not already listed so i'm going to plug in half plug in two i'd probably plug in four okay here's the values that i got i got a negative as 11 and 11 and a quarter 11.25 we got a negative one half 1 15. negative one and four and a half keep in mind we also have that point so that's going to help us out a little bit too and now we're ready to graph it man it's a lot of been a lot of work so we're going to take a horizontal asymptote first at y equals three we're going to put that up there next we're going to do is we're going to take our vertical asymptotes and put them on the board we're going to say odd a horizontal asymptote doesn't have odd or even you have to have some other points to figure out how you're going to interact with that you can do it with some calculus but we don't have that right now i should say you can do it with some limits but we don't we don't have that right now we do have that those are odd we also have that we have some x intercepts one at zero and one at one they're both crosses and that's kind of awkward they're really really close together so we're going to have to know right now whether we're doing this or this we also have to know that so that we interact with our horizontal and vertical asymptotes appropriately thank goodness we put in some extra points here and thank goodness we have that that's a big one because that would tell us a lot about this graph um so if i did six comma three right now notice if i if i find out where my graph crosses the horizontal um asymptote it better be on the horizontal asymptote right because that's where it intersects it's what we did intersections happen where you set functions equal we set functions equal to find out where they cross okay what crosses here if we set it equal to a horizontal asymptote it better be crossing on the horizontal asymptote if it does so that helps us a lot now we're going to put some of these other points so negative 5 comma negative sorry positive 11 and a quarter negative 5 and eleven and a quarter we also have negative one comma negative one half we've got one half come a 1 15 that's right above that x axis but it's a huge point isn't it because we have to we know now that we have to have no x-intercepts here come up hit this point cross hit it cross and go back down that must happen at 2 we have negative 1 that verifies that for us at 4 we have 4 and a half and this is going to give us a fairly clear picture of what's going on so we know i'm i'm gonna do this from the place where i have the most points and the most points is typically around the y-axis doesn't have to be there but it typically is so we have our x-intercepts within our vertical asymptotes we have this uh not y-intercept but another point above the x axis so we know that we've got to do this and this it might be helpful to have a couple other points in here we also know because our vertical asymptotes are both odd odd means opposite infinities we have to do this hit this point we also at that point i'm talking about that in a minute we do opposite infinities and somehow hit our horizontal asymptote or well well come close to it on that side as well now what about that point this is where it gets a little weird so we cross this horizontal asymptote but it's still there we also have an odd vertical asymptote this is true you had that point you have this opposite you have to be coming from up here it's got to be decreasing it's got to go through this point it also has to touch this point so what in the world happens here's what happens and we would know this with some calc 1 doing a a local minimum we would know that this hits this point goes down and then eventually comes back up and hits that it gets close to that horizontal asymptotes as it does a little kind of dip here and gets closer and closer as we get to infinity so there's a little dip but it crosses it and comes back up and gets really really close to that original asymptote so we wouldn't know that if we hadn't checked for this we probably would have made the mistake of just coming down here and floating above it and that's not what happens it hits it and it comes back to it so that's why i wanted to show you this example because some fascinating or sort of interesting things happen with uh with the horizontal asymptotes if we intersect them so i hope that makes sense i hope that this is kind of gelling together for you the the sequence of steps i consider this to be a fairly difficult problem to do so if you're handling it great job you're doing well i'll see you in a minute for another exam okay i hope you're ready for another one this one's got a hole in it we're gonna see exactly what to do with the hole that a hole is not something on the x-axis a hole is something that's off of the x-axis typically that we need to see where it's at so we're going to do that and show you exactly what to do so step number one we got to find some end behavior we take our leading terms we're gonna put them in ratio simplify and understand what that does so leading terms here leading terms say that if we simplify we get 2 that's a constant think about it if your function is taken over by your leading terms you put them in ratio and you get 2 that means as x approaches positive and negative infinity this function gets closer and closer to two that says that you have a horizontal asymptote at y equals two this is our end behavior this is exactly what our function is going to get closer to as we get really really big and really really negative the next thing that we do is we factor everything so we're going to take a moment factor our function both numerator and denominator so if we do that i taught this technique a long time ago but if we do this and divide by our a then what we're going to get is two factors we get this x minus two and two x minus one on the numerator we got a difference of squares i think we've seen it three times already i can't stress how important this is when you're finding a hole do not cross out your factors until you identify what your domain problems are tell you identify what your discontinuities are you have to do that first because if you cross and i go oh there's a dot you miss the hole you're missing a point here and you can't miss the point about the missing point you need to find a hole and so when we factor this the number one thing we do is we take our denominator we set it equal to zero and we say there are two factors right now there's two factors that are causing a discontinuity a domain issue one of them is x minus two the other is x plus two so we identify what they are after we identify that they are so these are domain problems now we identify what they are so we look back at this and say okay at x equals two i am going to have a serious issue at x equals negative two i'm gonna have a serious issue x equals two came from x minus two now you look back here and go oh x minus 2 is something that can cancel now you do cancel it it is gone but it's also identified what this is so when we cancel we say hey at x equals 2 we have a hole before you go any further identify where that hole occurs so we already know that it's at x equals two but that does not mean that you go here and you put a circle around that and go oh there's no point on the x-axis at 2. that is not what this means there is going to be a hole in our function it's going to be right in the middle of our graph it's going to look like this there could be a hole it's going to continue so what we do is we say all right we know right now that we set these equal to zero we find some discontinuity some problems identify what they are oh i crossed this factor from where i got the two i crossed it out that means that's a whole now figure where the hole is how you do that you take the 2 i know it's not there we're figuring out where we have a missing point take the 2 and plug it in it will allow you to now that you've canceled this out so our our simplified function looks like this i want to make kind of two mental notes about this uh the first thing is that this will allow you to find the whole plug in your two it'll allow you to find the hole the second thing everything that you could do with this function you can now do with this one so if you want to find x-intercepts forget that use that one if you want to find out uh your y-intercept you're going to do that you can use this one you want to find the horizontal asymptote you actually could have used this too look at this here's uh 2x squared over 2 of x squared here's 2x over x it still gives you 2. it's going to behave exactly the same as that why because there's only one difference between this graph and this graph this graph has a missing hole that's why we have to use this to find it and identify the hole say that one more time that's kind of missing hold this one doesn't but this one came from that so we know this has a hole at that value that's why you identify your whole first before you start canceling your junk out so we've done that now plug the two in so two would say two times two is four four minus one is three over four that's at three fourths so we are going to put an open circle at that point and that's going to signify the graph's got to go through there right it has to it's got to go up to it and then test it but that's going to be missing whole that's a bit open circle for us then we identify okay at this x equals negative two that came from x plus two x plus two cannot be canceled therefore it's a vertical asymptote and it is an odd once we've done that we find our x intercepts x intercepts are always from numerators you can set this numerator equal to zero but i would encourage you to set it equal to zero after you've factored and cancel it's much easier so your numerator is two x minus one if we add 1 and divide by 2 we get 1 half now notice this did come from a factor that has a power one it's basically a linear right so you can't even have a power two in there this is a cross step number four we're going to find our y intercept we're going to evaluate for x equals 0. you can use this if you want to it's not all that bad you're going to get 2 over negative 4 that's negative 1 half or you can use this plug in 0 you get negative 1 over 2 that's negative 1 half either way we evaluate zero and we got negative one-half as our y-intercept now step five step five says if you have a horizontal asymptote that's not zero or you have an oblique asymptote at all you need to set your function equal to your horizontal asymptote that's not zero and solve it and if you have an intersection you have to show that i'm going to show you what it looks like when you don't have an intersection you're going to come with some some untrue math statement that goes what's that mean it means it doesn't cross and so i'm going to show you that right now so we take our function now which function do you want to take this function or this function it doesn't matter so pick the easier one take your simplified function set it equal to 2. 2 being a non-zero horizontal asymptote if we multiply both sides by our denominator we get two x minus one equals two times x plus two we get two x minus one equals two x plus four and we subtract two x you go wait a minute something's wrong we just canceled out all of our x's and we get negative 1 equals 4. yes precisely can this actually happen can negative 1 equal 4 ever well no that doesn't make any sense so what that means is that if this can't happen then this can't happen if this is untrue then this is untrue this means if not possible that means it's not possible for my function to intersect my horizontal asymptote that's what that's saying this says there's no intersection here this says this can't happen so therefore that can't happen there's no solution to it so that says that this graph this graph doesn't cross that horizontal asymptote there's no intersection and now we're ready to put everything on our x-axis to model our graph and then graph it so we have a hole we have a vertical asymptote we have one x-intercept so we put that up there so we know that negative 2 vertical asymptote odd we know that we have an x-intercept at one-half as a cross we know that we have a hole and that's a whole now we're going to plug in some extra values we're going to evaluate for every one of these intervals to make sure that we um that we have an accurate graph you can use your y-intercept for this one that's totally fine so i'm going to do one two three since we already have something in there so i'll evaluate negative three use zero here you'll use one and three this is going to give us 7 1 3 and 1. and we are ready to graph the first thing we're going to do is we're going to put our horizontal asymptote on our graph after that it's time for our one vertical asymptote at x equals negative two now we know that's an odd vertical asymptote and now for our points so we have our y intercept we know that our y intercept is zero comma negative one half that's right down there we know that we have an x intercept at one half that's across that's right there then we go ahead and we say we have a couple other features that we need to need to notice we have a hole your hole is not here notice that would create some sort of really awkward thing here we have to we have to match up with this so it would be impossible for us to cross cross and then not cross again and hit a horizontal asymptote there's no other x-intercept beside the one that we have so we cannot cross the x-axis anywhere else we also know that we do not cross our horizontal asymptote that's what this said you do not cross it so there's no coming up here there's no coming up here going back down there's simply you have to do this and that is what this does for you right where we have our hole this two common three-fourths is at 2 comma 3 4 we have an open circle our graph is going to go to that circle and go past that circle now we fill this out with some other values we know at negative 3 we got seven we know at zero we had negative one half we already used our y intercept at one we have one third and at three we have one this is going to be really clear if you do it this way i hope you see i hope you're seeing how these extra points really clear things up so we know for sure like there's another x-intercept so we know for sure we've got to do this and then we have to go through that point we have odd odd means opposite infinities for vertical asymptotes we do not cross our horizontal asymptote that's what this said no intersection so you don't cross it you go right to it you don't cross it you go right to it the previous example we crossed it and had to come back to it that's not happening here that's how we do our holes what we do is we find them we figure out where they're at and we put an open circle there it's very useful because it gives us another feature of our graph the last thing we'll say is that this graph is the same as this with that filled in that's what it would look like this graph has just that missing hole it's super interesting it's kind of fascinating that they're they're so close this this one is missing that hole which is why we had to do it this way figure to hold first and then cancel it out hope that makes sense we're down to one more kind of serious one and then some special cases and things i want you to know outside of just taking a function and graph it maybe how to go backwards things like that okay we're hammering along this is going to be the most kind of labor-intensive one uh so this has an oblique asymptote in it i gotta show you how to find it um i'm to show you how to find where your function intersects it and what that means for our graph so it'll take a little bit of time to explain that but it's it's going to be the same process that we've gone through so the first thing we do find your end behavior now your end behavior can be one of three things it can be like a power function on or even a positive negative it can be a horizontal asymptote a zero or a constant or it can be oblique asymptote you are going to find an oblique asymptote if this power is greater than that power why because if you do your end behavior and you take your leading terms and you simplify them you're going to get x to the first power x to the first power is a linear function remember the second example we had x squared that was a parabola x to the first is a line it's called a slant asymptote or an oblique asymptote that's what that is however unlike with your your x squared uh what we have to do is we have to figure out where this thing is exactly for a slant asymptote so what we're going to have to do is our long division of polynomials and that can be a little tedious so when you find out that you have an oblique asymptote go one more step take your numerator divide by your denominator and do exactly two iterations of long division and here's what i mean by exactly iterations just divide your first term by your first term so x cubed divided by x squared is x multiply so x cubed minus 9x subtract and we go right x cubed minus x cubed is zero zero x squared minus nothing it's still that 0x squared and we have 0x minus negative 9 that's plus 9 that would be 9x and then check one more does this divide this no it doesn't if you had an x squared here yes you would so let's say that was like x squared x squared divided by x squared would give you one and you put plus one this right here your quotient is what your oblique asymptote is this is the function for it so y equals x this does not matter so we would i'm gonna show it to you right now if this were the case but let's pretend that this were like a a 2x squared or something well then we when you subtracted x cubed minus x equals zero 2x squared minus nothing would be 2x squared and this would be plus 9. we would do one more iteration you'd say 2x squared divided by x squared would be 2 and then you'd have x plus 2 as your slant asymptote you'd go to 2 go up 1 over 1 and draw a dotted line that goes diagonally that's what would have happened now we didn't we didn't have anything right here so as soon as you get to x plus something or x minus something or 2x whatever as soon as you get a linear equation you're done we didn't have this and we didn't have that so this was completely empty that was just 0x squared which is why we just get x and not x plus anything so our oblique asymptote is y equals x now we go and factor everything to figure out where our whole or vertical asymptote if we have any r now if you don't remember how to factor x cubed minus 1 that would be a difference of cubes how you factor difference of cubes you take the first thing being cubed you put it here you put it here but you square the second one the last thing being cubed is one we put it here we put it here but we square the second one multiply the one times the co times your your first factor that would be one x put the same size you start with that's minus one opposite sign and always a plus so this is going to factor as x minus 1 times x squared plus x plus 1. if you don't remember that you might want to go check out like intermediate algebra when you factor difference of cubes so that's on there you can check out the video on the denominator we have a difference of squares again that's gonna be x minus three and x plus three one nice thing about the difference of cubes and sum of cubes is that this is not factorable so it's going to be an irreducible quadratic which is great because that means we only have one x-intercept here now as far as our vertical asymptote or whole what we do is we identify that we have problems so we know that we're going to have problems on these two factors we write them down first and we solve them and then we identify them so x equals three that's a that's a domain problem discontinuity comes from this factor this factor has a power one this factor is not cancelable it's an odd vertical asymptote same thing here since we've already factored our function we set our numerator equal to zero for x-intercepts the only one that actually is is able to equal zero are the linears that you factored non-reducible quadrat or irreducible quadratics like this one that you can't factor try it quite try quadratic formula if you want or do you get 1 minus 4 1 squared is 1 minus 4 times 1 times 1 that's negative 3 instead of square root that is an imaginary number this is not going to give you any more x intercepts just this one so x minus 1 equals zero that comes from a factor that has a power one this is going to be a cross for our y intercept we just plug in zero it's real honestly easiest to do here so in your original or your simplified function if you have holes so from here we plug in zero we're going to get positive one-ninth now for a bit of awkwardness if we have an oblique asymptote or a horizontal asymptote is not zero you gotta set your function equal to it i would recommend setting your original function or your simplified if you cross out some factors that's great but here we have to set this equal to whatever we get here if it's not zero so we take our function the reason why we're not using this one is already factored we have to distribute it that would be a real pain the only time you use something from here for this step is if you have cancelled out a factor and it's something that's nice not factored version anymore otherwise we go right back into here we say if we had a horizontal asymptote that's not zero if we have any sort of oblique asymptote set your function equal to that so we're going to set it equal to x if we just if we multiply and we distribute and we simplify a little bit so if we subtract x cubed both sides these are going to cancel we're going to get negative 1 equals negative 9 x hey look you haven't simplified all your x's that means this function will intersect this y equals x oblique or slant asymptote it will happen where it happens is if you divide by negative 9 x equals positive 1 9. 1 divided by 9 or negative 1 divided by negative 9 is negative 1 9. but remember we've just found a an intersection right so we're not going to go to one knife here and put a little point what we found out is that this function crosses this function at that x value you need a point when you're crossing a horizontal asymptote and when you're crossing oblique asymptote so we're going to cross at one ninth comma something how do you find the something well there's two ways and we saw this when we intersected that horizontal asymptote you can take one ninth and you can run it back through your function or you can run it back through the function you're crossing this is way easier so if i plug in 1 9 here i'm going to get 127 minus 1 i'm going to get uh oh shoot no i'm not gonna get one one more that one 729 minus one i'm gonna get one eighty first minus nine that's divide those things you know what i get i get one ninth why because here's the other function the other function is y equals x what's your y value when x is one-ninth that's what we're doing we're figuring out where this function crosses this so all we have to do is plug it into what whichever one we want which is easier you see if we're finding out where these intersect they have to have the same x value and same y value we found out these intersect when your x value is 1 9 so you have to plug it in to figure out your y value plug it in here you're going to get one knife plug it in here you're going to get one knife which one's easier that one so if i plug in one knife to my x value of the function i'm crossing my oblique asymptote it's going to also give me out 1 9. that's a little awkward but that is a point on the graph that's 1 9 1 9. now why is it the same thing put an output i hope it makes sense because that's exactly what this says to you this says that for y equals x that diagonal line your output equals your input so if i have an input of 1 9 i have to have an output of one night that's gonna make sense the next thing we do is we take all of our important values we put them on here on our x-axis so we have a few points we have a couple vertical asymptotes that are odd we have one cross at x equals one i'm not going to put that point on there but i am going to recognize that this is a point on my graph i'm going to have to put that there it'll be on my oblique asymptote i'm also going to plug in a few other values so i'm going to plug in something like negative 4 i'm going to plug it i'm not going to plug in 0 because i already have that i have my y-intercept i'm going to plug in 2 [Music] so i'm going to take these values i'm going to plug it into my function let me use this one because it's a little bit easier to evaluate for me right now okay so i've taken the time to evaluate i plugged in negative four got negative nine point three two got negative one point four four and got nine we're ready to plot this along with our intersection between our function and our oblique asymptote and our y intercept so we start the same way that we went through this first thing we're going to do is show our end behavior somehow so i'm going to show my oblique asymptote keep in mind it's not perfect 45 degrees because my scale is a little bit off i've kind of compressed this a bit to allow for our space next thing we do we put any vertical asymptotes that we have on the graph and we know that they're both odd finally we put our points on there we put our x-intercept at 1 we put our y-intercept at 1 9. we put our intersection of our of our function and our oblique asymptote so this has to be on this dotted line this diagonal line that is that is our our intersection and this is a little weird so there's a one-ninth for your y-intercept and a one-ninth one-ninth for your intersection between your graph and your obligation this is one reason i put this on here because this is going to show you that this technique of graphing or sketching doesn't give you everything that you you probably should have on a real graph and we'll talk about that when we get there but we put it we put it on there we are 0 1 9 that's this one we have our 1 9 1 9 that's that one we have our x intercept of 1 we know it's a cross we know it's not a bounce and then we put our points on here so negative 4 comma negative 9.3 we also have our y intercept already we do 2 comma negative 1.4 and we have our 4 comma 9. all right and using what we know about this what we know is that we found we found trusted we found all the x-intercepts we also know that this is odd that is odd we also know there's an oblique asymptote that our function has to follow we also know that if we found all the x-intercepts we cannot come back and cross this anywhere that means that because of that y-intercept um we probably should have something yeah honestly we really should have had something in here as well we don't it's fine but we probably should have a point in here and that would show it a little bit more clearly if we plugged in negative one or negative two that this has to behave this way that would be an appropriate step to take now how in the world does this happen what happens there what probably happens is there's a little dip so a little uh sorry a little rise so this probably rises and goes back down it's not flat don't do flat it probably does this a little rise in there but that that teeny local minimum or local maximum depending on what it does that would be found with calculus so we'd have to find that here we know that it's got to follow this there's no x-intercepts hassan or y-intercept has to hit this intersection between y equals x acid or x-intercept cross passage at this point has to be negative infinity can't come back out because this is odd we have opposite infinities we also know that we do not intersect the the y equals x line that oblique asymptote anywhere but here otherwise it would have shown up and we set them equal so we can trust that this doesn't intersect this just loops around and follows that oblique asymptote because this is odd our infinities have to be opposite and something quite similar happens here that we follow that oblique asymptote that's about as good as i can do with hand sketching and this information is to get a look about like that that's why we still call it a sketch it's closer to graphing we have it much more accurate than if we didn't have these these points but it gives you a fairly clear picture of what's going on with your graph so we have just a couple more examples one that's very quick graphing and then some special cases things that we can't do okay this is gonna be a fairly quick example letter version quick of something that that's already factored for you that you really don't want to distribute and how to deal with that also how to deal with a bouncing x intercept how to deal with a um an even multiplicity vertical asymptote so that we're going to explore those things as we go through this so we take a look at it we go right x squared x minus 1 squared over x plus 3 to the fourth should i distribute all that no no when you're dealt this and you still need to find end behavior even like a horizontal asymptote deal do it the way that i showed you with the sort of fake distribution and then what that's going to do is that's going to say take your largest powers that you would get if you were to distribute and so we'd say here's an x squared here's an x to the second power that's x to the fourth on the numerator and if you were to distribute this you'd get an x to the fourth well that's one x to the fourth divided by x sub four is one this is a horizontal asymptote at x equals one i'm sorry i misspoke at y equals one we have a horizontal asymptote y equals one so as x approaches positive negative infinity this graph is getting closer and closer to one somehow the next thing we're going to do is we're going to factor everything hey look at that it's already factored that's fantastic so it means if you were to distribute this you have to refactor it don't do that just take what they're giving and say hey we're going to have a problem if this factor x plus 3 equals 0. that would be a discontinuity so we we say that we have a problem we show what the problem is and then we identify the problem so x minus 3 comes from x plus 3. this factor does not cancel so right here this says this is a vertical asymptote and it has an even multiplicity then we find our x-intercepts so with an x-intercept we take our numerator and set that equal to zero from our factored version now what i told you is that we're really concerned with the factor equaling 0 and then the power of the factor telling us whether we cross or bounce so our factors here are actually x and x minus 1. i don't want you to think of x squared as the factor which you think of x as the factor and the power 2 is the multiplicity so x equals zero by the zero product property x minus one equals zero but the same property x equals one no problem but this is a factor x it's got a power two that means that we have a bounce or a touch this also has a power 2. this is another bounce or a touch now we find our y-intercept but if we do that hopefully we understand that if we evaluate 0 and we have an x-intercept of 0 0 for x-intercept is going to be zero for a y-intercept also you can try if you want to but plug in zero here you're getting zero times i really don't care zero times anything else is zero divided by something that's not zero otherwise we would have had a hole because something would cancel is going to give you 0. now you'll notice that even though we have a horizontal asymptote of y equals 1 i'm not setting my function equal to that one and the reason is if i do that here i'm going to spend a very long time distributing so x plus three to the fourth power is x plus three times x plus three times x three times x three you use binomial expansion either way it's uh it's gonna be kinda nasty um [Music] so we're not going to do it if if you have to then you have to distribute that if you figure out where you have an intersection if you do have one i'm showing you a quick sketch to get a picture of this graph without doing a whole lot of work so this was quick this was quick this was quick now let's see that this gives a pretty decent graph without having to do everything about it without plugging in points even so we get a nice sketch so we're going to firstly do our horizontal asymptote of one our vertical asymptote at negative three and put that it's even that's different we've never seen that before then we put our x-intercepts we know that we have zero and we have one but we also know that those are bounces so i showed you a little kind of trick here if you put a little dotted line in the neighborhood of those x-intercepts that says that we're going to bounce now if those are the only way that we intersect with our our x-axis we probably need at least one other point to say where we're even at and so i would do something like plug in negative one negative one would be good because if we know that we're down here we bounce bounce well that doesn't make a whole lot of sense because we have to intersect that so let's figure out where that negative one is so we're going to evaluate f of negative one okay i've taken the time to evaluate two values i've plugged in negative one got out one fourth plug the negative two and get out 36 and the reason why i did both is because i don't want to take the time to see if this function intersects this horizontal asymptote here's the reason why i plugged in 2 points if i plug in negative 1 and get out 1 4 and plug in negative 2 and get out 36 that's way up there that means that this value let's put it here even though it's way higher than that that means that this is going to have to cross that horizontal asymptote so in plugging these two points i eliminate setting this equal to that and trying to solve it so that's now i don't know whether it crosses here and comes back down but i don't think it does so here's what's going to happen with us what's going to happen is that we know that in order to hit this point we're going to have to and we know that we don't want to hit this point we got to come from way up here we're going to have to cross hit this point we're going to bounce we have to bounce again and interact with that horizontal asymptote now what i admit to you is i don't know if this actually crosses and comes back down i'm not sure we'd have to set this equal or use some calculus to figure out whether that happens what i do know is that there's a bounce here and here so there's got to be some sort of turning point in there somewhere i also know that because this is even i have in these equal infinities i also don't know whether this is crossing here and coming back up we need a little bit more math to do it all i really want to show you in this example was how to deal with an even even has even multiplicity and therefore vertical asymptotes the same infinities also when we have bounces just keep in mind we're not crossing there so this graph looks about like this so we're going to have to come down bounce bounce and come back up so i hope that makes sense to you we'll come back with a couple special cases and then we'll be done okay last little bit some special cases an awkward formation of a function and going backwards from a graph into a function which is not as hard as it seems as long as you follow what i've shown you you'll be fine so what to do on something like that uh number one i want you to understand a couple things about this you can't there are some other ways to do it you can look at this and get some important features out of it such as you can still get a vertical asymptote at zero you can actually get an oblique asymptote at 2x so that that's sort of valuable what you what might be hard to see is that you don't have any x-intercepts uh that can be difficult so my my advice to you is take this find a common denominator and make one fraction out of it it'll make it in the form of a rational that you're used to so because our common denominator would be x we'd multiply the first function by x over x and we get this function 2x squared plus 9 over x i'm not going to spend a whole long time on this this is a lot easier to see that you have a vertical asymptote at zero it's also hopefully easy to see that if you set your numerator equal to zero there is no way that you can make that happen 2x squared plus some other number in no way ever equals zero without imagining numbers so you can't do it there are no x-intercepts there's a vertical asymptote at zero and there's also an oblique asymptote we can see that 2x squared over x gives us 2 x in fact that plus 9 without an x being up here if you were to do long division polynomials you would get 2x you'd multiply get 2x squared subtract you get 0 bring down 0x and go oh it doesn't go in hey there's my oblique asymptote so how this graph looks i'm just need a really quick picture of it this has an oblique asymptote at y equals 2x this also has a vertical asymptote at x equals zero and we know that it's odd because that's a power one so the way this graph looks you might want to plug in one half or something if you plug in one half uh notice that you get something that's let's see 1 plus 18. uh that's going to give you 19. so plug in one having some way up here so what that means is that our graph looks like this and do the oddness that it's kind of an awkward looking graph but getting some information from this is easier than that and that was my point here so get a common denominator make one rational function really easy to see that we have a vertical asymptote at y at x equals zero so on the y-axis that means that we don't have a y-intercept if you plug in zero here you have a problem there's no minor shift there's no x-intercepts it's easiest to see here we have an oblique asymptote it's easiest to see here and then to take care of it so that's what that graph would look like kind of awkward not a lot going on with it but hopefully it's still interesting to you the last one can you take and find a function from a graph yeah and honestly it's not all that bad we just have to put a couple notes on here and then we're good to go so when you're doing this we're asked to do this take a look for some important pieces of information any asymptote and any x-intercept and put odd or even on its multiplicity as far as multiplicity so let's take a look at our x-intercepts first so i see two x-intercepts one is at three and that is a cross across what we know is that crosses have odd multiplicity i'm going to look at negative 1. oh that's a bounce and what we know about bounces they have even multiplicity that's what you're looking for now we take a look at our vertical asymptote we have one here we have one here this has opposite infinity so i know that x equals negative three i have an odd asymptote and at x equals 1 i have the same infinities that means that x equals 1 i have an even vertical asymptote i'm looking for my y-intercept i see it there i'm also looking for a horizontal asymptote i see one at y equals two we'll talk about how to deal with this so when we come up with a function here's what to do first start off with your x-intercepts and your vertical asymptotes and put them in the appropriate numerator or denominator x-intercepts come from the numerator so they're going to give you factors on the numerator just match up the multiplicity so i know that we have an x minus three remember x equals three would be a zero so x minus three would equal zero and that would give us a factor this is kind of we've done this before going from from zeros to two polynomial functions we've done that that's why this is here so we have we would have one factor x minus three because that's a cross i know that we have a power one the next thing we're going to do we're going to understand that x equals negative 1 would be a zero so x plus 1 to 0 would be a factor for us but because that's a balance that has an even multiplicity so given power 2 not 4 or something we talked about why that was in another video but we don't want to go super high and we could put a 3 but it's probably not the case now go with your vertical asymptote so i have 1 at negative 3 so if our denominator is equaling at x equals negative 3 some sort of vertical asymptote then x plus 3 would be a factor on my denominator so x intercepts numerator vertical asymptotes came from denominator therefore vertical asymptotes will give you factors on the denominator one of them is x plus three x plus three notice if that was there that would give you an x minus 3. it has an odd multiplicity because of the opposite infinity so we're going to put a 1 and now we have x equals 1. that was a vertical asymptote so x minus 1 equal in 0 would be a factor on the denominator that's giving us that vertical asymptote hopefully at this point you're understanding we're just going backwards but we're just kind of going in a totally odd like opposite order also so we're dealing with our x-intercepts before our vertical asymptotes getting numerator before denominator and now we're dealing with our multiplicity so an even multiplicity for our our asymptote right here same infinity says let's put a 2. we're almost done the only thing that we have to do now is check for for our horizontal asymptote our horizontal asymptote is 2 now what's that mean a horizontal asymptote only happens at a constant if your degree is the same for the numerator and denominator let's check that here's one two three one two three so i know my degrees are the same here as they had to be to give me a horizontal asymptote that was not zero and not some other end behavior so that had to happen our degrees had to match up on numerator and denominator now i know that that horizontal asymptote is at two so what i'm going to do is i'm going to say hey this would give us one over one i'm going to make sure it's 2 over 1 i'm just going to put a 2 right there and you can double check everything about it but this will be this graph i know my degrees match i know i have a horizontal asymptote too you can fake distribute to try that out i have my vertical asymptotes at negative 3 odd cool positive one even got it i have a cross at three i've got a bounce at negative one and my y-intercept of uh negative two we can plug in two and check that or plug in zero and check that if we want to so if we did that this would be 1 this would be negative 3 and this would be 2 so that would be negative 6 over plugging in 0 here 1 times 3 that would be three negative six divided by three is negative two so we know we're right on the money so that's really nice uh you can do you can do the horizontal asymptote a slightly different way by taking this point that's not on your x-axis and calling this a i'll show it to you now if you called that a then what you could do is plug in zero negative two zero for your x and negative two for your f of x and it would solve that for you uh now we get a equals two and that would tell us hey that a right there that's a two so there's a couple ways to think about that one is just using your horizontal asymptote and you're good to go the other one is using a point off of your x-axis and doing what i did here we've actually done that already we did that in our polynomials when we were in the same section as using graphs to figure out your functions so taking x-intercepts and going backwards so we've done that this is just another iteration with rationals i hope all this makes sense i hope it's gelling together i hope that you understand the interplay between your vertical asymptote and your graph and your x-intercepts your bounces across put everything together right now for you so i know it's long video i hope that you hung out the whole time or watch it over several occasions or put on two times speed so i talk super super quick that's fine too ultimately i hope that you've enjoyed the graphing we're basically done this is as much i can teach you as far as graphing rationals in this class next what we're going to do we're going to talk about inequalities for polynomials and for uh for rationals and we're about done then we wanted something completely different talking about exponentials and algorithms so i hope you're hanging with me hope you're enjoying the class still see you later you 

Transcript for: Inequalities with Functions - Graphically (Precalculus - College Algebra 45)
hey there welcome to another video in this video and the next two videos we're going to start dealing with functions and inequalities together so inequalities that involve functions and before we unpack algebraically how to deal with polynomials and rationals that's next two videos in inequalities we're going to get graphically what exactly it is that we're doing so just a few quick examples on how we determine when a function is greater than greater than equal to less than less than equal to zero so basically how we compare a function to the x-axis not too bad there's just one thing that we need to understand when they're asking you where a function is greater than or equal to zero less than or equal to 0 these are always asking and maybe more appropriately worded this on what portion of the x-axis is your function less than 0 or on what portion of your x-axis are your outputs below the x-axis so where's your graph below sorry below the x-axis or above the x-axis on what portion of the x-axis is your function above it or below it that's what these are asking so that's what i'm going to show you it's all about the x-axis so we're not doing this so much as we're doing this so along the x-axis i'm going to show you that i'm going to model that for you on four examples some involving some polynomials and some involving some rationals as we see asymptotes up there so again here's the question so what this asks is according to your graph of your function i want to find the portion of your x-axis where the function is greater than or equal to zero that's where the function is above the x-axis or on the x-axis and so really we just go from left to right and we ask on what portions of this x-axis am i above it well when we start out we're above the x-axis here so for this portion all the way from negative infinity to zero my graph is above or my outputs are greater than zero my graph is above the x-axis and how we would show that is with interval notation we'd say hey for this part of the x-axis negative infinity all the way to zero my function is above the x or my in my outputs are greater than or equal to zero all the way up to and including 0. now we always have this question when do we use a bracket when we use a parenthesis if you have an equal sign in general we use a bracket the only time we don't do that is if you're asked to find something equal to a point that does not exist so open circle or asymptote we're going to see it a little bit so one segment is okay from negative infinity to zero hey my graphs above the x how about from zero to one well no no my outputs are below zero my function is below the x-axis that doesn't qualify here so the same i want the graph to be above the x-axis the other interval is right here so from one to two and so we'd say there's another one where my function is above 0 where my graph is above the x-axis and the portion of the x-axis where my graph is above it is also 1 to 2. but we're going to say above it or on it and that's what the equal says it says this function is above the x-axis from one to two it's on the x-axis at one and at x equals two and that's what we're talking about here we're saying my graph is above the x-axis from negative infinity all the way to zero on the x-axis at zero and then again it's on the x-axis on this x-axis equal to zero my output is zero at x equals one and then all the way to two and including two and that's the way that we we do this that's what an inequality is asking you for as it relates to a function and zero or some constant above or equal to where i'm below and vice vice versa so how about where's the function below zero same question just for looking below the x-axis the more appropriate wording for this in english would be on what portion of the x-axis is your function below the x-axis so on the x what interval of x is my function below it or on what interval of the x-axis are my outputs negative less than zero well that would be not here all my outputs are positive here my outputs are negative from here to here all my elements are negative and from here onward all my outputs are negative and that's what we would write those two intervals are from zero to one from zero to one all my outputs are negative they're down below the x-axis the functions below x and then again from 2 to infinity we just have to use the appropriate symbols in interval notation when you don't get to include the points that are on the x-axis and that's what this is saying it's saying i want outputs that are strictly below zero not equal to zero strictly blue strictly negative strictly below the x-axis so that would say yeah it's zero but not including the zero not including the zero says you could do like .000001 and if you plug that into this function .0001 it would give you a negative output we're just not allowed to include the point x equals 0 because that's on the x-axis for us so we don't include it we show that with the parentheses same thing for one we're below the x-axis at every value between zero and one but not at zero and one parentheses allows us to do that it says i'm below the x-axis or have an output that's negative from zero to one or between zero and one but just not including them same thing here i am below zero i have an output that's below zero at every input from 2 to infinity just not including the two and so we show that with the parentheses that's about all there is to it we just need to get down kind of the english interpretation of what this means or some sort of a mental picture of what this means when you're asked to find function below zero it what it's saying is what portion the x-axis what are the inputs that are causing your outputs to be greater than or equal to zero so positive or on the x-axis what are your out what are the inputs that are causing your output to be less than zero so below the x-axis let's try a couple more so on the next one we kind of reverse this we say hey can you find the function that's greater than zero without being equal to zero so what this is in english is find me the portion of the x-axis where my outputs are strictly positive or where my graph is above the x-axis that's what it says but not on it so we look at our our graph and we go okay hey my graph is above the x-axis right here and then right here notice i'm not doing this i'm doing this i'm going along the x-axis why well because of the way that we organize our functions x is the independent variable it's what drives the function it's what you get to plug into and then your outputs f depends on that so we can organize our thoughts in such a way to say this portion of my inputs causes my outputs to be positive so it's asking you what are your inputs that are causing these outputs to be positive well those inputs would be negative 1 to 1. this is where my graph is above the x-axis and then again so above between here and here and then above from 2 onward we always use parentheses for infinities because we can't actually get there no matter what we saw that over here that had to be a parenthesis because you can't really include negative infinity it's impossible to actually get there so we always do that but then we look here and we say you know what i'm not asking for the values of x where my graph is on the x-axis where my output is equal to zero i'm saying i want to strictly pause it strictly above that well that would be between negative 1 and 1 but not including them and that would be from 2 to infinity but not including it so i guess a long story made short as if you have an equals you use a bracket for points that are on the x axis and if not you don't next one down here that's f of x is less than or equal to zero kind of the opposite idea this is asking the english where is your function below the x-axis or in other words on what portion of your x-axis is your graph below it or does your graph have negative outputs or zero outputs on the x-axis or below it so we look at it and go well i know my graph is below the x-axis right here and right here on the on the x-axis what that means is inputs from negative infinity to negative one cause me negative outputs inputs from negative infinity to negative one are going to cause me to have this graph below the x-axis since this is also asking you for where is your output equal to zero where is your output on the x-axis we get to include that input we get to include negative 1 saying hey every single value from negative infinity up to negative 1 up to negative 1 is going to give me a negative output it's going to give me something below the x axis at negative 1 itself it'll give me something on the x-axis and that's included here that says okay that includes the output of zero that's fine that's why we include that value if that hadn't been there we would have to do a parenthesis because that wouldn't be included the other interval that we see is i want my graph below or equal to x axis that's from one to two the the inputs from one to two give me outputs that are negative below the x-axis at one and two themselves those inputs of one and two x equals one x equals two give me an output that is zero it is an x-intercept it's saying that's allowed here i want the outputs that are less than sort of negative or below or equal to or on the x-axis and that's exactly how we do these for polynomials it should make sense that where we're not above the x-axis or equal to the x-axis we're below it and vice versa for polynomials they are continuous they don't have any jumps gaps support really any constants for any length of time besides our horizontal functions like y equals constant okay let's move on just a little bit so what about if we have some rational functions we treat them the same but they can be a little bit more confusing as far as interval notation is concerned because we have some asymptotes and if we ask where are we below or equal that can be a little confusing so we'll talk about that again the key here is just what portion of the x-axis is causing outputs that do this or outputs that do that so let's ask the first question on what portion of the x-axis are my outputs strictly negative not on the x but below the x well let's think about it from here to here my graph is above the x-axis so those are all positive outputs from here to here oh hey my output is negative so that's that's one interval where we're below the x-axis or have negative outputs here we have positive and here we have negative for the entirety of this interval so the interval for where my function is below the x or has negative outputs those inputs are from negative 2 all the way to 0 then again from 2 to infinity now we'll talk about the parentheses and the brackets right now so if this as asking you what portion of the x-axis gives you outputs that are strictly negative we don't get to include a zero we're saying i want something that's strictly negative below zero or below the x-axis that means that from negative two to zero well i'm not gonna include the negative two ever no matter what why well negative 2 is undefined negative 2 is a vertical asymptote there's not even a point there so even if we had an equals here we wouldn't be able to include that we'd have to use a parenthesis because that point at negative 2 does not have an output that input does not have an output so we're going to use parentheses here no matter what really we'll see that right down here but at 0 because i want something strictly less than it i can't include the 0. like negative 0.0001 that would be fine that would give me a negative value that's okay but at zero that's on the x i can't include it likewise at two we don't we have another vertical asymptote we can't include that and this says all the inputs from negative two to zero not including zero are going to give me a negative output that's what it's asking for all the inputs from two to infinity not including the two are going to give me a negative output the other one if we talk about hey where's my function greater than or equal to zero it's kind of just the opposite just be very careful with uh with your brackets here we're gonna discuss that for just a minute so where we're looking at the the x-axis where our graph is above it well our graph is above the x-axis or has positive outputs from negative infinity to negative two and then again from zero to that's where my graph is above the x or has positive outputs i'm gonna put those intervals down so negative infinity to negative two and then again zero to two just keep in mind we sometimes get in such a like a zone of thinking equal sign means brackets let's put brackets everywhere well that's true for the zero that's okay but it's not true for the negative two and the two and here's why if we're looking for the function is greater than or equal to zero that means that our outputs are positive or on the x-axis here all of our outputs are positive they're not equal to zero and there's no point at negative two so if there's no point in negative two you can't even plug it in to say whether it's positive or zero it's undefined that's what a vertical asymptote means we can't even do anything with that for that reason because we never actually get to the negative two there's no point there at all we cannot include it even though there's an equals there you can't even plug it in i hope that makes sense like that's what a vertical asymptote meant right is that you had a denominator that was equal to zero and you could not plug that value in because you get something that's undefined well that's what's going on here negative 2 is an undefined input and therefore can't have an output well you can't have an output you can't say whether it's positive or zero and therefore we leave it as an open parenthesis because you can't ever retain that input to plug in the other one in this interval we say we want our outputs to be 0 or higher than that 0 is included that's ok so 0 because it's an x-intercept and we're allowing that we're allowing our output to be zero that is an x-intercept we're going to include that value we certainly do not include the two for the same reasons i talked about here it's a vertical asymptote you can't actually get there and those are the intervals for where our functions below the x-axis or above the x-axis or on the x-axis okay let's talk about our last one very very similar concept at this point you really should pause the video and try it just see if you can identify the intervals where we're above zero and below zero it is a little bit challenging because we have a horizontal asymptote which kind of makes us want to do it different intervals than we should keep in mind this is your x-axis not this one so in the first example i am asking for on what portion of the x-axis is my function strictly positive are my outputs strictly positive is my graph above the x-axis that's the three ways that we can interpret that well this is not the x-axis this is so where i'm above the x-axis well my graph is positive from here to here and then again notice how i pause there's no point here from here to here and then again from here not to here from here to here my graph is positive above the x-axis it does not happen again it's negative from here to here and then a positive again from here to here i misspoke it doesn't happen from here to here it happens again from here here that's still positive that's above the x-axis so when we take a look at it i'm thinking on what section or portion interval with the x-axis my graph positive or above it that's negative infinity to negative 2. now why we have to stop why we can't keep going is because if you have a missing point somewhere even if it's undefined you can't include it in an interval because that would suggest that your graph is above the x-axis at that value and it's not there is no point there so we'd say that this is above the x-axis x-axis above above above but then right here we get the pause there is no point but then right past that right at negative 1.99999 and then forever so just right up to negative 2 and you show the negative 2. remember what parentheses do they say right at that value just past it so you put the negative 2 even though there's no value there the bracket would include the value the parentheses does not it says we can go from negative infinity to negative 2 but not including it that's like negative two point zero zero zero for a really long way and then a one all of those inputs will give us outputs that are positive and then again from negative two just past that so negative one point nine nine nine i'm really really close to it and then all the way let's see the portion of my x-axis here causes positive outputs from here all the way to two now this is asking you for things that are above the x-axis and not on it there's no equals there so i have to disinclude that two with the parentheses because i'm not asking for x-intercepts i'm asking for strictly positive strictly above the x-axis now from the 2 to the 4 i'm negative for sure and that's a vertical asymptote from the 4 to the 6 i've negative for sure but we do cross it again so from 6 onward it's always going to give us positive positive outputs there from so from 6 to positive infinity but since we're not including x-intercepts we have to not include that 6. those would be the intervals of the x-axis that cause our function to be above the x or have positive outputs and not zero the below honestly it's a little bit easier because there's only two little little intervals that have a function value that is negative and that would be from two to four so here's our x-axis from two to four then again from 4 to 6 but just not including that 4 that 4 is again undefined point you cannot include it so we want inputs that cause negative outputs outputs that are less than zero or equal to zero that's x-intercepts so we want inputs that cause negative values or x-intercepts negative sorry positive two right at that x value that is an x intercept so we're going to include that because worst bracket ever because x intercepts are allowed to be included so we're saying that input causes an x-intercept great that's allowed every input from two to four is causing a negative output great that's what we're looking for for itself is undefined you can't include it no matter what at four again it's undefined past four you're causing negative outputs until you get to six which is an x-intercept and that's allowed and that's exactly how i want you to go through uh using these inequalities as they relate to functions just kind of have a picture in your head just remember that it's all about the x-axis it's what portion of the x-axis is causing your outputs to relate somehow to this inequality i hope that makes sense from here we're going to dive into inequalities of polynomials and i'll show you some of this idea as we we get a number line because an x-axis is a number line if you think through what they're asking you like i've just shown you inequalities of polynomials become quite easy and then we'll do something very similar with rational so see for those videos 

Transcript for: Inequalities with Polynomial Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 46)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about inequalities as they relate to polynomials and the next video is inequalities as it relates to rational functions but before we begin this i really need you to have watched the last video when we talked about inequalities from a graphical perspective i need you to understand what it means when a function is less than zero when a function is greater than equal to zero and finding x the interval on x-axis which causes that i need you to really grasp that you see what we're going to do here is we are going to think of these as functions it is a function but i need that mental picture to be in your head because i'm going to teach you two approaches the first one is going to be graphically just like we did in the last video we're going to get a picture just like that makes it very very nice and then i'll teach you kind of a a different way to go where you can just plug in some values and check the inequality to see whether it's true or false so we're going to talk about that as we go but again you got you really got to watch that video you got to get down this idea of a function relating to zero and the x ax the x-intercept uh interval that we we get from sorry the x-axis interval that we get from that so let's take a look at it if we consider this this polynomial as a factored version of some function oh man do you see it do you see that this is a function it's just asking where on the x-axis is this function less than zero in the previous video it's doing this it's asking that question right there on what interval of the x-axis is this function giving you negative outputs not even x-intercepts just strictly negative outputs or the graph will be below the x-axis not even equal to it so what that's going to do is ask to do the following things and basically all of this stuff firstly find x-intercepts that's really nice and it's factored already identify what those x-intercepts are are they crossings are they bouncings and then get a mental picture of that if we can do that it's really easy to identify where the graph is below that x-axis and that's what this is asking you to do so if we're if we don't just fall into the zone of this inequality i do this and this if we fall into the zone of hey that's a function you guys are so smart at it you guys know that you're watching videos staying hanging with me here it's gonna be easy so we just understand that's a function it's asking where's the function less than zero no problem identify your x-intercepts why well x-intercepts are where the graph has the opportunity to cross or bounce to be above and then below or below above and above or vice versa we can go below and above it can cross or can bounce there those are the opportunities where the function has to change from above to below it creates the kind of the boundaries of our intervals and so we asked the question if this function is below zero on part of the x-axis let's find out where that is x-intercepts are a big part of that because they're they're where you can cross or not cross bounds so we say all right let's do the same thing we can do it for a while one x-intercept would occur at five and another because this is factored by the zero product property would occur at negative 2. so we're going to put that on that number line remember a number line like this is just the x-axis but we're also going to put a little bit more about this we're going to do two extra things when we think about this graphically this is going to do two things for you number one it's going to help you really solidify graphing in your head and number two it's going to give you a very very very nice picture of what's going on so you don't make mistakes we're going to put down what these x-intercepts actually are are they bounces are they crosses so this came from this factor which has a multiplicity 2 we should know right now that that creates a bounce for us or a touch we sometimes call it this factor has a power one which means that we are going to have a cross here if we can just get our end behavior ah man do you remember your end behavior and behavior says we would get an x to the second power times an x to the first power if we distributed that's x to the third that's an odd so here's how this has to look we don't have to be super accurate about it but here's how this has to look we have a cross and a bounce this must look like this odd says we start here we end here remember odds look like that or something along those lines so if our odd has to look like this because it's a positive odd we have to start here we've got to cross come back down bounce that models are odd that models are crossed that models are bounced and now we get a very very clear picture of where this function is below zero below the x-axis it's just like the last video only we're doing the graph now so that's why that video is there that's why a lot of textbooks introduce inequalities with those graphs but a lot of times that connection is not made we can do the same graph and so we just think about it okay hey where is this on what portion of x-axis is my graph below the x from negative infinity to negative 2 no problem not including the negative 2 because that is an x-intercept but we're not including x-intercepts here we want strictly negative outputs above above above above above up and then continues to be above above above no problem this is only one interval from made in fade to negative two where this function is below the x-axis i'm going to change this slightly just a minute and i need you to see it what if this had been equal if that had been equal hopefully in your head right now you'd say yeah you know what if that was less than or equal it would include all the negative outputs but it would also include the x-intercept that would include that negative 2 but it would also include one other point and i need you to see it i need to see that this would be below below below below below equal above above above above and equal it would include a single solitary value of x that would allow this function to be on the x-axis and that would be at x equals 5. how do we show that we put a union and we put the individual value of x that's allowing this function to equal x and that's what we're e equal to zero which is on the x-axis so we're allowing that and you put a curly bracket let's say we show an individual value of x that's causing this to be true and that that's that's it so we see that in the next example which i want you to try on your own actually after we factor it together and then and then we'll kind of understand how to how to deal with that so this is really about all there is to it what we're going to be doing is we're going to think of this as a function as above or below the x-axis or on the x-axis drop a very very quick picture of it and then just consider what it's asking you to do there is another way to do this i'm going to show it to you right now before we move on to the next example the other way that we can do this is we can sort of test values and see if they're true or false in our original inequality honestly it takes a little i think that takes a little bit more time because you're very good at graphing you understand this stuff which makes it quick plug-in values can be a little slow but there are some shortcuts which i can show you um the one thing that i do need to make sure that you understand is that with quadratic inequalities you always got an alternating truth it was always true false true or false true false for if you had two x intercepts it was always that case that doesn't happen anymore because we have this whole bounce idea uh what happens is we can have the same truth statement we're gonna talk about that right now and then we'll go into the next next example so here's the idea if you want to test values rather than graph it's perfectly acceptable any instructor i know would accept that just be very careful with it here's what testing values would do for you so we'd say hey you know what i'm going to test a value in each of these intervals and see if it's just true or false according to my original inequality so remember we've we've got that i'm going to erase that i'm actually going to erase our graph for a second so we would evaluate numbers like 6 that's somewhere in this interval 0 that's somewhere in this interval and maybe like negative 3 that's somewhere in this interval and we'd evaluate that in our original inequality right here in the function so we take a number like 6 and say okay if i evaluate 6 i'm going to get 6 minus 5 that's 1 1 squared is 1 times 8 6 2 is 8. 1 times 8 is positive 8. it is not less than 0. well that's a false statement and what that means is that every single input in here is going to give something that is a false statement according to our inequality something that's positive actually and so we're just going to put a big fat f i'm also going to show you how to cheat at this in just a second if you evaluate for zero okay zero zero minus five is negative five and 85 squared is 25. all right zero plus two is um let's see two 25 times two is i really don't care about what it is but it's positive it's positive 50. let me look at this yeah it looks like positive 50 is not less than zero so this is also another interval for which every single input is giving you a positive output and not something less than zero how do we know every input in there does that how do we know that these are the only two x-intercepts that exist otherwise if you factor different these are the only two that exist and because polynomials are continuous they don't have any asymptotes they don't have any holes in them well you have to be all above here because there's no way to drop below the x-axis on a polynomial without crossing it you can't do it now with rational functions you can because of the whole vertical asymptote idea but those will be on our x-axis and so we'll be able to see that and i'm going to give you some some tools for how to how to find that as well so we go all right well i know every input here has to give me a positive output well those aren't below 0. so this is false and lastly we plug in negative 3 that's going to be negative 8 squared 64 times negative 1 well that's negative 64. and so negative 64 is for sure less than zero oh what that means that's true that means that every single input in this interval is giving me a true statement or something negative and so once we've outlined whether our intervals are causing something that's true for inequality or false we just take the true segments and we say hey the only true interval here that's works in my inequality is negative infinity to negative two one drawback is that i've seen just a ton of students accidentally make their their interval from to negative three the value you plug in that's not what's happening this whole graph will be below the x-axis from negative infinity to negative two that was just your testing point your testing value to represent every input on that interval so we'd say negative into negative two not including the negative 2 because we're not really cared about those x intercepts and that's exactly what we had at first like that like that so we're saying we want everything that gives negative inputs not including that zero not x-intercepts so the way to cheat at it this is kind of cool you do the same exact thing you do x-intercepts bounces crosses you write them down and here's the deal because of the way that graphs interact with a bounce or with a cross you can sort of cheat at this plug in the easiest number that you can think of plug in zero if you can't plug in zero plug in something next to zero putting something as easy as you can so we plug in zero and we go okay if i plug in 0 i get something that is false we've already done it and then think think about what bounce means think about what cross means bounce means that you come down and you have the same output sign as you had before you bounced so if you were positive you remain positive if you're negative you remain negative what that means is that if this interval is false then if you bounce you're still going to get a false keep the same truth statement on both sides of your balance false false or true true that will always be the case for you on a bouncing x intercept hopefully that makes sense to you bounce maintains the same sign and so if one's false is false if one's true the other is true crosses don't crosses change sign so if crosses change sign then one of your intervals would be true and then they're false one would be positive one would be negative or one would be positive would be negative like this but somehow that's how crosses work for for our x-intercepts is we change from a positive to a negative or a negative to a positive so this is false then this will be true your truth should change on opposite sides of an x a crossing x intercept same for bounces different for crosses so if i were to do this really quickly honestly i'd probably graph it because it's that's quick um but if i had to plug in a value i'd plug in something really easy figure out whether it's true or false and then what i would do is identify bounces crosses same truth for bounces opposite truth for crosses that's all you really got to do the other one thing i would tell you though is this is a great way to check your work to understand that bounce has the same truth and cross has opposite that's a great way to check your work even if you do the graphing that's all i really want to say about it what you should do now is pause the video and try that example on your own factor it first and then see what you get so of course we're going to get to it now if we factor this and we think about this as the question where is my function greater than or equal to zero or in other words on what portion of the x-axis is my graph above the x or positive outputs or equal to the x x-intercepts that's all we're talking about so how that starts is find your x-intercepts that means we had a factor that also means we're identifying the x-intercepts we're also going to say what they are whether they're cross or bounce at those x-intercepts why because we know that relates to our truth that relates to our graph so we have said this is actually where the function's above the x-axis or on it we found the x-intercepts because that signifies where our graph is above or below that separates our boundary sort where our graph is above or below the x-axis now we're saying because this factor had an even power and even multiplicity that's a balance because this factor had an odd power that's across due to our multiplicity let's put them in order on our x-axis on the number line we know that's a bounce we know that's a cross i'm going to show you the second technique i showed you on this example first here just so you get um that i'm not trying to sway you on which one to do i really don't care what i would do on this problem if i was not going to graph it is i would think hey what's the easiest number i can think of to plug in and where does that fit i can think of to plug in like one if i plug in one that's pretty easy here you can do it anywhere you really want i'm just gonna see whether that's true or false so if i plug in one let's see one cube is one minus four times one one minus four that's negative three is negative three greater than zero no no that's false so what that signifies is that everywhere between zero and four as that's the representation representative of those inputs it's going to give me something that's negative less than zero that's not what we're looking for so this interval is all inputs that give me something that's not true for my my inequality now let's be smart about it if that's false and this bounces this interval is also false a bounce does this and this or this and this it doesn't really matter how it's going if you're going to use this technique all that really matters is this interval's false this was a bounce so that interval is also false they have to have the same sign on opposite sides of a balance if that's false and this is a cross that's true you have to have opposite signs on different sides of the cross so this interval is false this one has to have the opposite sign and it's therefore true so it appears the only true interval is from 4 to positive infinity because that's this number line that's the x-axis we have to be very very careful though oh and i hope that you see it i really do this is also asking you for function values that are equal to zero function values that are on the x-axis those are x-intercepts so when you do this and you identify that's an x-intercept so is that one this equal is including those x-intercepts even the zero so even though that's false and false it's bouncing here isn't it so somehow it's bouncing there that means it's on the x-axis that's allowed that's something we collect and keep with this therefore we have to include that zero as well that is an x-intercept and that's included in being above or on the x-axis outputs that are positive or zero includes x-intercepts and that's one of them so we have to include that i hope that makes sense to you now the graphical approach to it if we did this a little bit differently and said hey there's a bounce there's a cross i do the same exact thing here i write everything exactly the same i know that my leading term is x cubed x cubed has an end behavior that looks like that so what this says is if my end behavior is a standard cubic it's going to come up this is bounce go down somehow come back up and cross at x equals four and then we can actually get a better picture of it where is my function above or on the x-axis above uh on this interval on here and here and that's exactly the same interval notation that we would get so i hope that's making sense um in just a minute we're going to do two more you should be fairly decent with it at this point what i'm going to do is put them on the board and ask you to kind of pause the video and do it on your own i'm going to go right through it all right we're going to get to it so there's just two more again pause this video and try these the one thing you need to know before you pause it hopefully every positive you already one thing you know before you pause it is while this is a cubic and asking whether where it's greater than a lie it looks like this where is this cubic above this line uh here and here and according to the x interval x axis it's asking on what portion this is the english part of it on what portion of the x-axis are the inputs making these outputs more than these outputs or equal to it where the intersect or whether where this cubic is above that linear that's what it's looking like this is a picture of that but this is very hard to do the way that it's written like that we'd have to do a lot of other things that are much harder than doing a very simple manipulation so the simple manipulation is what this problem translates to where a cubic has outputs greater than a linear or again the translation is where are where are the inputs giving you outputs here that are more than this where is the function above the line where's the cubic above the line that translates to this if you get everything on one side in order first term positive and zero on the other side that translates to a different question with the same interval of the x-axis and that's the way we get away with this remember that what this question is asking you isn't um it's asking you where is where is the interval that causes this function to be more than this one or where's interval of inputs where this function is more than zero it's a slightly different question it translates this graph into this graph so where this function is above the line is where a different function is above the x-axis different look but the same interval of the x-axis that's kind of neat making a little shift in our idea that changes the look of our picture but getting the same interval of inputs that are causing both of these to be true they will have the same solution set both of them are asking the same question in a slightly different way one saying what's the set of inputs that makes this output greater than this one this one's saying what's the interval of inputs in making this output greater than zero it's going to be the same interval so set everything on one side greater than or equal to zero or just manipulate so you have zero on one side of inequality and now what it wants to do is factor completely find your x intercepts and see if you can determine uh what our true and false intervals are so we're going to do that right now the first thing we've got to do is factor and find our x-intercepts because that's where we change from above above to below zero our signs can change there so we factor out our gcf of x and then this factors is pretty nice this is x plus three and x minus one and we have three x intercepts we've got x equals zero x equals negative three and x equals one so we said our functions are sorry factors equal to zero we solve them not too bad we got zero we get negative three we got positive one all of them are crosses so that's a power one power one power 1. all of them are crosses all we got to do is put them in order understand a bit about our end behavior and then go for it so our end behavior is a cubic function right here this is really what we're doing this is the x-axis this is your cubic we're asking where what are the intervals that's causing the outputs of my function to be greater than zero or in other words where's the function above the x-axis or on it if we know it's a cubic then this has to have this odd end behavior we know that so we're going to be down here cross cross cross and up here oh that makes sense that's a picture of my graphing hopefully you can tell why i like this technique for you guys because it's it's really going to kind of solidify the graph in your head as you go through it that's the one way to accomplish this and just do the intervals where the graphs above and equal to the x axis the other way would be to plug in a value i'd probably plug in 2. 2 seems like it's going to be the easiest one to plug in for me so here's the second technique and i'll show you the graphing technique if i were to evaluate 2 evaluating 2. plug into here or plug it in here because that has the zero on it that's what we need to know so plug in two and we go right uh probably here would be okay two times five times one plug it in two not one is gonna give us zero we'll plug in two two five and one that's going to give us ten is ten greater than zero yes that's great so that says that every input from one to infinity is going to give us a positive output and that's exactly what we are asking for so true how about this one opposite truths across from crosses opposite truths on different sides of crosses so this is a false and then another cross true another cross false guarantee the truth is going to look like that so there are two working intervals here one is from negative three to zero the other one is from one to infinity we never include infinities you got to give me a parenthesis but we are going to include these values because we know they're x-intercepts that's why we put crosses here we know they're x-intercepts and we're asking for x-intercepts so we're going to include those that is the the solution said that's the interval for which this cubic is above the x-axis and also where this cubic is above that linear that's interesting same interval same inputs and that's all we're looking for what are the inputs that cause this to be true what are the inputs that cause these outputs to be above or equal to those elements there they are they're right there graphically similar but down a little bit different so we're going to get the same truth but you're going to get a picture of it rather than just the true false true uh which one's better whichever will make sense to you whichever one you think is easier because we understand the end behavior and we understand the crosses here we can say where we are above zero above the x axis or on it is from negative three to zero including that because those are x and then from 1 to infinity including the 1 because that's again an x-intercept we get the same exact solution okay last one seemingly simple sort of problem let's think about what this means what this is asking you is where is this powerful function greater than one well this is the x-axis so really the picture of it is here's x equals one or sorry y equals one where is this power 4 above it that's really all the same on what portion of the x axis is my degree 4 x to the fourth power greater than 1. so above this horizontal line of y equals one we can translate that and it's a literal transformation check this out if we subtract one that changes this question to where is x to the fourth minus one greater than zero now why does that work this is a really nice one for us to see if you take x to the fourth power and subtract one from it what's that do well we gotta be thinking that's a vertical shift right so that's the same question as if i took this whole thing and shifted it down one unit everything would shift the same exact graph is as is it's answering the question for where this function is greater than zero is where that non-shifted function is greater than one it's the same thing you just take this and shift it down you get the same interval on the x-axis i kind of missed it there but it would answer the same exact interval and so we're going to show it this way because this is easy to factor and this one's really hard to kind of kind of do algebraically so we're going to factor this we're going to put our x-intercepts on the x-axis we'll figure out where we're above that x-axis and that will answer this interval for us so the factored version of this it's got a difference of squares it's got it twice so we can factor as x squared minus one and x squared plus one we can't factor x squared plus any other number it's not possible to do it's called an irreducible quadratic across the real number system and since that's what we're dealing with we can't factor anymore but this difference of squares we can so what do you do with this one you actually do nothing it's not going to do anything for you as far as x-intercepts because you can't solve it in the real number system it can't cross the x-axis or it's not creating any additional crossings these two do though since we know that we're gonna cross hey that's a power one that's a power one that's multiplicity one that's odd that means that we're crossing those x-intercepts there's only two of them so we have a cross and we have a cross hopefully we understand that if this is a power form this is just that power 4 power function and even shifted down one unit it is going to cross the x axis that's what's happening here across those two locations we also should understand that if that's a powerful it's got end behavior if we have crossings it's going to look something like that it has to cross and then cross it actually has symmetry on it so it shouldn't come as a surprise that our truth has to be the same here and here it does it does have that symmetry we also know that truth should alternate here oh man that should be that should be just right in your head that this should alternate should be true false true or false true false depend on what we're asking here and since we're asking where is this function greater than zero where is it greater than zero that's greater than zero from negative a to negative one and then again from one to infinity do we use brackets or parentheses well since we don't have the equal sign we are not asking for x-intercepts we're asking for strictly what inputs are giving positive outputs where's the graph above the x not equal to it that's negative infinity to negative 1 and then from 1 to infinity those are the two intervals that cause these outputs to be positive or above the x-axis that's where this graph is going to be above 0. that's where this graph is going to be above one if you unshift it the same interval works it's kind of neat if you wanted to plug in a value of course we could plug in zero zero is really nice uh zero to four power zero minus one well that's negative 1 is negative 1 greater than 0 no it's not crossing say that you have opposite truth and we get the same intervals negative infinity to negative 1 1 to infinity but use parentheses because we're not asking for x-intercepts here's what i hope i hope number one's made sense i hope i've made a connection between graphing and these inequalities that we're doing that's what i intended to do sometimes we treat inequalities if i had just taught you to plug in a value we would not be seeing the connection of the graphs with this and i want you to see that i want you to have that that knowledge because you're it's there like it's right there it will really help you with this idea if you understand the crossing versus bouncing and why those truths have to be different well that's important that's why we studied multiplicity and all that and now put it in conjunction with these inequalities so i hope i've made sense for you really really get this stuff because in the next video we're going to deal with inequalities with rationals and we play a lot of these same concepts so i'll see you for that video and i hope you're all doing good 

Transcript for: Inequalities with Rational Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 47)
hey everybody i hope you're ready for another video and i hope you're doing well so welcome and let's get started um today in this video what we're going to do is we're going to talk about rational inequalities now the last video we talked about polynomial inequalities and a lot of the same things you're going to hold true here the where the truth is opposite across odd multiplicity and the truth is the same across even multiplicity with regard to x-intercepts but also with regard to vertical asymptotes so with these rational functions we know that we can change sine or be above or below the x-axis above or below zero where we cross the x-axis but we can also be have different signs where we have vertical asymptotes where we can do this or the same when we can do this and so what it comes down to is with rational inequalities we're going to do the following things we're going to find the x intercepts we're going to find the vertical asymptotes we're going to put them on a number line and we're going to see whether those have even or odd multiplicity and that will help determine the truth here's the main points that i need you to know number one you're going to set your numerator equal to 0 and find x-intercepts you're going to set your denominator equal to 0 and find vertical asymptotes and we're going to write down for both of those whether we have an even or an odd the truth remains the same for both sides of an even multiplicity x intercept or an even multiplicity vertical asymptote the truth will be opposite on either side of a odd multiplicity x intercept or an odd multiplicity vertical asymptote so let's get right into it we're going to see that as we work through it i'll be re-explaining as we go i've known to do and then we'll talk about what happens if you don't have zero what if you have a constant there or another function even what that means so let's get to it what we want to do because we know that the sign can change at x-intercepts or vertical asymptotes for our function we're going to find both of those so we start by setting our numerator equal to zero what this does is this says i want you to find where this function crosses this thing now i'm prefacing what we're going to be doing if this thing is not 0. if it's another number or a function we're basically finding the intersection of this function and that in this case it's the x-axis in this case it's zero so that's why we're setting our numerator equal to zero and that's because this function can only equal zero if our numerator equals zero in general we're checking where this equals this function where they intersect so since this is already factored this is very nice for us we know that we can we can set each of those factors equal to zero by the zero product property and we know a couple things about it these are x-intercepts where this function crosses this zero the x-axis we also know because they came from factors that had the first power these are odd multiplicity that means they're crossing so at this point we know this function has two x-intercepts both are crossing they're right there that that means something that means that these are two opportunities for this function to change sign to go from above to below zero or below to above zero or stay below zero or above zero the next thing we've gotta do is find any vertical asymptotes that we have so we're gonna look at our denominator we're gonna think hey if the denominator equals zero i have myself a vertical asymptote nothing's going to cancel out here that would create a hole but not necessarily a change in sign and so what we're going to do is look for vertical asymptotes really that's about it so we're going to check that out a vertical asymptote here is going to occur when our denominator equals zero and we know that's a vertical asymptote and it's odd in our heads we should be thinking what that looks like that looks like if a vertical asymptotes here that looks like this or like this that's odd multiplicity that means we're gonna have opposite infinities so let's put these on the number line this x-axis and let's see what happens so let's see we've got an x intercept at negative two a vertical asymptote of one we're putting these in order and an x intercept of three and we're going to label what these are it's really important to understand that to label them these are not all x-intercepts that's a vertical asymptote and why it's important is when we write out the intervals for which this is true for which the the solution set for this this rational inequality we want to make sure we know what we're dealing with you see if we have a less than or equals 2 we're going to include where this function is on the x-axis but we can't include a point if it's a vertical asymptote so we're going to show that that way when we get there we can make sure we use parentheses and not brackets but it all comes down to listing that help and so we do a lot of things that we're used to we write down that for x-intercepts we have a bouncer across you right appropriately due to our multiplicity these are crosses and a vertical asymptote we're going to identify that as a vertical asymptote and that this is odd so we have a couple choices number one you could you could draw this like a picture of a graph like we do for polynomials and that does work so if we had a vertical asymptote here and we know that that is odd and we have a cross and across if we take the time to do end behavior which this is going to be a a slant asymptote actually we're going to get across up and then down up so that's that's what this looks like but it's probably a little bit easier just to plug in a value for for one of these intervals see whether that's true or false that one value is going to represent every single input for that entire interval and determine whether that whole section is above or below whatever value that is now why do we only check one number not lots of numbers well we found all the places where this function could possibly change from being above to below this where it intersects it that's it that's in this case x-axis or where we have a vertical asymptote this is going to be the same exact logic that we're going to use if that number is not zero where we intersect it and where vertical asymptotes occur are where this function can change from being above to below this one that's the idea in this case it's just the x-axis it's just zero we're thinking positive versus negative so we're going to check that right now so the easiest value that we can check is zero we're going to plug in zero so if we eval we evaluate for 0 we're taking 0 and we're evaluating it here 0 minus 3 well that's negative 3 times 2 that's negative 6 over negative 1. so we're just simply evaluating this there if you want to see a little more clearly zero minus three zero plus two zero minus one or evaluated for zero and we're getting that this is negative six over negative one which simplifies a six and we know that's not true six is not greater than or equal to zero so this is a false interval and that means that every input in here what's going to happen is if we put in any input between negative two and one it's going to give us a value that is positive y positive well we plugged in 0 to give us a positive value it's given us something that's not less than 0 this would be something above the x axis remember we found out where we can possibly change from positive to negative it's at x-intercepts and it's an asymptotes there's no other points where we can change from positive negative and that's true that all of these inputs are either going to give positive like it did in this case or negative which is what we were looking for so this would be false we plugged in zero it gave us something not true gave us something positive we were looking for below zero looking for negative now here's what we can do because these multiplicities are all odd so they're crossings and they're odd multiplicity think about what would happen if this is false meaning this is positive this is this is creating a positive interval of outputs then this would be negative because we would be crossing the x-axis that's that's a true statement so these are positives outputs these are negative outputs wait if these are positives and not about not less than zero these are negatives and they would be less than zero if you plug in negative three it's going to work uh negative three minus three that's negative six uh times negative one well that's negative sorry positive six divided by 4 that's going to be a um let me do that right sorry negative 4 that's going to be a negative number and so that's a negative output that's less than zero this would be true okay well what about asymptotes remember that what asymptotes do for odd multiplicity is they're opposite so if this is going to positive infinity this one's coming from negative infinity well that means that it's below the x-axis that means that this would be negative values and this because we're crossing x-axis would be positive values and since we're checking for we want negative outputs these are gonna these are gonna be exactly what these truths are notice one thing this this makes it hopefully really easy for you if you if you have odd multiplicity your truth has to be opposite so true false true false because this is odd multiplicity odd multiplicity and odd multiplicity we can think of it as hey we're crossing your signs going to change odd multiplicity your sign is going to change crossing your sign is going to change and that is what we're checking for i hope that makes sense number one just find where numerator equals this thing in this case is zero those are x intercepts and then we're finding a vertical asymptote those are the possible sign changes for a function in this case the actual sign changes they're all odd our signs will change every single one of those x values one being a vertical asymptote now that's that's important because when we go and we write down the interval for which this is true so the solution said we cannot ever include a vertical asymptote well because there's no point there it's undefined so what we're going to say is we want it to be less than or equal to 0. all of the outputs from this interval of inputs are going to give us values less than zero let's say a different way this portion of the x-axis is giving you negative outputs by giving you outputs less than zero or below the x-axis so that's a true statement we're going to write that out as negative infinity to negative two because we are including including right there those values that equal zero those values that are x-intercepts we're going to include this input that gives us 0 and you can see it right here you plug in negative 2 it's going to give you a 0. that's an x-intercept that's on our graph on the x-axis and that says that's okay we want something where we include the x-values that give us 0. that's one of them we included now the other other interval starts at one and ends at three just this little interval we don't write down the false intervals just the true ones but when we go from one to three sure three is an x intercept that's why we write the cross down so that we understand that's an x intercept and that should be included if we have this less than or equal to zero so we're going to include the three but because that one is a vertical asymptote and there is no output there we're going to disinclude that so that says that every single x value on these intervals here or in this interval notation thing that we have is going to give you an output that is negative or zero that's zero that's zero the rest of these are negative even this one because this doesn't include one this would include like 1.00001 which would be really really really negative like close to close and negative and you can't do that but um it would be extraordinarily negative and that's the that's the case here so just to make it easy don't include your vertical asymptote that's why we write this so that we see it we go yeah i'm never going to include that so one last thing before we move on what if this was not here the only things that would change if we don't have the equals is you would use parentheses with the negative 2 and with the 3 because we would want to be strictly below the x axis strictly below 0 strictly negative and those values right there would give you 0 and not negative so we just put parentheses there you leave this one because that's a vertical asymptote you're good no matter what on that okay let's try the next one so we have something very similar the only change is that we have greater than or equal to zero so what this means is that we've got this rational function we're asking what is the interval of inputs what portion of the x-axis is going to give me outputs that are positive or on the x-axis so greater than 0 above the x-axis or on it because that equals so we're going to do two things number one what we're going to do is we're going to set our numerator equal to 0 to find x-intercepts the reason why it's zero we're figuring out where this crosses that and because that is zero we say hey the only place that can happen is where our numerator equals zero that's true this is going to change in a minute when that's not zero we'll set the entire function equal to that and we'll have to multiply by the denominator here that's not necessary i'll show you why in just a second so we're going to find our x-intercepts and then we'll find our vertical asymptotes by setting the denominator equal to zero so step one let's set our function equal to zero i'm going to show you right now why if this is zero it's just the numerator so if we had x plus five squared over x squared minus four and we said hey the only places where where a rational function can change signs or be above or below this is where we have intersections or where we have a vertical asymptote so we're going to do the intersections so how you find the intersection of any two functions you set them equal but we understand about this because we're pretty good at rational functions if you set this equal to zero because that's zero this denominator has no chance of making this equal to zero and if i were to multiply both sides by x squared minus four this does absolutely nothing and it says well that's going to be zero anyway and these would cancel out if you will and for that reason that's what you'll see in a lot of textbooks and what i said even is that if you want to find x-intercepts of a rational function which is what this is talking about in relation to the x-axis you just set the numerator equal to zero because the denominator would cancel itself out anyway if we have zero if it's not zero that's a different story and that's the last two examples that we do so hey look at this it's nice it's already factored it's got a power two we know that if we set the numerator equal to zero and we solve it the factor that has the x is x plus five equals zero we get negative five and because that's a multiplicity two we know that that is going to be a balance or a touch next up what we're going to do is we're going to find any sort of vertical asymptote that we have what happens is that we've got a factor of denominators first figure that out and so we know that x squared minus four equaling zero that's kind of that's a that's a bad thing or at least it's a thing that we won't get a defined output for so if we set our denominator equal to zero and we factor it we see that we have two factors each to the first power now keep in mind this was x-intercepts we know that intersects the x-axis and that is a balance these things are coming from the denominator so don't lose track of what we have these are going to be vertical asymptotes one at negative two and one at positive two but we are certainly gonna write down that there are vertical asymptotes and they both are coming from factors that have a power one which means they're odd and we're ready to go so we've looked at it we've said what we're checking for is where our rational function is above zero positive or above the x-axis or on the x-axis that's what we're looking for we find out firstly where this intersects so we're using just a numerator but that's only because we have a zero we're in general finding out where this crosses this because that is where these functions can be above and change to below is where they intersect since that is a function itself y equals zero that is the x-axis uh we're figuring out where this touches or crosses that that's where we can change from being above to below or below to above and that's what inequality is talking about we also talk about vertical asymptotes that's also where we can change because we have this sort of enormous gap between one infinity and the other where we can just immediately jump up there we don't really jump it's just where the function is but that's where we can change from being above or below the x-axis at well or above and below that function whatever that is so we've done that we found our x-intercept we found our two vertical asymptotes and we're ready to put this on the x-axis and so we put everything in order we don't have to have it to scale that it's fine all we need to know is what you have in order and what they are so we want to identify that that's an x-intercept and we put balance to represent that or touch is fine we know that that is an x-intercept because we put that word we know these are both verbal asymptotes and they're also odd so i don't have a great picture in my head of what this looks like this well i guess we can this has a horizontal asymptote at one this right here is a bounce somehow this is a vertical asymptote and a vertical asymptote with opposite infinities in some way shape or form and so what we're going to do is we're going to put up here one interval one testing number that determines whether this interval represents values that are outputs that are above zero or below zero so i'm going to plug in zero somewhere in here there's a zero so i evaluate for zero we're going to do this off to the side so zero plus five over zero squared minus four zero plus five squared is twenty five 25 divided by zero squared minus four well that's negative four uh 25 divided by negative four i really don't care what that actually is i just care whether it's above or below that number since that's zero this is a negative negatives are not above zero values are below zero so that's false that means that every single value in this interval because we've determined where this function can possibly change signs can possibly change from being above or below that function we determine that as an any x-intercept or any intercept in general or vertical asymptotes so we have all those so we can't change anywhere else that means that every single input in this interval is going to give you the same signed output either all positive or all negative this interval is going to give you all negative outputs that's not what we're looking for so this is false and now we work looks like f sub zero let's just plug in zero so and now we look at at just our really our multiplicity if it's odd then we keep the same truth on the other interval if it's even sorry we flip the truth on the other interval if it's even we keep the same truth so this is a false interval what this means is that this means that every single input in here is giving you a negative output we were looking for positive we don't want the negatives but this says hey you have an opposite infinity so picture this in your head this false means that all your inputs are negative this had to be going to negative infinity but an odd vertical asymptote says okay if you went from negative to negative infinity there you're coming from positive infinity because that's an odd vertical asymptote that's got to be coming from up here that means that every single one of these input inputs in this interval is giving you a positive output it has to be above zero it's going to be an opposite truth and it will never change from that because there are no more vertical asymptotes there are no more x-intercepts we have them all so we can trust in this this says this is true well the same logic works here says that this is an odd vertical asymptote now if there's no x-intercept in here this probably does this that's just the picture of the graph but that's odd what that means is that if this is if this is containing all negative outputs and that's a odd vertical asymptote then this has to be an opposite infinity again well that means that all of these inputs are yielding a positive output odd change your truth now the last one this is a bounce so a bounce says hey if all of these inputs are giving you positive outputs and you're bouncing you're not crossing it you're not changing your sign then all of these inputs are also going to be positive outputs it's going to have the same truth so you can picture this as coming down and bouncing and that's about what that graph looks like there'd be two vertical asymptotes one kind of funny one then a vertical asymptote and a bounce that's what it looks like it's kind of kind of interesting so and we see this we saw this in the last example that if you have odd multiplicity your truth is going to be opposite on that whatever x-intercept or vertical asymptote you have that has that odd multiplicity if you have even multiplicity this is included for vertical asymptotes your truth will stay the same and so that's very important to keep that in mind if you don't feel confident with that you can plug in some numbers you can try something like 3 that'd be fine plug in 3 you're going to get 64 over 5. 64 over 5 i don't care what it is it's positive that's greater than zero that would be true that's what we're looking for is greater than or equal to zero the same thing here like negative three well negative three is going to give you uh two squared that's four over five but it's still positive it's four-fifths positive negative six same thing you get negative one squared is one over 36 minus four that's 32 132 that's also positive this right here is going to be positive so all of those inputs are giving you positive outputs and that's what we were looking for all right so now it's time to draw the interval for it so we're just going to list out all of the all of the true intervals that we have so our true intervals go from negative infinity all the way up to well wait a second we're looking for above the x or on the x which is included in this x-intercept because that is because we identified that it was an x-intercept so we're going to go from negative infinity all the way to negative 2. a lot of students they ask what about the negative five well what's that do if you had to well just think about this for a second if you wrote this as three different intervals you'd do negative infinity to negative 5 but you would include it because it's an x intercept and then you'd say oh yes but i'm also including negative 5 all the way up to negative 2. and this right here is redundant this says this interval includes negative five oh yeah this interval also includes negative five wait a minute if your two intervals that you're separating include the same value wouldn't you just have the same interval from negative negative two and that's what we think of that as you know i'm going to leave that for just now rewriting so we know that we have positive outputs for all the inputs from negative infinity up to negative 2. now can we include negative 2 i know we want to no because that's a vertical asymptote that's why we write that and then again from 2 which is also a vertical asymptote so we use parentheses for vertical asymptotes there's never a time when we include that to infinity that is the interval of inputs that are going to give you outputs that are above this and that's what we're looking for or intersect that that are on that now what would happen if i didn't have this what would that do if we didn't have that then what would happen is we would have to disinclude any x-intercepts that we have since this is true true but there's an x-intercept we have to break up that first interval so this 2 to infinity that would be fine but here we'd say you know oh man we can't include the x-intercept it says not to we do negative infinity to negative five negative 5 to negative 2 and we would disinclude that with some parentheses i hope that makes sense i hope that you're seeing i'm probably over talking the graphing but i wanted you to see that i want you to see that hey all variable aspects really do this even does this we'll get that in the next one because i'll change it for you we'll talk about it for a second bouncies and crosses they matter they matter but really what it comes down to is put everywhere your function can possibly change from above to below that other function so we set them equal and we find vertical asymptotes those that's the two things we do that's all the places where these functions can change from being above to below one another we put those in order we just look at our our multiplicity odd means opposite truth for x-intercepts or vertical asymptotes even means same truth for r for vertical asymptotes or x-intercepts we just need to identify which is which so we don't include the wrong points let's do our last one before we move on to deal with a non-zero other function or non-zero function on the other side of our inequality now this one has a zero what it's asking is the same as the last example where is this rational function above the x-axis whereas this russian function above that function or on that function where the intersect so step one find out where these functions intersect by setting them equal to one another so this equal to that now because that's zero the denominator has no bearing on where these two functions intersect it's all about the numerator which is why we took the shortcut here and what i showed you in the last example so we say because that's zero i'm going to set my numerator equal to whatever that function is because my denominator would be cancelled out anyway you multiply both sides by x minus 1 times x plus 1 and it would cancel because 0 times that would give you back 0. so numerator equal to 0 is find out where they intersect i'm going to start using that phrase instead of x-intercepts because what an x-intercept is is where this intersects that where that function intersects the horizontal line that we call the x-axis which has a value of f of x or y equals zero that's what we're doing so in the next couple examples we'll see that where we're finding the intersections so where these intersect is where they are equal and where they're equal we can use the zero product property and set every function every factor that has an x in it equal to zero now x equals zero that's great and it actually has a power one so we know that this is an x-intercept at x equals zero and it's also a cross i'm going to jump over here x minus 2 equals 0 says yeah x equals 2 and we know that because that factor has a power 1 that's odd multiplicity this is also a cross the x squared minus or sorry plus one don't make something happen that that won't give you x-intercepts don't make a mistake by accidentally factoring this x squared plus one is not a difference of squares it does not factor it's not giving you anything it's an irreducible quadratic and it will not tell you any more x-intercepts than you already have on the board right now if it was x squared minus one yeah sure then we'd factor it and we would get two additional x-intercepts but we don't have that we have two x-intercepts they're both crosses and that's that's what we need to understand about that now we're also going to find vertical asymptotes because the only places where a function can change from above to below another function is where they intersect and where you have a vertical asymptote so we take this on our denominator and we set it equal to zero understanding that anywhere my denominator equals zero i have a vertical asymptote in these cases so we have x equals 1 and x equals negative 1. and we're going to look back at our factors and the exponents that they have we know that these are both vertical asymptotes and they're both odd multiplicity and so we're going to put those on our x-axis represented by that number line and we're going to determine one interval by testing the point and then use opposite infinities pretty much everywhere because these are all odd multiplicity so opposite infinities opposite signs for our crosses and our our asymptotes counter respectively okay so we have these are all jumbled up now so we need to be very careful i know x equals negative one is a vertical asymptote that has odd multiplicity and then we look at x equals zero that's an x-intercept i want to cross x equals 1 that's a vertical asymptote with odd multiplicity and then x equals 2 that's an x-intercept i'm going to put a cross again now in your head you should be looking at this going i didn't know what the picture looks like but i do know that every one of these five intervals is going to alternate truth because all of these multiplicities are odd if you feel more comfortable putting odd for your multiplicities you can but be careful the reason why i put cross or balance is so in my head i understand that is an x-intercept i put vertical asymptote and odd that's the odd is another clue to me that i'm not dealing with x-intercept i'm dealing with a vertical asymptote i can't include it that's why i do that so we just have to test one interval you can test them all if you want to it doesn't really matter i'm going to test this i want to plug in the first integer that seems easy to me so i can't plug in zero or one i'm gonna plug in three so i'm gonna plug in three make sure i understand where that's at that's here i'm gonna evaluate for three in my original inequality so this would be oh that's a lot of threes so three times three squared plus one times three minus two divided by three minus one times three plus one now it looks like we have a lot of work to do but i do want you to understand that i don't really care about the output if we were graphing i would what let me say a different way i don't care exactly what my output is i only care in relation to what that is and so what i'm going to do is i'm going to plug in 3 but i'm going to think that's a positive that's a positive that's a positive oh my numerator is positive that's a positive that's a positive huh my denominator because i'm multiplying two positives is also positive a positive divided by positive is always a positive it's always greater than zero what that means is this has to be true that means that every input in this interval is giving you an output that makes this true that is an output that's positive or above the x axis above whatever that function is now if it makes more sense to you to figure out that this is 30 over 8 and go up that's positive that's fine too it doesn't really matter that's really the only math we got to do if we understand about the the odd multiplicity then we should understand that if this is true and that's a cross if this is above the x axis this is below and that's not what i'm looking for we should understand that if this is below the x-axis and a vertical asymptote that has odd multiplicity that this interval has an odd multiplicity vertical asymptote where it's on the other side so say it again if this does this this one does this because it's odd multiplicity that would be above the x-axis and true but wait a minute there's an x-intercept so this would be above the x-axis but then cross it because it's a cross so this is above then this interval is below but likewise on this this is an odd vertical asymptote if this is below the x-axis on an odd vertical asymptote this has to be above our truth alternates like we would expect it and we're just going to write out those three intervals that we have so the first one says the intervals that are causing me to have outputs that are true in this inequality that are greater than zero or whatever that function is are from negative in phase negative one not including that negative 1. even though it says equals i know that's a vertical asymptote i've written that down then from 0 to 1 not including the 1 because of a vertical asymptote but yes including the 0 because that is an x intercept and those are included i should say that's a point where these functions intersect and the point where they are equal or intersect is included and likewise from 2 to infinity i include the 2 because we're talking about including where these functions intersect and 2 is one of those that's why we label it as a cross that's where these functions cross and that's the idea so this is the uh the interval of inputs for which give you which gives you some outputs that are greater than or equal to whatever that function is and that's the idea so i hope it makes sense i hope i've explained it well enough for you to understand i'm going to come back with two more examples of what happens if you don't have a zero so one equal to a constant and one where we have two functions we'll see in a minute just kidding i thought of something as i was right after the other example that i wanted to tell you and i forgot to tell you so number one if this equals was not there then all we would have to do is put parentheses for our x-intercepts the zero and the two and we'd be all set the other thing though what happens if you have a vertical asymptote with even multiplicity we don't see them very often here but we certainly can't have them it doesn't make it any more challenging we just have to understand our truth and so what we're gonna do is we're gonna say okay if that had an even multiplicity what would happen here well our x minus one would have an even multiplicity our x plus one would be a vertical asymptote and still have odd so x minus one that'd still be a vertical asymptote odd we still have an x equals zero cross we didn't change that x e x equals one vertical asymptote this would be even and that x equals 2 would still have a cross so how does that change everything plug in a value now let's see what happens we can still try 3 and if we evaluate for 3 greater than greater than equal to doesn't matter what we're doing uh if we evaluate for three we're still going to get a positive over a positive and that's still going to be a positive that's still true but when we test this out true with an odd multiplicity is false but false with an even multiplicity makes this one also false remember these don't always have to alternate here's what would happen if this is above the x-axis this will cross here and be below but if this is below for a vertical asymptote and this is even this is starting from below this is all negative outputs here and odd multiplicity says we're going to cross so below to above and an odd vertical asymptote says above oh now you're negative infinity that's false so our truth is kind of switched a little bit this is no longer true in fact we have an interval negative one to zero and if you're including where we are crossing this function intersecting this function then we would dis include the vertical asymptote we would include that x-intercept but then this interval no longer works as well but we still have that 2 to infinity so we get from negative infinity to 0 we go from 2 to infinity we're including our x-intercepts because it told us to include where these two functions intersect if that was not there we just drop our brackets and use parentheses so i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing that those the multiplicity for a vertical asymptote is huge it's just like the x-intercept now we've seen both of those in practice so in the future you can kind of expect that just find your x-intercept or find out your where they intersect find out whether you have a cross or a bounce find your vertical asymptote even or odd the truth will swap for odd multiplicity and stay the same for even now we're ready to move on all right just two more examples but we have to have them because what happens if we want to figure out where a function is greater than or equal to another function that's not zero that's not y equals zero well the same logic happens i've been trying to prepare us our minds for this moment right now but it's a little more involved and the reason is is because when you find where a function intersects zero the denominator cancels zero times anything's still zero when you try to figure out where a function intersects a non-zero function your denominator does not cancel you literally find intersections so the same logic has happened i need you to see that i need to see for the first three examples we set the numerator equal to zero because we were just finding out where the function crossed or touched or intersected the x-axis now we're going to figure out where our function intersects this other function it doesn't have to be zero same logic denominator just doesn't disappear on you so we have to have it so step number one find the intersection set them equal and solve it this is where potentially one function could change from being above to below or below to above another or maybe it doesn't but that's where it would happen the only place where it would happen is where the intersection we find that first the next thing is we still find a vertical asymptote if it has one so that also could change where we're above one function two below or vice versa above to below to above if we have a vertical asymptote so those are only possibilities intersections vertical asymptotes exactly the last three it's just our denominator is not going to cancel out here so we do that we have our x-axis again and we're going to figure out what intervals work the same things i taught you in the first three examples hold true here so let's go ahead let's set these equal we're going to find out where these two functions intersect so instead of just the numerator equals 2 we have the entire function again that's not what we're doing what we're doing here is we're saying i want to figure out where these two functions intersect because that's where we could change from one being above to below the other or above to above below to above all those things we set them equal the reason why we have the denominator is because that number's not zero if that was zero we wouldn't even have to have the denominator but now as we see this remember with zero with 0 we multiplied both sides by x plus 2 and it didn't matter we saw we talked about that a little bit ago but now with 2 when i multiply both sides by x plus 2 wow it certainly matters the left hand side is great we get 3x minus 5. well on the right-hand side it's not just zero so i can't set the numerator equal to two because what we're really talking about is x two x plus four and this is something that's very easy to solve you'll notice right away though we don't have the zero product property because we don't have a zero this is something you're gonna have to take the time to solve so get everything on one side if you have a power greater than one or if you have a power that equals one so just linears get rid of your largest value of x and solve it so we know at x equals 9 these two functions are going to intersect that's important the only other thing we've got to do is also figure out any vertical asymptote so this was the intersect point the point of intersection this is just like the x-intercept except you're not talking about the x-axis that's that's it it's all you got to do so now our vertical asymptote would be if x plus 2 equals 0 we're going to have one of those it's a vertical asymptote it came from a factor that had a power 1 so we're still going to put odd just like we're still going to put cross for that because it's coming from a factor that is power one so let's draw our number line and see what happens so we know what we're dealing with we're going to plug in one value we're going to plug in zero and we're going to evaluate in our original inequality so let's do that if we evaluate for zero that's three times zero over zero plus two so three times zero that's zero minus five that's negative five negative five halves is negative two and a half less than or equal to two yes it is that's true zero is i'm sorry um zero gives us a value that's negative negatives are all less than two so this is true use your multiplicity if this is true and that's an odd this has to be false and if this is true and that's an odd this also has to be false for some reasons that we've already talked about you can think through the same thing the only difference here is that this is not zero this is at two it's a horizontal line at two so where they cross one could change from above to below from above or above sorry below to above from below two to above two where we're looking for below two so it's asking where's this function below the value of 2 between here and here all of these inputs are going to give you an output that is below 2. all of these outputs because this is where it crosses it's going to give you outputs that are above 2. well this is odd vertical asymptote if this is below 2 then this one would be above 2. it's not even going to intersect it we know that because it would have shown up somewhere else so that doesn't happen uh if you look at it carefully this has a horizontal asymptote at three three over one would give you three it's a horizontal asymptote three this never makes it back down to two it can't ever be below uh below two again because it's always above two that should be interesting to you so this is this is the only true interval that we have negative two to nine we're still never going to include anything from a vertical asymptote now we are going to include any sort of intersection point if we're told to if not if that wasn't there we'd have a parenthesis and that is about it the same thing is going to work in the next example all right last one we're going to find out where this function is greater than or equal to this function well there's only two places where these can change from one being on top the other one being on top and that is where they intersect and vertical asymptotes so where the intersect is you set an equal idea so let's set these equal we've done it every other time it's just with the zero you only need the numerator to set to find the point of intersection here we can't do that we set them equal to one another and then we have these um this idea that where they intersect is where they could potentially change from one above to to not being above our intervals would change and so what we're going to find these points of intersection by set them equal we'll solve them in this case we have a proportion we can cross multiply that's fine i want to tell you there are some other ideas on how to solve this sometimes you'll see a textbook say get everything on one side get 0 on the other side that's fine in those cases you typically have to find a common denominator change some fractions around it's not really harder but it is something that that we can do on the previous example that would have meant subtracting 2 and finding the common denominator and we could we could see that we could see if we did that if you subtracted two and got zero then you'd have to take the time to find a common denominator combine some like terms but you do see exactly what happens hey there's our 9. that's our only x-intercept there's our negative 2 that's our only vertical asymptote and that's exactly what we saw on that number line from the last example so you can do it that way here it's a little more involved you get everything on one side i'll show that to you in a minute that's the other option is it worth doing is a common question it just depends on what you what you you prefer uh me personally i think it's easier just to solve this and find the points of intersection and get my vertical asymptotes separately they're not going to change you're never going to get away from that vertical asymptotes it doesn't really matter what does matter is definitely finding the point of of intersection so 3 times x minus 3 and 5 times x plus 1 if we distribute and we solve this so we're going to subtract 3x and subtract 5. and we know that that is a point of intersection of those two functions and it's across it doesn't have a power to that that power says one so we know that's an odd multiplicity that's a cross vertical asymptotes all we've got to do is look at our original function our vertical asymptotes are going to occur when x minus three equals zero or when x plus one equals zero and because they're both coming from factors that have a power one they're odd they're gonna have opposite infinities um what would happen if you wanted to do it differently what would happen if you said you know i really prefer dealing with zero so i'm going to subtract my three over x plus one that's totally fine but notice you are going to have to spend the time to make one fraction so what's going to happen when we make one fraction you will do exactly what you've just done right here so you'll take this and say all right i would multiply it by x minus 3 over x minus 3 and x plus 1 over x plus 1 and you would get 5 x plus 5 minus 3 x well it depends it depends on how you write this typically what we would do is we would make sure that we have this on one fraction first or use parentheses here and distribute in just a moment you don't want to put minus 9. it's going to be plus 9. be very careful with that our denominators though are common and if you distribute and combine some like terms and say hey now that's still zero well let's think about it this changes it to what we just did right just did it like well not just it like 25 minutes ago now we've just done it we can see it we can see that this is just what we've done if this is now the x-axis this is it that's that function now that's zero then this would give us an x-intercept all right or in general where they intersect so subtract 14 that's negative 14 divided by 2 that's negative 7. same exact negative 7 that we have it's still a cross that would still be a power 1 from where we're getting that this is a vertical asymptote in every case hey this is 1 that's power 1. that's an odd vertical for a glass of total 3 and a negative one it's the same idea pick the one that's easiest to you do you like seeing the zero fine that's fine but you're going to take some time to do that you'll have to find a common denominator distribute combine some like terms but finding the x-intercept can be a lot easier and the vertical asymptotes are right there kind of smacking the face so that that's okay if you like this way that's also okay but you have to spend the time to find the point of intersection either way works it doesn't really matter the key is that you need to find that point of intersection whether you have it originally or whether you call this change it so that you have the x axis that's okay you also need to identify your vertical asymptotes or whether they're even wrong so the same stuff happens either way works what we get out of it is that there are three points three x values i'll say because those points would change depending on what function you're talking about whether it's 0 or 3 times 3 over x plus 1. those x values are where we can change from one function being above or below than the other function so we're going to put those up here we have negative 7 negative one and three we know the last two are vertical asymptotes whichever method you use you see it's the same they're both odd and x equals negative 7 is an x-intercept and it's a cross so that's only one we have that's an x-intercept we're going to plug in a zero so plug in zero if you can or an easier number if you can't we're going to plug in zero and we're going to see what happens we evaluate this in the original inequality you can evaluate it here as well that's fine so we do both if you want to if we plug in 0 we'll get 14 over let's see 0 that's 14 negative 3 times 1 is negative 3. 14 over negative 3 is a negative number negative numbers are not bigger than 0. that means that this is false if you plugged in 0 here this would be five over negative three this would be positive three over one negative five thirds is not bigger than three so either way you go you get the same truth in this case it's false there's if you plug in any input between here and here what's going to happen is that this function will not be greater than that function and that's what we're talking about or this function will not be above zero that's what we're looking for so let's see that's false if that's odd this is true if that's odd this is true if that's odd this is false you can test some values if you want to to feel more confident plug in something like negative two four negative eight and you'll get the same exact truth that we just got and that's the idea so what we understand is that on these two intervals from negative seven to negative one and then again from three to infinity we have inputs that are going to give us outputs which cause this function to be greater than or equal to this one to be bigger than it or to be intersecting with it or this function to be above the x-axis and so we're going to say all right let's include our x-intercept let's dis-include our vertical asymptotes so including the negative seven sure it says that we can include the point of intersection but never a vertical asymptote never heard of asymptote never infinity if that were not an equals if that were just a greater than we would just make that a parenthesis and we'd be good to go i hope i've explained this in such a way that you see the similarity between these inequalities that have functions and constants and the ones that have zero we can always change it to having a zero that's fine but sometimes we don't have to this seems like it's a little bit less work we just have to understand the idea when you're setting the numerator equal to zero you're finding the point of intersection of your graph and another well your two functions uh the one on the left side of the inequality and on the right side whether that's zero or something else then x-intercepts of vertical asymptotes and use that multiplicity to determine whether you have the same truth on two sides of a vertical asymptotic intercept with even or opposite truth with an odd so that's about it we're now done with this uh this idea of using polynomials and rationals we did everything i can think of um after this we're going to start talking about composition of functions and then some exponentials and logarithms so that's the second to last thing that we want to talk about in uh in this series this short series and we'll talk about trigonometry after that so we're on a roll i hope you're enjoying it i hope this is making sense to you have a great day you 

Transcript for: Composition of Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 48)
hey everybody welcome to another video in this video we're going to start learning about composite functions or composition of functions and here's the idea what we're going to learn about a little bit later is exponentials and logarithms and how they are inverses and if you compose them well they're going to cancel each other out and we're going to learn about that but it takes composite functions and inverses to finally get there so that's why we're learning this I'm going to tell you exactly what it is how you do it uh and then we'll talk about the domain of composite function in the next video so here's what a composition of functions actually does it takes one function opens up the variable and shoves an entire other function inside it where that variable is so really it's just replacing a variable of one function with an entire other function that's what that statement means so when one entire function is substituted into the variable of another the notation looks a little weird if you've never seen it before if we have two functions f and g of X then a composition of functions says F of G of X and that's how you pronounce it and this says F of G ofx but it really shows you what we are doing so this little open o there it stands for f of G of X it's not multiplication that's not what composition of functions does this is talking about what this is saying now what is this saying it says F of G ofx but here's what it's saying this says in the function f the output G ofx X is the input for f ofx it sounds a little weird but basically if you look at the notation it's saying this x is replaced with this entire function f ofx becomes F of G of X the entire function G replaces the variable X so we're going to show that I'm going to refer back to this when we get to plugging in some numbers over here or evaluating our composite functions but that's basically what we're doing so I'll give you the Leonard technique on how you do composition functions you all know that Taylor Swift is really good at math at least songs reference that so we're going to talk about the blank space as far as composite functions goes the best way to think about them so here here we go let's suppose we have two functions f and g 2x^2 - 5 and 1 - 3x^2 respectively here's what a composite function asks you to do it says I want you to take a look at the first function this first function is what you were composing upon so it says I'm going to look at F ofx I'm going to read F ofx 2x^2 minus 5 now we know about functions we know that the variable of the function the independent variable is where you the only place where you can actually plug something into so in 2x^2 - 5 x that variable is the only place you can plug anything in if you want to plug in five you'd put in five you'll plug in seven you put in seven plug in anything you want you plug anything you want into that X including another function and so what a composite function asks you is take F and open it up allow yourself to plug something into it create for yourself a blank space wherever you have variables so we would keep our two but the x that variable is openable if you if you will create a blank spots that really what a variable stands for anyway right something that you can evaluate into something you can plug into well we're allowing ourselves that with this blank space in your head right now this should signify the same thing that that say this says 2 something you can plug in 4^ 2 - 5 this says 2 something you can plug in 4^ 2 - 5 they represent the same thing so in a composition of functions we look at the first function f we're going to open that with a blank space and then whatever I plug into whatever I want to plug in for f i put it right here well that's what this is saying so again if I want to plug in something like three or five or seven or Nega five or whatever I would put it here just like I put it in for the X this is the place where you put in for for x and if you remember back to how I I've taught you to evaluate I always do this don't I I always take what I'm evaluating or the function I'm evaluating I write a parenthesis and I put a number in there in this case we're writing parenthesis and putting another function so F opens up and this second function is what they're telling you to put inside of that so I'm looking at my comp composition function I'm saying my first function is f I'm writing my f with the blank space I'm allowing myself to plug in for a variable and then the second function listed is what you put inside of your parentheses the entire thing do not separate it it's not separable it's one - 3x^2 that's what G ofx is and so that is what I'm evaluating inside the function f this is taken one function G ofx and substitute it into the variable of another function f ofx that's all there is to composition of functions now we do have to simplify it but I want to pause for a second to make sure that you're seeing it you should be seeing that F the first function got open with the blank space g of X the second function listed got inputed into that got evaluated into it it got comp composed into the F ofx now we do need to simplify this how you simplify these functions is really important so we want to make sure that we simplify any exponents first that happen so we're not going to be Distributing two we're going to be Distributing 1 - 3x^ 2 * 1 - 3x 2 due to the nature that it is being squared so we're going to take a moment and do that we can think of this as 1 - 3x^2 * 1 - 3x2 we should be pretty good at at um at Distributing at this point so we would get 1 - 6 x^2 plus 9 x 4th if we were to distribute that that's 1 - 3 - 3 that's - 6 x^2 and then + 9 x^2 remember that we still have a 2 and we still have a minus 5 so when we distribute we get 2 - 12x^2 + 18 x 4 - 5 and if we combine some like terms we're going to get and we can put in order also we could have done that up here we just didn't do it I gave you a problem that I just thought of and so we if we put this in order then we can put 18 x to 4th - 12 x^2 - 3 if we combine like terms appropriately I'm going to erase this this is just my simplification this is all we've done is simplify this and make this a little bit more usable a little bit more friend in standard form instead of some quasi factored uh form of a polom so we're going to have 18 x 4 - 12x^2 minus 3 this is what the composition F of G ofx created for us it's a new function now in the next video we're going to explore what the domain is going to be and I'm going to ruin it right now the domain of a composition of functions is a combination of the inside functions domain combined with the domain of what you get at the end so we look at two places what are you plugging in find the domain of what you're plugging in find the domain of what you get at the very end and combine those so this domain would be domain here uh well there's no square roots uh there's no denominators that have variables in them um there's no logarithm so our domain is all real numbers there's no square roots here there's no denominators that have variables in them there's no logarithms our domain is also all real numbers so domain of all real numbers combined with the domain of all real numbers says our composition also has a domain of all real numbers we'll explore that a lot more in the next video because we'll have some more difficult compositions so this is what F of G ofx stands for it's just taking one function inside the other function let's move on to the next one let's take a look at G of f ofx now G of f ofx is not in general going to be the same composition as F of G ofx they're not if you want to think about it as commutative they're not commutative you cannot reverse these and get the same thing except for one condition I know that I'm I always teach you before we get there I'm teaching you about inverses right now if your composition is the same F of G or G of f what it means is that those two functions are inverses we'll talk about that when we get to inverses it's it's a big deal um it's important for us to understand that so it's only time your composition can be reversed and get the same thing out and that thing I guarantee will just be X and that's how you test whether you have inverses or not we'll see that in the next video too but in the meantime we're going to explore what G of f ofx means so a composition says take a look at the first function that they reference in this case this is G of X we're going to write G of x to give ourselves a place for us to plug in so I'm going to look at G of I'm going to replace the variable or every instance of the variable with parentheses I need to be able to plug something into that function and the variable is the place where you do it so I'm going to take my one leave it my three leave it and X is the only place if variable is the only place you can plug something in for so I'm going to create a blank space which allows me to plug in for that variable if I had wanted to find G of two I'd plug in two there that's the same thing or G of7 I plug in7 there in this case accomplishes says I want G of F I want to evaluate F into that function so what I want to do is take my function f and this says open up G I've done it take your function f i want to take my function f and evaluate it inside the function G so I have my blank space it says write the appropriate name right F ofx in this case what this has done is this this has taken the function f ofx right here and put it inside the function G right here that's all a composition does if this is making sense to you you're golden you know exactly what a composition of functions really does it takes your first function opens it up basically replaces your variable with a blank space and then takes your second function and pl plugs it in there just kind of forces it in there the entire function all of this in that variable that's exactly what this technique does now we have to simplify so I'm going to be a little bit quicker about this we're going to distribute 2x^2 - 5 quantity 2 if we do that we would get 4 x 4 - 20 x^2 + 25 so I'm thinking of this as 2x^2 - 2x^2 that's 4X 4 - 10 x^2 minus another 10 X2 is where we get that from and then plus 25 but keep in mind we also need to distribute the three which means some sign changes so -12x 4 + 60 x^2 - 75 if we combine some like terms and we're going to write this in order here we're going to get a -12 x 4 + 60 x^2 - 74 now we could go and do things like factoring if we need to but this this is where we can stop this is the a simplified version of the composition of functions G of f ofx notice this is not the same as that they're completely different because these two functions are not inverses so I'm trying to teach you that as we go that way we we get there and say hey if you canst two inverses they're going to give you X everything's going to cancel out if you compose two inverses backwards it's going to give you the same thing it's going to be X I'm going start teaching you that as we go so let's go ahead and I'm going to rewrite this that way we have this a little more concisely after we simplified it so G of F ofx that composition is exactly what we have here okay so we're going to move on just a little bit we're going to get some sort of sometimes awkward looking compositions so let's take a look at F of f of x what that F of f it's almost sounds like you're stuttering a little bit F of f ofx what in the world is that mean that means that we're going to take the first function f and inside the variable for f we're going to place the whole function f again so if you follow the technique I teach you the whole Blank Space ideology if you will says take your first function f just ignore this for a second just look at your first function what I'm telling you is look here and I want you to write that function with a blank space every place you have a variable have a blank space of a parentheses now so the first function f 2^2 - 5 we're going to have two Blank Space squar - 5 that is what the function f says so our composition says look here rewrite it with blank spaces done now look at the second function the second function is f who cares all this is telling you is what you want to put in the function that you just opened open this one put this one inside of it so now we're going to look at the second function what's the second function the second function is f again so we're going to look there f is 2x^2 - 5 it says I want you to take this function f and put it inside of the parentheses that you just created might look a little funny this is not an inverse this is a composition of a function on to itself it in general is not going to give you an inverse there are some special cases where it can but in general it can't and so we're going to distribute this but before we do it we're going to check our work did we take our first function open it to parentheses squ minus 5 yes did we take our second function whatever it is and plug it in the whole entire function into the blank space which represents the variable yes we did now we simplify that so when we do we'll have our two we already did this distribution 2x^2 - 5^ 2 uh and that gave us give us 4x^2 - 20 x^2 + 25 we're almost done we're going to distribute the two and then we're going to combine some like terms this is already in order for us so 8 x 4 - 40 x^2 + 50 and then subtracting five from that gives us our 45 and so if we write that this is what the composition F of f of x is what I'd like you to do is actually see if you can pause the video and try G of G of x if you have well you should should if you have't um if you have what we should get out of this is the idea that this composition is asking you look at G ofx that's why it's listed first is look here and I want you to replace the variables in whatever function is first with a parenthesis so I'm looking at my G of X I'm not even looking here yet I'm not looking at the second G I don't even really care about that I'm looking at the first function I'm focused on this I'm opening up the variable with parenthesis now now I take the blinders off I know that this is represented by this with a blank space this place where I can plug stuff into now I look at my second function that's listed to my composition and go okay I've opened up my first one now I look here and I just replace whatever is in the parentheses I replace that Blank Spot or plug that in Blank Spot with my second function my second function is also G of X so I look here and go okay I'm just taking this entire thing I'm putting it here this is what G of G of X should look for and here's what it does practically we're going to see this as we go through here what a composition does it basically runs an input through two functions in a very specific way it runs an input through the rightmost function first and then whatever you get out of this the output of this function becomes the input for your first function I'm going to show you right here what is your input here because this is what F of G ofx stands for it's this what's your input here well your input is X but that's only for the function G so this says take your input plug it into g whatever you get out of that oh wait that becomes the input for f so the output here G ofx stands for an output the output of G ofx acts as the input for the function f and that's what this is doing for us this is saying this this function G I'm going to plug into X right it's going to have to run through this function one time the output of that XS is the input for this next time I run through G it's a very interesting concept if we simplify this we're going to distribute one - 3x * 1 - 3x of course you should have caught me on this one hopefully I can't take an excuse on that one just completely missed that power too but at least I caught it so we're going to get 1 - 6x^ 2 + 9x 4 so I'm thinking 1 - 3x 2 * 1 - 3 2 that's 1 - 6 x^2 and then + 9 x 4 we're going to distribute the -3 again we get min -3 + 18 x^2 and - 27 x 4th power if we combine some like terms and write this in order we're going to have 27 x 4 first + 18 x^2 and then minus 2 and we combine some like terms so we're going to write that now and this is really every permutation of our compositions we can do we've done F of G which takes G and plugs into F we've taken G of f which takes F and plugs into g f of f which takes F onto itself G of G which takes G onto itself and we simplified everything done a lot of work um just so you know the domain of every one of these compositions is all real numbers because we didn't develop any fractions or square roots or logarithms and the domain of both of my initial functions is all real numbers so the domain for all of these is all real numbers we're we're going to see some different things in the next video now we're going to work on evaluating some composition of functions there's two ways to do this so let's take a look at F of G of 1 and see what this is really asking us to do I'm going to give you both of these ways the um the not really having to think about it part the not really having to think about it way to do this is identify which of these compositions you have over here and just plug in the value so if we take F of G of one this says well wait a minute we've worked really hard to figure out F of G of X right and X is our input so if I change this this x to1 this is saying F of G of 1 and F of G of X I can just evaluate F of G of X for one so basically just plug in one to the F of G of x that you have simplified and that will work so if I take F of G of 1 put in our one here for f of G of X that'd be 18 - 12 - 3 well 18 - 12 that's 6 - 3 is three so I should be getting three now the other way to do this uh little little bit more thought but possibly easier because some of these exponents are fairly large possibly easier here's what we would do we would take the one and this has to run through these two functions in this order one acts as and we already talked about right here one acts as the input for the second function listed why the second one F of G ofx says we want F of G ofx that second function is your initial thing you plug in that is your initial input you can see it right here the second function inside is what you'd have to plug into first second function is inside which you got to plug in first and then it runs to the first function so for f of G of one you run one as an evaluation uh you evaluate one into G first so if we put this into G then this would be 1 - 3 * 1 2 well 1 2 is 1 3 * 1 is 1 this would be -2 so if I did g of 1 we get -2 that output that output of G becomes the input for f the first function you you deal with so now we say okay I plugged in one for G it was -2 -2 gets now run through as as evaluated in F so -22 is 4 uh 4 * 2 is 8 8 - 5 is 3 again so we did g of 1 1 we got -2 and then F of -2 we take our input into our second function that output becomes the input for our first function that's the second way to go about doing it either way works we got three um in either case it really doesn't matter but you can see that this way requires a little more thought this was already thought out that's why you're able to just plug it in this requires a little more thought but it can be a little bit easier when some of these exponents are fairly large let's take a look at the next few of them we're going to do it fairly quick so if we evaluate G of f of x for -2 that's what this is asking to do go here G of f plug in two in that simplified version you can actually do it here too you plug it in here so if I evaluate for two I'm going to get 2 4th power 16 16 * -12 is - 19 196 2^ 2 4 4 * 60 is 240 - 74 all of that's going to give you -26 now is it easier to plug this two into F figure out the output use that output as an input for G maybe let's try that so what this says is take your two it acts as an input for f ofx based on what we know about what's going on here so two gets put into your second function whatever it is and case it's F so think that this would be G of f of 2 this is what is going on right now we have to find F of two first and then G of that output F of two is an output it's the output of the function f when you have an input of 2 so take two plug it in here uh that's 4 * 8 and 4 * 2 is 8 - 5 is 3 so F of 2 is 3 now we want to find G of three so F of 2 gave us three and now we're finding G of whatever that output is if we plug in three evaluate uh 3 2 is 9 3 * 9 is 27 1 - 27 is - 26 it's the same thing that we would get and it has to be the same if you've done this correctly I hope that's making sense I hope you're seeing the interplay between these composition of functions that F of whatever this is that's your you're inputting this into the the second function first the output of which acts as your input for your first function now let's do the last couple little bit strange to plug something into itself but that's exactly what this asked us to do so F of f of1 says take negative 1 evaluate in whatever this function is in this case here's F of f so I can take negative one and put it here and here now because this is an even function a you should verify that even Powers if I pluged into negative it's not going to affect anything this would give us a - 40 + 45 so that looks like that's going to be 13 or we can do it this way take1 evaluate into your second function use this as the input for this function so F of1 Well that's going to give me -3 I evaluated F of1 that's 3 and now my -3 the output of my first valuation becomes the input for my second evaluation so F of negative3 my output 9 * 2 that's 18 - 5 that's 13 and the last one g of G of zero if we go to G of G we've already simplified this if I plug in zero I get -2 that's nice if I want to do it differently G of G of Z says take G and evaluate it with the output of G when you plug in zero that's technically the exactly way that this is this is going on so it says evaluate G of Z and then use that output as an input for G again so G of 0 is one you did this it was that now that output that you just got X is the input for G again so we're evaluating 1 it looks like -2 because we have 1 2 1 - 3 * 1 is -2 that's exactly what we got it matches up we know that this is correct I hope that I've explained composition of functions for you um hopefully you understand a blank space idea where you take your first function open up every variable with a parenthesis that's a blank space something you plug into take your second function plug it in and then simplify and simplifying is actually the hardest part here evaluating you can do it a couple ways and we've gone through that so in the next video we'll talk more about domain so what happens when you don't have domains that are all real numbers all of the time how do you represent that so I'll see you for another video 

Transcript for: Finding Domain of Composite Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 49)
hey there now that we have a good idea about what a composition of functions actually means we're going to practice that but at the same time we're going to explore what the domain of a composite function or when you compose two functions for composition functions how do you find that like what that is because it's really important sometimes when we compose functions they end up losing some pieces that we need to know for the domain and so i'm going to give you a very good technique on how you deal with the domain of composite functions which is important to know especially when we get into exponentials and logarithms and calculus so let's take a look at an easy example that we have done in the last video and i'll tell you what all this stuff means so let's let's start learning about it if i give you two functions f and g and i ask you to compose them f of g or any sort of permutation of those two functions we know that we take the first function open up with a blank space and put the second entire function inside of it so i'm going to call this the inside function the function you're composing and the function you're composing upon so this g of x this inside function that's really important we need to understand the domain of that inside function that is the most important thing that i can get you to know is find that first and don't lose it you see when we find a composition of two functions or a composite function we'd say the domain's a combination of two pieces it's the domain of the inside function and the domain of the simplified composition that we get so the whole idea it's not hard you just need to know it the whole idea is you find the domain of really both functions because we most of the time compose f of g and g of f at the both of them almost all the time and so it's really useful to find your domains first but in general you find the domain of the inside function first so we look at this and say that's my inside function that's my inside function find your domain do the composition simplify the composition find the domain of the simplified composition and then combine those two that's all there is to it so here's what we would do here's a process these domains are going to be all real numbers i talked about in the last video but here's what we would do i'm going to find f of g of x and i know it's already done so and i've actually erased some of it uh there doesn't really matter so i know it's already done here's the thought process here's my inside function it's g of x i know this is going to go inside f of x so i'm going to look at g of x i'm going to find my domain so my head i'm thinking okay well what's the domain i don't see any square roots good news i don't see any denominators with fraction with variables in them that's good news now let's see logarithms that's good news that means the domain and the absence of those three things is all real numbers we also can use interval notation negative infinity to positive infinity so i know that that's in the back of my head that the domain of the inside function is right there then i do my composition okay i've already done it i get down to here this i sort of i erased it's three and we would take a look at it and say okay now that we have a simplified composition of these functions what's the domain of this well i haven't added any fractions i've already gained any fraction of the denominators that have variables in them i don't have any square roots still and i don't have any logarithms still so the domain here is all real numbers the domain of your composition is a combination of your inside domain and the final domain that you get so this domain is all real numbers what we got domain is still all real numbers we combine those you get all real numbers you don't get double all real numbers but you get all real numbers negative infinity to positive infinity that is how you find domain the same thing would happen here i'm just going to talk through it real quick the domain of our inside function f is all real numbers the domain of our final simplified version of our composition is all real numbers we combine those two you still have all real numbers remember you're only looking for really three things and one of which we haven't talked about yet so you're looking for any sort of radicals that have even powers even fractional powers so like one half powers one fourth powers or square roots fourth sixth roots you're looking for radicals you're also looking for fractions that have denominators that could possibly equal zero so any sort of denominator with a variable you check that we're looking for those two things do we have them originally are we creating them those things are important to know logarithms come later we just we haven't covered them so you're not going to see them yet that's the main idea here so we're going to move on to some more complicated examples that don't have domains that are all real numbers but again this is what we're checking for all right let's get after it we've got an example here where i'd like to find the composition f of g of x and g of f of x with the domains of these things so keep in mind we can still do f of f and g of g i'm just not going to get into it because these are the most common and if you understand these you can do those as well we've already talked about last video so let's find f of g of x the first thing we want to do before we start this if we are required to know the domain which you are almost all of the time we're going to take the time to find the domain of both of these functions first why so we won't forget about it and that way we don't think that our domain is something that it's not so i'm going to take a look at this and i'm going to firstly find the domain of both of these functions so on f of x i know that this has a fraction the variable has as a denominator has some variables in it and if we have a denominator that equals zero we've got a problem it's going to create a vertical asymptote but in general you have something that creates an undefined output and so we know that x plus three if that equals zero we get some problems so i know that our domain in simple form here is x cannot equal negative three that would create a problem for us that's an issue g of x i'm going to take the time to find that domain as well if x equals 0 we have a problem so the domain of g of x is x cannot equal zero f of x is x cannot equal negative one all real numbers besides those two values work just fine in those two functions now we're going to find f of g of x in your head right now i want you thinking what's my inside function what's the function i'm not composing into that i'm using to compose onto another function the inside function here is g of x you'll see it as we write it but our inside function is g what's going to happen we're going to compose this we're going to simplify it and then we're going to take the combination of two different domains what we get when we're done combined with what was inside when we started so for sure for sure our domain is going to have whatever the domain of the inside function is in there somewhere x cannot equal 0. we know that it's going to be a combination of domain inside and the end so here's our inside domain that is why we find it first because this will not leave us now i warn you as we get through here that domain may or may not show up in the final composition we might simplify the way it might move from a numerator to a denominator which is why we find it first because if you don't find that first it's very very common for students to do this without doing that and then lose that piece because they think well oh you can plug in 0 which is fine now remember something about domain you can't ever really make it better it always carries its baggage with it so because this came from here it's always going to have that condition it's always going to not be able to it's never going to be able to let you plug in zero no matter how much it looks like it so now let's continue with our with our composition so this composition says take a look at the function f hey here's a function f replace all of the variables so if you have a polynomial with many variables it's averaging one of those variables replace all of the variables with a parenthesis that's a blank spot for us so x hey blank space x blank space that's what x's mean anyway this thing that you can plug into and then plus three so we replace all of the variables in our first function with blank spaces now take your second function in its entirety and plug it in so i'm going to plug in 2 over x and 2 over x that is the second function that we're composing into the first function and now we simplify it notice this is where you can identify easily if you hadn't been able to before what your inside function is the function you're composing so that's going to be 2 of x or 2 over x and 2 over x and that's where we get our domain from and then we have to simplify this and yes you do have to simplify it so how do we simplify this well because the parentheses really aren't super relevant right now just give us a place to put that function we have 2 over x divided by 2 over x plus 3 this is a complex fraction how we deal with complex fractions is multiplied by the lcd on both the numerator and the denominator so our lcd here is x let's take x let's multiply it by x over x now stop right now and watch what we've done please get this what you've just done think about it this will make this make sense what you've just done is you've multiplied by one right right follow me here you've multiplied by one but only if x is not zero because if x is zero zero divided by zero is not one what is it it's undefined you can't do this if x is zero this condition allows you to even do this thing if this is not here then you cannot do that if x is zero that needs to make sense to you this is not one if x is equal to zero it's undefined if x is equal to zero it's undefined you can't do what you're doing if x is allowed to be zero which is why we have that restriction and why it maintains in this problem even though it looks like it's going to disappear you need it watch that a couple times if that does not make sense i've explained it but it's got to sink in that you wouldn't even be able to do this without that restriction so we've done it now we're going to simplify remember that we do distribute 2 over x times x your x's are going to cancel you're going to get 2. here we distribute 2 over x times x is going to cancel you're going to get 2 but here nothing cancels you get plus 3x so our simplified composition is two over three x plus two notice something does it look like you can plug in zero here yeah no doubt like if you were to plug in zero right now it'd be just fine if you were allowed to do it this is why we write down the domain of our inside function and the domain of that inside function first before i did any work i do this every time i look at my inside function i identify my domain i write it down because i know that a lot of times it disappears so i don't want to lose that so we've done that we have it simplified and now we've also developed another domain problem check it out it's not the same domain problem as this one it's new and this happens when we start dividing functions or composing functions sometimes we get additional domain restrictions you've seen that a long time ago we just get it again in a different context so we have two over three x plus two oh my gosh as a fraction i've got some variables on the denominator i know that if my denominator equals 0 i have some problems so when we subtract 2 and divide by 3 this creates another issue for us something else that's undefined so any sort of value that causes this to be undefined is a problem i'm going to take this i'm going to also add this to my domain so i already knew from the inside function x to not equal 0. we explored that a lot right here but now i also can't allow x equals negative two-thirds any other values besides those are going to be just fine but those things themselves those are problems i hope that makes sense to you you take your inside domain you put it down first because it can sometimes disappear and you don't want to lose it but for the reasons i've already mentioned you cannot plug in zero even though it looks like it we also gain some other domain restrictions so take the combination of those two ideas that is your domain okay let's move on to the next one so g of f of x well our inside function changes we're still going to do the same technique but before i even start this i'm going to say all right my inside function is f of x if i can't identify it now i write g of f of x and this way i look at g my first function i notice that's 2 over x i'm going to create 2 over a blank space so that's my first function g written in such a way that i can compose into it i look at my second function f okay f says x over x plus 3. i'm going to take that x over x 3 and i'm going to put it inside this blank space this variable this has taken f of x and put it inside the variable of g of x is exactly what we want now i can really easily identify what my inside function is my inside function is f of x it's the second function so i'm gonna start building my domain now because i already have this domain i know that no matter what happens i'm going to take this domain and i'm going to have that inside the domain of my final composition so i know for sure that x cannot equal negative 3 i'm going to write it down now so i don't lose it and i'm probably going to get some other restriction out of this well we do have a complex fraction again we know that the lcd is x plus 3 and how we deal with the x plus 3 is we multiply both the numerator and denominator by whatever the lcd is in this case x plus three now notice again for the same thing here if you allow x to be negative 3 this doesn't work if x is negative 3 then this becomes 0 over 0 and that is a problem for it it's undefined and so we have to restrict that to let this even work that's why finding the domain of a composition of functions is so important because you have to tell it when it's going to work it's only going to work if you don't allow x to be negative 3 you can't even do this if x is negative 3. so we're going to go ahead and multiply this is going to distribute but this is going to cancel you're multiplying x plus 3 on a numerator and denominator it's going to cancel even one but we're left with just x this right here is the composition g of f of x so we get 2x plus 6 over x and then we find the domain again this one's pretty nice we look at this and say hey if x equals zero if our denominator equals zero that's a problem that would create something that's undefined so i'm going to combine that with the domain already have notice how the it looks like you can plug in negative three just fine the only reason we have that is because this came from inside of the inside of our composition and we can see that we need that to be the case to even simplify this composition and so we're going to add something else to it we say hey we had that but we also can't allow 0. but those are the only two restrictions we have any other number in the world is going to be just fine in this composition if you want to see why this is true why you need this one try to evaluate if we try to evaluate negative three first we run negative three through f then you go okay if i evaluate for negative three that would be uh zero wait oh right there we can't we can't do it now try to do zero if we did zero so evaluate for zero because this is coming from n right makes maybe it doesn't make sense that we'd uh we couldn't evaluate that but evaluate for zero if we put zero into f first we get zero over three now that would be zero but when i take the output zero and put it in here to my first function g two over the output which was zero is undefined so even this one does not work if you try to evaluate it the the way that i showed you in the last video by taking 0 plugging into f that's 0 then plugging in that output into g 2 over 0 is undefined that's why these are both problems and that's how we deal with domain inside plus and gives you domain and composition all right this is the last example that we're going to do there are some that are a little more complicated but the idea is what i'm teaching right now on how to find this the reason why we're not getting more complicated with the structure of the problems is because that's not what this is about um what this is about is me teaching you how to find the domain now we have dealt with simplifying the algebra of tougher problems uh what we haven't done is found the domain yet that's why we're focused on that so we're going to compose this f of g of x and g of f of x we're focused on finding the domain and the aspects that pertain to us so how we do that is really important number one thing we're going to do is we're going we're going to find the domain of both of these functions y both because we're composing them in two different ways if we didn't if we just had this one i would only be focused on finding the domain of g of x i won't even care about f because i take the domain of my second function inside function and whatever i get at the end f really doesn't play into it in terms of finding the domain first here it does and so that's really important so composing two different ways affects what what domains we want to find in this case we're finding both so i'm going to start with f of x i'm looking at f of x i'm thinking does it have square roots no does it have denominators that have fractions in them no logarithms no the domain here is all real numbers now we go ahead we look at g of x we say oh that's a square root that has to have some domain issues if we have x minus 1 inside of it so we find the domain of g of x and say oh man i put anything back to it what is the domain of a square root what we know is that the inside of our square root has to be greater than or equal to zero we can't allow negatives inside of square roots in the real number system that is the way that you don't allow negatives what you don't do you don't set this thing equal to zero it's not a denominator don't do that that shows me that you don't understand the concept if you do it if you're doing that the concept here is inside not negative that's what that means when we solve this get our domain we know that x has to be greater than or equal to one in order to create non-negative numbers that's zero and positive inside of that square root and so we found our domain here's what's going to happen when we take care of f of g of x because g of x is our inside function in this composition our domain is going to have that no matter what happens it's going to have that so i'm going to do a couple things i'm going to show the composition i'm going to identify that g is actually the inside function i'm going to write the domain and then we're going to simplify so our composition says the first thing i want to do is i want to look at the first function f i want to replace the variables inside of it with some blank spaces so f is x squared plus 1. i'm going to replace the variables with blank spaces however many variables there are you replace them from with blank space so we can get some complicated things now i take a look at my second function i say all right my second function is g of x that is going to that's going to go inside the blank space so f is x squared plus one g is square root of x minus one i'm going to stop right now and if i haven't done it already i'm going to write out the domain right now the pieces i understand my inside function is g of x i should know it here but i can really see it here i'm going to take the domain of this which i've already found and then i'm going to simplify it and if i have to i'll add additional restrictions in there so let's go ahead uh wait a minute square root squared we know that every time a power matches a radical we simplify that but x minus 1 plus 1 is just x so f of g of x gave me x well that's interesting i'm going to tell you something right now that we're going to explore when we get to inverses in a few videos if you compose two functions and you end up getting x the two functions you compose are inverses they're going to undo each other if you compose them and i can prove it to you right now if you take any any number that you want that's in this domain that's a key feature right it's going to be in the domain for these should be inverse you'll talk about that in a minute but if you take any number leg let's say 10 if i if i take 10 i plug it into here take the output plug in here i'm going to get 10 back that's inverses 2. they undo everything about one another so just so work with me here if i take 10 10 minus 1 is 9 the number 9 and the square root of nine is three so that's the output right i plugged in ten i got out three take three the output plug it in here now three squared is nine nine plus one is ten wait a minute i plugged in ten i got the output pick that would plug in here and i gave it back ten it undid all the math i plugged in 10 i ran it through both functions i got out 10. that's what inverses do they undo each other that's exactly what this is saying it says what are you plugging in x what are you getting out x nothing's happening right because they und each other look at the math this under this this under this you have x remaining inverses undo one another and that is why when you compose two inverses you will always get x you're plugging in this you're getting out the same thing it's i've done all the math around it and that will happen every time with inverses now i said something very specific i said these are inverses and that's true but only on a certain section of the domain of the x-axis because it doesn't exist other places and so these are inverses under your domain that you already identified that's pretty neat you've already seen where these two things are inverses so as long as x is greater than or equal to 1 this function and that function are inverses because it matches up with our domain now uh well let's look back here let's finish this up does f of g of x have any of the domain issues well that doesn't have any square roots that is a radicals in general that are even this does not have any fractions and variables in the denominator no logarithms so this domain is all real numbers but it does not trump the fact that you have a domain issue already so we say all real numbers as long as x is greater than or equal to one this is there no matter what why because it had some baggage that we saw the inside function had a domain issue we have to we have to have that and if we don't then we are wrong on the fact that these two are inverses because if we don't have them we say oh they're inverses all the time no they're not no they're not they're only inverses on that domain that's why we need it all right let's talk about the last one if you've done it already awesome if not you can pause the video and see it at least if you can do the composition so g of f of x says let's take a look at our first function the first function is g so i'm going to replace my variables with some sort of blank space uh something i can plug into and evaluate that holds everything together that's what parentheses do for us then i take a look at my second function f of x okay f of x is x squared plus one i put the entire function in all the parentheses i've created there's only one in this case and before i simplify i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to start writing out my domain the domain domain's a combination it's a combination of the first function that you're sorry i'm sorry the inside function the inside function and the final composition after you simplify so the inside function is f of x from here and we can see x squared plus one and we know that that domain because we wrote down already is all real numbers so i'm going to write that down and if i have any domain restrictions i'll write that along with i'll say all real numbers except x can't equal whatever or all real numbers as long as they're greater than one but let's see what happens okay so i have square root of x squared plus one minus one well these ones are going to give me x squared minus 1 or plus 1 minus 1 is 0 square root of x squared gives me x well that's interesting i get the same thing as here and that is exactly true if you compose two inverses no matter which way you compose them you have to get the same thing and that same thing will always be x we talked about why here we said with inverses inverses undo each other then do everything about themselves so that what you plug in is what you get out in an inverse well if i if i undo them in the opposite way what you plug in is still what you get out in an inverse it's just done differently and you can see that here plus 1 minus 1. those those are inverses square root power 2. those are also inverses in certain domains so g of f of x is still equal to x now what's interesting is this does not gain me any additional domain issues so my domain there's no modification that the domain of the inside all real numbers the domain of the final final composition all real numbers our domain here is all real numbers now why are they different why is that domain restricted and this domain is not restricted why is that the answer is because when we take a look at what f of x does take a look at this take any number and plug it in you're going to get one or more take a look at it plug in anything you're going to get one or more that's your output right that's the range of this so the range of this is one or more the range of your inside function is the input of your uh the compose upon function so this has to give you one or more this works as long as your numbers that you're plugging in are one or more since the outputs here are one or more it matches perfectly with our domain there's never an issue which is why we don't have a domain restriction it's impossible to get something that would give you a negative inside of there with that particular function i hope that makes sense to you i hope you're seeing the value in finding domain that we're not even allowed to really work with these functions unless we need our domain which is why we need to know it so those that's how we compose functions um i hope it made it make sense i hope you understand the blank space and plug it in and now find a domain take the inside take the final put them together sometimes we don't have issues even when you might expect them sometimes we do when you don't expect them so i'll see you for another video we're going to start talking about one-to-one functions next and then inverses and eventually we be matching all these ideas together composition with inverses one-to-one functions exponentials and logarithms and getting something pretty fantastic on how we solve exponential and logarithmic functions i'll see you for that you 

Transcript for: One to One Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 50)
hey there hope you're doing well and i hope you're ready to learn about inverse functions uh but before we get there we're going to learn about one-to-one functions so in this video we're going to be talking about what a one-to-one function is i'll tell you what they do and why we need them so what you should learn is that a one-to-one function is just one input giving you one unique output and why we need them is so that inverses can happen that's our next video why we need inverses so that we can explore exponentials and logarithms so we're gonna get right into it to be pretty brief there's not a whole lot here besides you just need to know what a one-to-one function is so that you can tell when a function is going to have an inverse and when it's not so a function it is a one-to-one function firstly if if it's a function and secondly if that function gives you one unique output for every one input you see if we just cover up this one word right there that's what a function is so a function is where one input gives you one output but a one-to-one function says okay okay it is a function for sure so one input is giving you one output but that output is unique unique means doesn't happen again like we're all unique we don't have an exact replica of someone of ourselves floating around somewhere hopefully but that's what a one-to-one function is it's where one input gives you one unique output it doesn't happen again and so we're going to explore that a couple times to see what it looks like the reason why we have to have one-to-one functions for inverses to work remember this is not just a video about one-to-one functions it's a video about one-to-one functions it's supposed to teach you something else about inverses so here's why you need it in an inverse what we're going to find out is that we are going to switch the x value with the y value in general for every inverse that we we deal with so we need functions to be one to one in order that their inverses are also functions we're going to explore that when we get to inverses for now one to one function means one input one unique output doesn't happen again so we're going to take a look at that let's imagine we get this this scenario here so we've got some employees and they have an id number so there's mark joe ty jane and mark has an id number 325. and joe has an id of 184 tai has this double 07 and jane has 291. so what are inputs and what are outputs our inputs are the names mark joe ty and jane and their id numbers are our outputs 325 184 007 291. one idea that i like to say that one-to-one functions have to maintain is this idea of mapping forward and backward so if i say a name goes to an id number the id number has to be mapped backward to that same name well that's the case here if i say mark you know the id is 325 if i say id of 184 you know i'm talking about joe if i say 07 you know that that's tie and if i say jane you know it's 291 they're mappable both ways so inputs determine one output and outputs determine one input you see if we didn't have a one-to-one function it'd be something like this now that one worked too well if we were trying to assign id numbers to employees because if i was trying to punch in my code and i'd be like all right 325 i know that's mark 184 i know that's joe double of seven well here if both tai and jane have double o seven um well then they both they would both have an id number notice it would still be a function every input has one output even tie and jane they both do have an output the problem comes in if i'm trying to put in my double 07 it doesn't know who to go to it doesn't know from where it came and so we'd be punching in zero zero seven and then the computer whatever we get confused like well who is that is that chi is a jane that doesn't make that doesn't make any sense this is a non one to one function right now so before we had a one to one function this is not this is not one to one because in inputs giving us a unique output yes and here but not here this input is not giving us a unique output maybe argument who's writing double 07 i don't know even if i do this i said well that's all everything now you now you're you both have double seven well well that's the same thing um that's just listed the output twice but they still have the same output it's still not mappable backwards and forwards in order to be a one-to-one function every input has to have a unique output it can't occur again and again the reason is when we get to inverses your outputs become your inputs so if my outputs become my inputs then one input is giving us one output that's a function but the reverse would not be true if these were inputs it would not be a function i'd have the same input giving me two different outputs and we know that's not possible for functions that's why we need one-to-one functions to exist so that our inverses actually make sense so let's explore this now that we have just kind of an idea down on what one-to-one means this is not one-to-one the previous example was let's look at now some relationships and then some graphs and then we'll start talking about some functions in the next video so let's take a look at f and g these are just relationships that have four points and five points respectively and if we know anything about points we know that our inputs are x values so 1 3 negative 7 and 18 and our outputs are negative 2 4 1 and 12. all we have to check to see whether this is a one-to-one function is this are your outputs repeated if they are you do not have a one-to-one function if your inputs are repeated you don't even have a function at all so and we saw that on what was called the vertical line test well now we're not really looking this way we're kind of looking this way it's going to lead us to something called the horizontal line test in just a moment so what we look for is hey 1 3 negative 7 18 none of those are repeated none of our inputs are repeated that means this represents a function then we look at our outputs negative 2 4 1 12. oh none of our outputs are repeated that means we had a function now this is a 1 2 1 function every input is giving us a unique output negative 2 4 1 and 12. those do not occur again this is one to one now let's look at g if we had to read through our inputs and it's pretty easy to identify which is why this is such a quick video our inputs are 2 11 negative 5 6 and negative 1. we can tell right there none of our inputs are repeated what that means is that g does represent a function we just need to classify and say is it a one-to-one function why well because with one-to-one functions i can find an inverse why do i need an inverse inverses are the only way mathematically that we have to undo a lot of the things that we have such as we need subtraction why so because it undoes addition uh we need division why because it undoes multiplication we need a square root why because that is a power 2. we need logarithms why because they undo exponentials exponentials we're going to find out are a one-to-one function and therefore have to have an inverse and we're getting there so is f gonna have an inverse yes because it's one to one is g gonna have an inverse we're about to find that out we know it's a function for sure because our inputs are not repeated and now we check our outputs 6 9 negative 2 negative 3 and 6. oh that's a problem if our outputs are repeated well then what that means is that we do not have one input giving us a unique output and when i get to inverses and switch them around my outputs become inputs i don't even have a function anymore so while g is a function it's not a one to one function two gives you six and negative one gives you six every input is not giving you a unique output this is not one to one all right in the next video we're going to find out that this would cause you to be able to find inverse this one wouldn't for some of the reasons that i mentioned we will explore a lot more in the next video now we can finally look at this graphically just to understand that if our x-axis is our input axis and our y-axis is our output axis here's what we're looking at firstly we want to determine whether these are all actually functions so we're going to use what's called the vertical line test vertical line test says your outputs look this way so for every input if you wanted to find the output you would look vertically and so we imagine a whole lot of vertical lines and we say all right if a vertical line were to intersect our graphs at more than one point then what that would signify is that at that input where we have two different outputs and functions do not allow for that so vertical line says these are all functions they're all functions they all pass a vertical line test every one of our inputs on all of these graphs is giving us one output now we check whether it's a one-to-one function wait one-on-one functions say are your outputs repeated because outputs are along your y-axis we'd say okay it's it's like this does this graph have an output of let's imagine three does this graph have an output of three i would be looking not vertically i believe it horizontally because that is the level at which that would have that particular output so if i'm looking for more than one output to occur graphically i'm actually looking horizontally i'm saying okay these are my output levels kind of like a ladder go up and down and just check to make sure at that level you only have one output so this if i imagine all these horizontal outputs all these horizontal levels it's only going to be hitting my graph at one time that means that all of our outputs are unique they don't happen here and then happen again later they're only happening once every input is giving us one output yes that was that's a vertical line test one unique output that's the horizontal line test that's why you need both of them vertical says function horizontal says okay now he determines a function now you have a a one to one function this because every level is giving us every output is giving us exactly one intersection with our graph that says that we have only one output at each of those out of those y values each of those levels if you will this is one to one so is the next graph so if i imagine all of these values along the y every possible output we could have and imagine some horizontal lines because that's the level of which your outputs would be well at those horizontal lines i'm only intersecting a graph one time that means there's only one output for each of the or one point that represents those outputs at each of those values so this is a one-to-one function as well now the next graph a parabola and in general every parabola unless we start restricting the domain and we'll see that in our inverse functions that we can't do that sometimes but if i take a look at this and say well okay let's imagine let's imagine all these y values all these output values and i'm going to think output values are are a horizontal thought it's this level so if i'm looking at at this level of an output am i touching my graph twice if i am then there are two inputs which give us the same output and that's not allowed we have to have unique outputs so here's our and there's there's lots of them but there's there's two outputs here that are the same that means there's two different inputs that are giving us the same output well that's not unique what would happen is that when i try to find inverse my outputs become my inputs and then i would have the same input remember that's the same height right the same value that one output value becomes my input value i'd have the same input giving me two different outputs we would see that so this right here this is a non one to one function this is not one one it's still a function but it's not one to one because we have the same output twice and multiple times actually if you think about a lot of these horizontal lines you can probably look through the rest of them hopefully you can identify which one of these next two is a one-to-one function which one's not if we think about the horizontal line test well we already determined vertical they're all functions horizontal line test says at every single potential level on the y-axis every single potential output i need to have at most one intersection with my graph notice we can miss it and that would actually be okay but if i think about every potential level it's only hitting my graph once and that's signifying that these outputs are only happening one time they don't happen again later there's only one inputs giving us that one output and that is mappable backwards and forwards which is going to lead us to inverses this is one to one the next one's clearly not if we think about some of these horizontal lines in this case we're intersecting this graph three times that means that we hit the same output three different times for three different inputs that is certainly okay for functions but not okay for one-to-one functions now we talked about the horizontal line test right we said if you imagine horizontal lines if those horizontal lines hit your graph more than once you do not have a one-to-one function because that would represent multiple outputs that are the same not unique well if it's called the horizontal line test then a horizontal line can't pass the horizontal line test we'd have no outputs until we get to right here let me say oh hey we have a whole bunch of the same output that's what the horizontal line means it's constant so this right here cannot be a one-to-one function either at lots of different inputs we're getting the same output and that would be a failure of a one-to-one function so again why did we learn it we learned it because we're going to find out the next video that only one to one functions have inverses and every inverse comes from a one to one function so if a function is one one it has an inverse if a function has an inverse it's also one to one so we needed this to determine that functions have inverses and then we're going to find them in the next video so i hope that made sense i know it was pretty brief so yeah we got a brief we had a quick one but hopefully you now understand when a function is one to one and when it's not we'll talk about some algebraic um looks of functions a little bit later have a good day 

Transcript for: Finding Inverse Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 51)
welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about inverses so we're going to discuss when functions have inverses we're going to discuss how you find inverses how you can tell you found inverses or that two functions are actually inverses and what they look like once we found them so kind of the graphs of inverses and again remember why we're doing this uh the whole reason why we're talking about inverses is because we want to get to exponentials and logarithms and discover that they are in fact inverses we're going to do that very very soon and that's very powerful for us let's do a lot of different sort of things mathematically so let's talk about inverses where they come from what an inverse comes from is from something called a one to one function that we talked about in the last video so here's something you need to know if a function has an inverse it's going to be one to one and if a function is one to one it's going to have an inverse and that's exactly what this first statement says a function has an inverse if and only if it is one to one that statement if and only it's kind of strange if you've never seen it before that's called a biconditional statement it means one is necessary and sufficient for the other in other words it says uh if a function is going to have an inverse it's got to be one to one and if it functions one to one it's going to have an inverse it basically goes both ways so inverses are important and one-on-one functions are important you can't have an inverse without being one-to-one and so we we needed that we need to understand that functions were one-to-one in order to have an inverse a couple of things i want you to know when we talk about what an inverse is an inverse undoes something so like addition and subtraction are inverse operations and likewise inverse functions are going to undo each other and we're going to talk about that when we get to the composition here in just a minute a couple other is that if f of x is a one-to-one function which means it's going to have an inverse right if we know it's one one it's gonna have inverse then we have a little uh notation for that and we can say um a couple different things about being one to one sorry about being an inverse a couple different notations uh typically we're going to see this little minus one and in my opinion it's really not great notation usually it's it's a little bit better to use something like arc or inverse and say it but this is the notation that we have and so when you see that it is not an exponent what that stands for it's not f to the negative one power it's not a reciprocal because it would be a reciprocal would be one over f of x that's not how we find hardly any inverses what that means is and how this is pronounced is f inverse of x so for a one-to-one function f and it's gonna have an inverse that inverse function is notated as f inverse and it has a little negative one as a superscript so the inverse is f inverse of x that's how you say that and it's also going to be one to one and it just makes sense if an inverse is one if a function is one to one its inverse is also going to be one to one because when we're going to find this out essentially we're just switching x's and y's to create our inverses so we're going to get into that just a little little bit so recap real quick uh one to one functions have inverses and inverses have to be one to one they're going to undo each other when you see that in just a second and then if a function is one to one it has an inverse it's going to we write that as a superscript with a negative one and we say f inverse or g inverse or whatever the function's name is so what is this whole undoing thing about when you have a function and you compose it with its inverse for instance when you have a function f and it's inverse and your input is x here's what the undoing says we saw this when we did composition of functions a couple videos ago that we actually had an inverse and what happened was we took an input we ran it through a function and another function which was its inverse and it gave us back the input this is what this is about to say if you take an input where would this go first this would go into the inverse function and the output of that would go into the original function this f of x and it would give you out whatever you plug back in well what did you plug in you plug in x if you compose a function and its inverse it's going to cancel out all the operations everything about it and it's going to leave you with whatever you plugged in that is what an inverse function does and so here we'd say all right our input is x it ran through one function and the inverse of that function is going to undo everything about it and versus undo each other it's going to leave us with x what if i did it the other way around what if i write my input through the function and then that through the inverse of the function it's going to leave you the same thing this is the only time in the world that when you compose functions differently when you switch around like commuted if you want to think of that if you compose two functions and you reverse it and you compose those functions the opposite way and you get the same thing out it says those things are inverses and the thing you will get out is x i hope it makes sense that that x that you're getting out is your input if you plugged in five you get out five you plug in negative two you get up negative 2 by doing this why well because when you plugged into your function it did something to that input right it gave you an output but then if your inverse undoes everything that it did to that input it's going to be back the input so it's going to undo everything the function did likewise the function would undo everything the inverse did they are inverses of one another we're going to see that in a couple of these examples i'll show you that before we get into it i simply want to show you with uh with one example on on how to find a function an inverse of a function with which is some points so before we get into this one imagine that we had just this relationship and i say i want to find an inverse for this and this is going to lead us on what to do with these algebraic functions that we have on the board firstly we do need to understand what one to one means so one to one means number one that it is a function that means our inputs one three seven and five can't be repeated and it has to be one to one function means our outputs cannot be repeated negative two five negative three and eight this is a one to one function it's a function because every input is giving us one output we can see that and it's a one-to-one function because not only is every input giving us one output but those outputs are unique every input has given us one unique output those topics are not repeated so here's what an inverse would do think about the work behind it and this is going to illustrate why this happens think about the work behind it so if i plug in 1 what my function does my function gives me out negative 2. what would an inverse have to do to undo all that it's going to have an inverse because this is a one-to-one function it has to have an inverse but what would happen well if my function is mapping basically one to negative two then the inverse has to undo that where is that what where is the value now so if i plug in one and got out negative two i went from one to negative two the inverse has to say well wait a minute um i gotta take that negative two and i gotta move it back to one i have to undo everything about it i've always thought of this because i've had i got some kids like two-year-olds when you're trying to clean the house this is like a two-year-old so you take toy and you put toy on away let's say this is this is like the the uh the toy chest or something you take toy from floor to toy chest what's two year old do immediately right after toy chest two four yay that is what an inverse does two-year-olds are cleaning inverses they can do everything that you've just done well that's true one to negative two got undone now it went from negative two back to one notice what happened it took my input ran it through a function ran that output as an input through an inverse and gave me back what i originally put in so i plugged in one i ran through function inverse and it gave me out one that's what this says it says take your input row through function run through inverse get back out your input take input run through function run through inverse get you back out whatever you plugged in that's all there is to it every point we can manipulate that way so our inverse is going to say all right what are you doing really in essence all you're doing is you're changing your input and your output you're just you're swapping them your input becomes your output your output becomes your input so the inverse of 3 five would be the point five three and for seven negative three that inverse would be negative three seven and finally eight five this would be the inverse of f we call it f inverse and all we're doing essentially is switching our x with our y that is what inverses really do and that's how they undo the function they just say all right well hey you took an input and moved it to an output i'm going to switch that and take the output move back to the input it should make sense it's just switching your x with your y it's replacing those or reversing those so that's a bit about why this works one illustration that we're going to see that now as we solve for these functions for inverses so let's get started let's take a look at f of x 1 minus 3x i'm going to give you a series of steps on how you can solve a one-to-one function for its inverse how you can find that the first step is if we're going to have to switch x with y and that's exactly what we did in the previous example we just switched the input with the output or the x value of the y value and it gave us an inverse we're going to do the same thing algebraically but we don't have y we do have something that stands for y f of x h of x g of x those are all the output values those are the output for your function and we can call that y f x g of x and h of x are just a little hard to work with in some algebra and so we're going to replace that with y so step number one replace your name of your function f of x with y step number two is you're actually going to find the inverse right now you can perform that performing the inverse is exactly what we did earlier switching your x with your y and we're going to do that every place we see y which should only be one place remember there's only one output right so you should be just one place we're going to call that x and every place we see x we're going to call that y in this way we have just reversed the input and the output this right here has done the inverse what we're going to do now is solve for y why what's it going to do notice if i replace my output with an input an input with an output and i solve for this it's going to have to do undo everything about this function it's going to undo all these operations it's going to undo the function itself and that's what inverse does it undoes a function and so we replace with y we change our y to an x and all of our x's that we have into y's and then we solve for y it's not going to be that bad we're going to subtract one divide by negative three i really don't like seeing a negative on the denominator so i'm going to write this a little differently maybe move my negative to my numerator in which case you would have to distribute and this essentially is your inverse but you want to call it such you want to say yes this is what i've done this is the process of finding the inverse i've replaced it with y so it's something i could work with easier that's only reason why we do it i've replaced my output with an input and input with an output input and i've solved for y that's undone the entire function but then you're going to call it that so you say this process will find you the inverse for any one to one function and then what we're going to say is that is the inverse of f so we're going to write it as f inverse and that's really all i need you to be able to do i need to be able to take a function and find its inverse of the process that i've shown you now let's take a look at the next one g of x g of x equals x cubed plus four we're gonna say all right um is that a one to one function first off is this a one to one function because you can only solve inverses for inverses if you do have one to one functions so you go well how do you know well it might be nice to take a look at those graphs that's a line a diagonal line with a slope of negative three looks like that with y intercept of one so our all of our lines are one-to-one functions it's gonna have an inverse that's an x cubed and there's no going back down because you've seen that cubics go back down with some turning points this doesn't have any because that's just a vertical shift of four oh wait hey all our transformations are coming back at us we should understand that that's a power three cubic that has a its original before we shifted x intercept and y intercept is 0 0. it's going through the origin but it shifted up four units it's not causing any additional turning points this is a one-to-one function and so we can now solve for its inverse since it is one to one it's going to have one and we go through the same process that we've just done we're going to start by replacing our g of x with y after that we say all right if i want to find an inverse i'm going to have to undo the function somehow um i've seen some teachers teach it like hey just solve for x you can you can do that and then then switch your variables but i've seen a lot of students accidentally leave it in terms of why which is we don't want that so instead we go right well what can i do differently i could change my output to an input and my input to an output or in other words switch y to x and every x to y and then solve for y and it accomplishes the same thing but it's a little bit more understandable and what you get is is going to be your final answer you don't have to switch all your variables after that so let's solve for y and do doing so undo our original function we're going to subtract four and lastly how we get rid of a power three is with a cube root i'm going to ask something that should pop into your head really quick when you take a cube root do you need to put a plus and minus in front of your cube root and you should know that you should know with a cube root or a fifth root or a seventh root or any odd root you do not need that because power threes maintain the sign of the radicand in other words what's on the inside if it's negative you maintain a negative and it's positive maintain a positive you don't need that power twos what happens if you take a square root well with square roots you would need a plus and minus wouldn't you so if i needed a plus and minus because those those those even powers 2 4 8 6 if i square a negative it becomes positive it does not maintain the sign of its radicand which is where that came from in the first place i don't need them for cubes or cube roots but certainly here we're going to talk about that in a second so if we simplify we know that this is going to be y equals the cube root of x minus 4 that is the inverse but i'm going to say that this is an inverse one thing now you can see this all the time a lot of the times because our notation is based on having a function f because it's very very common many many times you are going to see this and this is technically incorrect it is actually incorrect when you call something inverse you need to say what it's inverse of so if i use f inverse i'm not really matched up with the original function that i'm finding inverse four so if i find the infer inverse for g of x it's not going to magically become f inverse of x we're going to call this whatever the name is inverse so this is the inverse of the function g not f so in both cases we replaced with y we replaced our y with x x of y we solved for y there by finding the inverse and we called it an inverse now what is that for well that essentially tells you what's going on it tells you that you're undoing everything and that's exactly what we've done but it's also a way for you to check your work here's how if you compose what you get here into what you get here or what's here into what you've found what's going to happen is these two things will cancel everything out and you will end with x why well if your input is x and a function and inverse undo each other then the output also has to be x it has to be whatever you had originally it's got to not essentially do nothing you start with x you end with x so we're going to show that we're going to show this in this example that when you compose a function with this inverse in either way it's going to simplify down to x so let's try it if we want to check our work or check whether any two functions are inverses just compose them it doesn't really matter the order in which you go whether you want to do g of g inverse or g inverse of g it doesn't matter sometimes you're asked to show both that really doesn't matter because if you do it one way it's going to work both ways so let's check g inverse and a g if you remember compositions this is why we did compositions everything coming together right now for us if we do compositions we look at our first function this function right here say let's open that up with a blank space take the second function which is what we have right down here evaluate it essentially just plug it into the variable or the blank space of the function you just open now it doesn't have to be this easy this is the easy one because i wanted to show it to you but everything should cancel hey cube root to the third power is gone x minus four plus four is x this is what will happen every time you compose a function onto its inverse or an inverse onto its function every time in fact if you wanted to picture this just think about it if i did it opposite i took this function and put it here so this x would be x cubed plus 4. x cubed plus 4 minus 4 those would count so you get x cubed the cube root of x cubed would be x it'd give you the same exact thing no matter what and that's what compositions of inverses do where are we going with it like why who cares when we get to logarithms and exponentials we're going to find out the following things we're going to find out that an exponential is 1 1 well that means it has to have an inverse but none exists and what we had and so we created one we discovered one everyone think about that we discovered logarithms okay exponentials and logarithms are not inverses what's that mean means when you compose them they're going to cancel that's exactly what this says if you compose a function with this inverse it's going to cancel if you compose a function with its inverse it's going to cancel we're going to discover that logarithms exponentials are inverses and therefore when you compose them they cancel and that leaves us how do you solve exponentials and how to solve logarithms that's why we need it that's why we did compositions to get to one-to-one and inverses so that we can explore exponentials and logarithms that's why all right let's talk about the last one h of x equals x squared plus nine and you are asked find the inverse of this function maybe even find it and verify that they're inverses by doing a composition sounds like a lot of words it's not that hard however you do know something about inverses you know that they have to come from one to one functions well think about that this right there is a parabola are parabolas inherently one-to-one well no they're inherently not one-to-one functions there are many outputs which are repeated there are many equal outputs that give us different inputs here's what happens if you try to go ahead and find an inverse of a non-one to one function you're going to run into a situation that as you're solving this for y you're going to be getting having one input give you two different outputs we're going to see it in here so here's how to how to fix that or how um textbooks or teachers fix that they say okay is that one to one well no can you find an inverse or something that's not one to one no no every single inverse has to come from a one-to-one function so how do we fix this problem this is a parabola that shifted up nine units so if i just look at one side of my graph so either the positive x-axis or the negative x-axis well then it becomes one-to-one so i find out where that axis of symmetry is and i say well let's let's just take a look at that let's take a look at when x is greater than or equal to zero well then at that point and further to the right this would become a one one function this is a parabola shifted up nine units and i'm looking at just where x is positive it's going to give me [Music] that half of a graph oh is that let's say that's nine if is that one to one yes if i ignore this other half of the parabola i ignore that and i say i am ignoring it if i ignore that then that is a one-to-one function and in order to find that inverse we can go through the same process but you are going to see that when we start solving this for y we would unless we had done that we would come up with a situation where one input would give us two outputs this is the whole reason do not miss this point the whole reason you needed one to one was so that one input gave you one unique output y so that when you switch them like we do we switch x's wise then that output becomes your input so what that says is that if i have two inputs giving me the same output remember my output is going to become my input then i'd have one input give me two different outputs that would be a non-function this is why it was so important for us to have a one to one function so one input one unique output not not a not not repeated by any any other input that would be an issue so i switch it that's not even a function anymore so let's solve this let's see what the issue would be the first thing we're going to do is we're going to set our h of x equal to y so basically we replace it with y it gives us something that's a little easier to work with then we're going to replace y with x and x is y we're interchanging our outputs and our inputs and as we solve for this y as we solve the output it's going to undo everything about this function and it's going to give us our inverse so let's subtract 9 and here it is when you took a cube root you didn't need a plus and minus but when you take a square root fourth root an even radical when you do that on both sides yeah for sure you're going to have a plus and minus and let's check this out think back i really need to think back to one of our first videos and we discovered functions versus non-functions and we said all right if you have a plus and minus stemming from the fact that you were taking a square root of both sides you had a non-function that's exactly the point i'm trying to make here this is not one-to-one this is not one-to-one without this this is not one-to-one if you go and try to solve it if you try to find an inverse of a non-one-to-one function what you're going to get is a non-function period if you plug in one number besides nine plug in one number here it's going to give you two different outputs one input would give you two outputs here that's a problem it's not even a function why would one input give you two outputs because two out the two inputs here give you the same output so if two inputs give you the same output one new input that's your output would give you two new outputs you're switching them this would not even be a function anymore so how do you fix it you fix it by restricting your domain you fix it by saying okay we're only looking at this part that is one to one what that would be is now remove that negative if our x is positive would give us just those positives there and that's the way we get around this idea of if you don't have a one-to-one function can you still find inverse no but you can restrict your domain so that that changes the function into being one to one or or looks at just the one to one part of that function so this came from h that's h inverse and we say that's just the square root of x minus nine if you needed to prove that that was the inverse you would show a composition i showed it this way i'm going to show it one more time let me show it backwards just to show the same thing so if i compose my first function onto my second or my original h of x onto the inverse i'm going to open h of x h inverse of x with a blank space i'm going to put my function inside and we can really easily see that all this stuff's going to cancel a function and inverse into each other if i start with x i'm going to get out x that happens every time when you compose inversion that's how you check we're going to come back with a few more examples a little bit more robust i'd say and then we'll be done let's get after we got four more examples we'll talk about the graphs of inverses how they look to be very important for exponentials and then and then we'll call it uh call it a video and we'll move on to exponentials in the next video so i'm going to run through these fairly quickly now the idea is not for me to teach you more about inverses where they come from but to show you some of the techniques you need to solve for y there's some factoring involved that sometimes students just forget that you can do and so i'm going to show you that it's very useful now it's also very useful when we solve for logarithms in about a lot of videos so let's take a look at them number one thing when you get these examples it's going to say find the inverse for this one two one function so you don't necessarily need to check for it the times when you see really that something's not one-to-one is when you start having to take a square root and you go oh wait a minute that's that's a problem and therefore you need to restrict the domain we'll see that right here like that's a that's an even function we'll talk about that even functions are symmetric about the y-axis we need to restrict the domain um but in general you go all right that's that's one to one because it's going to tell me that or i can i can i can test it out like we've done before but in general those are going to be one to one if they're asking you to find an inverse so that's a one-to-one function you could graph it if you wanted to i taught you how to graph them but it's it's for sure going to pass the horizontal line test that's one one so we're going to run through it i'm going to show you all the techniques that you need number one thing you're going to replace your output with y then what we're going to do is replace the y with x and replace every x with y and finally we're going to solve for that y sometimes it's not all that easy sometimes it is it's not that bad but in general that's our idea so if we solve for y we're going to have to somehow move y off a denominator you can do it a couple different ways you can picture this as a proportion and cross multiply if you think of this as x over one that's totally fine you can multiply both sides by the denominator that's okay too that's what i'm going to do um you can just switch this with this denominator which is eventually what we're going to do anyhow and so i'm going to show that to you so let's multiply by 2 minus y and 2 minus y what are we going to get on the left hand side we get 2 minus y times x on the right hand side we get four now here's what i tell you at this point in a lot of these examples it's time for you to make it the correct choice you either distribute or you don't here's how to tell if you have all of your y's already on this side in parentheses just divide by that x if you don't then you need to distribute collect all your y terms on one side all your non-y terms on the other side and you're going to factor we'll see that in a couple examples but for right now we look at this and all right i've got all my y's right here i am just trying to solve for y there's no otherwise anywhere else i do not need to distribute if you do distribute is it a problem no might be a little extra work but it's not a problem so we're going to divide by x we're going to subtract 2 and if we divide by negative 1 we get y equals i'm going to switch our our order here positive 2 minus 4 over x we're done that's our inverse 2 minus 4 over x if you have to make this one fraction remember you need a common denominator it'd be 2x minus 4 over x you can do that x over x and that's fine also it's the same exact thing and you say all right this is f inverse of x okay what if you don't like that what if you don't like to divide or if you say you know what i'm just a distribution kind of person i just love distribute that's fine there's nothing wrong with that in fact we're going to do that on all the rest of our examples we're going to have to distribute that if you do distribute from here so we not divide by x if you distribute then at this point collect all your y terms on one side all your non y terms on the other side and then if you have more than one y term factor the y and divide if you don't like here just divide just divide by negative x we rarely like to see a negative on the denominator so i'm going to take that run that through the denominator with the numerator so if i divide by negative 1 on the numerator and denominator actually i would get 2x minus 4 over x which is exactly the same thing that we got either way works pick the way that you're most comfortable with a lot of people actually do like the distribution because they're used to it just saying you don't really have to do that you can divide the main point is collect your chart with y's factor if you have to and then your final step should be divide maybe change your signs and that's our inverse could you compose it yeah you could but you'd have to take this function and put it right there if you did that you need to clear a denominator but it is going to eventually cancel out everything and give you x all right so let's try g of x g of x equals negative two x over x minus one we're gonna right after we're gonna try to find the inverse so let's replace our g with y place we see y which is only one place we're going to change that into an x and every place we see an x we're going to change that into a y now we've got to solve for y but we also have a denominator so we're going to multiply both sides by that and we end up getting y minus one x equals negative two y and the last example i gave you give you the example to show you that it's not always necessary to to do distribution however if you ever have a y anywhere else beside in that parenthesis you have to distribute the idea is get all of your terms with y on one side all the terms without y on the other side why because then you can factor the y and divide that's what we're going to do here so when you see this if you confuse just distribute we know that it actually does work both cases is going to work but here for sure you're going to have to distribute this so when we distribute we get x y minus x equals negative 2y and this is where a lot of students get stuck they go what in the world do i do now because i have y's in two different places what i'm going to do factor but in order to factor you get your y's on one side and non y's and other that way every term has a y so i'm going to take this and move it over here and this and move over here by adding x on both sides and adding the 2y on both sides so that's what we're doing right now i'm going to add 2y to both sides i'm going to add x to both sides and look what it does if i collect my terms with y and separate my terms without y it leaves me every term with y over here as something that can that has a gcf of y i can factor it looks like magic almost like oh that's cool i've just changed two y's into one well that's what factoring does doesn't it it removes it from all the terms and puts in one spot via multiplication but now i can divide because it is multiplication and that right there is the inverse of the function g that we started with you can check your work you can compose it it just becomes more difficult with some of these harder problems more complicated because you have to plug in this function in at least two different places most of the time so you take this plug it in here and here you'd have to simplify that complex fraction that you're going to get with the lcd of x plus 2 distribute combine some like terms factor and it's going to cancel out and leave you with just an x just for fun let's do it so either way you go it doesn't matter how you compose them i'm going to compose g of g inverse so how compositions work you open up your first function listed i'm looking back at my g i'm going to replace all my variables with some blank spaces into those blank spaces i put my second function so into this function i put this entire function so into my blank spaces i put this what i found that looks kind of nasty but this is the reason why we deal with complex fractions in like intermediate algebra classes so that we do this so how do i deal with complex fractions we multiply by the lcd so our lcd here is just x plus 2. we're going to multiply both the numerator and denominators so as to multiply by a really fancy one equivalent rational expression is what we're creating here i'm going to multiply both the numerator denominator x plus 2. on this numerator that just cancels and that's great so on this numerator i'm just going to get negative 2x on my denominator keep in mind you have to distribute this so i'm going to distribute yes it's going to go here x plus 2 and x 2 are going to cancel i'm going to get x but it also multiplies to the now when you multiply by one you're going to subtract that whole thing so what's that look like oh my gosh i'm subtracting the whole thing subtracting 1 times that whole thing so it's negative 2x over x minus x minus 2 not plus 2. and because negative 2 of negative two is one we get x and that proves it that proves that these two things are in fact inverses you can actually see it here too imagine plugging in anything but one imagine plugging in something like two all right so let's remember we're plugging in 2d plug into if i plug in 2 i get negative 4 over 1. well that's negative 4. now take your negative 4 plug it in here negative 4 divided by negative 4 plus 2 well this is negative 2 negative four divided by negative two is two i got out after i plugged it in and ran it through i got back out two that's what inverses does and that's what this composition is showing you okay let's move on to the last two let's look at h of x negative three x plus four that negative is supposed to be out front negative three x plus four over x minus two first thing we're doing to find the inverse is recognizing that it's gonna be a one to one function if we're going to find it or it has to have a domain restriction so that's a one-to-one function actually has a horizontal asymptote at negative three that's what it's going to look like but we're going to replace our h of x with y and we show that every time now we take our y we say i want that to be my x and every place i see an x i'm going to change that to a y and now it's our job to solve for y we're going to deal with something very similar to this and that we're going to have to distribute and collect our y terms and factor but we also see that negative make it make a choice with that negative and do one of one of three things either divide right now by negative one that's okay you can do that or multiply through your numerator which is what i'm going to do or your denominator which i don't recommend but you can do so i'm going to run this through my numerator and make this x equals negative three y minus four over y minus two that way we have at least we have a sign floating out front that we're not sure of so you can always do that you always just run through your numerator so i distributed negative 3y and then minus 4. now we're going to go ahead and do our manipulation try to solve for y let's firstly multiply both sides by y minus 2. and then we're going to check your problem if all of my y's are right here all i've got to do is divide if i have more y's that are right here i need to distribute collect my y's and factor that's what happens here so i have a y here and here it says you're gonna have to collect those terms there's no way to do that without distribution and now we see it we got a y here y here we got to collect and we got to get everything else it doesn't have a y on the other side so i'm going to add 2x and add 3y to both sides now we're ready to factor now because we factored we have things that are multiplied together we undo multiplication by division we could check our work with a composition take this plug it into the variables there and simplify yeah you're going to get a lot of complex fractions but it is possible to show that and this is our inverse so we're going to say that this came from the function h this is h inverse that's it if you i wouldn't say this is really conclusive but if you did take a value besides negative besides positive 2 because you can't believe that and you evaluated here took the output plugged in here and give you the same input that's a really good indication without doing a composition that you have inverses but really to check your work you're going to want to compose those i hope this is making sense i hope you're seeing the process and the whole idea of why i'm doing this one just make sure you're grouping your y's that way you can factor it and i get stuck right there's where students get stuck on it so let's come back we'll do one more example all right here we go so f of x equals x squared plus 3 over 3x squared you go wait a minute that's an even function i'll verify that's an even function even functions are symmetric about the y-axis so if something's symmetric about the y-axis no matter how it looks it is not going to be one to one so this requires something from us if we have something symmetric with the y-axis we can make a one-to-one part of it a lot of the times by taking and saying let's just let x be greater than or equal to zero now there's a problem with that too in this case we can't let x be greater than or equal to zero why well it fails our domain our domain says you've got a vertical asymptote on the x on that y axis you can't let x equal zero so we just want to be strictly greater than zero here and i hope that makes sense to put domain together with this this hey you have to have a one-to-one function this section of the x-axis is going to cause this to be a one-to-one function that's not normally something you would have to do it's going to be given to you it's going to say hey this is 101 or hey on this portion of the x-axis this is a one-to-one function now i'll find the inverse considering that and so we go through that so all right let's replace our f of x with y let's change our y to an x our x's both to y's and now we're going to solve for y do the same thing you did here let's multiply both sides by 3y squared so 3xy squared these are gone you're going to get y squared plus 3. and now the same idea collect your terms that have y or y squared and the ones that don't leave them on the other side so i'm going to subtract y squared there's no distribution here and then we're going to factor factor out the whole gcf so factor out y squared and now because we have factored these are connected by multiplication multiplication we can divide and one more step and why that was necessary if you ever see yourself taking a square root you're going to normally have a plus and minus if that wasn't there oh man i hope makes sense if that wasn't there when you did this next step you would have to have a plus and minus there and that would create a problem for you because you'd say one input would give me two outputs stemming from the fact that right here two inputs are giving you one output that would be a problem so one input would give me two outputs if i reverse that that's an issue but because we restrict our domain you don't have both you just have the positive here and that creates an inverse and it's inverse of this function on that domain so what that means is that these are both one-to-one functions and they're in versus one another you can compose them you might kind of see that your squares are going to cancel out your square root threes uh you have a little bit of work with the lcd there but it certainly would be an inverse and we're going to say that this is f inverse of x i hope i've made that make sense for you how to find an inverse algebraically so we've done it now with points so we can just switch x and y that's essentially what we've done here just a lot more work um and we had to do it all the time right because we these aren't just four points those are infinite number points so we can't switch it in for the number of points unless we do it with the function itself that's what we've done we made sure to label it appropriately with our f inverse h inverse as the case may be and now we're going to take a look at graphs very briefly to see that what a graph does from a function to its inverse all right last little bit we need to talk about the graphs and i hope you're still with me because this is really important this is how one of the ways that we're going to determine what a logarithm is from an exponential function so here's what you need to know about a function and its inverse graphically if this is our function is it a one-to-one function yeah is it gonna have inverse all of them do all one-to-one functions are going to have an inverse function graphically here's what happens because we switch our x with our y you remember that we did with points we do with algebraic functions because you switch your x with your y because your input becomes your output your output times your input we are going to reflect our function across the y equals x line and it is going to give us our inverse so a function and its inverse are reflections about this y equals x line because we're switching x with y to create that inverse that's the idea so this function will look like this roughly so this point is let's say negative 3 0 then now we switch that if this was negative 3 0 then 0 negative 3 should appear on my inverse function if this was let's say um 0 4 just making these up right now then 4 0 should appear on my inverse function and i've sketched this this is approximate but it's just to show you that this is the inverse of this function uh the graphs are reflections about this diagonal line this y equals x line if you folded it they hopefully match up the distance here should be the same and that's it this is still a one to one function they are inverses of one another if i had this as our function that would be the inverse it doesn't really matter they're inverses of each other so moving on what happens if you're required to graph a an inverse from its function i've given you one that i made up really quickly so i've given you one two three four five points one of which you notice is on that y equals x line if we ever want to find the inverse just take those points reverse them and reflect it about this diagonal line it's a lot easier when it doesn't intersect that line to find the reflection when it does you're going to be crossing it's going to get a little bit awkward so here's the idea if we have these four points listed not that one because that right there if i reflect something on y equals x it's going to stay y equals x this is a point that's going to be on both of these functions the function and its inverse so if i have the other four points then if 2 negative 2 1 is on the original function remember that we're switching that was not switching we're switching the y with the x so if negative 2 1 is on the original then 1 negative 2 is on the inverse you know it's changing these signs you switch your x with your y and 0 negative 1 negative 2 0 and negative 7 3 let's double check so switched switched switched and switched if we plot those one negative two that would be the new point for an inverse zero negative one this would be now this point for the inverse this point is the same now my scale is a little off but that's going to be the same zero negative so negative two zero this became that point and negative seven three this became that point when i reflected it and we're going to do our best to graph this looks about like that this is a little off of our scale but hopefully you get the point that all this is really doing is taking this and reflecting about that point right there notice how they have to both have the same exact point because that is on or y equals x so i've taken this and i just rotated it and that's where it ended up so i hope i hope you're with me on the graphs what we're going to do in the future is get an exponential and reflected about that line it's going to create the graph of a logarithm we'll look at our key points for that and that'll be about it we're ready to get certain exponentials which is exciting a whole other world kind of opens up with them with us or for us with exponentials and logarithms so at this point you didn't know that one-to-one functions create inverses that inverses only come from one-to-one functions and then how to find them algebraically and what they look like graphically so hopefully it's making sense and i'll see you for another video you 

Transcript for: Graphs of Exponential Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 52)
welcome to another video today we're going to talk about exponentials i know that you've seen them before you've probably heard them before you might even graph them but we're going to look at them under kind of the why they look the way that they do and how we're going to use them for logarithms in just a little bit so we really want to get a good feel of why these are created the way they are why they look the way they do why they are one-to-one functions and that they will create an inverse graph that we call a logarithm in just a little bit so deeper than just a cursory understanding of hey this is what exponential looks like so we'll talk about right now what an exponential is but that should be the back of our thoughts as why they look the way that they do i'm going to create two graphs at the same time we'll talk about key points domain talk about range horizontal asymptote and then we'll move on from that so what an exponential is an exponential is different from a polynomial so a polynomial what it does it takes a variable and raises it to a constant exponent has a lot of different terms you can do that and adds them all up an exponential switches that it takes a constant that we call a base that's always positive and not one not zero and it takes it to an exponent which is a variable which is a very interesting concept we get a lot of really good population modeling from exponential type of growth so that's what this means so when we see a function where we have a base that's a constant raised to a power or an exponent this is a variable that's an exponential function a is always positive it's not zero and it's not one for the following reasons if you had a having the ability to be a negative what would happen what would happen is we'd have this negative number raised to the first power would give you a negative raised to the second power would give you a positive and we get this very disjointed dis non-continuous uh graph we have a lot of continuities in that it'd be very difficult to even graph really consider what's going on and so we disallow that instead we say hey our base is going to be positive it's not going to be 1 why why can't it be 1 well if you take 1 to any power you're going to get one it's going to create this horizontal line at y equals one which would be great if that's all we were doing said oh yeah every differential is this but that's just that's not true what we're going to understand about this is that as our one sorry as our as our base gets bigger than one we're going to get an increasing graph and as our base gets less than one but not negative remember it has to be between zero and one basically we're going to get this decreasing graph and we will explore that as we continue so that is what an exponential comes from is this base that's a constant that is positive not one raised to this variable that is that is your exponent and that's going to be changing so now we're going to move on to talk about graphs you see there's two cases when we talk about exponentials even though our a is positive always zero we have this one this value of one that causes our graphs to either always increase or always decrease depending on whether our base is above or below that why why is that the case and this is going to be the fundamental reason why our graphs look different here it is if you take one to any power true enough you get out one if you take numbers that are greater than 1 and you take them to positive exponents those numbers are going to grow so if i take numbers like let's use this for instance let's use 2 to the x and i take two to the first i'm gonna go up two two to the second i'm gonna get a four two to the third i'm gonna get eight and then two the four is sixteen if i take numbers that are more than one and i take them to positive exponents these are going to grow correct numbers greater than one raised to powers that are positive are going to grow numbers that are less than one so between zero and one like fractions like one one-half and it does have to be in parentheses it's the whole fraction being raised to that power if i take a base of one-half or numbers between zero one and i start taking them to positive exponents what happens well one half to the first power is one half sure but one half to the second is one fourth one after the third is one eighth when that fourth is 1 16 they get smaller this is the reason why our graphs do two different things is because values that are greater than one when i take them to positive exponents grow and values less than one when i take in positive exponents shrink they decrease how about negative numbers that are greater than one when i take them to negative exponents create reciprocals for us so that that was a concept a long time ago negative exponents don't create negative values they create fractions or reciprocals of fractions if we start with fractions so two to the negative one doesn't create negative two it creates one half two to the negative two doesn't create uh negative four it creates one-fourth and so this is going to climb and likewise here one-half to the negative one doesn't create negative one-half rates two this is going to fall which is the reason why we have these two different graphs we're going to explore that right now in a little bit more detail we're going to come up with the fact that every single exponential has some key points and a horizontal asymptote and why that is so i talked about some values we're now going to plot them we're going to see why this graph climbs where you see why this graph falls we'll get our key points from that so let's plug in some values if we start by plugging in let's say 0 0 is always a great value to plug in because it gives us our y-intercept if i plug in 0 2 to the 0 power is going to give me 1. how about when i plug in 1 2 to the first power is going to give me 2. so i'm getting out 0 1 1 2 if i evaluated for two i'd get out four now we can use a lot more values if we wanna plug in three two to the third would give us eight four to the fourth would give us 16. five two to the fifth would give us 32. this is going to be a pretty steeply climbing graph now if we about if i evaluate some negative values like negative one two to the negative one power two to the negative one equals one over two that's gonna be one half and two to the negative two would give us 1 over 2 squared well that's 1 4. and so we don't climb back like a parabola we don't get negative we get these values positive one-half and positive one-fourth now here's a big question if i plug in negative three in your head you should be thinking see two negative third that's one over 2 cubed that's 1 8. and then if we're plugging negative 4 of that b that'd be 1 16 then 1 32nd then 1 64. is this ever going to hit zero is it even possible is it even possible to take a value and put it here and make this zero is two to any power equal to zero well you try zero right but two the zero power is giving you one not zero it's impossible for us to plug in a number here that's going to cause this to be zero in fact this is big it's impossible for us to plug a value in here that even makes this negative i tried positives and gave me really big values i tried zero it gave me one i tried negative it gave me fractions four bases that are greater than one it's just giving me fractions but they're positive this has no ability to give me an output that's negative now that's interesting that says that we can plug in any number right our domain is going to be all real numbers but i can't get out every number i can't even get out zero oh i can't even get out of zero i can't even get out negatives and therefore since i can't get out negatives and i can't get out zero we're going to have a horizontal asymptote at y equals 0. this graph is always increasing that is what an exponential looks like if your a is more than one we're going to remove the two and talk about in general when a is greater than one in just a minute before we do that we're going to answer this this graph so let's take a look at one half to the x let's start plugging in some values exactly like we did if we evaluate zero and i take one half to the zero power so i'm evaluating x equals zero one half of zero anything to the zero powers if you have a base that is a a positive number is going to give you out one well that's the same exact output is here now it says ask another question is it always true that if i take some sort of constant and i evaluate it for x equals zero am i always going to get out one the answer is yes every single one of these exponentials before you start shifting it manipulate it do transformations every one of them if you evaluate x equals zero it will give you out one why because any constant raised to the zero power is one that's huge that's going to be a key point for us now let's move on what happens if i plug in one evaluate for one if i evaluate for one one half to the first power remember that's our variable one half of the first power is going to give me out one half anything raised to the first power gives you back what you plugged in so i get this point one comma one half way over here i evaluated one and i get out two here i evaluated one i got a one half is it true that every time you evaluate an exponential for the value x equals 1 you'll get back the base is that always true answer is yes that's always true if i plug in 1 here i'm going to get the base 2. if i plug in 1 here i'm going to get the base one-half if i plug in 1 here i'm going to get the base a those are the two and only two key points you ever need for exponentials in order to graph them especially with transformations you need the key points 0 1 and 1 comma the base don't go any further until you understand that those two key points are going to show up on every exponential before we shift it you need that you need to understand that with an exponential if i evaluate for zero a to the zero power gives me one that's big and if i evaluate for one a to the first power gives me back whatever my base is these two key points are how we're going to graph in the next video when we talk about transformations 0 1 and 1 comma whatever your base is let's continue if i plug in 2 well 1 half to the second power is going to give me 1 4. same question is this one can we ever get this to touch zero touch the x-axis or be negative well if i plug in three i'm gonna get one-eighth forming at one sixteenth five and one thirty seconds six and so forth and so on i can't ever make this negative in fact if you take a positive number to any exponent you're not going to get a negative we explored that here this can't be negative it is going to get closer and closer to zero as an output well wait a second that's this idea of a horizontal asymptote again so we have the same idea that both of these graphs and every exponential in general is going to have a horizontal asymptote on the x-axis before you start shifting it on the x-axis or at y 0. now what happens when we plug in negatives if we evaluate for negative one one-half to the negative one power there's a nice property of exponents it says if you evaluate a fraction to a negative exponent you can reciprocate the fraction and it will change the sign of your exponent so one half to the negative one is equivalent to two over one to the first power that means we're going to get two and likewise if that's a negative two i would reciprocate and have two over one squared will that give you 4. these functions are in fact symmetrical about that y-axis we can see that this one is increasing all the time this one's decreasing all the time you can see they both have a key point of zero one and one comma whatever the base is here's your zero one here's your one comma your base here's your zero one and here's your one comma whatever your base is this is true in general for exponentials until you start shifting them around they both have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero that's also true for exponential so this is kind of a big deal understanding where these things came from why they look the way they do and especially identifying what they're going to look like for your base so if your base is more than one they're going to increase if your base is less than one they're going to decrease um in general so in general this is if you're uh if this a was just greater than one not specifically equal to two and we started erasing some of this stuff and saying well i don't know exactly what my base is here's how this graph is going to look if your a is more than one you're still going to get zero one but you'll just have some sort of a key point that's that's above 0 1 y well if a is more than 1 and you plug in and you plug in let's say 1 here you're going to get 1 comma a if your a is above 1 it will be one comma something above one it would have to be above that value if a is above one if a is below one so we'll change this to not necessarily one half if your a is less than one then when you plug in one you're going to get something one comma something less than one that's below here that's why that has to drop if both of these these functions whether a is above one or below one if both these functions have that point zero one then the a being greater than one would climb and a b and less than one would have to fall in general that's true so here's the way i like to think of it for for exponentials if a were to equal one which is not going to if a were to equal one you would get a horizontal line one to any power is going to give you the horizontal line that's a constant if your a is greater than 1 that raises the positive side of your y-axis and lowers the negative side if a is less than 1 it's reverse so a more than one yeah start climbing and the more you're more than one the steeper it's going to climb a less than one you're gonna start falling the more you're less than one you're going to start really falling dramatically that's that's a cool thing one other thing to to see here is the um yeah i don't know now i'm not going to show it to you but uh there's some even evenness going on with the switch of a sign we can get that a reflection of these graphs which is kind of neat to see this is key this is what we want to know is what we want to talk about in general that's true for your your key points that's true for your horizontal asymptote which we'll explore in the next section other than that our domain for our exponentials you should see this you can plug in any number we plugged in zero we plug in positives we plugged in negatives there's nothing wrong with this your range is not all real numbers your domain you can plug in anything all real numbers your range is strictly positive you cannot get up zero and you cannot get out negative numbers from an exponential before you shift it so your domain is from zero to positive infinity but it's not included in zero that's another way to say all real numbers range we get out things very close to zero which is why we don't use a bracket all the way to positive infinity in both of these cases all right so the last thing and a very important thing we have a special number in math we have lots of special numbers in math one of them is pi one of them is e now i know you're familiar with pi and hopefully you're familiar with e this number e right here that is a constant number it is a value that does not change that's a weird value it's called the euler number euler is spelled with an e and so this is this is based on on him leonard euler it is called the euler number or the natural number and it's about 2.7 now this number we can't write out as 2.7 because it goes forever and it doesn't repeat it's a transcendental number but that is a a very special number and it occurs a lot in nature and in a lot of mathematics so it's really useful to understand an exponential based on that number e so e is approximately 2.7 about two point seven one and it goes forever uh and it doesn't repeat for any length of time that's uh that's modeled by a fraction so it's not a fraction here's the question in which of these two which of these two graphs would best model that would it be a graph that's always increasing or graph that's always decreasing well let's think about that what is the base so is it exponential sure it's got a base what is the base is the base more than one or is the base less than one if the base is more than one it can't look like this one it's going to look like this one in fact it's really close to this this is going to be if we did f of x equals e to the x let's see what these values would do if i plug in 0 am i still going to get 1 yeah always every exponential does that if i evaluate for 0 e to the 0 is still going to give me 1 i'm still going to have that value if i plug in 1 am i still going to get my base out yes except my base is going to be e so e to the first power is going to give me e what that means is that for our graph we get something that if this is one and this is two we'd get about you know i'm gonna change this a little bit evaluate for 0 we get out 1. evaluate for 1 we get out 2.7 of roughly 2.7 this would be one comma e and we can see right there that if every exponential has a .01 and you evaluate for one it gives you out your base then if every exponential has 0 1 if your base is more than 1 you'd get out something above 1. and less than 1 you get something less than 1 when you plugged in 1. so evaluate for 1 if a is bigger than 1 it's up here if a is less than one it's between here that gives you whether it climbs for four bases greater than one or falls for bases less than one it has to do that so this is going to give us a climbing graph it's a little bit steeper than 2 to the x but it's very close because that's 2.7 this is how the graph of f of x equals e to the x looks it still has those key points it still has that horizontal asymptote this is still the domain and range is it going to be useful to try to solve for x-intercepts for an exponential they don't have any um so that that would be kind of a waste of time these are not going to have them until they start shifting down can we can we solve exponentials yes but we need more to it so i told you the idea behind what exponentials are i told you why we're going to need them here's the the key points and key points the key points of what you need to remember for exponentials number one exponentials are caused by taking a base to an exponent that is a variable your base has to be positive if your base is more than one your graph is going to climb and if it's between zero and one your graph is going to fall this is always increasing this is always decreasing they both have the key points zero one because when i take a constant to zero i get out one and they have the the point one comma whatever your bases because if i take the base to the first power i'm gonna get it back they both have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero that's always true for exponential until i start shifting them finally e to the x is a very special case of an exponential where we have a certain base that's used very often in nature sciences and mathematics and that base is e e is approximately 2.7 and so we are going to get this ever increasing graph this is always increasing on the domain just like that one's always decreasing and finally this is like the the whole punch line of what logarithms are gonna come from is this function one two one use your horizontal line test certainly a function is a one-to-one function yes because no outputs are ever repeated and that's also a one-to-one function because no outputs are ever repeated well if a function is one-to-one it has to have an inverse in a couple videos from now we're going to take that idea we're going to explore it and say yeah this has an inverse in fact we could graph it it would be not hard to graph we'll change our key points from exponentials and get key points of the inverse of an exponential we'll call it a special name called a logarithm and then we'll discover that they solve each other so that's very important because right now there's no way to solve that function if i set this equal to another function or like a constant or something and try to solve it we really can't do it unless some special cases arise so that's what i want you to know right now where they come from and where we're going with i hope you explain it well enough for you to understand that next time we'll practice i know that this while not being vague doesn't let us practice very well how to graph these so we're going to practice next time when we do some transformations of exponential functions hope you're doing well you

welcome to another video so in this video we are going to graph the exponentials that we talked about in the last video we discovered why the graphs look the way that they do in the last video now is our time to practice that so i'm going to show you exactly how to graph exponential functions with some transformations we're going to see that all the transformations that we learned earlier all the shifting left and right up and down and reflecting this across the x-axis across the y-axis all the vertical stretch compression that still works we just need to know how to read them so the ideas to get out of this are that we have some key points there's only two of them we have a horizontal asymptote we're going to use that with our shifting to get a really good picture of our graph all the shifting is still going to work so we've got five examples are going to go pretty quickly i'm going for for quantity here to make sure we see a lot of different cases we'll come back with some examples of exponentials that involve euler number or the natural number this e and then we'll be done so let's refresh on what exponentials actually mean exponentials are this constant raised to an exponent that is a variable a is going to be greater than one or less than one yielding two different graphs if a is more than one we discovered last time this is going to be an always increasing function and if a is less than one we get a decreasing function a is not going to equal one otherwise we get a horizontal line and that's very boring and not exciting like exponential should be also we we know that in both of these cases we have two key points and a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero the key points are always due to the nature of what exponentials do zero one and one comma whatever your base is zero one because if you plug in 0 a constant raised to 0 always gives you 1. and 1 comma a because if you plug in 1 anything raised to the first power is going to give you back that anything and that is our base so let's explore our model the process for going through these what our shifting is going to look like and then we'll graph these honestly really quick so let's take a look at it we have a function 3 to the x minus 2. i'm going to make sure you understand that that minus 2 is being subtracted from the function so when we look at this we think this is based on an exponential first thing i want you to do with an exponential is put down the key points so the key points are always 0 1 and one comma our base well our base is three so zero one and one comma three now here's what's going to happen we're going to shift this graph so this is based on the function 3 to the x but we're going to shift it we're going to understand what that minus 2 does we'll shift this and then we'll put our key points on the graph in relation to where we shifted it not here at 0 1 and 1 3 that would have been the case if we hadn't have shifted it but that does something to it and so just like we did before the transformations we're going to put this in relation to where our our shifted x and y axis actually went so we go okay we have our key point zero one and one comma base that happens every time we have exponentials then we're going to identify what our shifting actually does so here's where to look we look at the end of our function and we determine whether something's being added or subtracted after our exponential part of this is over and if that's the case we have a vertical shift then we look in the exponent if anything's added or subtracted that's going to be a horizontal shift then we look in front in front of our exponential remember our exponential is positive so that's a positive number anything in front of that is going to be a a vertical shift or compression or reflection if it's negative so here i see my exponential function and then a minus 2. that minus 2 is not with the exponent it's not even with exponential it's after it that's a shift down 2. so this is a vertical shift down 2. from there we look for a left or right shift well that would be inside my exponent so x plus or x minus some number that's not there so we don't have any sort of a horizontal shift i'm just going to show that by putting my x and my y axis with these dotted lines and here's what that does for us that creates this this place where i can use my key points to illustrate a shifting of this original three to the x graph but in relation to where these things actually shifted so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to look in front of my function there's nothing being multiplied you don't count this as a multiplier here that is your base it's where these points came from a multiplier in front of it would look something like this like that number that would be a vertical stretch here it would look a little awkward but it would look something like if you had a vertical stretch it would look something like this that would be a vertical stretch in this case you take your four you'd multiply your outputs by your four to get your new key points the three itself is your base you don't multiply the base before the exponential exponent you take 3 to the exponent and then you multiply by 4. that you do the function first and then multiply by 4 that is what it would create this multiplying the y or the output and growing your function or shrinking your function or reflecting your function that's what that does so this 3 is your base there's no changing that anything multiplied in front of it would look like this sometimes we get a little sloppy and we say we don't show the parentheses which we should and you'd get 4 times 3 of x that 4 would still be that vertical shift you would in no way ever get 12 to the x please keep that in mind so here we look at it we go yep that's a vertical shift down two there's no left or right shift there's no manipulating of the outputs or key points that means no reflections no vertical stretch compression we are just going to plot our key points from where we shifted this so zero 1 is in relation to this new shifted axis system for us this maintains your horizontal asymptote that's really nice that's what we that's why we show this with this technique so 0 1 says i'm right here 0 1 in relation to this this would be like 0 0 this is now 0 1 and then 1 comma 3 in relation to this new sort of x y axis but with the same scale so here's zero one here's one comma one two three and because i know that my base is more than one i know that i'm going to get a climbing function already so i have that picture in my head i also know that because i plotted my key points there's no way that this can't decline this has to be an increasing function oh yeah our base is more than one that should be the case so we looked at we said we have a base that's more than one it's going to be climbing we have this exponential function it's going to have key points 0 1 always and 1 comma whatever your base is we shifted down 2 that moves our horizontal asymptote we did not shift left or right well that moves that does not move this y-axis that we have we're going to graph our function like we know it should look if you need to be more precise you can plug in some other values so if you plugged in two two three to the second power is nine nine minus two would be seven and you'll find some some actual physical points here please keep this in mind i know we've done transformations at least three times and so this should be there already but if it's not if you're forgetting this these points are not on this graph exactly they are from the shifted version of where you did this so you're using your key points to give yourself a very accurate graph but your actual points that these transform to are the points zero negative one and one comma one this is just a really useful way to graph it that's all we do it for is to get a really nice picture of it so this model is everything our exponential should it is an increasing graph we do that because our base was more than one we shifted we have our key points and we just throw it on there and make a pretty decent graph so let's take a look at what a a horizontal shift would look like so taking a look at f of x equals two to the x plus 2. i want you to notice something first right off the bat that this is based on an exponential and the base is 2. this again should be a base greater than 1 you should get an increasing function unless we start reflecting it so let's identify if this is our base then right now we should come up with our key points our key points for exponentials are 0 1 that's where we start and one comma whatever our base is one comma two in this case because our base is two then we start identifying any transformations that we have how i'd like you to do this and this is going to make a lot more sense when we do it how i want you to do is i want you to look at the exponent and if there's anything added or subtracted in your exponent put a parenthesis around that and what that's going to do that's going to clue your brain into oh right that's affecting my input affecting my input moves on the input axis or the x-axis it'll also make certain that you don't accidentally think that's a vertical shift up to so anything next to your exponent you put that in parentheses and it says this is not a vertical shift so we look here hey there's nothing being added or subtracted after my function that's not a vertical shift i look inside my function oh right that's why i put parentheses that's a plus 2. that's a shift to the left too we did not shift vertically at all so there is no adding or subtracting after the function no vertical shift there's a shift left two that's adding to inside my function affecting the input affects the input axis we shifted left too notice how our horizontal asymptote doesn't shift it's still at y equals zero then we look in front of our function out in front of this two and see if anything's being multiplied are we do we have a negative out there uh do we multiply by anything that stretches our function and we don't so we're not affecting our key points here our key points are still 0 1 and 1 2 but they have also been shifted haven't they the whole thing's been shifted and so we're going to plot those in relation to where we shifted from or sorry i shifted to so 0 1 same scale 0 1 and then 1 comma 2. so where these dotted lines intersect that acts like your origin so that you can punch key points zero one would be here one comma two would be here that's our key points put in relation to our shifted axes because we didn't shift up or down our horizontal asymptote still maintains that's why we still draw that dotted line to make certain that we understand okay this is this is really where it is let's make sure we get that right this is our horizontal asymptote still and we're going to graph that if you want to be more accurate it's really nice to have a y-intercept so if you wanted to find a y-intercept you can always do that by evaluating for zero so if we take this and we evaluate for zero zero plus two is two two squared is four now this point doesn't get shifted because you're literally evaluating it so you're plugging in 0 saying where am i crossing this this is the real y-axis this was just shifted so that we get a nice graph this is the y-axis if i plug in 0 i'm going to get out 4. we've got to behave with our horizontal asymptote we've got to behave with our key points from our new shifted axes and we've got to behave with our y intercept that's a really good picture of that graph for minimal work i hope you're seeing the ideas here the ideas are always identifieds and exponential write down your key points 0 1 and 1 comma your base depends on your base then identify your shifting vertical is always after the function horizontal is always within your exponent and then out front affects your key points then we shift it we put our key points in relation to our axes that we shifted and we try to get some other point on there to give us a better picture here we could have used something like two and gotten seven it's just a little bit high for this graph okay let's move on so we have f of x equals negative three x to the x plus one we're going to start the same way because this has a base raised to an exponent that is a variable this is an exponential and we are going to immediately write down our key points one thing to look at here this confuses some people so be careful some people say wait a minute i thought your base couldn't be negative it can't and that's not if we remember order of operations remember that exponents happen before multiplication and so this is not negative 3 raised to the x power this is 3 raised to the x power and it has a negative out front in fact it has a negative 1 out front this right here looks confusing but oh man i hope that you remember this this is big is a big deal do you remember that these are completely different things completely different this says you're taking negative 2 that number to the fourth power that's what that says you can think of it this way you can think about this as negative 1 times 2 to the fourth and because exponents distribute across multiplication you take negative one to the fourth you would take two to the fourth you would get positive 16 out of that that doesn't happen here you see if you think about this as negative one times two to the fourth only the two is being raised to the fourth power not the negative one it's a matter of order of operations the exponent takes precedence over the multiplication because they can always separate a negative as negative one times a positive number we have to look at what is actually being raised to that fourth power here both the negative one and the two are here it's not that way it's just the two this would give you negative 16 well this gives you positive this is what is going on there so if you want some help on getting these right i would really recommend writing it just a little bit different if you write it as the base in parentheses it's very helpful to see what's really going on here i hope that makes sense your base can't be negative and it's not negative the base is 3 3 is being raised to the x power that's a variable and that is our our exponent and then there's a negative one in front of that that's what's really happening i hope you're with me on that one it's it's very much this this case so with that in mind now we understand our key points our key points are always 0 1 and 1 comma your base your base here is 3 not negative 3. after that we start identifying any transformations that we have so we're looking at the back end of our function after the after the exponent and we're saying all right that plus one that is a vertical shift up one unit i'm looking next to my exponent so in the exponent next to my variable i don't see any pluses or minuses that means that there's no left or right shift after that we look out front this is where that negative makes sense that negative says oh that is going to be a reflection oh do you remember that do you remember how negatives out front affect the output think through what you would have to do here if you were to plug in a value like let's say let's say four okay you said you take three to the fourth power that's what you do first you want to take negative three you take three to the fourth power that's 81. then you'd make it negative that's negative 81. that is a reflection and that's what that negative does it always does this in front of a function it's going to be a reflection about the x-axis well for us what that does we show that by affecting our outputs of our key points so we found key points great we identified a vertical shift cool we said there's no horizontal shift no problem now we look out front and say that is really a negative one negative one is going to affect my output values not my inputs i'm still going to get zero i'm still going to get one but my outputs have now been reflected so from our shifted axes that's shifted axis system where this acts like an origin no it's not our origin but acts like it for our key points i'm going to plot these new key points 0 negative 1 so if that's 0 0 that's zero negative one and one comma negative three one two this would be zero negative one this would be from here 0 negative 1 and 1 comma negative 3. our horizontal asymptote is shown that's why we show those dotted lines that's why this technique works i always like teaching things that always work for transformations and this technique does look straight and then we're going to plot this oh this is fantastic this is reflected like we thought it would be this still has a horizontal asymptote it's just now decreasing there we go if you want to be a bit more accurate you start plugging in some other values uh we have two and we have the shape of this so it's it's pretty nice but you could plug in something like positive two just remember when you plug in values or evaluate and you use your function you're finding those values according to your true x and y axis your key points are just a tool for you to graph this easily i hope you get that these key points are just in relation to your shifted axes the actual points here are zero zero and one comma negative two yeah sure and you can find more like that if you plug in two or evaluate for positive two um you do this you do three to the second power is nine then you have negative one times 9 that's negative 9 plus 1 is negative 8 so you plot 2 negative 8 from your true x y axis i hope that makes sense okay we have a couple more one thing about functions is they're they're really a lot easier to determine what's going on if they're in some sort of an order that we we can anticipate their their their transformations so when we have 1 minus 2 to the x plus 3 this doesn't look all that good make sure that we put this in order with your exponential first so i would put negative 2x 2 to the x plus 3 and then plus 1. the other thing that i'm going to do so that i don't get confused on my my vertical versus horizontal shift i'm going to put this in parentheses anything next to your variable in the exponent is going to be a horizontal shift it's affecting the input it affects a shift on the input axis anything afterwards should be a vertical shift that's why the order is important so that you can easily see this now the last thing i'm going to do i'm going to make absolutely certain that i know that my base is 2 and not negative two that negative is going to be that reflection again that's important for us to understand that this does not multiply by negative two on your outputs this did not multiply by negative three on your outputs it multiplied by negative one your base stays the same your base is three it's the negative that was affecting the output there same thing's going to happen here so we identified it's an exponential we maybe put it in a better form and now we show our key points our key points are 0 1 and one comma whatever your base is because your base is two we get one comma two then we start identifying our shifts i see here this is a vertical shift up one i also see that we have a horizontal shift left three from there from that that those dotted lines that don't really exist uh they're just given a really good picture of a horizontal asymptote where we're shifting and letting you plot your key points from it we're going to plot our key points so we're going to plot these things but we do have to manipulate them if we have something in front of our exponential so this was up one this was left three this was a base of two what that negative does that negative x like multiplying your output by negative one so we're going to take that negative we're going to say all right my inputs do not change but my outputs get reflected because they're being multiplied by negative 1. our base is not negative two that negative and this negative affect the outputs of those key points of that exponential with that base so from where we shifted we're going to say our key points are zero negative one here's zero zero here's zero negative one and one comma negative two from zero zero here's one comma negative two we still have a horizontal asymptote which is why we draw that dotted line and now we might wanna do something like find the true y-intercept so plug in zero evaluate for zero in either of these things zero plus three is three two to the third is eight and one minus eight is negative seven that's going to give us a much better picture of what truly happens so that crosses the y-axis and continues downward to negative infinity this graph and its base form of 2 to the x would be always increasing because we reflected it that's what this does this is always decreasing you should be able to look at this function once you write it appropriately and tell me the three transformations we have you should tell me this is a vertical shift a horizontal shift of left three and a reflection about the x axis that's what you should be able to do i hope that that is is being confirmed in your mind that that's right so that's about it now we're going to move on to the last example we have three times one half to the x i gotta give you a fraction you know me and we'll make sure that we understand everything about that so let's do it when we have an exponential it's important to first identify that it is an exponential and what the base is the base here is not one and a half you cannot multiply these that breaks the order operations just like you could not multiply these or like you could not multiply these that would break the order operations exponents happen before multiplication we talked about that so identifying our base our base is one-half now let's think about that if a base is one-half that means that our basic graph shape for an exponential should be decreasing we should get this picture in if before we start shifting things around we also can identify our key points key points for exponentials are always 0 1 and 1 comma whatever the base is now we can go ahead and identify transformations we don't have a vertical shift there's nothing being added after our exponential we don't have a horizontal shift there's nothing being added to our exponent or subtracted we do have a vertical transformation that that is a vertical stretch here so that three that's going to take and multiply our outputs by three well let's do that for our key points so one times three is three and one half times three is one and a half or three halves we don't change our inputs this does not affect our inputs anything affecting our inputs would be next to our x variable because that is our input variable so we did not shift up or down we didn't shift left or right so we're going to plot our key points based on that vertical stretch of 0 3 and 1 comma 1 and a half we still have our horizontal asymptote but notice what you keep going to do why i'm teaching it to you do you see how if you plot your key points there is no ambiguity you are you have to decrease to make this happen and if you have just a basic understanding of what these graphs look like it's not that bad so we understand this is exponential it should be decreasing unless i start reflecting it messing with it and it does we see that this thing is going to decrease if we wanted to be more accurate you might want to plug in something like negative 1. negative one here would give us one half to the negative one power that's two three times two is six so this would cross at or sorry across this would have a point at negative one six about right there still has to obey the horizontal asymptote that was not shifted that's about what this graph looks like and it's modeled very well on what we understand our base to be originally so it should be decreasing we didn't reflect it or anything like that it's still decreasing so i hope that you've uh you've picked up a lot about these exponentials how they graph that the transformations we're using are the same ones we've been using the key points are just a little different there's zero one and one one comma whatever your base is that's great you just have to identify your base i'm gonna come back with three i would call like a a little bit more difficult because we're dealing with e and we're going to see a reflection of the y-axis so hang on for that we got three more allied so two more not three more uh because i put a couple together i made extra hard and so i wanted to make sure that we can do it so anyhow we're going to get through two more examples of graphing exponentials this time with a base of e we'll see what that means we need to remember what e is e is approximately 2.7 it's not exactly 2.7 but we're going to use that to get a sketch of our graph so let's take a look at f of x e to the x plus 2 minus 1 please keep in mind that just because you have an e up there it's still an exponential that's not a variable it's just a constant number that's around 2.7 and we're going to graph exactly the same way so how should this graph look well because e is 2.7 about and that's more than one it should still be an increasing graph our a is still more than one we're just going to identify the shifts the same exact way plot with our key points the same way so because we have an exponential with a base of e we can deal with our key points our key points are still 0 1 and 1 comma the base it just so happens that our base is e and now we're going to identify our shifting also remember that it's pretty nice and a pretty good idea to put any numbers that are added or subtracted to your exponent inside parentheses it's going to clue your brain into the fact this is a shift to the left too so we're looking at saying this minus one is after exponential that's a vertical shift that's down one we also have this plus two that's next to our x variable in parenthesis that's a shifting on the horizontal axis plus means left two after that we've already identified our key points but we're gonna look in front and we're gonna make sure that nothing is affecting them so out here nothing's being multiplied there's no negative there's no reflection there's only two transformations here down one and left two so we're going to plot our key points in relation to this new where we shifted to axis we have a horizontal asymptote we show that that's great we're going to plot 0 1 so if this acts like 0 0 then this is 0 1 the true point is of course negative 2 0 and we're also going to plot 1 comma e now now 1 comma e think of e as 2.7 when you're doing this 1 comma e therefore would be 1 comma 1 2.7 that gives us a good approximation for where that point is it's not exact because we can't exactly plot e but we're close now how about the y-intercept if you wanted to do this take your calculator out and plug in or evaluate for zero the true zero where you're going to cross the true y-axis 0 plus 2 is 2. e squared's about 7.4 minus 1 is about 6.4 so this would cross the x-axis at about 6.4 keep in mind we have a horizontal asymptote that's been shifted down so you are going to cross the x axis here the only time you do with exponentials is if you shift them we still behave with that and that's about how that graph looks going to be climbing like we thought it was more steeply than 2 to the x because that's a larger number larger base than 2. that's what that graph should look like there now the last one so uh oh man that's really out of order it's really nasty let me show you a couple things to help you with this number one put it in order number two we're going to take a look at our base make sure that we find our key points and that this is based on an exponential so this is this is certainly an exponential we have a base of e so we're going to write our key points down it is in order and then we start to manipulate that exponent you see here's what we need in order for us to determine our transformations accurately number one we need an order we have that number two we need to see what the base is we know that number three we've got to make sure that our exponent has a positive x in it it needs that to identify what happens next to it and so that negative x plus one that's really awkward it's going to lead us to think it's a left shift when it's actually a right shift but you have to factor to do that so do you remember hopefully like five seconds ago i said put your exponent in parentheses well that's true but put your exponent in parenthesis so that your x is positive all right well let's try that so if i do that i'm going to factor that negative that negative does something for us and so does that negative 2 out front we are now ready to start identifying our transformations and there's a lot of them in here one two three there's five transformations right now and we'll talk about all of them and when to use them yeah that's a lot so the first thing that we're going to do is after we do order after we identify exponential after we write down our key points and after we put things in the correct structure so that we can identify our transformations we start showing them so that plus 5 that is after our function that is a vertical shift up 5. we are going to draw that then we look inside of our function so inside parentheses next to our our variable next to our x variable which um which anything that that is next that's going to act as a and an affecting of the x-axis so when we look at this there's two things going on number one inside the parentheses after you've factored it you need that x positive to identify this inside the parentheses that minus 1 is a shift to the right one okay what's that negative do if you remember from a long time ago that negative right there that is next to the x variable isn't it well the x is the input variable yeah but that negative 1 that negative looks like it's being multiplied by that input variable it is and that's exactly what's going to happen to our inputs so next to the input variable affects things on the input axis so that negative says i'm going to take your inputs and make them negative let that affect this so when we start changing our key points that's up five that's right one that right there says take your inputs and multiply them by negative one they essentially change the sign of your inputs zero can't but one can so one becomes negative one that is what that does and what that's going to do imagine this imagine take your inputs and change their sign it's going to reflect across the y axis we saw that earlier but that's happening again so vertical shift up five horizontal shift right one reflecting about the y-axis now this does two things we showed it one time but it does two things that is affecting the output of your key points and every point really this is saying take something plug it in yeah you're manipulating it e to that power is going to give you an output and that multiplies the output by negative two so take our outputs multiply by negative two so negative 2 times 1 is negative 2 negative 2 times e is negative 2 e you can approximate that with a calculator 2.7 times 2 is 5.4 negative is negative 5.4 ish so that we're gonna keep that in our head now what does that actually do up five right one reflect about the y that is a vertical stretch because it's more than one and that is reflecting about the x so this is about everything that you can have in a transformed graph we have a vertical shift horizontal shift a reflection across the y a reflection across the x and a vertical stretch you can't have both a vertical stretch or and vertical compression otherwise i would have showed that to you um but you can have one or the other and that's what we've done here so we've gone up five we've gone right one we have our key points all it's up to is a plot that's all you need to do if you follow my technique and you do your shifting with your dotted lines and you get your key points and multiply them correctly like i've shown you next to input input next to output affect your output and just plot those so if that acts like our origin then 0 negative 2 is right here and negative 1 negative 2 e remember negative 2 is about 5.4 but negative negative 1. according to where we say we think of our origin as acting negative one count one two three four five point four that's it we know we have a horizontal asymptote and because we used our key points we know that this graph it is an exponential right but think about this this graph has been moved around if that's a base of e it's been shifted up and right and reflected this way and this way this graph has to be increasing but behaving with these key points it's going to have to look like this your key points show that and you have a horizontal asymptote you can't do this because you fail to hit both these points you have to do this and meet that asymptote plugging in some more values would be nice so we could plug in negative one negative one into this function would give us either way you wanted to go this would give us negative one minus one is negative two that'd be positive two e squared we've already done that actually so e squared is seven point four negative two times seven point four uh that's like negative 14.8 plus five negative nine point eight so this would be negative one comma negative nine point eight it is down there it's it's kind of dramatic because we have that vertical stretch and it's e which is um two about 2.7 as your base i hope that i've made that one make sense there's a lot going on in that problem but i'm glad we did it because it shows you about as hard as it gets for graphing transformations we have everything in there i could think of so anyway i hope that you're doing well i hope this is making sense to you we're going to come back and we're going to talk about how to start solving exponentials before we get into the graphs of logarithms just so we have some place to to start with with what you can do with exponents exponentials hope it's making sense and i'll see you soon 

Transcript for: Solving Exponential Equations with Common Bases (Precalculus - College Algebra 54)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about a very special case on how to solve exponentials so we are kind of halfway through talking about exponentials and logarithms we're going to get to logarithms very shortly but we're going to talk about exponentials just to get our brains wrapped around a couple of ideas so here's what i want you to learn in this video number one in general why we have learned everything we've learned in this unit so talking about exponentials and logarithms and inverses and one-to-one functions and composition functions is so that we can make the following connections this is it this is a train of thought that we needed to know number one we learned about one-to-one functions so that we can discover inverses one to one functions have inverses we learn about inverses to know that when you compose two inverses of compositions with inverses they undo each other we learned about those things to discover that exponential functions are one to one therefore they're going to have this inverse we're going to call that inverse a logarithm and when you compose them an exponential and a logarithm will basically cancel each other out that's what we're going to to get to so this is a very very special case on what if you can shortcut that that that situation what if you can solve exponentials without logarithms and there is one time that you can do that it's if you can find common bases in an equation that has exponential expressions so in general and i need you to know this in general if you want to solve exponential equations you need logarithms that's a must unless we have this one special case where we can find common bases now why is it work well if you have an equation with exponential expressions and that's it all your terms or exponentials basically looks like this you have one exponential equal to another exponential if you can make it so that you have the same exact base on both sides of your equation we can make something happen we can say hey does it make sense that if this and this have the same base and these are equal the only way they can possibly happen is if the exponents are also equal and that's a statement that's the special case for solving exponential equations when you don't need logarithms is if and only if you have this these common bases here so if a to the x equals a to the y if our bases are the same in an equation then your exponents also have to be equal that seems pretty straightforward i hope but here's here's the point there's really nothing happening here uh there's no real math that you show like you you don't need to cross out the a's you can i love crossing stuff out but you don't have to this is just a blanket statement saying if you have an equation with your base is the same the exponents also have to be the same and take this for instance if you have 2 to the i don't know equals 2 to the third well the only way these can possibly be equal is if you have the same base here you have the same exponent here two to the third is eight two to what power gives you eight well two to the third would be eight so we'd say this question mark equals three well question mark's a really awkward way to write something we don't know why don't we use a variable and we can so we'd say hey if 2 to the x this thing i don't know equals 2 to the third then x would equal 3 in this case that's the only way to make this statement true is if those exponents are the same consider that our bases are the same so we're going to use that technique for a few examples just illustrating this you probably have seen something like this before i'm going to show you some special situations where you need to know what to do with fractions you need to know what what to do with some quadratics that are going to come out of these these equations but that's basically we're just digging a little bit deeper so long story made hopefully shorter is that with exponentials in general you need their inverse you need logarithms but there's one situation where we can avoid all that if we can make an equation have all exponentials with common bases and we get one exponent exponential on one side and another on the other side of an equation and with the same base then we can set our exponents equal let's practice so how about 2 to the negative x equals 16 to go those are our common bases that's true but sometimes we can manipulate this so that we get common bases that's the only way we're going to get around not having to have logarithms to solve exponential equations so 2 to the negative x 2 is a prime number we can't get any lower than that a sub base if you want to but 16 is not prime so we're going to think can i write 16 as the same base raised to some power the same base being 2. so i know that 2 to the negative x that looks really good 16 we can write as 2 to the fourth power and we see right away that this is the case that we're talking about if you can get an equation with the common bases then if 2 to the negative x equals 2 to the fourth the only way this is possibly equal is if our exponents are also equal now if our bases are not equal then that goes off the table we can't use that and then we need logarithms to figure it out but if you're basically the same the only way this equation is true is if your exponents are also equal and so if you if you need to show this man i don't i have to show something i just i just gotta cross it out you can do that but it's not it's not real math it's just using this principle right here that says base is the same exponents also have to be the same and then we can solve something that's much much easier can you do some of this in your head yeah yeah but i'm going to really encourage you not to because it's fairly difficult to do something like this in your head and it's really difficult to do something like that in your head and so finding the common bases and setting your exponents equal is very useful for us so cool we got this we set them equal if we divide by negative one then we get x equals negative four and that's actually true two to the negative negative fourth power or opposite negative fourth power is to the fourth and that is 16. let's go ahead let's move over here so we have another exponential equation this is where we have one exponential expression equal to another that's what we're looking for here we notice that we have a base of two and a base of four the first idea the easiest idea for us so that we don't have to go down logarithms is let's check and see if we can get common bases now with a base of two being a prime number we can't go any lower than that but a base of four that's different than two we can so here's the way that i'd like you to do this number one when you are going to to take some sort of a base and write it as a different base i need you to use parentheses and i also really really need you to write this exponent exactly the same way the most of the mistakes here in this in these cases they're not signatures only a few times in sign errors are the major thing uh one of the major things about this is students start losing exponents and students forget to distribute when you have to start changing bases and those are two really really important concepts so the way that we solve that we fix it is rewrite your your base in parentheses but then also do not forget to write your exponents so i'm writing my exponent first so i don't forget it when we get too wrapped up in changing this we tend to forget that so write it first and then look at the 4 look at your base let's try to write this as 2 the base we want to some power i know that 4 is 2 squared so this says 2 to the 2x minus 1 that's what we have this says this right here says 4 to the 3x plus 1. we're just writing it as 2 squared and then we all know we all know that when we take an exponent to an exponent we multiply well what that means for us is that when we have two to the second raised to three x plus one we're going to have to think of this in parentheses we're gonna have to think of this as two that's our exponent not our base our exponent raised to another exponent you need to distribute that so sure we get this 2 to the 2x minus 1. that's totally fine we did nothing that would change the base we'd have to but on the right hand side we've got 2 to the 2 times essentially times three x plus one that is two to the six x plus two not six x plus one we must distribute that it's an exponent times an exponent and because this is our entire exponent distribution is necessary if you need to write this as an extra step that's fine that's taking an exponent times an exponent and then you can really see the distribution but once we've done that once we've taken and found common bases this principle takes over and says hey if your bases are the same in an equation then your exponents are also equal they have to be in order to make this equation true or make it equal that also says that if you have more than two exponentials you're gonna have to have some way to combine them and if you can't then we need another technique for that this only works if you have one exponential expression equal to one exponential expression and then you can set your exponents equal bar in that very very special case we need other techniques for that if our bases cannot possibly be the same then we need logarithms for that so once we have it we say all right now that our bases are the same we know the only way that's true is if our exponents are also the same and this gives us something really nice to solve we're going to subtract 2x and we're going to subtract 2. so subtracting 2x from both sides gives us 4x subtracting 2 from both sides gives us negative 1 minus 2 is negative 3 if we divide by 4. x equals negative three-fourths so that's about what we're doing here i'm going to start going into some special situations that we can get like with fractions what to do with those but that's essentially what we're doing we're finding common bases and setting our exponents equal when we get further on into this when we get to where what happens if this is a 2 and that's a 5 can you possibly get a common base no and we would not try any of this stuff we'd go directly to the inverse of an exponential remember i'm trying to build out in your head what that's going to be okay we haven't got there yet but i'm trying to build up that if these are not able to get common bases you're going to go directly to the inverse of an exponential which is a logarithm so right now this is a real special case if you can get these to be the same base cool do it it's really easy or easier than logarithms but if you can't you're going to need the inverse you're going to need logarithms for exponentials all right let's move on if you ever get fractions and you're trying to do this technique what we're going to do right away is we're going to get common bases but for every fraction that you have make sure that you write that as a negative exponent so save you so much time and a lot of headaches so fractions are going to equal negative exponents for these exponential expressions and exponential functions so let's take a look at we have 25 and we have something with a 125 and go man that's that's really lousy i don't like that that's nasty these are not the same let's try to look at these under this lens and say let's try to get some common bases out of it if i think about 25 and i think about 125 um try to write the bigger one as an exponent of the smaller one so here we were able to write 16 as 2 to some power that was 2. 4 as 2 to some power the bigger one is as a and exponent of the smaller can i write 125 as a power of 25 well no i could like 625 is 25 squared so so no what that also means is this little caveat here you don't always necessarily need to get down to the smallest prime number base sometimes you don't have to do that if this had been four then i wouldn't have to break both of them down to two if this had been four and not 2 then i could have said this is 4 to the negative x and 16 would be 4 squared and i would set those equal to one another you don't always necessarily have to get down to a prime number base to make this work just any common base will do in this case we go well i can't really write 125 as 25 to a power but i could write both 25 and 125 as 5 to some power so we're going to go through that we're going to say all right 25 to the x plus 3 i'm going to think i'm rewriting my base i'm going to number one first show that i have my same exponent i'm going to write that right there so i don't forget i don't lose it i'm taking my 25 and i'm thinking in my head let's find a common base between 125 and 25 and that would be a power 5. so i'm going to write this as 5 squared this means the same thing here's my same exponent here's 25 written is 5 squared we're good to go i'm going to do the same thing with 125 i'm going to think how how is 125 at power of 5 well it's 5 to the third power so we've just rewritten this with a common base that's the idea take a look at what your bases are this is the base think of fractions as something over the basis you want so 25 and 125 both have a base of 5 somehow 500 5 to the second power 5 to the third power and now with every negative exponent i'm sorry with every fraction that you get after you've written them as an exponent write them as a negative exponent so we can always on one fraction change a power to a negative exponent by moving it from a numerator to a denominator or from a denominator to a numerator so we can do that here too so instead of 1 over 5 to the third we can think of this as 5 to the negative 3rd power consider that this is the same thing five to the negative third power is one over five to the positive third power so again if you see fractions sure get a common base but then write them as a negative exponent it makes everything a lot nicer we see it right now after we take care of this side so 5 to the negative 3rd power that's good to go on the left hand side we have an exponent raised to another exponent if you want to write this out like it did over there an extra step that's fine you don't have to we can think about this as distribution this would be 2x plus 6 but we do absolutely need to distribute this is really what we're doing taking an exponent times another exponent and then that causes us to have to distribute so we're going to get this 5 to the 2x plus 6. equals five to the negative third power now we see why we use that negative exponent if we hadn't it's really awkward to understand what's going on here with the denominator so if we write that as 5 to the negative third power we see oh this is perfect is exactly what we want we've got 5 here we've got the same base and the only way this equation can possibly be true is if we have common bases we also have equal exponents so our 2x plus 6 equals negative 3 gives us something really nice to solve if we do solve that we're going to subtract six and dividing by two x equals negative two ninths no we don't negative nine halves you can put negative four in half if you really want to but it's fine to leave that as an improper fraction in fact um that would show you that this is going to be some sort of a radical expression anyhow with our our exponentials so i hope that makes sense to you um i really want to make sure that you understand that the concept of get your bases the same and if you don't have that you will need logarithms it's it's a must so here cool yeah we got 5 squared 5 to the third but that was a special case that had been 27 this won't work uh we could have done three to the to the third and five to the third but those would not be the same base and when we get down to here we get stuck so we need something else beside that all right we're going to work our way through three more examples a little bit tougher a little bit more more in this than we had in the first few examples so a little more complicated really but just remember our goals so our goal is whenever you see an exponential equation i'm trying to build these categories in your head if you can find common bases great set your exponents equal but we have a very stress case there you have to be able to get one exponential equal to another one with the same exact base and then set your exponents equal if you do not have that the second category is you're going to have to use logarithms somehow so in your head right now common bases great exponents equal and you have to have two exponentials one on one side one on the other that's it but if that's not the case logarithms we haven't made it there yet so let's take a look at it are we going to be able to write all three of these exponentials as one common base if that's true then we can start combining our exponentials and that's great that's not a problem we know that when common bases are multiplied you can add exponents and that's a really good thing if not then we're going to have to use logarithms somehow so we look at 9 and 27 and 3. 3x is your base here can i write all of those as one base take a look at your smallest base and see if you can write the larger ones as some sort of a power of that so i'm looking at 9 i'm looking at 27 i'm looking at 3 3 is the smallest one can i write 9 as the power of 3 yeah it's 3 squared can i write 27 is the power 3. yeah it's 3 to the third and so we're going to take a moment we're going to do that i'm going to start with my 3 i'm going to remember that 3 has a power of 1 so that's going to be important because that's a fraction we're going to be writing that as a negative exponent in just a moment i'm also before i do anything here going to write my exponent and my ex so i don't forget about it so i know that 9 to the 2x i have my 2x 27 of x squared i've got my x squared and this is 1 over 3 to the first i have my 3 to the first then i go inside i rewrite 9 and 27 as these powers of 3 9 is 3 squared and 27 is 3 to the third but because of the way we wrote this in parentheses and with our exponents already up there it shows us that we're going to have to multiply this so this represents 9 but to the 2x power we know that we would get 3 to the 4x power 2 times 2x is 4x 27 is 3 to the third and we're raising that to the x squared power but because we have an exponent raised to an exponent we're multiplying this is going to become 3 to the 3 times x squared whenever you get a fraction and you're going to use this technique of evaluating the or sorry solving these exponential equations with common bases make sure that you write any sort of fraction as having a negative exponent so this would be 3 to the negative 1 power that puts everything almost on the same level if you will where we have same base same base same base now this looks really good but but the only way this technique works is if you have one exponential equation equal to another however the great thing about using this common base technique is if you can get common base bases and all of your in all of your expressions here that are multiplied or divided you can combine them so 3 to the 4x power times 3 to the 3x squared power you can combine those remember this that if you ever had x squared times x to the fifth you can combine those and make it x to the seventh you can add exponents but this leads to a really really common mistake you can probably see it i've seen this so many times where students go oh this is fantastic i can combine these i see it very very often it is so common for us to see multiplication and really really want these two exponents to be multiplied but that's not what happens x to the second times x to the fifth gives us x to the seventh not x to the tenth we add two plus five three to the x 4x times 3 to the 3x squared we're going to get 3 to the x 3x squared plus 4x we need to add those exponents do not multiply this is completely wrong so common base is being multiplied we know that what we do with exponents is one level below what we see so if we see multiplication operationally we're going to be adding them if we see division we operationally subtract if we see exponents we operationally multiply so we've been doing here anyway we saw an exponent raised to an exponent that's an exponent level idea but one level below that is multiply so that's what we're doing here we're doing one level below what we're seeing one level below multiplication is you need to add those exponents it looks a little bit more awkward but this is exactly what we want we have an exponential equation we have the same exact bases and we have just two exponential expressions one on one side base three one on the other side base three that's great the only way these can possibly be equal is if our exponents are also equal so this is the place this is what we want to this is where we want to be essentially we want to be at the spot where we can say same bases exponents are also the same and now we get into something that sometimes we just forget what to do with if you ever have a power two or larger in an equation it's not a direct solving it's something where you need another technique and that's going to either be a square root method or factoring some sort of a formula like difference of squares something you're going to have to use in order to solve this if you have power ones like we had some of our earlier examples that's just fine we can solve them directly by subtracting a smaller variable adding or subtracting a constant and dividing but if you have a power 2 or higher try factoring so we're going to get everything on one side in order first turn positive and we're going to factor because we're really good at factoring we know that we can put a four and a three that's three times one one and three add to four multiply the three if i divide by my a and simplify one third doesn't simplify three or three simplifies to one over one that's one x plus one that's three x plus one and that actually works here's three x squared plus one plus three x that's four x and n plus one and if we set both of those equal to zero by the zero product property then x equals negative one and x equals negative one third we get our two solutions there so i hope that's making sense i hope you're seeing that the technique doesn't change i'll be just a little bit more involved here and if you have more than one exponential expression on one side you need to combine it you need to have just one equals one exponential expression in order to set your exponents equal sometimes that takes some exponent work just remember what you do with exponents is one level below what you see so if you see exponents raised to exponents you're not powering them if you will you're multiplying them if you see multiplication or division you should be adding or subtracting your exponentials if you see addition subtraction well wait a minute there's nothing below those so you don't do anything with your exponents which means y that's why you can't add or subtract your non-like terms let's say the same column all right let's move right along so we have this next one that's really nasty it's got a fraction it's got three different exponential expressions two are multiplied if you do have any that are added or subtracted so you might get to those we'll deal with those a little bit later those are typically a substitution idea so this is what this is what you get when you can combine in situation one exponential equal to another that's the only way that these common base solving by common bases work is if you can do that if not if you have more than that more than just one term this is still one term it just has two factors that you can combine if you have more than one term typically it's a substitution or some other technique so let's look at it we've got two terms but three exponential expressions we've got a base three we've got a base three notice to the seventh power but that is a base three just happens to be a denominator that's okay we deal with that and we get a base 27 so we're going to look at this and identify our smallest base is 3. i've got it a couple times that's really good can i write the larger base or bases as that smaller one can i write 27 as a power 3 sure so what if you could well you combine what you could and then you'd use logarithms for what you can't and anyhow if you don't have those common bases we have a 3 to the x squared and we don't need to simplify that times out whenever you get fractions and i could have given this different right i could have given this like the 125 and made you think about that's 5 to the third and then that would be 1 over 5 to the third so 5 to the negative 3rd power we just did that i couldn't give this to you as the number three to the seventh it's just a fairly large number and so i don't want to think about that so i could give that to you as a number just keep that in mind you'd have to change this to a base of three and then say hey this is one over three to the seventh but that's a fraction i like fractions can i write this as a base on the same level as the other bases to a negative exponent the answer is yeah we can do that that's appropriate that's what we want to do to get rid of those fractions they're very hard to deal with otherwise on the right hand side we are going to immediately write down that exponent we don't ever want to lose that but the 27 we're going to change so 27 needs to be written as 3. to the third power to still represent 27 but to also say i want the same base so i can use this technique if that didn't work if that was not a three there well then we'd have to combine these two and use logarithms and now we're going to simplify a little bit more we know that an exponent raised to an exponent we're going to one level below we're going to multiply those and that's 6x we also know this common base technique where we set exponents equal only work if we have one exponential on each side that looks good this doesn't so we have common bases that's great and this would not work if we didn't but if we have common bases we know that when we multiply these expressions with common bases we need to add our exponents multiplication that's the operation you see one level below that addition is what you do with the exponents and so we're going to keep our base the same that doesn't change that's how exponent rules work you keep the base the same all the math is done with your exponents if we add those x squared plus negative 7 is x squared minus 7 equals 3 to the 6 x this is what we want i'm going to say it one last time this is it but if these were not the same number you would have done exactly the same thing until you got down to here you went i wouldn't actually even have to do anything with this but you would have done this until you got here let's say that was like a four or something then logarithms would come in that would be the inverse and you'd have to do it that way here this is a special case we have the same bases that's great if you have the same bases and two two exponential expressions one on each side of your equation the only way that's true is if your exponents are also equal we see another power too that means that we're gonna have to use some technique uh beyond just solving for x directly we're gonna need to factor this so let's get everything on one side every time you see a power two or higher this is your your technique everything on one side and then check it out so by checking it out i mean how do we solve that can we factor it can we do quadratic formula is there another technique we have square root method different squares something like that so here we'd say yeah that factors looks like negative seven one that adds to negative 6 that multiplies to negative 7 because our a is 1 is a nice factorization for us and if we use the zero product property we get two solutions out of it we get x equals seven we get x equals negative one so i hope this makes sense i hope you're seeing the technique getting your fractions to be negative exponents combining your your like bases or your common bases appropriately and making sure we don't lose those exponents and keep in the back in mind that you know if if you're not able to get those common bases we have something else later that i'm going to teach you all right we get the last one and even though it has those ease in there this is actually a little bit easier and the reason is because there's no argument what kind of common base you're going to have it's given to you you have a base of e and you're not going to have to manipulate hardly any of it the only thing that we have is that 1 over e to the 1 over e squared to the second power we're going to change that that's a fraction we always want to take our bases that have that are within our fractions and make them a base to a negative exponent other than that this is pretty straightforward this is really nice we see right away that we're going to be able to use the common base technique so e to the x squared great e to the 3x no problem remember e is just a number it's like any other number it just happens to be written as e it's 2.7 well it's like any other number it's it's a transcendental but um and then it's not a fraction doesn't doesn't ever terminate but it is still a constant and so we can write this as e to the x squared e to the 3x and e to the negative 2. it's just a number they're just exponentials and now you have the same base and they're on the same level nothing in fractions that's really good the next thing we're going to do is understand that in order to use our technique we need one exponential equal to one exponential this is great this is not because we have common bases being multiplied we know that we can add our exponents together and create one exponential what that means when we're adding this is e to the three x times e to the negative two is the same thing as e to the three x plus negative two or three x minus two and that's what we're looking for we're looking for with this technique two exponentials same base and that means your exponents also have to be equal in order to satisfy this equation so when we solve this we're noticing the power 2 this is going to be another factoring equation so if we subtract 3x we add our 2 we can factor it nicely negative 2 and negative 1 add a negative 3 and they multiply to positive 2. so those are our factors so x squared minus three x plus two we set each of those equal to zero by zero product property we solve them straight down we get 2 and 1. you notice i haven't been doing this very often but i'm going to show you right now that you can actually check your work here it does work i haven't shown it to you that's kind of on you but you can't do it if i take 2 and evaluate it this would be e to the fourth equals e to the sixth times one over e squared remember that if i were to divide those i would subtract e to the sixth over e squared would be e to the fourth e to the fourth equals e to the fourth or i would have first power this would be e to the first e to the third and e to the one over e to the second e to the third over e to the second will give you e to the first they do work you can check them in these equations that's just fine the other thing i wanted to tell you was what if you were able to what if you're able to get all the way down here and then you set these exponents equal and you get something that's not factorable firstly try again because almost always these things are factorable but if they're not we already know that if you have a quadratic that's not factorable well then you can do the quadratic formula don't be afraid of that so this is really the technique i'm showing you is how to get down to right here and then say oh my exponents are equal done if this doesn't work i'm going to teach you logarithms in a while but this technique of setting exponentials equal this opens up the door for anything else to happen so what i mean is if you set your exponents equal and you can't you get everything on one side you can't factor it well you might have to do quadratic formula you might have to do man this would be just nasty but you might have to do something like uh rational zeros theorem if it's not factorable you power three or higher it's not factorable that's a potential i doubt you're ever going to see it but keep in mind that these are all factorable to keep it nice they don't have to be but the technique is if you have exponentials one way to solve them is to get two exponentials on on one on each side with the same base and set your exponents equal if that does not happen or you can't make it happen you need another technique typically you'll have more than one more than one term on each side you need a substitution and then eventually if you can't get common bases you will need logarithms that wraps up everything i really want you to know about solving these exponential equations with common bases as far as i really want to go next time what we're going to do is we're going to start talking about what a logarithm is we'll start taking that graph of an exponential we will find the inverse of it and then we'll say that's the graph of a logarithm and what logarithms do so we'll graph logarithms we'll talk about how to solve logarithms and we'll talk about how they're inverse of an exponential i hope you're hanging with me i hope you enjoyed the video i'll see you for another one soon 

Transcript for: Introduction to Logarithms and Their Graphs (Precalculus - College Algebra 55)
hey welcome to another video we gotta get on today we gotta finally put things together and go from exponentials to something called logarithms not just how to do it i'm gonna show you why i'm gonna show you why this stuff comes about where logarithms come from and how they are inexorably linked together where you can't get away from these things that are joined because they're inverses we're going to learn about that today right now so what i intend to do in this video is teach you where a logarithm comes from why they have to exist what the graph looks like then because we know the graph looks like it because they exist we'll see what the structure is from an exponential trying to solve for an inverse after that we'll talk about the domain how to find the domain of a logarithm how the argument always has to be positive why that is graphically and then we'll graph just a few examples to get the feel for how transformations would work with logarithms so here we go let's take a look back at what exponentials are something that we should be very familiar with we've seen this in a couple of classes now and we see this in a couple videos ago that these exponential functions whether a is above one or below one creates something has some key points that we understand some domain that we understand some range that we understand so let's take a look at that whenever we get an exponential function we understand that before we shift around before anything like that we have some some very important features we understand that every one of these exponentials goes to the point 0 every single one of those is going to go through that point because when we evaluate for 0 any base constant base to the 0 power is going to give us 1. we also know that they all go through the point 1 comma a we know this because if we evaluate for one then the base to the first power gives us back that base so one comma a if a is above one if a is more than one then one comma a will be vertically more than this point and if a is less than one vertically one comma a will be less than this point which is what gives us this increasing or decreasing graph for exponentials is why they look a little bit different we also know that each and every one of these has a horizontal asymptote somewhere if we haven't shifted it it's right on the x-axis y equals zero that's important we know that the domain we can plug in anything anything to an exponential and we have no domain issues whatsoever so from negative infinity to positive infinity this thing is continuous and has no domain restrictions whatsoever however if you take a base that's positive and you take it to any exponent positive or negative you can't ever get out a negative so our range is not all real numbers our range is from zero to infinity but this is important this is something to focus on because when we get logarithms the domain of logarithms we're going to see that you cannot have zero in the argument y stems from right here you cannot ever get out a zero in an exponential equation or sorry function this is because this never actually touches zero you can't ever touch you can't cross it we can't ever get out negatives or zero from an exponential what that's going to turn into is we can't ever plug in negatives or have an argument that is negative or zero in a logarithm and see why that is so that's a recap of what exponentials are now here's the main point main point of an exponential is if you take a look at that graph and apply the horizontal line test this thing is not only a function but a one-to-one function and we learned something in inverses that every one-to-one function has to have an inverse what's that mean that means that this function which is one to one and this function which is a one to one they're both exponentials also have to have inverses so we thought about that we said okay well what's the graph of an of an inverse really look like if this is an exponential it's one to one it has an inverse we should be able to graph it if the graph of this exponential looks like this then the inverse is going to be a reflection across the y equals x line well that's true and in fact we know how to find inverses just by reversing the x and y coordinates you need that part of that that lesson when we talked about inverses to to get this right now so main concepts are every one to one function has an inverse the graph of an inverse is the reflection across the y equals x line how to find points is to reverse the x with the y so get this we know exponentials have an inverse pretend we didn't even name this as a logarithm yet someone somewhere would have said okay that's a one-to-one function great it's got to have inverse fantastic we can graph this inverse all right what are we going to call it i don't know um and we called it a logarithm a long time ago when these things were discovered and so when we take a look at this as a one-to-one function that has an inverse if we want to reverse our key points it's going to give us a really solid graph of a logarithm check this out if every exponential has 0 1 then every inverse of an exponential we're going to call this a logarithm in a minute every inverse of an exponential is going to have the point 1 0. if every exponential has this point 1 comma a then every inverse of an exponential is going to have this point a comma 1. now here's where it's important understand that our a is more than one if this is going to have the point a comma one if a is more than one then a is going to be located over here somewhere this is the point a comma one where our a is more than one what if they had been less than one it would be over here and we're going to see that on that graph over there and this is the point one comma zero one last thing if your exponential has a horizontal asymptote and we're switching x and y so think about this if you have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero then if you switch x and y you'll have a vertical asymptote at x equals zero and that's also true more than that if this is a horizontal asymptote on let's call it the negative x-axis then this would have a vertical asymptote on let's call it the negative y-axis and we can graph this if we think through that this is a reflection across y y equals x then this exponential which is one-to-one which has to have an inverse which is found by switching x and y and along with our horizontal into a vertical asymptote this graph has to look like this and that's about as close as i can make it to represent the inverse of an exponential so here is the big idea this was an exponential that had to have an inverse and we just crafted so we knew it had to because it was a one-to-one function had to have an inverse function we just did it we said all right yeah reflection across y equals x let's switch some key points 0 1 becomes 1 0 for the inverse 1 comma a becomes a comma 1 for the inverse horizontal asymptote on the negative x axis becomes vertical asymptote on the negative y axis cool if a is more than one then a should have a key point more than one comma one this is the graph of the inverse of an exponential we know it exists we even have a picture of it we can do the same thing over here i'm gonna move a little bit quicker but but check it out if this is a one-to-one function it's also an exponential just happens to have a less than one every exponential has key points of zero one and one comma a why this decreases because one comma a where a is less than one has an output below one that's why that looks the way that it does so if that's one-to-one it also has to have an inverse and the graph of that inverse has to be reflection across y equals x we also have to be able to reverse our points so x becomes y y becomes x and the horizontal asymptote changes to a vertical all right well what would that look like if this graph has 0 1 then the inverse should have 1 0. please notice as we're going through this we're getting exactly the same points it's going to look different because the a is less than 1 but both of these have a key point at 0 1 for exponentials and therefore one zero for the inverse so one zero if this has a key point of one comma a then we're gonna have a key point and inverse of a comma one but because a is less than one if the key point is a comma 1 and a is less than 1 it's going to be between 0 and 1. this would be the point a comma 1 and this is the point one comma zero so zero one becomes one zero for the inverse one a becomes a one for the inverse except a is less than one so it's gotta be it's gotta be positive right it's gotta be somewhere between zero and one and give us out one also one more thing this is going to look a little funny because this original function our exponential crosses the y equals x line well what that means is that the inverse is also going to cross the y equals x line and it's going to be at the point where they intersect because that point of intersection when you switch x with y would give you the same input and output it would cause that to just reflect and still be on that that that line of symmetry finally if we have a horizontal uh asymptote at y equals zero so on the positive x-axis then we're going to have a vertical asymptote for the inverse on the positive axis and here's what this graph looks like they look similar because you have a graph that is being reflected but like almost has the same sort of shape but notice how they are distinctly different your exponential decreases and your logarithm does decrease but they have different things about them your exponential you still have a domain of all real numbers you can plug in anything in this function no problem and you have a range from zero to infinity no problem you only get out positives but look at your logarithm your logarithm has a domain that's purely positive you cannot have an argument that is negative or even zero but you can get out all real numbers your domain and your range i hope that this makes sense to you are also going to switch everything about a function and its inverse switch domain becomes range range becomes domain y's become x's x's become wise horizontal asymptotes become vertical vertical become horizontal that's what happens with inverses your key points reverse themselves and we're going to see that right now so this is the graph of our our logarithm as it comes from this one-to-one function called an exponential so we we took a look at it said exponentials are one to one they have to have inverses and we graph those inverses if that's the case if we if we know that our graphs look like this and every single one of these logarithms is going to have a vertical asymptote and every single one of these these inverses of an exponential let's call it have a a key point at zero one i sorry say that one that wrong at one zero because it came from key point zero one so at one zero and if every one of these inverses of an exponential has a key point of a comma one in this case a is more than one and in this case a is less than one then every one of our logarithms is going to look inverses of an exponential is going to look one of these two ways for a that is greater than one with this vertical asymptote if a is more than one we get this picture it's always increasing if a is less than one we get this picture always decreasing very very much like our exponentials exponentials were always increasing or always decreasing depending on whether a was greater than 1 or less than 1. i hope that i've explained this in a way that makes sense to you i hope that i've shown you the key points many people do not really fully grasp where a logarithm comes from where the inverse of an exponential comes from and is called a logarithm so they just kind of go through math and go oh there's things called exponentials there's this thing called logarithms and they miss the point they just pass it right by they don't get it what i try to do in the beginning of this video is show you where they come from so we're about to call the inverse of this exponential a logarithm so we'll do that a minute but for right now i wanted you to understand that the main points the main points were every exponential is one to one and therefore had to have an inverse we found the inverse we took the key points reversed them domain became range horizontal became vertical asymptotes with a greater than one we had an increasing and then still increasing graph but it was reflected across y equals x and the decreasing was still decreasing but reflected across y equals x we know a lot about this we know that for every single one of our inverses we'll be able to say what the domain is what the range is what the key points are but we have to call it something if i were to do this and say that's a one-to-one function and we should be able to find the inverse how do we find inverses algebraically well we we replace it with y we switch our y into an x this is better this god makes sense to you like we've done this right we know this this is how we find inverses and x becomes y so we'd say the thought process long time ago was one to one one to one here's the graph of it no problem here's the graph of this one no problem if we're supposed to be able to find an inverse so we should be able to do it algebraically so function replace that with y the y changes to an x the x changes to a y and then what are we supposed to do well we're supposed to solve for y and you'd get here and you'd go yeah great um how do i how i'm supposed to solve for y i can't divide i can't multiply i can't add i can't subtract uh i can't would you take a y th root or something on both sides but then your variable's over here somewhere like i don't i don't want to put a radical with the index of y it might be really really stinky awkward like we don't want to do that so how in the world am i supposed to solve for y which is what is necessary to find the algebraic representation of the inverse function here we have to solve for y and so what people did is they said i know this thing exists we just proved it graphically we know the horizontal line test says we have to have an inverse but there's nothing mathematically that we have that would solve for y already a logarithm says if you have an exponential you can change this into what is called logarithmic notation and so we would say here's what logarithms do they solve for your exponent in some sort of an exponential that's all they do what a logarithm does is it separates the base from the exponent and exponential notation puts it back together so if we have an exponential what your logarithm is going to do it's going to say here's your exponent your logarithm is going to separate your base from your exponent notice where the exponent went where the base went basement is what's called a base for a logarithm it's the same word it's the same base this is what a logarithm does this is the inverse of some exponential with the same base some really fascinating things happen with logarithms such as when you compose it with an exponential they cancel if they have the same base we're going to see all these properties as we move forward into logarithms but this is the main concept of what they what they do so i'm going to write out now some of the key things for for logarithms we'll see how this stuff switches around and then we'll get into domains and graphing okay so here we go when we whenever we find an inverse from a root function what happens is all of our x and our y junk they they switch and so if we take a look at our graphs and we acknowledge what our exponentials have we're going to see a lot of similarities but they're they're reversed what i mean by this is your domain for an exponential was all real numbers nothing you couldn't plug in that's going to be your range for your logarithms notice how we can get out our ranges from negative infinity to positive infinity this will eventually slowly get to positive infinity same thing as as this our range here is from negative infinity to positive infinity this will eventually cover the entirety of the y-axis so our domain for our original function becomes our range for our inverse our domain for exponentials become our range for our logarithms so we get out all real numbers for our range now take a look at your exponential our exponential said you can't get out everything for an exponential in fact the outputs only cover from zero to infinity but not including that zero due to the fact we had a horizontal asymptote okay what that what's that mean for the inverse for the logarithm if we can't get out everything we can't plug in everything for the logarithm of the inverse we don't get out anything but 0 to infinity that means that the argument inside of our logarithm can't ever be anything but 0 to infinity we cannot have negatives you cannot even have zero our domain here is zero to infinity take a look at what we can plug in there is nothing on this side of the x-axis you cannot plug in a negative oh look at that vertical asymptote you can't even plug in zero we know all about vertical asymptotes now you can't even allow this this is unallowable it's undefined you cannot have zero as an input of your logarithm it is undefined in both of these cases they both have vertical asymptotes and they both only have inputs that are allowed to be on the positive x-axis that's okay that comes from the domain of our exponentials it's expected now our key points we saw this as we're going through the graphene key points here are 0 1 2.4 both of your logarithms are 1 0. key points for your exponential are 1 comma a switch that around key points for your logins are a comma 1. the reason why these graphs look different is because of this point they both go through one zero just like both of your exponentials went through zero one they both go through the point a comma one a comma one just like your exponentials went through one comma a but the difference becomes if your a is more than one then a comma one is a point greater than one up to one and if a is less than one this is a point a is less than one up to one so less than one up to one that's why they increase and why they decrease lastly because our original functions or exponentials had a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero these are going to have a vertical asymptote at x equals zero and that's about it the main the key point that i need you to know right now is that these graphs come from exponentials logarithms are the inverse of some exponential with the same base a huge point the next thing i need you to understand is the domain you may never plug in a value that causes the argument we said we call that the the inside of your logarithm sometimes the argument we can never allow an input that causes that to be negative or even zero it must be strictly positive it's a very optimistic function it's always positive you can only plug in values that cause this thing to be positive okay that that's a must it must do now the outputs can be negative sure absolutely the outputs can but the inputs must always cause the argument what's inside the logarithm to be positive we're going to practice finding domain but those are some notes that you're going to want to make before we can talk about graphs before we can talk even about domain we do need to understand how logarithms work how we can change from exponentials to logarithms and logarithms exponentials this will get you used to the idea of what a logarithm does and what a logarithm looks like so what we learned in just the first part of this video is that exponentials do have an inverse and we call that a logarithm what should they do they should undo each other so here's what i want in your head this is very important this is what i want you to understand what a logarithm will do is it will take an exponential and it will pull it apart so it will take the base and the exponent and put them on opposite sides of an equation it will solve for the exponent that's what logarithm does it separates the base from the exponent what an exponential will do is take a logarithm and put it back together it will take the base and exponent and put it in an exponential notation so we can go backwards and we can go forwards on these we're going to practice that right now we'll also learn about something called a natural log and a common log if you haven't seen them or if you've just forgotten about them so here's what happens if we have some exponential notation i'm going to walk through this very quickly this should be review for you but i'm just doing the courtesy of getting used to it again so that way i can talk about it at length so this and this and this and this and this would all be called exponential notation so when we look at it you have a base to an exponent equals some sort of an argument here so 3 squared is 9. or a to the third is 2.1 2 to the x is 7.2 our bases are 3 a and 2. 10 and e these are still exponential notation a base which is a constant raised to some sort of a power equals some number and same thing here 10 is our base raised to an um a power equals 2.3 what a logarithm will do is write this in a different notation and it will separate the base from the exponent so when we write these as logarithms here's what happens base gets written with the logarithm so log base 3 is how we say that not log of 3 that's a different um a different connotation and that's going to stand for something like a common log which we'll get in a second so we'd say log base 3 it's written as a subscript it's not on the same level as a log it's a subscript it's slightly below if you were to draw a straight line it looks like that log base three of nine equals two the nine and the two are the same level as the law of log base think about like in the basement log base three of nine equals two what has happened is the logarithm has separated the base from the exponent and put it on opposite sides of your equation and the 9 becomes the argument of the logarithm it says something a little bit funny it says it says what an exponential is sort backwards so what this exponential says is 3 to the second power is 9. what the logarithm says is 3 raised to what power will give you 9. or in order to get from 3 to 9 what power do you need well you need to why is it is strangely worded well that's kind of that that's how inverses work in general so you can say uh three plus five equals eight you can say that and that's probably the most straightforward way to say it but you could also say it with an inverse you could say 3 minus negative 5 is also 8. well that is true and that's using some inverses internet so that this is the inverse of addition and this is the opposite of five well you're you're so you're doing something along the same lines here logarithms will say the same thing but they'll say it in a different manner so because their inverse is almost like an opposite idea here 3 squared is 9 or 3 to 9 needs a power 2. or in order to get from 3 to 9 what power do i need i need power 2. so let's move on a little bit let's try to write all of these in logarithmic notation if i have a to the third power equals 2.1 our base is a our exponent is 3. what a logarithm is going to do is rip those things apart so let's say log base a that is our base for the exponential that is our base for our logarithmic notation our exponents three logarithms always separate those things and two point one becomes argument so log base a of two point one equals three start saying in your head as you're writing these things down to get used to the way we say these we don't want to say log of a of 2.1 because that log of is always going to have a base of 10. and we're going to see that when we get to common logs so we're going to say log base for other bases of whatever argument is equals whatever the exponent is logarithm separate based on exponent you should try this one and this one on your own right now if you haven't do that or do that right now so this it says 2 to the x equals 7.2 we know what our bases are base is 2. our exponent is x this is the standard type of exponential right these are a little bit not true exponentials there's exponential notation we're kind of moving around but this is a true exponential it has a base that's a constant a variable that is an exponent watch what happens when we put this into logarithmic logarithmic notation this is going to solve for our variable for us that's what it's supposed to do an inverse should undo its original root function so a logarithm should undo the exponential that's why a logarithm rips apart the base from the exponent it's going to put them on opposite sides of the equation it's going to solve for your exponent so with our log having a base of 2 from our exponential having a base of 2 our exponent of x your logarithm is going to put your base and your exponent on opposite sides and then it's going to have an argument of whatever your exponent whatever your exponential is equal to so log base 2 of 7.2 equals x let's solve for x for us that's what a logarithm does it will always separate your base from your exponent and put your exponent by itself on one side of your equation it'll always take what your exponential is equal to and treat it as an argument inside your logarithm your calculators will do this in a manner of speaking most of them have a base of 10 some of them like some casios i know of will allow you to plug in both a base and an argument some don't let you do that some will just have a base of 10 or base of b and i will give you a change of base formula to show you how that works but that's it now this other one well this is also an exponential like we we are used to where it has a base of 10 and x root of x if we put this in logarithmic notation where we let the logarithm separate the base from the exponent our base is 10 it's written as a subscript subscript log and 2.3 and x are on the same level you should be able to draw a line through that have them all be on this to that same line this is solved for x well that's great that's what an inverse should do it should solve stuff for us a logarithm will solve an exponential an exponential will solve a logarithm we're going to get to that we start solving these things it's going to be awesome but for right now we're just we're practicing and we're seeing this we're just getting used to it your calculator will do this the log button on your calculator will allow you to plug in 2.3 you can try it right now if you want to the log button on your calculator has a base of 10. in fact that base of 10 because we have a base 10 number system is so common we call it a common log this is a common log and in fact whenever you have a base of 10 you don't even write it when you say this you don't have to say log log base 10 you just say log of 2.3 and people will understand that you're talking about a base of 10 because this common log is log of 2.3 means we have a common log we have a base of 10. that's why it's so important to say log base whatever this is log base 2 log base a log base whatever log base 3 but here when we say log of 2.3 we are implying that that has a base of 10. this is called a common log so whenever you see log and missing your base it's not missing it it's just that you need to know that's a base of 10. the same thing happens here this is also an exponential it has a base that is a constant it's basis e that's 2.7 ish and then it's a number that doesn't end doesn't repeat for any length of time and we can use a logarithm to write this in logarithmic notation logarithms always do the same thing they take your exponential and they separate the base from the exponent for any true exponential it will solve for your exponent and let you solve that here it's already solved we know x equals this thing now what is this thing well it's not a variable it stands for a number it is a constant here log base e of 8 equals x says this is some sort of number and your calculator will actually handle it but you're not going to see log base e on your calculator written this way in fact you'll never see it again because this is called what is called this is what is called a natural log why is it called natural log because it's a log with the base of the natural number e called the euler number or the natural number is a constant that we call the natural number it's it's just e we just write it as e but if you ever see that base in a logarithm or have a logarithm with that base you're going to write it as the log with a base of a natural number or a natural log how we write that is with this ln so if you ever see or say or hear ln8 ln of 8 natural log of 8 what it says is you have a logarithm with a base of e please understand this is still a logarithm it is just like this okay it's a logarithm with the base of e we just don't write it if you ever have a base of it you're going to write ln that stands for natural log if you ever write any sort of if you ever see any ln and you change the exponential notation this has a base of e just like that has a base of 10. they're not missing they're just written certain ways because they happen so often that we get tired of writing e it happens actually happens probably more often than that one natural logs are incredibly common very very very common so now let's go backwards we've practiced going from exponential notation into logarithmic notation now we're going to go backwards let's practice if if a logarithm takes your exponential and separates the base from the exponent a logarithm should put it back together so when we identify this one important thing is to identify what your what your base is and what your exponent is so let me take a look at it if this is a logarithm my base is three and my exponent because it's a logarithm is negative two your base in your exponent are separated in a logarithm your exponential should put that back together now what this says kind of kind of strange it says in order to go from a base of 3 to 1 9 i would need a negative 2 as in my power on the 3. it says it backwards because it's an inverse your exponential should put that back together for you should say your base and your exponent get put back together on the same side of the equation and should equal your argument so 3 to the negative 2 equals 1 9 that actually makes sense 3 to the negative 2 power is 1 over 3 squared that is 1 9. so moving back and forth is really important for us we're going to start seeing that how about log base b of four equals two a logarithm has separated my base for my exponent so that's my base that's my exponent and exponential will put it back together now can you go further could you solve that yes you could but be a little bit careful when you're talking about logarithms your bases have to be positive they came from exponentials didn't they one of the key things here was that the base of an exponential had to be positive so if we ever see a base that is negative that is disallowed we can't have a negative inside of our our base just like we can't have a negative inside of our argument so keep that in mind all right you should probably try the next few of them just putting these putting these in exponential notation be careful on these two because they are common log and a natural log counter respectively here we have a logarithm logarithms have always set already separated the base from the exponents so if we identify those we've got a base of 2 we have an exponent of x an exponential will put that back together and give you 2 to the x equals 6. these last two there are the same things they they are just logarithms what i want you to notice especially on this one is that that argument's unsolved and your exponential will solve a logarithm for you if you need to solve it now this is already solved i mean this we really shouldn't be doing exponential notation but we're just practicing this i want you to notice that your exponential will solve that for you so let's go back to it we have ln 4 equals x is it a logarithm yeah of course a logarithm has a base yeah it's base is e we don't write it we'll never do that again but its base is e there so what the logarithm is done is separate the base from the exponent and exponential will rewrite that it will group your base to your exponent and equal whatever your argument is it puts it in a different form it says something different it says a base of e needs or what do you need in order to go from e to four as an exponent well you would need i don't know x this says e to the i don't know x equals four that's what that says so log of x equals 3 that implies a common log that implies a base 10. we don't write the base 10 but it does have a base in order to go from a logarithm to an exponential you're going to regroup your base from the exponent which has been separated so our base is 10 our exponent is 3 and that would equal x i asked you to know something i asked you to notice that this logarithm had a unknown argument this exponential solve for that so the the two things we're grasping one right now is firstly how to go back and forth from logarithms to exponential notation and exponential notation logarithms but the second thing i want you to be grasping here is that a logarithm will solve an exponential like that and an exponential will solve a logarithm why well because they're inverses and they have to that's what inverses do inverses undo their root functions so a logarithm has to solve an exponential an exponential has to solve a logarithm just like addition has to solve subtraction subtraction has to solve addition they work together to undo each other they work together even compositions already see it seem really cool when you compose a logarithm and exponential they're also going to undo each other we're going to start seeing that so come back with just uh one more way for you to kind of think through these before we get to graphing i hope that you don't breeze through this part of the video i hope that you really spent some time on it here's why this is going to start down our road to solving logarithms with exponentials it also will sort of fill in how to solve exponential logarithms but mostly how to solve logarithms with exponentials so how how in the world does it does it do that well it goes both ways actually but here's here's one thought on it can you think through what a logarithm means well enough to determine what these things equal i'm going to give you two ways to go about and do it the first way is really using some thought of what log of the masks these ask questions like if you have a log base 5 of 25 here's what it's asking you what power do you need to go from 5 to 25 remember this in a logarithm is always an exponent this is your base of some exponential this is always your exponent so this asks if i'm missing this what power do i need to go from 5 to 25 what i would need a power 2 and this is going to be a power 2. now what if your brain doesn't work that way if you go i what power do you need to go from one what power do you need to go from one third to nine my brain does not work that way how in the world am i gonna do that an exponential will solve it and i'll show you if you call that x and simply do exactly what i showed you the last part of this video where it said all right if that's a logarithm can i write this as an exponential yeah i would take base to exponent equals whatever my argument is but wait a second that looks a lot like an exponential where we can find i just do the math in my head where we can find common bases and if your bases are the same your exponents also must be the same now this one might have been pretty easy to do in our head but this one doesn't really seem that way now i can tell you it's negative 2 but it might be easier for you to do this and say if that's my base and then that has to be my exponent if i write these as common bases you know wait a minute common bases how do i get a common base with one third do you remember common bases do you remember that one-third whenever you see a fraction write it with a negative exponent nine you can write as three to the second power one-third you can write as 3 to the negative 1 power well that will lead you to 3 to the negative x equals 3 to the second as soon as you have common bases your exponents have to be equal and x equals negative 2 and that is true 1 3 to the negative 2 power would give you reciprocate and square it 3 to the second power which is 9. that's true statement how about this one how about this uh this common law log all that's got a base of 10 log of base 10 to the square root of 10 so what power do you need to go from 10 to the square root of 10 or 10 to what power gives you square root of 10. do you remember that a square root is a fraction of one half as an exponent so this is going to be one half 10 to the one half power would give you the square root of 10. could you do it a different way could you write this as an exponential and think oh my base is 10 this is separate in my base from my exponent if i know that 10 to the x power gives me an argument square root of 10 and i remember that square roots are fractional exponents of power over root then my bases are the same and x would have to equal one half the same sort of things are going to work here we're going to run through them really quickly try them in your head though before you start doing this technique try them in your head just think through it can you think 5 to what power gives you the cube root of 25 it might be valuable to think of 25 as 5 squared because 5 to the 2 3 power would give you power over root that'd be 5 squared inside of a cube root if that's not working for you yeah sure call this x an exponential will at least make it easier to think of these most of the time and especially if you have common bases base to the exponent remember longer than several bases from exponent exponential puts it back together 5 x equals 25 to the one-third power cube root is a one-third power if you need to find common bases then you need to write 25 as 5 squared and then we know up power to another power we multiply those and we can see that as soon as we have common bases our exponents are equal and that's a true statement 5 to the 2 3 power would give you 5 squared inside of a cube root that's five squared inside the cube root [Music] this one's really important i need to do on your own uh these two i'll walk through with you this one's really easy it leads us to to the idea of compositions but this one's kind of hard square root of three what power do you need to go from the square root of three to nine so basically you need to undo the square root and then square it again so undoing the square root of power two that would give you three then another power two would give you nine so two to the the second power to a second power that's a power four this answer is going to be four so we've thought through it if you would like you can write this as well logarithm separated base from power that is not right logarithms have separated the base which is a square root of 3 from the exponent which is x and puts it equal to your argument that's the exponential notation for this logarithmic expression now we'd have to find common bases so change your radicals let's make this three to the one half power cannot lose that x most of the time i write that first before i even deal with this and then 9 is 3 squared but if we do that then 3 to the one half to the x we know that we can multiply those exponents so 3 to the x over 2 equals 3 squared our bases are the same our exponents therefore must be equal and x has to equal 4 by multiplying by 2. all right now what about this one i told you that this is really a composition i really really want you to see it whenever you compose whenever you compose two inverses with the same base in the case of logarithms exponentials they will cancel out i'm going to prove it to you that i'm going to show it to you so firstly it's it's an absurd statement which is why not absurd um it's a redundant statement or a trivial statement maybe it's the best word which is why when you see the composition of an exponential logarithm they cancel out think about it this is a logarithm yeah it's got a base of e so if i wanted some really poor notation i'd write the base of e but wait a second this argument also has a base of e and it happens to be an exponential so we have composed check it out we've composed an exponential onto a logarithm with the same base whenever you do that or a logarithm onto an exponential the same base it doesn't matter whenever you do that these things are going to cancel you are going to get 3. because here's the statement this is asking e to what power gives me e to the third wait a minute e to what power gives you e to the third you just said it had a third power yeah e to the third power gives you e to the third power it's trivial because you've composed a function with this inverse and they're going to cancel they're asking kind of you to complete something that's already been completed and it's going to give you three now if you want to see this a little bit more detail you can do it this way you could say e to the x power equals our argument which is e to the third here's our base here's our exponent put them together equals our argument but can you see that's already completed common basis for you it's already done you're gonna get x equals three any time you see this an exponential inside of a logarithm of the same base those are going to cancel anytime you see an exponential with a logarithm inside with the same base in in the exponent place those are going to cancel also we're going to get those in properties or logarithms but i wanted you to see it here the last one before you can finally get on to some graphing and some domain because we're getting very used to how a logarithmic structure will be able to identify what the base is and we'll be able to identify what the argument is we need to know this one so log base 2 of 1 equals what let's look at it let's call that x what an exponential would do is take your base put it back together with your exponent and equal it to your argument that's what exponential notation does you should be very good at it right now going from logarithms to exponentials we already practiced a lot of going from exponentials to logarithms so now we go right oh wait a minute uh what does x need to be what what does x absolutely have to be to take two to some power and get one there's only one thing we can do there in fact this is one of the key points of our exponentials isn't it because we said every single exponential ever is going to have one two to what power gives you one translates to every exponential has a point zero one on it why because we know that anytime we take a base that's a constant to an exponent that's zero base to zero is going to give you one any exponent to the zero power is going to give you one that translates to this please get this if any exponent to the zero power is going to give you one any logarithm of one is going to give you a zero every single time this is why no matter what the base was we had a key point on our logarithms of one comma zero do you remember that we'd always have one comma zero for our logarithms it was a key point for us why if an exponential gives you zero one because you plug in zero you get one no matter what whatever base you have then any logarithm is going to give you one zero because for any logarithm you plug in one you're going to get that that zero it says your base raised to a zero power is going to give you one no matter what no matter what base you have two so what if that wasn't a base two if it was a base three or square root of three or five or i don't care what this is this is going to be true that's why 0 1 is on every exponential graph and one zeros on every logarithm i hope that makes sense to you this is going to be one of our properties of logarithms as well when we get there but i wanted you to understand that because it solidifies one of our key points of one zero for every logarithm regardless of what your base is let's come back and we'll do some domain and then we'll talk about some graphs very quickly okay let's learn about some domains of logarithms there's one thing we learned we took a look at the graph the beginning this video that said if your range of your exponentials from zero to infinity so basically just positive then your domain for logarithms has to be the same thing range became domain for logarithms what that means is that the domain of your logarithms state that your argument the inside of your logarithms must always be positive not zero but positive think square roots but not equal to zero so we have to have something that is strictly positive in this there's there's no no way around that and so when we go ahead and we find domain for our logarithms it's actually a really simple task it also means that we include one more thing in our knowledge of domain so up until this point you really only had two features that you had to worry about one was denominators you could not have a zero on the bottom of your fraction number two was square roots you had to have the argument of your square root greater than or equal to zero and now we have logarithms i don't care whether you have an ln or a common log natural log common log or a log with any other base it doesn't really matter for every single base of every single logarithm ever the argument must be greater than zero that's all there is to it so whenever we see a function that has a logarithm in it we're going to look at its argument the stuff inside of parentheses the seventh century longer than say that because this is based on some logarithm with i don't care what the base is that argument must be greater than zero so we take a look at it go okay is that a logarithm yeah it's going to have some domain issues all right what are those going to be let's take a look at our argument and say this is a logarithm of the base of e i know that the inside of it must be greater than zero so what that says is i can only allow inputs that make that argument strictly positive i can only allow inputs that keep this thing greater than zero that's the argument greater than zero that's what we mean here the argument of your log must be positive okay if we add three that says you can have any number in the world as long as it's bigger than three anything less than or equal to that is a problem because it would create something undefined for your logarithm logarithms do not allow arguments that are negative logarithms that are not shifted this is shifted oh man do you get it this is shifted three units to the right this is inside your logarithm that's a minus three minus these two the right shift so before shifting it logarithms did not allow zero or negatives when we start shifting the logarithm we start shifting our domain a bit but it still bears out that our argument must be positive that says you can only allow values that are more than three if you try to plug in three you get ln of zero why don't you try that right now put in your character there's ln zero it's going to go error you're killing me why don't you understand i can't do that that's a little melodramatic but you can't do that it's going to give you now i promise try it right now press ln 0 enter and you're going to go sorry all right so this is your domain your domain is you gotta have numbers bigger than three anything besides that and you're you're blowing this thing up uh you can't allow arguments that are zero or negative let's move on so we have another logarithm it looks really nasty um we're going to get into the graphing stuff that looks similar to this so why in the world well maybe there's some things we can identify here like that's a shift up three this is written out of order that's a reflection that's a vertical stretch this is gonna have some sort of a shift to the right of some amount but that's not what we're talking about yet we are going to get there but right now we're just talking domain so we'd say this is a logarithm it has a base of 4 this is my argument and i know that in logarithms i need to plug in values that keep my argument positive here's what not to do do not set this equal to zero and try to solve it that shows your instructor whoever that is that you really don't understand the concept and it also is going to lead you to make an error with your inequality that we have right now because you're about to multiply by negative 2 or multiply by 2 and divide by negative 1 either way you're going to have to reverse the inequality so you look logarithm i know the argument must be positive so only allow inputs that make that happen let's subtract five you can multiply by two that would not change your inequality but dividing by negative 1 or multiplying by negative 2 here as soon as you do that that reverses your inequality says you will need to have values of x that are less than 10 in order to satisfy the fact that that needs to have an argument that's above zero not 10 itself try to plug in 10. if i plug in 10 you're getting 5 minus 5 and that's zero that's a problem plug in 11. that actually plugged in 12 it's easier plug in 12 something bigger than 10. if i do that 10 12 divided by 2 is 6 5 minus 6 is negative 1. your logarithm is not going to be happy with that it's going to go no i can't have negatives in there so keep it positive that's why we have to have values that are less than 10. if you forget to do that it's going to give you completely the wrong domain also notice one thing here please get this that it's not about plugging in negatives it's about plugging in values that keep this whole thing positive so in this domain you have negative values if you plug in negative 20 you can do that negative 20 divided by 2 is negative 10 but 5 minus negative 10 is 15. that's perfectly fine that's absolutely okay so it's it's more about this keep the inside and make find the inputs find the domain find the interval of x-axis that keeps your argument positive and that's what this is doing for you last one we're going to bring something back here we have a logarithm it's got a base of five it's got this argument we all understand hopefully at this point that your logarithm has to have an inside an argument that is always positive the question is do you remember rational inequalities that we did a few videos ago oh man that stuff's coming back yeah it's coming back because we can have fraction side logarithms which means according to domain that you need to solve for the interval on which that's defined wait a second so now we're using something we learned and something that we're learning yeah that's the way math works so if we have x plus one over x needs to be positive needs to be greater than zero do you remember what to do here do you remember that we create a number line that we identify what our problems are x cannot equal zero due to the fact that this is a denominator and if we allow our denominators equals zero and we cannot cancel the factor that this is a vertical asymptote and it's odd due to the fact that has a power one this should be just going wow oh my gosh i remember how to do that on our numerator we'd set that equal to zero this would give us x-intercepts or in general where this function intersects this function that is an x-intercept and that is a cross we can put this on a number line and we can use our vertical asymptote and our x-intercepts to determine whether or not we actually have sign changes uh due to the fact that they're odd or even multiplicities man i hope that makes sense so put these in order we can test one point something like x equals one and just see if it's true or not if we evaluate x equals one then we can say one plus one is two two over one is two two is bigger than zero that's a true statement what that means is that every value on this part of our x-axis every single value is going to create a true statement here every single value is going to create this thing being positive why is it important because if we have values that create this thing being positive this thing is your argument this thing is saying these numbers are allowed in that function this is defining your domain you've just found the values of x that keep this positive and that's what we're looking for for logarithms so this is one part of that interval just remember that when you have odd multiplicity your truth changes when you're doing what's called a sign analysis test or checking your intervals so true here means false here false here across means true here and so your intervals that cause this to work just like that negative infinity to negative one and then zero to one i'm sorry zero to infinity um i said one here and that's a very common mistake sometimes when we check a value we accidentally either put that value in our interval or we make this part of an interval that doesn't really need to be there so our working intervals the things that keep our argument true that satisfy this rational equality which represents our argument are any value from negative infinity to negative one those values are all going to create a positive argument and are therefore allowed in that logarithm that's what domain means along with zero to infinity any x value in that interval is going to cause this to be positive and therefore is allowed in our logarithm you can try some if you want try something like 10 10 plus 1 over 10 is positive try something like negative 2 if you'd like negative 2 plus 1 is negative 1 over negative 2 well that's negative that's positive 1 half negative 1 over negative two is positive one half or just one i don't care if it's fraction we're just want to keep that positive and you can do that all day long but these are the only two working intervals that we have for that so that defines our domain i hope that i've really made this make sense to you so far i hope that from the graphs we understood that logarithms need positive domain need values that keep your argument positive now sometimes you can allow negatives but that's only because when you plug them in your argument becomes positive that's what we're looking for so we're going to come back in another video and we're going to start graphing logarithms with some transformations so i'll see you for that you 

Transcript for: Graphing Logarithms with Transformations (Precalculus - College Algebra 56)
all right so we're going to graph some logarithms very quickly there's only two examples uh and there were Transformations and the reason why there's only two is because we've done transformation so many times this is just one more of our basic graph shapes and having graphed some exponentials we should have a pretty good idea about what our key points are but switched and what our asmp tootes are but switched and so we're applying that logic to some logarithms and just getting these pictures on some new graphs so what I'm going to do is I'm going to refresh remember on what the graph of a logarithm looks like what the domain what the ranges what the key points are and then apply that to two examples um with logarithms we do need to absolutely understand that a logarithm is the inverse of some sort of an exponential so exponentials are always increasing so are logarithms or always decreasing and so are logarithms just a little bit different uh our logarithms always have a domain before we shift it of positive numbers so our X values all have to be positive in order for us to evaluate inside of our logarithm we get out all real numbers sure but our domain is always positive until we start shifting that we're going to see that play along here our key points are always always one Zer and and a comma 1 that stems from whatever our base is and that comes from the fact that with exponentials that's what we got but we got 01 and 1 a so reverse that we have our inverses 1 comma 0 and AA 1 for every exponential before we start shifting that and likewise we have a horizontal ASM toote at zero for exponentials and therefore we have a vertical ASM toote at x equals z for our logarithms so our graphs look about like that here's our key points 1 Z A1 here's our vertical ASM toote key points of one Z A1 depending on whether a is greater than one or less than one we have this increasing or decreasing graph we know that because if a is more than one then our key point of a comma 1 would be to the right of one if a is less than one our key point of a Comm would be to the left of one that would give us an increasing or decreasing graph because the output would be one in both those cases so a more than one one a less than one one gives us that look so let's move on let's talk about our logarithms we'll talk about putting them in the right order I'm going to use key points in our shifting for our transformations to graph these things pretty quickly so number one thing with every function you really do want it in order so that we can identify some of the Transformations so so while we might be able to do it here it's going to look a bit better if we put our logarithm first all of our functions that we deal with have the same type of look for Transformations anything with in the function is a horizontal shift anything after the function is a vertical shift anything in front of the function is a reflection or vertical stretch of compression so when we take a look at our logarithm same things happen so here's how I want you to think through it I want you to think this is a logarithm yeah it is it has a base of e you need to know that if it's a logarithm I have some key points let's write our key points our key points are always 1 Z and the base comma 1 now that may be a little confusing if you have a base you need to know that base is e our key points are 1 Z right there and whatever the Bas is comma 1 our BAS is e comma 1 in your head just use 2.7 as a close approximation for E so when you see e just think 2.7 that's what I want you to do when you're graphing these things so we have one Zer we have e comma one and now we start identifying our shift so we say logarithm all right uh maybe what you should do also is look at your base our base is is it more than one or less than one if our base is e our base is more than one it should look like this unless we start reflecting it so that's important if our base is less than one so a fraction we'd have something like this as our root or basic function I'm not giving you one of these today they happen less frequently than our bases that are greater than one but they do happen I'm just going to focus on when your Bas is more than one you can certainly apply the same techniques that I'm showing you for this not a big deal I'm just getting into the root of the situation here so I've identified logarithm our BAS is e oh we should probably have something like that we've identify our key points one Zer and E comma 1 no problem we have key points with logarithms all the time like that and then we start identifying our vertical shift and then our horizontal shift and then our reflection or stretch or compression so I'm seeing that we've got a shift up of two units and also right one unit so that plus two that's a vertical shift show that show that and show the the right one that minus one so vertical shift horizontal shift of right one show that because here's what happens if every logarithm has a vertical ASM toote in its basic graph shape then when we shift it to the right one it shifts our ASM toote for us and it also shows us that in relation to where where we shifted we treat this like an origin and if you plot your key points from that spot you're going to get a good shape for this graph so we would plot 1 Z but in relation to this one Z is right here notice this is 1 but zero you won't move up or down it's got to be on that horizontal line that's going to happen every time just like this is on your x-axis and that's on your x-axis this is on where you shifted your x-axis and then e comma 1 remember e is about 2.7 so from here 2.71 2.7 one so one Z on the X on the shifted version of your x-axis and 2.7 comma 1 that's like your key point in this situation we've also shifted our vertical ASM toote so we're going to obey that and we've got a pretty good sketch of that graph for very very minimal work this is the way I want you to go through graphing logarithms identify that is a logarithm think about the base really have that base in your head and what picture you should obtain after that identify your key points using your base identify your shifts and any Reflections or transformation or vertical stretch compression and then we plot it with our key points after shifting all right let's try our next one so this I've tried to throw just about everything I could think of at you besides a common log so a common log has a base of 10 but frankly 10's a big number I don't want to grab it so we're going to graph something from the base of three in order to graph these appropriately the first thing we want to do is identify what it is and identify if it's in order so when we look at it we see a logarithm that says okay stop right now and put this in order with your logarithm first so this and this is a little out of order makes it just harder to see what our Transformations really are so we would say this as say -2 log base 3 of x + 1 + 3 so now that we have that in order we're identifying that is a logarithm and it has a base of three right now in your head you should have one of these two pictures if a is more than one which it is it's three we're going to get this look until we reflect it so it should be based on this look so let's think through that that looks like this and then let's identify what our key points are our key points for for logarithms are always the verse of exponentials so in exponentials we get 01 for logarithms we get 1 Z for exponentials we got one comma the base and so for logarithms we're going get the base comma 1 our base here is three okay once we've done that we start to identify any Transformations we have we start with the vertical shift anything after the function after parentheses is going to be a vertical shift so that plus three says you're going to shift your graph up three units that plus one says that's inside the function any anything inside the function that's affecting your inputs is going to affect a shift on the input axis so outside outputs inside inputs this plus one says I'm next to your X I'm going to add one to your inputs that's a shift to the left one we've identified a vertical shift up three a horizontal shift left one remember that's opposite and now we're going to look out front what this out front does that coefficient does two things then negative is a reflection across the x-axis or the shifted version of that and that two is a vertical stretch because an absolute value -2 is greater than two the a it counts as two right here for your your vertical stretch so think through what should happen this graph had a base of three should look like this we've moved it up three let's see uh left one we've reflected it and stretched it so this graph is up left reflected it should look like this have that picture in your head it actually should end up looking about like that graph now how we do how we deal with that how we deal with that -2 because this -2 happens after we evaluate our inputs and we run through logarithm it's going to affect the outputs of our of our logarithm and so the outs of our key Point get affected by that -2 just like every other time we're going to multiply our outputs time -2 not your inputs well that doesn't do anything for one zero that stays the same but it is certainly going to multiply 1 * -2 so we get 1 Z still and then we get 3 comma -2 still okay that's fantastic now we're going to go ahead and we're going to plot this so from our shifted up and left versions of our axes from our new vertical asmp toote and our new where we would consider to graph our key points this acts like the origin we're going to plot 1 Z we're going to plot 3 comma -2 so 3 comma -2 along with the same scale that we have is from this as treated like your origin for your key points 1 2 3 down two that's three -2 as plotted from your shifted graph of course the point 32 is not on this logarithm the actual point is going to be 2 comma 1 but we're using this technique finally your vertical ASM toote plays along whether you reflected the graph or not if you reflect a vertical ASM toote about the x-axis it's the same exact thing and so you have to obey that you also need to points don't you because we don't want to make the mistake of accidentally graphing this logarithm this way it's not that way it's been reflected and stretched it should be this way that's why those two points show that also this does not have a horizontal ASM toote logarithms don't have that oh their range is all real numbers it can't have a horizontal ASM toote let that sink in so this is not going to level out it's going to get to negative Infinity slower but it's still going to get there and so don't make this and I've see that many times like students go oh yeah horizont because I want to um don't do that think back to what your graph does this doesn't have a horizontal ASM toote this continues to positive Infinity albeit slowly but it does does do that so we're going to plot this I don't know exactly where we cross the xaxis if you want to make this a little bit better than the sketch I've done start plugging in values that you can evaluate now what do you mean evaluate we spent a whole long time thinking through logarithms in our head in last video uh so think about things like this what would you have to plug in here to simplify that logarithm well you could do something like um you could do something like two I already have that but you do something like two think about this by plug in two 2+ 1 is three the logarithm asks you three to what power gives you three one that would give you out one that's what logarithms ask logarithms ask you what powers it take to go from here to the argument that's what it asks logarithms represent an exponent that's what they do well we already have that point what would the next value be you'd have to plug in eight plug in eight and you go eight wow 8 + 1 is n if I plugged in8 I valuate 8 I would get 8 + 1 which is n 3 to what power will give you the nine two 3 the 2 power will give you 9 so this whole thing would simplify to 2 -2 * 2 is4 -4 + 3 is 1 the next point would be 8A 1 that's way over there it's off the screen now we just plugged in eight but also look at this what if we plugged in zero man this is important I want you to really see it what if you evaluated zero should we get the three yes yes check it out if you evaluated this for zero last little bit 0 + 1 is 1 wait a minute 3 to what power would give you 1 do you remember that if I evaluate for zero and I get one logarithm of I don't care whatever base you have log base whatever of one is always zero every time 3 to the zero power would give you one any base to the zero power would give you one if you ever have an argument of one your logarithm is going to simplify to zero so this whole thing would be 0 -2 * 0 is 0 0 + 3 is 3 that actually works and that might make this graph a little bit better so I hope that that makes sense I hope that you're seeing the Transformations that we know and love and the technique that I've taught you works all the time it really does I hate teaching stuff that I have to retach later so I gave you that that technique of transformation so that we use it up to and including this and this is the last thing that we actually have to graph in well the college algebra portion precalculus trigonometry we got a lot more graphing and you know what the transformation stuff it still works um so that's going to be very useful for us and we'll see that when we get there but for right now I need you to understand to put things in order identify the logarithm the graph that you're going to get think through your Transformations maybe even label them out this actually has four Transformations up left reflect and vertical stretch uh you should be thinking through what the graph does identify your key points as one zero and the base comma 1 and then multiply if you if you need to multiply the outputs then we do our shifting we put our key points and we we graph it along with our our vertical ASM toote for logarithms or horizontal for exponentials hope it makes sense get some practice in on that and I'll see you for another video when we start solving exponentials with logarithms and solving logarithms with exponentials so here for that video in a little bit 

Transcript for: Introduction to Solving Logarithms and Exponentials (Precalculus - College Algebra 57)
welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about just an introduction to how to solve logarithmic and exponential equations just a quick preview of what it takes when you can't find common bases we're going to explore a lot more in future future videos but right now i want the idea to get in your head of how to approach solving an equation when you have logarithms and when you have exponentials so here's the rundown number one thing whenever we see an equation with logarithms or exponentials the first thing we're going to check is if i can make it to have common bases with logarithms what that's going to mean for you is that you have a log on one side and a log in the other with the same exact base and we can just set the insights or the arguments equal to one another we're going to see that in a future video with exponentials that means that we might have to manipulate a little bit and we've done that before where we say hey this is an exponential equation let's get the same base and if we can then exponents are equal we're not going to talk about that because we've already done that in a previous video right now is if you don't have common bases what in the world do you do so here's what we're going to learn in this video if you have logarithms in your equation and you don't have two of them you just have one logarithm and a constant what we could know is that we can take any logarithm and change it into some exponential it's inverse and in doing so we're going to solve that logarithm so in your head i need you really thinking with the exception of common bases if i see a logarithm i'm using exponentials to solve it because that is the inverse just like addition is to subtraction exponentials are two logarithms they undo one another and so we're going to practice that when we get to exponentials with the exception of common bases if you have an exponential you're going to be using logarithms to solve it so when we see exponentials we're going to use a logarithm it's inverse and by writing an exponential in a logarithmic form we're going to be able to solve that exponential logarithms are two exponentials as subtraction is to addition they undo one another so let's practice that right now so i'm going to model this as we go through these are very very quick we're just getting a feel for it understanding that exponentials are going to solve logarithms and the next part of the video logarithms are going to solve exponentials so let's take a look at it log base 2 of 2x plus 1 equals 3. so here's the thought process going through number one thing we're going to check if we have common bases now for logarithms what that means is we need a log on one side and a log on the other we don't have that after that we're going to look for logs and if we have a log we're going to isolate so we have a log on one side nothing else around it and some sort of a constant on the other which is what we have here so we have a log base 2 of 2x plus 1 equals 3. once we have that log isolated we have our base identified what we know is that logarithms have separated the base from the exponent if we write this in exponential form it will put it back together so if our base is 2 and our exponent is 3 our exponential could be written as 2 to the third power equals 2 x plus 1. that in general is how exponentials work they look at a logarithm they take the base and the exponent that's a logarithmic separate of those two things and it puts it back together and notice that this is something that's pretty nice for us to solve we can take a look at and go oh well now that i have this in exponential form i know what two to the third is two thirds eight two x plus one it's really easy to solve we can subtract one and then divide by two so x equals seven halves as long as what you solve for does not create a negative inside your argument you need to remember that that our arguments have to be positive our domain for logarithms is strictly greater than zero so if we ever have a solution that causes zero or a negative when you plug it in that's an invalid solution typically it happens when you have a quadratic or higher but we always would want to check that so we check does that make this negative no in fact you plug this in uh 2 times 7 halves of 7 7 plus 1 is 8 and 2 to the third power would give you 8 that's exactly true and that's exactly what this is solved for that's what we're going to do to solve logarithms you check for common bases that takes two logarithms if you don't have that you're going to need to isolate your log we've got that one log one side constant and then use an exponential notation to solve that it's going to be pretty easy to solve in most of these cases let's move on to another one so we have another logarithm we check for common bases i don't have two logs i have one log there's one log on one side and a constant on the other exponential notation will solve your logarithm the exponential is an inverse of some logarithm and so we're going to use that inverse identify your base so our base here is 3 our exponent is on the other side a logarithm has stripped away the exponent and separate it on different sides of the equation so our base for an exponential is three the exponent is two and that's going to equal x squared plus one this is the exponential notation of the inverse of that particular logarithm the same base and the same exponent now we're going to solve for x so notice that we do sometimes have to rely on some techniques that we've had so when you set up your exponential you might have a quadratic you might have to factor this in this case we're just going to use the square root method because we can isolate that power too but you might have to factor it you might have to quadratic formula for it you have to do lots of things to solve this here's the main point the only thing i'm really trying to teach you in this video is that in order to solve a logarithm you're going to have to put it in exponential form also this video is very basic we have some other techniques with exponentials that i'm going to show you later but right now it's just the idea i need to just pound in your head that exponentials are what it takes to solve logarithms when we get to exponentials this means logarithms are what it takes to solve x answers because they're inverses of one another so solving this we know that three squared is nine if we subtract one and we take a square root remembering that when you take a square root you need to have a plus and minus we end up getting two solutions we get plus and minus the square root of eight because eight is four times two the square root of 4 is 2 and it leaves us a square root of 2 that's 2 root 2 and negative 2 or 2. now common question is wait a minute i thought you couldn't plug in negatives into a logarithm well you can't plug in values that make the inside of your logarithm negative but look at our argument here look at this x squared plus 1. there's nothing that you can plug in here that's going to cause that to be negative you can plug in positive numbers something squared plus 1 is going to be positive you can plug in negative numbers something negative squared plus one is going to be positive these are both valid solutions for you because they don't make the inside of your logarithm negative it's very common for students looking through oh i can't have negatives it's really easy to do that but that's not the idea the idea is you can't plug in values that make the inside of that logarithm negative neither of these actually do that therefore they're both valid solutions okay moving on do you remember that if i have a logarithm and i've checked for both side of both of them sorry i've checked for common bases now i don't have my i just have one logarithm and it's isolated do you remember that when you have an ln it stands for a logarithm but it has certain base so that base would be e ln stands for the logarithm of the natural number so that says it's an implied base of e here so this is a log logarithmic equation i check for common bases but i only have one logarithm i don't have two that's what you would need for common bases to work i have my logarithm isolated there's nothing being added subtracted or multiplied it's very basic here what we do when we see this if we go okay we've got a logarithm without common bases you're going to need to get an exponential from that so when we look at it all right our base is our base is e our exponent is eight remember a logarithm all of them have separated the base from the exponent put them on different sides of your equation so we're going to put it back together in something called exponential notation so our base is e our exponent is eight and that's going to equal the argument negative two x plus one looks a little weird but we can certainly solve this if we solve for x go through the same exact steps that you would with any other equation if that's our variable remember that's a number that's like 2.7 ish goes forever it's trends of known you can't really get to the end of it but it is a number sort of like pi if we're solving for x you're just going to subtract one and then we're going to divide by negative two do exactly the same thing here but don't approximate e to the eighth what we want is something called an exact solution so an exact solution hasn't used your calculator to say well e is about this therefore e to the eighth is about this and then we subtract once about this divided by name two it's about this that's a that's an approximation and those are valid sometimes when they ask you for it but if you need an exact solution this is the process you go through subtract 1 from both sides notice it's not subtracted from the exponent and subtracting from e to the eighth and then we would divide by negative two now we typically don't like to see negatives on the denominator so we can move that out front that's appropriate i don't like seam all denominator move them out front or you can run it through the numerator as well so negative e to the eighth and then plus one or we can reverse that one of these two two solutions is really what you should end with something with a negative e to the eighth minus one over two or one minus either just distributing that negative through your numerator over two this is what's called an exact solution we have not approximated now if you want to approximate what you can do on your calculator is put parentheses plug in 1 minus e to the 8th and that parentheses because you need to tell the calculator that that's my numerator and then divide by 2. it'll give you a decimal approximation and that's sometimes useful for us but if you're asked for exact that's what we do also when we're doing math and we need an approximation don't approximate until you get here so what i don't want to see i don't want to see it plugging in 2.7 or e and then getting e to the eighth and writing down a decimal and then subtracting one writing down a decimal then dividing by negative two and writing out a decimal you're starting to round your approximations and if we approximate approximations they get more and more error in them it's not really appropriate to do so don't do that now it seems kind of awkward to check but you still could check this answer if you plugged this in and you plugged it in right there well it's really weird but think about how this would take the place of x negative 2 over times something over 2 those 2's would cancel that negative would distribute here and give you negative 1 plus e to the 8th negative 1 plus 1 would give you 0 you would end with e to the 8th now wait a minute ln of e to the eighth we're going to see this right here but whenever you have an exponential composed on a logarithm or a logarithm composed of an exponential we're going to see in the properties of logarithms a very nice video these things cancel this right here says this is going to give you 8. so in other words it says e raised to what power gives you e to the 8th well e to the 8th power would give you e to the 8. oh hey look it's 8. it makes sense it actually works so that we can check and it becomes a little more awkward what you can't do you can't check an approximation it's not going to work out because you just approximated the decimal which is another reason why we want to leave it in exact exact answer form so moving on here a couple of special cases where you don't necessarily need to write an exponential but you still can't so i want to show you this so we check do i have two logarithms where i can make common bases no not really what am i going to need i want to need an exponential but i'm going to need a logarithm isolated we have that right here the base of this particular logarithm is e so notice what happened is just what we talked about if this has a base of b which we never really write here's what is actually going to happen once we learn about the professional logarithms you have now composed an exponential onto a logarithm you've composed two inverses the reason why we talked about compositions and inverses is so that you would learn that when i compose two inverses they cancel and you get x the x here in this case is 2x it's your exponent so what's going to happen i'm going to show you this i'll prove this to you with the exponential notation what's going to happen you're going to end up going that's going to be 2x equals 8. your solution is going to be 4. now can we see it a different way sure if you understand that that base is e and that this is a logarithm it's isolated can you write it in exponential form well yeah we can our base is e our exponent is 8. so base to the exponent equals our argument this is what happens every time you compose an exponential onto a logarithm with the same base this is the key the same base what would happen is that your exponential that you create will have the same base you can see it right here same base means same base that's why it's so trivial that's why it says well yeah you can just go 2x equals 8 because those things cancel out because these e's practically cancel out you know if my bases are the same then my exponents have to be equal and sure enough i get just four that's going to happen every single time you compose an exponential with a logarithm the basis will if the bases match then the bases will cancel and you're going to get the exponents equal and that's exactly what we have keep this mind this is a big deal this is an exponent right but this is also some exponent of an exponential that's what logarithms have done they separated the base from the exponent our exponents will get set equal if our bases are the same that's the reason why these inverses undo each other is because of that they have the same base they're going to know each other kind of cool all right last one's also a special case i'm going to show this to you you'll hopefully understand the same concept that you're seeing here with just a slightly different base and i'll show you the exponential notation so if you were to think of log base 6 of 36 equals 5 x plus 4 you're you're noticing right hopefully right right away that your variables over here wait a minute couldn't you just subtract 4 and divide by 5 yeah you could there's no variable over here which means this is already a constant in fact it's a constant that we can simplify think about this 6 raised to 2 what power will give you 36 2. this stands for two i promise you no matter what you do you're gonna end with five x plus four equals two a couple ways you can see that well what if we thought about it as log base 6 of 6 squared c squared is still 36 oh but what i've done is the same thing i've done here i've written this as an exponential and a logarithm with the same base well what's going to happen with that the bases will cancel you will end up getting 2 equals 5x plus 4. that's possible to do and we can show it just this way we can we can say hey that's going to cancel you get 2 equals 5x plus 4 or if you need the exponential we can think of this as if this is a logarithm it's isolated it has a base of 6 i know that if i were to write this in exponential form that's my base that's my exponent that's been separated so writing this back in exponential form let's say base of 6 to an exponent of 5x plus 4 must equal whatever's here in the argument 6 squared now it's really really clear that if your bases are the same here they're going to be the same in your exponential if your bases are the same here you're going to set your exponents equal if you're based the same here you're going to set your exponents equal this models a little more concisely what this is saying to you it's just saying you've composed a function with its inverse it's going to cancel out same basis it's going to cancel out so if we have those bases the same the exponents also have to be equal and then we can solve this is exactly what we thought would happen if we subtract two so sorry subtract four and we divide by five we get x equals negative two fifths negative two fifths times five would give you negative two plus four would give you two and sure enough six to the second power is 36. we can check our work on that i hope that makes sense to you i hope you're seeing the necessity of writing a lot of these in exponential form that's how we solve logarithms in general yes there are some shortcuts if we can find common bases somehow that's true we can simplify this a little bit easier but without that you are going to need an exponential for logarithms in general we'll come back we'll talk about exponentials and then we'll be done okay i guess i lied a little bit i want to do one more logarithm before we jump into these exponentials sometimes you get a little bit of awkwardness like hey can you solve for a base that would make this logarithm true and it's not that bad just remember that with your exponentials you check your common bases i do not have that because i don't have two logarithms what i do is i have one logarithm isolated equal to a constant this is the setup for solving with an exponential we look at this and say can i write this as an exponential well identify what your base is a base is x identify what your exponent is in this case 3 and that's going to be equal to your argument when you solve these just be careful remember that your argument has to be positive your domain for logarithm is positive numbers so whatever you plug in must keep that or make that positive but your base also has to be positive it can be fractions that's okay but it has to be positive so if you had a square root here and not a cube root when we took a plus and minus you would have to omit any negatives cube roots fine you can you can take this and take a cube root and not get any negatives here but you'd have to watch that just remember your bases can't be negative so take a cube root of both sides cube root of one is one and of eight is two so the base that makes this work is one half and sure enough one half to the third power is one eighth that's what this would say again last time just be careful that you don't allow any bases to be negative so this works um you still write this as exponentials that's how logarithms are solved in general is with its inverse of an exponential now let's move on and solve some exponential so the same logic applies it's just that we're going backwards you see logarithms and exponentials are inverses of one another it means it takes one to solve the other so we would check for common bases and here's what i mean by that you'd look at this and say can i write this as this base if that if you can then you do it because it's a little bit nicer you don't think using logarithms you'll get a more easy to understand solution but if we don't have that then we're going to find a logarithm and we're going to use that to solve our exponential so in each of these cases seven and eight you can't find a common base ten is your base not eight and not eighty ten and three you can't find a common base e and five definitely no convex e and seven no common bases so we would check that first step once we've determined there are there's no way to write these exponentials as a common base we're going to have to use a logarithmic form to solve the exponential it's not too bad when we get into a little bit more detail i'm going to give you at least three possibly if i feel like it four different ways to solve exponentials with logarithms so we've checked common bases and we don't have any common bases any of these problems and what i'm just i just need to know that if you do not have common bases with exponentials it is going to take logarithms to solve them we're going to isolate the exponential what that means is get the base raised to an exponent by itself and then we're going to solve as i was saying a little earlier i will teach you some other techniques when these become a little more difficult mike what do you do if you have two exponentials well then writing this as one logarithm is not going to work and so i'm going to show you that another video this is very basic just the introduction of hey if you have exponentials check for common bases if not write them as a logarithm and then we can solve that so let's practice that here so this is an exponential it's got a base of seven it's got an exponent of two x plus five now what a logarithm does a logarithm takes that exponential and breaks it apart it takes the base and says this is the base of some logarithm some inverse function of an exponential and then it's going to be equal to your exponent so we can take this and say all right so 7 to the 2x plus 5 equals 8 can be written as some inverse function a logarithm with the same base equal to the same exponent but just separated it just says the same thing a little bit weird it says seven to the two x plus five equals eight and it says in order to get from seven to eight you need an exponent of two x plus five now this allows us to solve for that variable x don't try to figure this out unless you have some sort of common base idea if you do then you can but in general you wouldn't need a logarithm to do that it would show up right here that you can get common bases just leave this this is going to be what's called exact answer if you if you approximate this on a calculator yeah we can get something out of it but it's you're going to lose a lot of the the exact as that would just be an approximation so when we solve for x a couple features to understand when we subtract five it is really important to not actually subtract the argument of your logarithm minus 5. this is inside a logarithm and this is not in order to get inside the logarithm you need properties of logs to do that and there's really only four of them so we cannot just subtract even though we want to it's best to put a parenthesis around that argument almost all the time that i can't think of a couple cases where you wouldn't want to do it and you can't really overuse the parentheses here with this logarithm it's going to show you this is log base 7 of 8 and then you subtract 5. it is not log base 7 of 8 minus 5. that's not appropriate you can't do that lastly if we divide by 2 the whole entire expression is divided by two this even though it's awkward that is an exact solution and it's also a constant this stands for one number it just has a weird logarithm in it your calculator will approximate this if you have the ability to plug in a base of 7. a lot of calculators don't most texas instruments don't do that they either have a log base 10 or a log base e that's the log and the ln on your calculator some of them do have have that base where you can plug it in but a lot of the ones i've seen don't have that so this is an exact solution for that exponential and we had to have logarithms to do it let's move on to this guy so when we move on and we take a look at five e to the point two x equals seven there's a lot going on but at its root at its heart it's an exponential now can you get a common base well the base here is e and the base here is 7. there no way to make a 7 into an e so we're going to need a logarithm to undo this exponential when you look at an exponential and you don't have common bases and you need a logarithm to solve it you need to get that exponential isolated what that means is get everything that's been added and subtracted and multiplied from that base to an exponent get that away so we're going to have to divide by 5 here this is how an exponential should look before you start using logarithms nothing added nothing subtracted nothing multiplied just like this now what we're going to do is say because i can write this as a logarithm we're going to identify the base the exponent and let the logarithm separate those things our base here is e and our exponent is 0.2 x the argument of our logarithm is going to be seven-fifths so with a base of e we'd say this can be written as a logarithm with a base of b i know this incorrect notation we're not going to use it i'm just showing you how this works that's going to separate our exponents so here's our base and our exponent written as a logarithm and this will equal seven-fifths i'm going to keep this in parentheses because that is appropriate to do we're showing that this fraction is inside the logarithm that's different than having a log of 7 over 5. we don't want to have that unless that's actually what the problem is representing the last thing i wanted to tell you about this before we divide by 0.2 is that log base e is always written as a natural log ln so when you see this we really should be going oh that's oh this is a logarithm of the base of e i would normally just go straight to the ln so this is log base e so i've separated my base in a logarithm equal to my exponent and then put the seven fifths inside that natural log and then when we divide by point two the reason why we want to put that fraction in parenthesis is you don't get confused on where you're dividing my point to you're dividing this entire thing by point two we can do a couple things to modify the look of that uh like multiply by 10 over 10 if you want to get rid of that decimal that's that's appropriate you can do that i wouldn't say it's super necessary but sometimes you're required to do it so multiply by 10 over 10 you get 10 line of seven fifths over two or you can reduce that five l and seven fifths so that might look a little bit nicer you could do something a little simpler i suppose i think i made that as hard as humanly possible if you think about that as one one divided by 0.2 1 divided by point two is five point two goes into one five times so you could do that as well but this is a nicer look then then that is so i hope that's making sense i hope you're seeing that hey exponential is gonna require a logarithm there another way to solve that besides using a logarithm with a base of e there's a couple ways we can get to that point but a logarithm is necessary to solve exponentials if you do not have common bases let's move on to the last two at this point i'm hoping that you could solve this on your own can you see that's a base of 10 that's a this is three there's no way to make this as a base of 10. can you see that with this exponential without common bases i'm going to need a logarithm can you also see that that logarithm is going to be a common log it's going to have a base of 10 in it but i need to get that 8 away before i write this in logarithmic notation so i'm going to have to divide both sides by 8. this is not 80 you're breaking order operations if we do that or operations say you have to deal with the exponent before you start multiplying if you start multiplying here you are really messing up that exponent we don't want to do that so we're going to divide both sides by 8. now that's how we like to see an exponential before we make it into logarithm we got a base we know it's 10. all by itself nothing added subtracted or multiplied onto that exponential this is okay because it's in the exponent but what we mean is multiplication here or added subtracted somewhere outside of that that base to an excellent idea now that we know the logarithm is going to be necessary for us if we have a base of 10 remember that a a log with a base of 10 equal to the exponent of 2x minus 7 that log should be written just log if we write log with no base it's implied that that base is 10. so i have a base of 10 an exponent of two x minus seven and a logarithm separates those i'm gonna make sure that my argument is in parentheses that's really good form to do that way you don't accidentally add subtract multiply and divide anything inside of that without meaning to by some sort of property of logarithms and then we solve for x because this is actually a constant this says 10 to what power gives me 3 8. that is a number it represents an exponent but i can solve by adding 7 and dividing by 2. where we add 7 is after that parenthesis and where we divide by 2 is that entire expression so divide the entire log of 3 8 we know it's a base 10 plus 7 and all divided by 2. that's as good as we can get for what's called an exact solution if you wanted to approximate your calculator will do this just press the log button on your calculator that is a log base 10 and sure enough it has parenthesis there doesn't it so when you press it goes log parenthesis plug in 3 8 and parentheses add 7. now if you do it correctly you might want to do your numerator parentheses first so parentheses log 3 8 close the first parenthesis plus 7 close the second parentheses and that will have the numerator for you and then divide by 2. and i'll give you an approximation for what this number represents okay last one you really need to do on your own uh it's an exponential for sure i'm gonna kind of just scream through this thing um it's an exponential without common bases if you have that a logarithm is necessary but you have to isolate your exponential first so when we divide by 4 we can easily see that that exponential is isolated this is certainly no not a common base we're going to write this in logarithmic notation so this exponential has a base of e i'm going to need a logarithm of the base of e this exponential has an exponent of x plus one logarithms separate the base in the form of a logarithm from an exponential and uses the argument logarithm whatever this exponential is equal to after that we can solve for the variable and solve our exponential so we subtract one we're done that's what's called an exact solution your calculator will also approximate this which is why i wanted to give these two to show you that your calculator that button that says log on it represents a common log that's what this is that ln represents a log of the base of e they're very very very common in our our math going on in the future we get so many elements so you you can approximate that by pressing ln you're going to see the parentheses put five fourths close the parentheses subtract one and i'll give you a decimal approximation for that exact solution i hope this video has made sense i hope that you understand like yeah we would we'd certainly go through this process every time with logarithms if you've got two logarithms of the same base it becomes pretty easy you set your your insides equal we're going to see that a little bit if you have two exponentials and you can write the same base we've already done that we modeled it with a couple examples a little bit earlier you set your exponents equal they're pretty easy to solve but without those two very special cases it is going to require you to use an exponential to solve logarithms you just take your logarithm isolate it and then use an exponential to represent the situation put your exponent and your base back together and equal it to your argument it'll solve very nicely if you have an exponential you're going to need a logarithm there's a few ways i can show you how to get there but in general you isolate your exponential and use logarithms somehow to represent the situation in this case we go directly to our logarithms by taking the base and separating the exponent and solving so hope the videos made sense i'm going to see you next time for when we start talking about the properties of logarithms just an overview of overview of what they are then we'll start combining logs we'll expand logs and then we'll be ready to solve some exponential and logarithmic equations in general so i'll see for those videos in just a bit

hey hope you're still doing well in this video what we're going to do is we're going to talk about the properties of logarithms there's really only that's kind of five of them but we group one of them together so it's really only four we're going to talk about the four property of logarithms just some basic examples on how they work and then we're going to use those in the next few videos to combine some logarithms expand some logarithms use What's called the change of Base formula and then we'll be finally ready to start tackling some of these problems that have some complicated equations with exponentials and logarithms just understanding these these ideas so here are the properties of logarithms as you need to know them the first one is this I've said a couple of these before but there's some some things that we need to remember all the time number one if you ever have a logarithm where the argument is one you are going to get zero and here's the reason why any base raised to the zero power is always going to give you one therefore a logarithm of any base of one is equal to Z this is exactly where man I hope you remember it when we graph logarithms this is exactly where the key point of 1 comes from input of one output of zero one zero is on every single logarithm before you start shifting it that's where that came from likewise a logarithm with a base of a of a if you have the same base here and here this is always going to equal one why because a to the first power is always going to give you a actually to the first Power it's almost a trivial statement it says a raised to what power gives you a a to the first Power gives you a and it's consequently why on every graph of a logarithm you had a key point of a one you plug in a you get out one for whatever base you have I hope that makes sense to you we had one zero we had a comma 1 for every logarithm ever that's where they come from and that's why these properties work is if you have a one you're going to get a zero if you have an A you're going to get a one and that translates to one more thing this is extendable so a to the first Power gives you a to the 1st but a to the r power is going to give you a to the r look at what we have done we've talked about in the last video but we've composed an exponential onto a logarithm with the same base two inverses an exponential and a logarithm are always going to cancel each other out so when you compose them in either order everything's going to go away everything's going to cancel out and and you get these trivial statements you say a raised to what power is going to give you a to the r power well this would have to be R and if you think back to what happened when we composed a function and its inverse everything canel and you got X well in this case our X is actually R so everything's in cancel you're going to get R and that's exactly what's happening here you have an exponential on a logarithm the same base they're going to cancel and give you whatever that exponent is this case you're going to get R and it says the same thing a to the r power equals a the r power we've explored this before we what we haven't seen is this one it is a similar concept You' just composed the inverses differently now we know from compositions whether we compose a function and its inverse or an inverse and its function you still get the same thing you still get everything cancels out same thing happens here when you compose a logarithm onto an exponential this acts as the exponent of some exponential but it has the same base so you've composed a function on its inverse it will cancel and give you in this case M and what it says is if you were to go and write this in logarithmic form right now it's in exponential form it would say you'd have a log let's see I'm going to do this for you you'd have a if I would logarithms here's my base I have to do it over here I didn't plan on doing this here's my base of a here's my exponent a logarithm takes the base and separates the exponent here's my base is a logarithm here's my exponent and makes the argument whatever this is and we get a trivial statement and this is this is saying the same thing as that it's saying hey uh what would my argument be if I have log base a of something equals log base a of M it would have to be M that's what that's saying so how we use these is really nice these are extremely quick just understand the nature of what you're doing don't treat it like just a rule like oh it's 13 1/34 7 1/4 and 8 those are all true but think about what is happening you have composed an exponential with a base of two on a logarithm base of two those are two inverse functions composed when you compose inverse functions they cancel you're going to get3 and that's why now it is just this rule isn't it here's our BAS is the same we're just going to get the exponent and that's what's going on but the reason behind it it's important to know next one hey have you composed a logarithm and its in well an exponential and its inverse of a logarithm that's a base of 10 that's a log with a base of 10 we don't write it but that's a base of 10 so you have an exponential on a logarithm the same base it's going to cancel you still have this problem this property right here with the same bases they're going to simplify you're going to get 1/3 same thing happens here we have an exponential with a base of e we have a logarithm with a base of e now we write that as Ln but that is a log base e an exponential composed on a logarithm the same bases your bases match up you're going to simplify this is going to give you -4 all of these things should make sense to you 2 to the -3 power = 23 10^ 1/3 power = 10 1/3 power they're trivial statements why because you've composed a function on its inverse e to the4 power equal e to the4 power yep how about this one well this is the other way we've composed a logarithm onto an exponential but you still have the same base this is a function compos on its inverse it's going to simplify and give you in this case seven we're right here right now bases match up they're going to simplify same thing happens here log base 10 on an exponential base 10 well you've composed a function on its inverse that has to simplify has to cancel out here you have a log base e on an exponential base e you've composed a function on inverse those have to cancel out and these are all three instances of this property where you have the bases the same you're going to simplify and get just the argument every time that's pretty useful we see that from time to time we're going to see it in a couple of these examples uh where we have composed the function on its inverse either purposefully that's when we're solving we're purposely composing a function on its inverse when we're solving exponentials and logarithms or uh in the in the working out or simplification of some of our our logarithms we sometimes see this and then we can simplify as we go that's very useful let's go on to the next couple properties so the next ones in order to really make these stick I want you to think about how logarithms are created logarithms come from some sort of an exponential they're an inverse of an exponential and because of that these properties minimic exponential rules so ex think exponent rules now they're not exactly exponent rules because they're not exactly exponents they come from exponentials but they're not exp exponents themselves and so they they model they're they model those exponent rules pretty closely but they're not exact so they're inverses so so check it out now if we ever have log base a of a product so M * n we can separate that we can separate that by using addition now now why addition well when you multiply common bases don't you add those exponents well yeah so multiplication is somehow tied together with this addition concept much like you have for exponents and that's a true statement for logarithms if you have a product inside of one logarithm you can separate this into two logarithms with the same base of a a sum so a sum of two logarithms also this is a really big note I want you to make a really important note here this is not a one-way street so what that means is if you have two logarithms and they're added together and they have the same base you can multiply their arguments inside one logm not add notice what is not up here nowhere have I had logarithm of Base a of m + n that's not expandable and nowhere will I have log base a of M time log base a of n that's not combinable that doesn't work and so what I'm giving you here this is really important is that I'm giving you the only rules that actually work to expand and combine logarithms don't don't think outside the box here don't invent your own math it's really common for students to do but we just cannot do it if it's not up here then you can't do it with logarithms if I haven't told it to you and the only other one that I can think of is change of base right now we're going to get that a little bit later but if it's not one of these you can't expand by it you can't combine by it so the next one's very very similar imagine this imagine if you're multiplying and multiplication give you some sort of addition concept what's division going to give you multiplication is to division as addition is to subtraction in the in the case of our our logarithm rules so what we do here if we have a log base a of m / n we can separate that we can expand it by subtraction think of your division of exponents if you add a to the N oh sorry X the M over X the N we would subtract those exponents and that's sort of where this is coming from so if we have log base a of m / n division is somehow tied together with the subtraction concept also these are not oneway streets they're two-way streets so you can expand a logarithm with division inside as subtracting a difference of two logarithms of the same base or if you have two logarithms the same base being subtracted you can combine it into a logarithm with division not subtraction these are both important we use both of these when we're solving exponentials and logarithms we need to know them kind of backwards and forwards to be able to expand and combine all right the last one it's called the power property if you ever have an exponent log base a of something to some exponent you can move that exponent or power called the power property to the front as a coefficient fascinating piece of math but what it says is that you can expand any sort of exponent as a coefficient or if you have a coefficient you can move that as an exponent this is how we start isolating logarithms to make it one logarithm without anything multiply or divided we can move that as an exponent well likewise if you have an exponent you really don't want it like what if that's a radical wait a minute a radical is like a 1/3 power or 1/2 power or a fractional exponent you can now move that as a coefficient you can get rid of any radicals inside of your logarithm provided the entire argument is under that that radical well that's really neat that really helps us out in a lot of cases so we can go backwards and forwards without power property now it's time to practice it let's take these I'm going to show you the thought process he going through we'll expand all of these and just use some of the properties that we can as we go through so um when we start talking about log base 5 of 25 to X we're trying to simplify this here's some things that we can think of number one can you expand via products can you understand that if that's a product I can expand this well how how would I do it if I look back there's only one thing that lets me expand a product it says I can take log base 5 of 25 plus log base 5 of X the only reason I have the parenthesis here is to make sure that we understand this is the end of the argument I'm not adding something inside of that that logarithm so log base 5 of 25 plus log Bas 5 of X says product equals plus that's what I need in your head product equals plus plus equals product can we simplify further well log base 5 of X that's not simplifi there's nothing we don't know what x is there's nothing we really do but log base 5 of 25 there are a few ways to simplify this now this is going to lead us down to the statement that there's more than one way to do do a lot of this work with logarithms as long as you're using an appropriate property that we've seen you're going to be fine I'm going to show you uh at least two ways to think about this here's the first way to think about this first way is I'm show you three ways the first way is um can you just think five raised to what power gives you 25 you go five 5 squar is 25 oh hey two this is going to be two guaranteed that's one way you could do it another way you could do it could you write this as log base 5 of 5^ s well sure 25 is 5^ s but think about what this means if this is base base and they're the same you now have this property log base a of a r is log base 5 of 5 to the 2 the log base 5 and the five that's an exponential composed on a log them with the same base that's inverses composed they're going to cancel you're going to get two what else could you do could you now use this property and move your exponent to the front well that's possible here's my exponent I can move it to the front as a coefficient log base 5 of 5 to the first power or simply log base 5 of 5 that's this property that's going to give you one oh wait hey do you remember that on every single logarithm we have the base comma one that's what that's saying that says log base 5 of five let's see how do I get to five from five to five what power is that that's a power one so this would simplify to a 1 2 * 1 is 2 no matter what you're going to end up getting 2 + log base 5 of x now that is as simple as we can make it but understand what this does for you this makes something a lot easier to graph that might be kind of diff difficult to graph this is not oh man you I hope that you see this this is a logarithm it's got a base of five so that means we have a0 1 0 and 5 comma 1 those are my key points furthermore that's a shift up two units there's no horizontal shift but this is out of order that's a shift up to got a key point of one zero got a key point of 51 there's no horizontal shift at all there's no vertical stretch you could graph this very easily with what I've taught you in the graphing video I hope that's fascinating that doing this makes it easier to actually do things like graphing cool we're just using some very simple properties okay let's focus on the next one so we've got this Ln of e overx the first thing I want you to notice is that we can separate quotients if we're talking about expanding by subtraction so when we do that that says take your your logarithm that is a logarithm it has a base of e and take that quotient create two logarithms that are being subtracted so division creates a subtraction concept for us and then we see if we can simplify each one Ln X well there's nothing we can really do much like the log base 5 of X in the previous example but L and E well that's wait a minute this has a base of e this is exponential with a base of e You' just composed an exponential onto a logarithm of the same base they're going to cancel but they're not going to give you zero this is this case right now so we have the same base even though we don't write log we write Ln it still is a base of e and a base of e they're going to simplify and they're going to give you one if you want to think down to this this route if you want to write the base of uh sorry the exponent of one there base matches base exponent compos logarithm with the same base it's going to cancel it's going to give you one that's about as good as we can make it but notice that you could graph this a bit easier oh man do you see it do you see that this this is a logarithm of the base of e so what are your key points well your key points are one Z and E comma 1 that's like 2.7 comma 1 this is shifted up one unit this is then reflected You' defect the outputs of your keyo points it would reflect that exponential I I making making it make sense to you I hope I'm making you see the connections of what I've taught you to what you're doing now it should not be completely separated it should be one big unit of information it's like oh this relates this is now easier to graph than that do you want to graph that I don't to graph that do you want to graph that that's easy that's a shift up one that's a reflection I've got key points of one z e comma 1 my my outputs would reflect and I could graph it very nicely that's much nicer okay last example it starts out pretty much the same we've got this logarithm of this division so this this quotient inside of one logarithm we can expand it and sometimes it's very nice we're seeing this this is much easier to graph if we expand that so let's do it so this logarithm would be Ln of the [Music] numerator minus the denominator I probably would put parenthesis here I might put parenthesis here you don't have to there's nothing after it but we do need to understand how this works how this works is it takes and makes your loog the first logarithm of your numerator minus the logarithm of your denominator that order is important it's not communed you can't switch it around so numerator is first denominator is second in that that difference after that we look to simplify whatever we can lnx you're done there's really nothing we can do there there's no basis that match there's no moving exponents there really is an exponent besides one and that doesn't help us to move you just get one times something which gives you back that something it's multiplicative identity so that doesn't really affect anything but Ln of e to X I need you to notice that I need you to notice that we are here I'm I'm going to throw a lot of these at you so that you do recognize it's very common in calculus for students to not simplify that because they're not seeing that e explicitly Ln of e to some exponent is always cancelable because you've composed an exponential on a logi of the same base so you can see why I'm throwing these at you so that you go oh yeah that's right okay that that simplifies so so I'm I'm getting you in the mode of when you see this later you can understand why they're calling this just X it's not magic it's composing an exponential on a logarithm going oh that is certainly going to simplify we have a actually have a property for that this says e to what power gives you e to X well e to X gives you e x you're going to cancel this it is an exponential compos on the inverse of a logarithm it's going to simplify to just X just like this simplifies just to3 your bases match I just need you to see it you can post a function with its inverse and that cancels so that's where we're going to end here this is a little bit more difficult to graph than some of the other ones uh but it it is possible that's certainly easier than trying to graph that thing so I hope that I've uh explained these properties to you that they're they're Loosely based on exponent rules which is why products are mapped to pluses and quotients are mapped to differences um this one's a little special with what we Nether X we get into that a little bit later on why that actually works so watch out for that U we'll come back with how to com how to combine and expand logarithms in general so we'll deal with expanding first as much as we can much hard than what I've given you here this is just an introduction and then we'll talk about how to combine them and then we'll be ready to solve exponentials molecules in general hope you're having fun hope you're doing well see you soon 

Transcript for: How to Expand Logarithms (Precalculus - College Algebra 59)
hey welcome to another video so in this lesson we're going to talk about how to use the properties of logarithms to expand logarithms now why would you want to do that well when we get to calculus 1 maybe calculus 2 depends on when you get derivatives of logarithms it really helps to be able to expand logarithms and to take a derivative after you've expanded them so when you get there you're like oh that makes sense for now sometimes we expand them we're solving equations we need to do that once in a while sometimes it puts them in a better format for us so a few reasons why we'd want to do it honestly in this video we're just practicing this so we're going to be using these properties to take logarithms that have multiplication division or exponents and expand them make honestly as many logarithms as possible using these to get these that's the idea separating multiplication into addition of two logarithms division into subtraction two logarithms of the same base and using that power property to move that exponent as a coefficient in the next video we'll go backwards we'll take logins or added or subtracted or have a coefficient and change them into more condensed versions of the same thing they do mean the same thing we're just using properties to show them a little bit differently because it benefits us on certain occasions so let's get right to it here's the process what i would want you to go through whenever you have to expand a logarithm number one take a look at your logarithm make sure a couple things have happened firstly make sure everything's factored so if you have an expression like we see in a couple of this one where we can factor this we want to make sure that's done first because when we're expanding logarithms we want to fully expand it and anything that has a product needs to get expanded or a quotient needs to be expanded also because radicals really can be represented by exponents that are fractions we're going to write all of our radicals as exponents and finally we're going to show any sort of product there is we're going to explicitly show the little dot that certain things are being multiplied together so we know to expand them so let's take a look at what i mean in this example what we're going to do first we're going to take a look at this this is a logarithm oh the base should be e we know it's e we're going to take a look at first factoring so is everything factored we know that it is is it necessary to write this in x first and then factor out a negative you you can it's not super necessary for what we're doing some occasions would call for it so we're not going to do that so everything is considered factored the next thing we're going to do we're going to write that radical as a one-half power because that is a square root we're also going to explicitly show that there is a product here now here's the order in which you undo or expand these logarithms i can't say you always separate products first you always move your exponent to the front first i can't say that because it really depends here's how to know what to do first this is not in a textbook you just have to look at it and figure it out here it is what operation is connecting the entire argument of your logarithm what's holding it together at this moment is it an exponent is that exponent holding all this together or is it the product there's only two things going on there's a couple exponents and there's a product here so we factor okay it's factored we make sure our radical is written as an exponent if we have one we show products and or quotients everywhere we can and then we look and see what operation is connecting this thing right now what's holding all of this together is that product there's no quotient but that exponent is not applied to the entire argument neither is this one so it's got to be the product that's holding together separate that first so we look over here how do we separate products well we know that we can make two logarithms that are added together with the same base since our base is e we're going to write ln and we know that logarithms are added together when we expand our multiplication or product within our unit of our logarithm and then we do the same exact thing we take a look at this now these should be factored of course and all of our radicals are still written as exponents that's only it's only done one time then we're good for the rest of our expansion here but then we consider what is holding this together what is holding that argument together is anything i can't expand is there a product a quotient or an exponent it's only three that we really look for well there's an exponent and that is on top of all of this argument if you will or applied to the entire argument that's something we can expand so we look down at our power property we understand that any sort of an exponent can be written as a coefficient so we're going to move that two likewise this argument or this factor i suppose has a one-half power applied to all of it so we can move that that's an exponent we can move it as a coefficient and we're done expanding now you might ask what about that one can't you expand that no you can't the only things in logarithms you can actually expand into additional logarithms or moving exponents to the front is with these three properties there's no way to expand subtraction or by addition so if we see a minus or plus you're done do we have to put parentheses here yes absolutely we need to show that that that logarithm has a one minus x as its argument we can't we can't miss that because otherwise it's very confusing if we did ln of one minus x that would be zero times one half minus x we want to make sure that we understand that's the that's the thing that's inside that logarithm so this is as much as we can do we've looked at it we've made sure it's factored our radicals our exponents we then look at what is connecting the entire argument we separate that one piece and then we continue to look inside each argument say what's connecting this one okay an exponent what's connecting this one okay an exponent's on top of all that then we start undoing as much as we can when we get down to the point where we have individual factors individual term factors or factors that have more than one term in them you're done that's as far as we can go let's take a look at the next example so the first thing we're understanding is that this is a logarithm it's got a base of five and wow there's a lot going on in here number one thing in your head is when you see expansion of logarithms i need you to factor stuff so this is factored x squared plus one you can't go anymore that's an irreducible quadratic you've seen it many times but x squared minus 1 is certainly factorable and we need to factor that right right away the other thing we're going to do is every single time we see a radical we're going to write that as an exponent that allows us to notice in our power property usually at the end here that we can move that as a coefficient so we've looked you said yep factor x minus 1 x plus 1 we know that that was written a power one half but it's x squared plus one that entire thing is inside that radical there's an inside parenthesis and then it has that exponent to it now what we do is the most important part we look and see how this argument is connected so what is joining this together is it an exponent or is it multiplication and division so we're going to show as much as we can we know that this is division that's pretty good we know that that because it's already shown we know that that's multiplication and we know that that exponent is connecting just to this numerator so the thing that's joining this is multiplication and division the overarching operators here are multiplication division we're going to undo those first notice how the exponent is not applied to everything if it was that would be the first thing we're doing but it's not here it's just being applied to the numerator multiplication division is connecting the rest of the stuff so we're going to explain that first now listen real carefully you can do all of this at once if you follow a very simple principle things or factors on the numerator are positive or added logarithms and things on the denominator are subtracted logarithms those factors on the denominator create subtracted logarithms that's really important because what happens is sometimes when we try to do this in multiple steps it gets way way confusing and we start making sign errors so i've seen it from time to time where where teachers or textbooks will say okay now first thing you do is take this subtract the logarithm of both those terms well because those terms are multiplied you would show addition and then you'd have to distribute a negative through that's much more confusing than what i'm about to show you here so what i'm going to show you is look at all your factors that are connected by multiplication and division the factors on the numerator are going to get positive logarithms to start and add it for every factor that's on the numerator on the denominator we're going to subtract logarithms that contain each of those factors so what that looks like here is we're going to start with our numerator factors we're going to go okay well we're going to have a log base 5 and we're going to take the first numerator factor that we see well there's only one of them there's x squared plus one it's an irreducible quadratic ratio to the one third power so that's a positive logarithm that's great now since we've exhausted all of the factors on our numerator we're going to look at the factors on the denominator but we're going to understand something very very important every one of those factors that's on the denominator is going to create a subtraction of the logarithm it's going to do this for every factor that's down here so if we want to extend this a little bit let's say that this also had maybe a k we would have log base a of m minus log base a of n minus log base a of k you subtract a logarithm for every one of those factors and the reason that that would happen is because if you did it a different way i'm going to kind of show this down here if you showed it this way and you did log base a of m minus log base a of n times k well you could separate that by addition but that would be inside this big bracket and that minus would eventually distribute i hope you see that i'm going to show that here in just a moment but that's true so let's continue now that we have these bro all factored up and we know what our numerator denominator factors are all our numerator is positive now we're going to subtract for each factor so log base 5 of x minus 1 that's one factor on the denominator minus log base 5 of x plus 1. we are almost done the last thing we've got to do is reevaluate all of our logarithms and see if we can expand them further so log base 5 x plus 1 you cannot expand addition minus 1 you cannot expand subtraction there's no exponent holding any of those arguments together this exponent does need to move to a as a coefficient when we're expanding so we want to undo as much as possible using these properties so we're going to take that write this as 1 3 and then a log base 5 of x squared plus 1. we need parentheses and we need parentheses on every one of those arguments that's as expanded as we can get now i did say that i would show you it a slightly different way as i mentioned this if you want to understand a little bit more about why we're subtracting a logarithm with each of these factors on the denominator and and you didn't quite follow what i said i can show you right here explicitly what would happen is that if you were to subtract numerator minus log containing denominator looks like that and if we further understand that well because that's a product we can expand that as well via two logarithms being added now this is obviously different from this that's a problem and here's why it's a problem when you subtract this logarithm well you're subtracting everything that that becomes as well so really what we would have is this bracket around that and by subtracting each one of those terms you end up getting this exact thing this is why i teach it the way that i do just look at the factors on the denominator and subtract logarithms containing each of them because that that puts all of this in summary and lets you kind of make a shortcut instead of having to show a bracket and then a distribution when in fact you can get the same thing by understanding what's really happening you're just subtracting logarithms that contain the factors on the denominator and you're adding logarithms that contain the factors on your numerator that's really all there is to it we're going to come back we're going to do that one i'll show you something quite similar all right let's go ahead and do one more so we're taking a look at this we know we want to factor everything it is factored we have x plus one x minus two quantity squared x minus one nothing can be additionally factored but we are going to do is write this radical as a one-half power and then we're going to show all the products and quotients that they're not already shown so we have a product here and here the quotient we can clearly see so then we look and this is the most important part just look at the operations that are connecting this argument because these exponents are just on these individual factors it's multiplication and division that's holding this together well we're going to separate that first every factor on the numerator is going to create positive logs or logs that are added together every factor in the denominator we're going to separate those by subtracted logarithms so log of x cubed plus log of x plus 1 to the one-half and then minus these factors inside these logarithms so log of x minus 2 to the second power and then minus log of x minus 1. so since that's all done in one step there's really only one more thing we need to do we re-evaluate each of these logarithms and look to see if they have anything else holding that argument together that can be expanded in these cases just a few exponents so x minus 1 is factored you cannot expend subtraction x minus two to the second power we can move that two this one half yeah we can't move that to the front as a coefficient and so can a three and so we moved to all of them we have that 3 as a coefficient the one half is a coefficient of 2 is a coefficient and that looks pretty good this is as far as we can go so this is what we would call fully expanded every product and every quotient has been expanded as addition and subtraction respectively and all of our exponents have been moved as coefficients i hope it's making sense to you i hope you're seeing it's not really that big of a deal um not really that hard as long as you're following these these properties that i've given to you again the main thing is write out factored versions of your expression once you've done that make sure that all radicals are written as exponents then look at what is connecting your argument usually it's products and quotients which we can expand all at one time factors on the numerator create positive logarithms or ones being added factors on the denominator create negative logarithms or ones being subtracted usually i deal with the numerator factors first and then the denominator factors after that we move our exponents as coefficients and then we're done all right let's go through two more examples quite quickly so the first one we're taking a look at that is a natural logarithm so it is a log we're going to firstly make sure everything's factored it looks like it's factored just fine we're going to change every one of those radicals which is only one of them into a 1 3 power in this case and then show our products between there the reason why we're doing this example is we can't forget that 4 and 5 are actually factors and they do need to be expanded even though they're constant factors they do need to be shown as ln of 5 and ln of 4 somewhere so we're going to show that so we've got 5 times x squared times seven minus two x and that's being raised to the one third power all over i'm gonna show this explicitly four times x plus one squared so what that lets me do that says that we've got really one two three four five different factors some of them have exponents but they're all connected by multiplication and or division so i've shown that i've shown that it's all factored i've moved this as a radical into a rational exponent i've shown my multiplication so we're going to do is understand that because this argument is connected by multiplication division i'm going to choose to expand that first i really don't want to be dealing with those exponents because they're not applied to all the factors that has to come later with individual logarithms that are being added or subtracted in this case so every factor that's on the numerator all one two three of them i'm gonna write that as a positive ln five and then plus ln for every one of those factors so ln 5 and then plus ln x squared and then plus ln of 7 minus 2x to the one third well that was all divided by two factors here four and x plus one squared so for every factors on the denominator i'm going to subtract a logarithm containing that factor so all numerator 1 2 3 became logarithms which each with each of those factors inside and then added or positive and each of the factors on the denominator created logarithms with those particular factors but being subtracted and now we're going to take a look at it see if anything else is connecting each of these logarithms this is fully expanded you can't do anything more with that but this has an exponent we can move that to the front of this coefficient so does this one and so is that one this you can't expand we're done that's as much as we can expand out of this logarithm that's a lot of them that's what five different logarithms there's no more exponents that's really nice because that means that things that we do with this are a little bit easier when you don't have to deal with a cube root instead that's just a one-third as a coefficient that's nicer to deal with in a lot of cases also don't expand pluses please don't do that or minuses you can't do that we've done as much as possible to expand this particular logarithm and that's it also the order of our factors doesn't really matter as long as the signs go with the appropriate factors from where they came from so denominator factors need to have negative logarithms uh numerator factors you need to have positive logarithms and that's that's what we need to just understand out of taking this and expand it as fully as possible i hope that i'm making sense to you i hope that you're understanding that the idea is just following those rules that we've shown and looking at what is connecting the argument in your logarithm expanding that first all right last one for now well this is a little bit different in that because we've got that two-thirds power that's on the entire argument that logarithm base 10 logarithm and it's not factored so when we approach these things and we need to expand this for whatever reason you're asked to number one thing to do factor everything first thank you that is true all the time for these logarithms we're trying to expand them so don't do anything without ex without factoring first so we're going to do that we're going to factor x squared minus 9. we're going to check that x minus 4 is factored and it is we don't have any radicals explicitly written but i do want you to notice something do you notice that a two-thirds power is a radical i could have given this to you as a really big cube root of all this junk squared now that'd be pretty nasty to me to do that but i could have done that and then you would have written it as instead of a cube root as that two-thirds power so i've given it to you like this but that is possible now at this point you have an option before you do the option i do want to say something if possible you can simplify these so if this had been x minus 3 you could have simplified this before you it now we have a domain issue there but we have domain issues here anyway so that that would be something that is possible to do so check in the in your logarithms to see if you can you can simplify your factors that's possible legal and you should do it so here we can't simplify but we certainly could have checked that after you factor or later on when we're combining logarithms what you combine can be simplified some of the times so now that we've done that you have options here are your options number one option you can look at this as one expression that's raised to the two third power because this here's the key you gotta look at what's connecting the entire thing because this is over all of this argument you can move this to the front of your logarithm first and be fine that's true you can do that in fact i'm going to do that that's option 1. option 2 is because exponents distribute across multiplication and division you can apply that exponent to every one of those factors okay if you do that then multiplication and division would now be connecting your logarithm and you can separate by by addition subtraction and then move your exponents later either one works i can show you both so i'm going to do option one first let's move that as a coefficient now because we've moved the exponent that's no longer there the rest of this logarithm is connected by multiplication division which we're going to separate by addition and subtraction of respective logarithms depending on where they came from the numerator denominator so log of x minus 4 squared minus a log for each of these factors however i'm hoping you see it there's something missing here you see when we have that two-thirds in front of this logarithm and we expand the logarithm much like the minus in front of a logarithm that we're expanding it's going to distribute and so we show that because all of this junk came from that logarithm that two-thirds also goes to all that junk so we're going to do that but we're going to fully expand before we do that so that's done we can't factor you can't separate it that's done you can't factor you can't separate there's no exponent this you can't factor or separate it but you can move that exponent to the to the front of the coefficient and lastly we can distribute that two-thirds so two-thirds times two is four-thirds and everything else gets a minus two-thirds and a minus two-thirds that's what we call fully expanded so there's nothing else that we can possibly break up everything's been distributed there's no exponents there's no multiplication no division inside of any of those logarithms this is what we mean by expanding logarithms so i'm going to show you the different way here and say well what if you what if you want to distribute that through first would you get anything different no and some people prefer it so i wanted to give you both to give you options the main point is look at what is connecting the whole logarithm and deal with that first whether you have to distribute the exponent or move it to the front that's fine but you have to deal with that first so let's take a look at what if i were to distribute that well because exponents raised to exponents as multiplication you would get a log of x minus 4 to the four thirds over x minus three and x plus three both to the two thirds because one times two-thirds of both cases is two-thirds you might be able to see right now that we're going to get exactly the same thing you see now that we've distributed that everything's connected by multiplication and division we would show our multiplication whenever you have it and every one of the factors of the numerator is going to create a positive or added logarithm all the factors on the denominator create a subtracted or negative logarithm so we have positive and then subtract subtract for those factors on the denominator and then we're going to move our exponents so that's about it that's fully expanded just like what we thought we would get it doesn't matter which order you go again the idea is factor everything make sure your radicals are exponents and look at what is connecting your logarithm just deal with that first somehow whether it's an exponent you want to distribute or move to the front or multiplication division where we want to separate that into addition and subtraction respective logarithms i hope this makes sense to you very useful for a lot of things that we do in math i'm going to come back with another video on how to combine so basically going opposite what we've just done 

Transcript for: How to Combine Logarithms (Precalculus - College Algebra 60)
hey there now that we've learned how to expand logarithms we're going to go the other way we're going to combine them so same rules but you've noticed i've written them in a different order i've written them in a way that we can combine so when we see two logarithms with the same base that have been added or two logarithms have been subtracted or a coefficient in front of a logarithm we can combine those into a more condensed version of a logarithm two logarithms being added can create one logarithm that has a product in that argument subtraction creates a quotient inside one logarithm not two logarithms so you divide it that's really important and the coefficient can be moved as an exponent just like before we move an exponent to a coefficient so we're going to practice that this is very very useful for what we're doing when we solve some equations that have logarithms in them it's really really useful to be able to combine those things it's important we have to be able to do it so that's mostly why we're covering this right now so let's get started just like an expansion you'll look for for what's connecting that logarithm we're going to basically undo that idea so we separated products and quotients typically first and then exponents last we did have some options in there but in this case we really don't have any options there's one order in how you combine logarithms number one you take any coefficient that you have and you move it as an exponent in whatever that logarithm whatever's inside of that logarithm so we're going to take a look move our exponents first after that we combine any logarithms that are they have the same base that are being added or subtracted so let's take a look at our first example number one thing when we notice we have coefficients and we have logarithms the same base and we're asked to combine these things move your coefficients first as exponents so that means we have log base 3 of x to the one-half power minus log base 3 of x to the third that's our first step every time after that we look to see if we have added or subtracted logarithms since we have a subtraction we're going to create a quotient inside of one logarithm that's really important we don't do we don't have a logarithm over a logarithm that's not correct this doesn't say that we have log a of m over log a of n says log base a of m over n you see why why it's so important is we're going to have the change of base formula in the next video where we do have a logarithm over a logarithm with the same base that's a different thing that we're going to do with that so since we have log base 3 minus another log base 3 we can create 1 log base 3. with our two arguments of our logarithms being divided now once we've done that it's very very important for us to be able to simplify this so when we simplify when we have common bases being divided you're going to get this most often when you have subtraction two logarithms you need to simplify so three minus one half now you can do one half minus three get a negative exponent move back down to the denominator that's fine but 3 minus 1 half is going to be 2 and a half or 5 halves so we're going to get 1 over x to the 5 halves if you needed to do one-half minus three change it back into one over x to the five-halves to get that that's perfectly fine lastly sometimes you'll be asked to write this as a radical so x to the 5 half's power creates log base 3 of 1 over that's a square root with x to the fifth as its radicand you should put parentheses around this so that we are not confused that that is outside some logarithm that's it so we can combine this as log base 3 of 1 over square root of x to the fifth should we rationalize it maybe we could be asked to do that sometimes we can leave it sometimes we can't really depends on what you're doing with it i'm going to leave that but if you had to rationalize it you could multiply well you could simplify this i guess i am going to show tape x to the 5 half's power is x squared with the square root of x rationalizing means take the radical part and make the power match the root on the denominator we'd have to multiply by a square root to do that this would give you an x squared square root of x times square root of x is x and so we would get square root of x over x cubed inside of that logarithm that's as complete as i can make this problem uh really we could probably have here but i want to show you some other options of how you can see this so if you get this and your answer looks like that and you go what are you wrong nothing nothing they're just they're just manipulating a little bit they're saying x to the 5 power is the square root of x to the fifth i can make x squared and x squared and have an extra x in there simplify both those you get x squared square root of x i can rationalize the denominator and end up getting square root of x over x cubed that's really all all that is the primary thing i'm trying to teach you is how to get from here to here that's the idea let's move on a little bit so the next one we're looking at this we're asked to combine we see a log base four and log base four the first thing we do whenever we're combining logarithms is we're going to move our coefficients as exponents now we don't have one here but we do have a five you move the 5 do you with a negative 5. well you can move this as a negative 5 and change it to a plus and then multiply logarithms together it's really easiest to move the 5 and subtract it's you're going to get the same thing it's a lot easier to do so don't mess around with moving this with the sign unless you unless you only have one logarithm and it is negative sometimes we can do that and it's helpful but in general just move this as a power five so we're going to do that first notice what we're not doing we're not factoring first this is the literal opposite of expanding logarithms in expanding we factored everything first and we use that to create these products well here when we're going backwards we're going to factor last and you need to simplify whatever our quotient is remember that that 5 because that's an exponent it needs to be an exponent on the entire expression so x minus 1 all to the fifth power now what we're going to do is we're going to look at whether we're adding subtracting since we're subtracting here we're going to create one logarithm with a quotient so i'm going to get to this when we get to that example and the one after that every positive logarithm or logarithm being added is going to create a factor on the numerator for you every logarithm that's being subtracted or negative is going to create a factor on the denominator for you you should do this all in one step don't do like five different steps do it all at once positive logarithm that factor goes in the numerator minus or negative logarithm same base that factor goes on the denominator and now now we have to simplify so now is the time where we factor and see if anything cancels out so x squared minus 1 factors is x minus 1 and x plus one well that's something that we can simplify since we have an x plus one x minus one over x plus one to the fifth power this factor and one of those factors actually do simplify so we end up getting log base four of x minus one over x plus one to the fourth a lot of students get here and they leave it because they forget to check that the reason why i'm showing this problem to you is so that you do check your simplification it's the literal opposite of your expansion and so when you get down to the end you gotta factor and check to see if you can simplify it can happen a lot when we're combining some logarithms so we're taking a look we're saying exponents first submerge this coefficient at exponents every positive logarithm creates a factor on the numerator or added logarithm creates a factor on the numerator every negative logarithm creates a factor that's not every subtracted logarithm creates a factor on the denominator just put it all together and since we've dealt with exponents first we don't have to do anything else besides simplify at that point okay moving right along so we got another one we're going to combine this first thing we do is we look for any exponents or any coefficients that move as exponents and we don't have any well that's okay what we're going to do now is notice that because these all have the same base of b they're all natural logarithms we can combine this with products and quotients in one logarithm one ln not three different ones we're trying to get one and so we're going to create one quotient every logarithm that's added or positive is going to create a factor of the numerator every logarithm that's negative or subtract it creates a factor on the denominator so we just got to look at this and say because they're all the same base because we're adding and we're subtracting we can connect by uh by multiplication and with division and so we're just going to notice where those things go so create one logarithm create a big fraction all of the factors of these two logarithms so ln of x over x minus one well that's positive that's going to create this as a factor on the numerator plus okay plus means i'm connecting by a product plus product this you create a factor on my numerator now it is a factor we are multiplying there minus okay when we subtract or we have a negative logarithm when we're combining via subtraction here we're creating a factor on the denominator whatever's being subtracted that creates a factor on your denominator just like the positive creative factor on your numerator so we're going to put this as a factor here man i hope that makes sense i hope that you're seeing that addition positive numerator subtraction negative denominator we're combining it one time we're just using these two properties at once to create this this quotient that has factors appropriately depending on whether we're adding or subtracting we're doing these properties but it's nice to do it one time so don't get confused with different steps where you go that's harder to do well now we had to simplify we didn't factor first we didn't have to but now after we've combined via products and quotients depending on whether we have addition subtraction we've got a factor we have to simplify so we're going to do that and writing that way also might help to help you to see that we can simplify sometimes so x on the numerator x on the denominator we're multiplying fractions here we could write one fraction that simplifies and that makes things a little bit nicer to see even now that is a complex fraction and how we simplify complex fractions is typically we multiply the main numerator this part and the main denominator this part by whatever the lcd is so in this case the lcd comes from whatever complex fraction is so we take a look at that that's x plus one over x minus one our lcd is x minus one if we multiply both the numerator and denominator by that lcd it's going to simplify the denominator for the complex fraction that's usually what happens there are other ways to do it i like this technique it works in my opinion the most concise but you can do it other ways so in this case we say all right we multiply by the lcd lcd always cancel out the denominator of our complex fractions it doesn't cancel out anything here this is all in the numerator the only denominator here is one the diameter here is where we got our our lcd from the x minus one this goes away so that's gonna cancel we're just gonna get x plus one over whatever this is i'm all right well when we don't cancel this this is going to end up giving us x minus 1 squared times x plus 1. and we're going to see one more thing so cancel here lcd does that with complex fractions x plus 1 we got it x minus 1 times x minus 1. this is not on a denominator this is multiplying right to it that's going to be x minus 1 squared and x plus one and then we see okay we have a factor over a factor everything's multiplied together it's all factored looks really good this is also going to simplify [Music] leaving us with 1 over x minus 1 squared and that's as simple as we can get so ln of 1 over x minus 1 squared wow that's a lot nicer to work with than that is for most of things that we're going to do especially if we have to solve anything with an equation because you're going to combine those anyway so we're really going opposite we're moving our exponents of coefficients of exponents first combining everything at once all of our subtraction addition creates corresponding factors in one logarithm of numerators for addition and positives and denominators for subtraction or negatives and then we factor and simplify that's actually the hardest part is okay so you're factoring then you're getting rid of the complex fraction and then you're simplifying more that can take the most work all right moving on just a little bit we got two more examples this next one just a little bit of work of simplification here that i want you to see also that when we have multiple things that are being added subtract and we can just group those together as products on numerators or products and denominators depending whether addition or subtraction so let's take a look at it first thing whenever we're combining let's move all of our coefficients as exponents first so that's going to be log base 3 of you can also choose to write these cube roots as exponents themselves that'll make it nicer if you have to move other exponents because you can multiply them a little bit nicer than you can with the actual radical so log base 3 great let's write that as x to the one third power so this is x to the one third power but when i take that 21 as an exponent now hopefully you see what i'm saying it's a little bit nicer to think of one-third times 21 than a cube root to the 21st power that's a little bit more awkward for some people log base 3 of 9 question could you change that could you simplify that right now and do 2 because log base 3 of 9 is 2. 2 to what power gives you 9. 2. could you do it yes and you could but you wouldn't be able to combine it with the rest of these logarithms so if our goal is to get one logarithm you don't want to simplify it if that's not our goal maybe you would in some cases but right now we're trying to combine this into one logarithm and so we're not going to simplify that i hope that makes sense we do need to move that 2. and this doesn't have any any exponent for us another thing that you could see hopefully you do see it could you just take log base 3 of 9 and log base 3 of 9 and subtract it yeah you could and sometimes books do this and we know we don't catch them we go wait a minute could you just get rid of that yeah you can but i want to show you what's going to happen because sometimes we can see this or miss it but later on we'll see that it simplifies i want to show you right now whether you subtract them here or whether you create one fraction and simplify them in the fraction it doesn't it doesn't matter now that would be quicker what i just talked about but i want you to see the point of putting this together in one one fraction and using division to simplify that way we we kind of validate that that's possible there so i want to see that so we've moved our coefficients as exponents we know that we could simplify this to do 2 and 2 here hey 3 to what power gives you 9 2 2 minus 2 is 0. great because you do log base 3 of 9 minus base 3 and 9 is 0. yes you could could you make this one fraction anyway if you missed it you get the same answer yeah there's lots of options as long as you follow the properties that i've given you you really can't get it wrong so we know that if we want to combine this into one logarithm it's going to be a log base 3. it's going to be a fraction because we have both positive and addition logarithms and subtraction or negative logarithms every one of the logarithms that's positive or being added creates a factor on the numerator so i'm going to have a factor of x to the 1 3 to the 21st power now could you right now simplify that and say 1 3 times 21 is 7 absolutely and that's exactly what we're going to do so this is x to the 7th power 1 3 times 1 21 is 7. times because we're adding addition creates products x to the 7th power times 9 addition creates products times x squared subtraction creates factors on the denominator quotients for us so minus log base 9 that creates over 9 and check out what happens whether you simplify here or create two and two and simplify there or nine divided by nine you need to be able to see that we are simplifying that that would create one if we further continue now we're just going to combine some some common bases by multiplication that means we're going to add those exponents log base 3 of x to the ninth power that's as simple as you can make it as combined as we can do i hope it makes sense i hope i'm really really making it make it sink into your head about how you connect some of these factors as products and quotients depending on whether they're added or subtracted terms we're going to come back with one more and make it as crazy as i can and then we'll go through it together all right so that's about as much as i could think of before i ran out of space on the board so let's go ahead and do that one if we're going to combine some logarithms and it's very important to do this in a lot of cases when we're solving equations you need to get one logarithm we're always going to move coefficients and make them into exponents of whatever our factors are inside of our logarithm so we're going to take a look at this move every single one of those coefficients not the signs just the numbers so that's 2 as an exponent 1 4 as an exponent of x minus 1. 2x plus 3 to the 3 8 power minus log of x to the one fifth power log of two to the fourth and then hey that doesn't have an exponent log of 12. now we are going to combine all this at one time because this is these are all logarithms of the same base and they're being joined together by addition and subtraction we're going to create one huge fraction and then we're going to go through and depending on whether we're adding or subtracting we're going to organize these factors in the appropriate numerator or denominator so positive says i'm going to put that factor on the numerator minus says i'm going to put that factor on the denominator plus says i'm going to put that factor on the numerator minus says i would put that factor on the denominator minus says i'm going to put that factor on the denominator and plus says i'm going to put that factor on the numerator could you do it differently yes but i've never seen a more concise way to do it when we understand that addition creates products these are all products subtraction creates quotients that's a quotient that's a quotient and that's a quotient if i were to expand this those are all on denominators there that's the easiest way i've ever i've ever seen how to do it or created how to do it now what we're going to do is if you have to have you can write these as radicals so i'm going to show that to you there's not much to simplify except for this right here you should expand that and say that that is 16. 12 over 16 we can simplify so i'm going to write this 12 first change that into 16 and organize a little bit better and also write these as radicals so 12 we got it 16 is here i'm gonna have x plus one to the second and i'm going to write this as an eighth root of 2x plus 3 all to the third power if this is in parenthesis that has to be in parenthesis two if you have a power that's greater than one so we have three we gotta have eighth root that's power here root here so eighth root of two x plus three to the third power our numerator looks pretty good we're going to simplify this in a moment all the things i'm going to do since i took that as 16 here i typically write single term factors before any multiple term factors so that's a fifth root of x then a fourth root of x minus one we don't need parentheses here and the only reason why we don't is because that's a power one that's a radical four and a power one so fourth root of x minus one to the first you don't need parentheses we're going to simplify the 12 and the 16. 4 goes into 12 three times and 16 four times but nothing else really simplifies there are ways that you could combine these radicals but it becomes pretty cumbersome and it's not going to be generally any better for you you can do it if you have to you have to but i'm going to leave it this way all right that's about as good as i can see how to combine that i hope that that makes sense and we're going to see this in just a couple videos when we start solving logarithms without common actually with n without common bases we do we do this in both cases and also in calculus we see it from time to time so i hope that you enjoy the videos i will see in a little bit for change your base then we get into solving you 

Transcript for: How to Change the Base of a Logarithm (Precalculus - College Algebra 61)
welcome to another video so this is a very short video this is just about how the change of base formula for logarithms works um where it's important and we see it a lot and it's also going to help you evaluate if you ever need to evaluate some logarithms and your calculator won't let you change a base from 10 or e so it won't let you evaluate for that so i've written the change of base formula twice you'll see it because sometimes we forget especially when we're just learning this that formulas are a lot of times two-way streets so here's what the change of base formula says it says if you have a logarithm with whatever base you you have you can always change the base of your logarithm by creating a ratio pick whatever base you want so if i have log base i don't know whatever a you can change it to log base anything of b over log base same same base of a i usually like to say the bass goes in i used to teach it a long time ago the bass goes in the basement like on the denominator so the argument is in the attic and the base goes in the basement it was super cheesy but it actually worked so if your argument goes to the top on your numerator and your base goes to the bottom in your denominator and you can pick whatever different base you want this is going to create the same exact expression as that does it's very useful a different way that we can can combine logarithms it's the last one or expand logarithms the last one typically what do you want for your base well you're probably not going to change a base of 3 into a base of square root of 11 because that'd be really difficult to use and work with so normally we're changing our base that we don't necessarily want to use or that we have a hard time evaluating into a log base 10 comma log or a log base e natural log that is by far the most common why your calculators almost all of them have the ability to plug in log base 10 and log base e log and natural log but not necessarily a lot of the bases if they do then this is fine it's a great format no problem leave it but a lot of times it won't let you so if you have log base 5 of 18 and you go i can't even plug that into my calculator most of you can't can we change it to a log base 10 or log base e yes if we use a ratio we can do that you've also noticed that i've written this backwards that's because we should understand that if i have two logs with the same base being divided this is not a subtraction it does not create a fraction inside your logarithm it does not create subtraction please don't go back and relearn what i just taught you in the last video please don't do that this right here you can combine it but it takes change of base to do it you can't expand it but it takes change of base to do it so two logs being divided with the same base you create one logarithm and this denominator becomes your base this numerator becomes the argument of your logarithm fascinating stuff so let's get back to this example how would we expand this well we can take and make any any logarithm we want provided we create this ratio of 2 log of the same base so i can pick log base anything over log base anything as long as the same base with 18 as the argument of the numerator logarithm and 5 as the argument of the denominator logarithm now i could put a 7 i could put a square root of seven i could put a seven i'd put 700 if i really wanted to but that might not help as much as keeping this log base 10. so on your calculator if you had to evaluate log base 5 of 18 you probably would do log 18 close that parenthesis divide log 5 and it will give you the decimal approximation for what that is the other way and you should try both the other way what if you picked log base e well i can change this just like this into any logarithm with whatever base i want provided i make a ratio with this log in the same base so ln that's log base e ln that's all of hc make sure your 18 goes here and your 5 goes here argument on the numerator base the denominator now you should try it and hopefully it's it works for you well try log press the log button press 18 close your parentheses divide by log 5. then try ln 18 close your parenthesis and then divide by ln5 they don't give you the same number so while they look different all of these represent the same exact expression they all are the same exact number just different ways to look at it different bases that we have same stuff so we're going to practice two more very very quickly i'm not going to go with any other base besides log base 10 or log base e because those are by far the most common you can put whatever base you want here it doesn't really matter and sometimes that suits you sometimes it really helps to do that to have a certain base for whatever problem you have but that depends on the context in general we usually use a common log or natural log so i'm going to show a common log here and a natural log here for a certain reason so log base square root of 5 no one has to deal with square root of 5 is the base of seven we're going to separate this and we're going to make something a little bit easier for us to deal with so i'm going to pick two logs of the same base whatever that base is in this case it's log base 10. i'm going to make sure that my 7 goes on my numerator and my square root of 5 goes in my denominator if you had to evaluate this now you could you could press log 7 close your parentheses divide log of square root of five and it's going to give you a decimal approximation for whatever that is because this is really awkward to think about uh what power do you need to raise the square root of five to in order to get seven that's really difficult this will allow you to to approximate that and it will give you that exponent which is kind of interesting the last one log base pi of e wow we're really trying to screw it up here aren't we um log base pi of e well that might be quite difficult to plug into a calculator if you're if it does not allow you to plug in for base now let me say this if it does allow you to you can just use that some calculators do say log whatever your base is pi and then of e it'll give you a decimal approximation but even still sometimes we need to write this with a base e or base 10. now i'm not going to choose a common log because i'm looking at my problem understanding that i've got an e there if i have an e it's going to be really nice if i use a logarithm with the same base so i'm going to pick a base of e so log base e over log base e why do i do that well because i've seen the e and when we compose functions which is e to the first power oh it's an exponential raised to the first power over a log base e that inherently this is very important for our solving just a little bit the next video next two videos if you compose a function with this inverse so in other words you pick a log that matches the base of your exponential you've inherently matched a function with this inverse that composition is going to simplify it's going to give you 1. do you remember that remember this base of e this says e raised to what power gives you e to the first that would be one or you have a function composed of its inverse or if ln match up with e you're basically the same we had a property for that either way you go that is getting to be a one this simplifies ln of pi does not simplify and that's as good as we can make it now that should actually kind of uh begin the question so can you do something a little bit different with stuff like this the answer is yeah you can you can pick a different base that matches a piece of it that you want to simplify so what if i didn't pick log base 10. now well we normally would do that what if i didn't what if it benefited me like we're going to see in some of our solving very limited but similar solving what if i picked log base 18. why well because what if i needed my numerator to be one for some reason or what if i needed these bases to switch well i could do that we would get log base 18 of 18. oh my gosh is it exponential compose on a logarithm of the same base that's going to give you one over log base 18 of five you know wait a minute did the bass and the argument just change spots yes and that's exactly what happened here this was our base e was our argument right now e is our base and pi is an argument but it's on the denominator just like this is now on the reverse of this is now on the denominator it's kind of kind of interesting hopefully you see that um so sometimes that's relevant for us we can always match up whatever base we want so we can always pick whatever base we want for the logarithm as long as you use the change of base formula to do it so i hope that makes sense um that's just a little bit of practice making sure we understand how this works as far as expanding combining we see this more when we're solving logarithms so i'll show that to you when we get there most of the time you're going this way so that you can evaluate things a little bit easier hope you enjoy the videos i will see you for another one in just a bit you 

Transcript for: Solving Logarithms with Common Bases (Precalculus - College Algebra 62)
welcome to another video so in this video we finally get down to putting some things together and starting to solve some logarithms and then exponential equations in the next couple videos so when we're solving logarithms i want to say that this would be a special case much like we saw a special case of exponentials we're going to deal in this video with the special case of what would happen if you have an equation where every single term happens to be a logarithm and a logarithm of the same base can we solve it very very simply the answer is yes if we have an equation with all of our terms being logarithms and they're all the same base and we can combine them all and get one logarithm on one side equal to another logarithm on the other side with the same base then we can set the insides of those arguments equal to one another much like we do with exponentials that's what we're going to learn in this video i do want to say that this is not the general case so in the next video we're going to say well what happens if you can't do that well then we're going to need exponentials and in general if you ever want to solve a logarithmic equation you are going to need an exponential to solve that the only x exception of that is if you can have this situation where you have common bases so let's jump right into it what would happen if you have one logarithm equal to another logarithm with the same base well if that's true the only possible way these things could be equal is if their insides x and y or the arguments of these are also equal we saw something very very similar in solving exponentials with common bases we said hey if our bases are equal then our exponents also have to be equal to keep this equation true and that's the same situation we have so the notes i i have down here for you are the same thing as the notes that i just mentioned this only works if every term's a logarithm and only if you have the same bases because then and only then can you set the insides equal these were different bases you'd be done there's not really much we can do as far as a special case is concerned with that now we can do some things with exponentials but not if our bases are different and not if we have a constant so how do you tell this video from the next one if you have a constant up here being added or subtracted not all logarithms or different bases then then this does not work this is a very very special case and just gets our feet wet with how we start thinking about solving these and that we can do it without an exponential in some cases also i want to tell you just a reminder that when we start any sort of a logarithmic equation before we start combining things we really should be thinking of the domain and understanding that in logarithms the inside of your logarithm always has to be strictly greater than zero it can't even equal zero so we're going to do a lot of things up here like combine some logarithms oh yeah we need to know how to do that combine some logarithms with division and we'll be thinking well aren't we breaking an x a a domain rule by doing that no because all of the insides of our logarithms inherently have to be positive to make them work anyway positive means you can't even let them equal zero so anything that does is not okay anything that creates an inside negative is not okay what that means if you want to wrap everything in a nutshell is whatever our solutions are we need to check those to make sure that our insides of our logarithms are not becoming negative by putting them in what that doesn't mean you don't just go cross not every negative i know it's kind of fine but that's not the idea the idea is check your solutions make sure they are making the inside of your your logarithms positive so let's get into it log base 4 of x plus 2 equals log base 4 of 8. this is a very simple concept this is a very special case we notice that there's logarithms everywhere there's one on one side one on the other side and they have the same base when this happens you can set your insights equal that's plain and simply what all of this says and by doing that we get something that's very nice to solve subtracting 2 we get x equals 6. take the time check your work does this make that negative no it looks good and log base four of eight six plus two is eight equals log base four of a and then that's a true statement so that is our one and only one solution what we do from here is when we take a look at our equations and we we see that we have logarithms i want you to start categorizing them do i have all logs with the same base or do i have logs of different bases or some terms that aren't logarithms like constants or other variables well that would be a different category so we're going to take a look at it do i have in this equation all logarithms of the same base no other terms added or subtracted oh yeah that looks good okay i'm going to put this in my special category of i'm going to have logarithms with the same base i'm going to be able to set my insides equal to one another however in order to do that it really does have to look like that this is where all of our combining of logarithms comes in combining of logarithms means that if you have more than one of them with the same base and add or subtract it you can combine them to one logarithm if you have any coefficients in front including that negative you can move those as exponents and so we do that first we make it so that we literally have one logarithm equal to another one nothing added subtracted multiplied divided so that three being a coefficient means that i can move that as an exponent and get log base 2 of x to the third power on the right hand side because that negative really stands for negative 1 you can move that as an exponent and get log base 2 of 27 negative 1 power this is what we're looking for we say hey look at this we got we've got two logs the one on each side there's nothing added subtracted multiply divide it and they have the same base if these are going to be equal it can only be the case that our our insides our arguments are also equal so there's not really much work to show here uh like we don't we don't have to cross anything out we just need to understand that the only way this actually happens much like a common basis in exponentials is if x cubed equals 27 negative 1 power now are there ways to do this with exponentials and the answer is yes if we were really smart about it we could say you know i do anything i want to an equation pretty much as long as i do it to both sides could you treat both of these as an exponent of some other base yes we can now if you pick that base of 2 why a base of 2 why would i do that well the longer that's a base of 2. if i choose this as an exponent of some exponential with the base of two i've inherently matched a pow a um a function to its inverse i've composed them i have a base matching a base that would cancel base matching base that would cancel it would set x cubed equal to 27 negative 1 anyway that's exactly what we're doing we're just making it a little bit quicker so now comes the work usually this is where i stop really teaching and this is stuff that we've seen before so this could be some more basic algebra things like you know just remember that a negative one power means a fraction like 1 over 27 remember that when we have an x to the third power and its iso exiting power we can we can match the power to the root and take a radical of both sides things like a cube root also understanding that if we're doing this with a square root we'd have a plus and minus and we're probably gonna have to watch some of our solutions on that because we cannot let any of these solutions make any of our arguments where we started from negative we don't check our work down here we check our work up there in the original so taking the cube root we get x equals one third we're going to pause for just a second make sure we check this take this plug it into the arguments of your logarithm just evaluate that make sure that they are not zero and not negative so one third in here does not cause us to negative notice what i'm not doing i'm not checking it here why not if that were a 2 and that were a power 2 and this happened to be a negative it would make that look like it's positive but that's not where i'm checking it i'm checking it here where it originally came from so just be careful on that check in your original equations all right let's move on just a little bit we got three more this one's going to be pretty quick the other ones are also fairly quick but we want to make sure that we're seeing these appropriately so here's the way to categorize it we're taking a look at it saying i have logarithms of course am i going to need an exponential am i going to just use common bases if all of your terms and there's four here our logarithms with the same base we can combine them and we are looking to get one logarithm equal to another one with the same base now are there other ways to do this there are and they would involve some exponentials but we'd gather all of our logarithms on one side combine them and a constant on the other side even if it's zero however that combining is a lot more work than we really need if we have terms that are all logarithms just combine your sides individually combine the left side combine the right side and then set the insides equal most of the time that's easier so let's go ahead and do that i'm taking a look at and thinking it only works if i have one log in equal to one log so i'm going to combine my left hand side remember in all those properties we learned if we have two logs that are being subtracted it's going to create one logarithm with a quotient in it and the order is really important all the all the logarithms that were positive or added created factors on the numerator all the logarithms that were negative or subtracted created factors on the denominator we did the same thing over here now we had a base of a base of a i don't even know what that is it doesn't matter because it didn't really matter that was a base of two why not because what we did with it with our exponential is we put two we put two we just matched the base well if we have a base of a and base of a what would we do whatever that base is provided it's valid is we would put a base of a and a base of a it doesn't matter what that base is what matters is that you have the same base that's the key here two logarithms they're equal to another with the same base much like two exponentials equal to one another with the same base we set the exponents or the insides equal to one another here we have the same base that the insides of logarithms equal to one another so we have log base a equals log base a this is only true if our insides are equal and this is what i was saying a little bit earlier right now all that's going to happen is that we have some kind of old algebra remember we can do things like proportions if you have one fraction equal to another fraction you can certainly find a cross product so we're going to multiply these and i hope you remember if if you get a power two or higher your idea in general is unless you can isolate that power two or higher you're gonna get everything on one side you're gonna factor it or use one of those techniques that i've taught you in this class and solve it you're gonna get zero on one side because you're essentially gonna use a zero product property over and over again if you don't have that like we didn't we had that here we i we're able to isolate the power and take cube root we're going to have a power 2 and a power 2. we're going to have to see what happens with this now if we can cancel out the power 2 great but in general we get everything on one side if not if you can cancel the power 2 or if you just have a power 1 don't try to factor it try to solve it correctly we're going to see that right here so x squared plus and minus plus 3x and minus x is plus 2x minus 3. we get this x squared plus 4x minus 12. now right here what i was just saying is we have a power 2. in our head we're probably thinking we're going to factor this thing and that would be true if we didn't have a power 2 that was going to cancel out so we're going to simplify we're going to subtract x squared on the idea let's get everything on one side as soon as we get rid of it though that's no longer a factoring problem that's a linear and that means just subtract your smaller variable get rid of your constant and then divide adding 12. so we work that out we get if we add 12 we get 9 equals 2x divided by 2 we get 9 halves is it okay to get a fraction sure is it okay to get negative sure as long as it doesn't make any of my original arguments negative so we would plug this in there you don't check don't check it here check it here so nine halves minus one well nine halves is what four and a half so that would be like four and a half months old that's positive nine halves plus six that's positive minus two that's positive plus three that's positive none of them are zero none of them are negative this is a valid solution for us and you can you can work it out and make sure that it actually does work but that's going to be just fine really what we're looking for is make sure that does not cause any of your inside your logarithms to become negative or zero now i mentioned something a while ago i really wanna delve into a little bit more why are we able to divide this by this in one logarithm and i don't mean the property the property says we can do that and we can do that why are we able to from a domain standpoint because at this point you should be thinking well wait a minute uh i would have a big problem if x equals negative 6 well that's true because now you have this denominator that if you plugged in negative 6 you would have something over 0 something that's undefined that is true that's a problem but look isn't that the same problem that we have here anyway like if x plus six equals zero if you plugged in negative six you would get a logarithm with zero on the inside logarithms have a vertical asymptote there you can't even plug in zero you can't have zero so we have the same problem anyway in fact it's more restrictive than that we don't we don't just disallow zero this thing can't even be negative so this is strictly greater than zero anyway strictly greater than zero not equal to zero so because the natural domain of a logarithm is already not allowing zero it's okay to do things like make division and not worry about the domain because you're not creating anything additional you already knew that could equal zero can't even be a negative when we put it like this and have that on a denominator it's not it's not creating another you can't equal zero it already can't do that so we're not breaking any rules by doing it challenging to see that that we're not cheating the system it's already there we're just using this and not having to define it further hope that makes sense to you oh this whole thing makes sense you hope you're seeing that yeah if i have two logarithms equal with the same base i can just set the insides equal much like we can exponentials we're just combining on each side setting insights equal we're using all the stuff about combinations and if we don't have all logarithms this will not work we're going to come back with two more examples and move on to a different video let's move on a little bit so in our next example i'm going to start really kind of modeling my thinking about how exactly we differentiate between this and a general logarithmic equation so when we look at it you're just looking really for one thing are all of my terms logarithms with the same base if so combine both sides set the insides equal if not we're going to have to use an exponential we combine both sides as much well actually we get all the logarithms on one side combine as much as we can and have a constant on the other side so here we're looking at the same every single one of those terms is a logarithm of the same base looks really good let's combine all the logarithms that we have on each side could you give everything to one side and combine it yes you could and you would have a zero on the other side could you use an exponential yes and base to the zero power would give you one equal to the inside you can do that i might show that to you on one of these examples just to let you know as a preface for the next video but you don't have to do that so if we have this all we're really looking to do is one logarithm equal to another we have to move our coefficients as exponents first and then combine the logarithms into one so we see a coefficient of 2 that's going to become an exponent on that 5. the same thing is going to happen with this too also i hope that you remember that we don't have to move that negative just the two now you can move the negative and deal with a fraction uh like this one over 10 squared if you really want to but it's a little bit easier to use that minus as a way to create division inside of one logarithm as a fraction rather than use that negative to create a fraction in one logarithm then multiply and get the same fraction anyway that's a little bit more cumbersome to do mathematically so we typically leave the sign unless it's the only sound we saw in the second example if it's the only sign in front it becomes a negative that's okay but typically we'll leave that as a minus rather than choosing it to represent a negative now because we have more than one logarithm on each side we're going to have to combine this via addition or subtraction creating multiplication and division within one logarithm respectively so we look at okay log base 3 log base 3 a minus sign between two logarithms creates a division or a quotient within one same base though added or positive creates numerator factors minus or negative creates denominator factors added or positive creates numerator factors minus or negative crazy denominator factors i've also squared the 5 and square the 10. now now we're ready when we see these logarithms equal same base we know that the only way this happens is if the arguments of logarithms are also equal so we set them equal we get another proportion and we're still going to cross multiply we're not seeing any power twos no no exponent higher than one which means this is a linear and that means that we're not going to be factoring we're just going to be subtracting the smaller variable removing any constants around that variable if we have to we don't have here we don't have anything added or subtracted to that variable term and then dividing and we get one-third we're going to check that so one-third into here one-third into that argument does not make that negative or zero that's a good thing that's constant that's okay one-third plus one is one in the third that's not zero or negative we're okay here and that's ten that's gonna be a valid solution this is what we go through uh when we're when we're solving these now i told you that i was going to do something i'm just gonna do it on a whim uh to see if we can actually do it might be a little bit more cumbersome but i'll i'll show you just as a way to to transition um to the next to the next video but i'm going to do it after we finish up off the idea so i want to keep this cohesive i'm going to show you how to do this a different way with an exponential after i do this one so last example oh man now i'm seeing logarithms everywhere i'm seeing with the same base i'm not seeing any constant term or a logarithm with a different base i'm not seeing anything added over here that's a constant or subtracted that's what we're looking for to determine the difference between common bases and having to use exponentials so we don't have that all right so what are we going to do well we've got to combine all of these to get one logarithm on each side nothing added subtracted multiplied any of that stuff how we do it now you have choices here you can choose you can choose to distribute that 3 and get 3 log base 7 and 3 log base 7 and that 3 in both cases would move to an exponent and an exponent that's true or you can combine these first either way is fine either way is appropriate because we have subtraction of two logs of the same base we're going to create a quotient inside of one one logarithm that's going to be x over two we're also going to choose to move that exponent now i want you to notice what happens on the left hand side now that we really don't need this anymore and this is multiplication this is going to move on as an exponent but it's going to be an exponent on that entire argument so it's going to go right there and when we see that i hope that you're understanding this hope you see it that whether i distribute and then move it as an exponent so x cubed and then 2 cubed and then create a fraction i get x cubed over 2 cubed i'm going to get the same thing here we know that exponents distribute across multiplication division coefficients distribute across addition and subtraction but because that subtraction becomes division one logarithm you're basically distributing over the same things i said this a while back that as long as you're using an appropriate rule you really can't get it wrong whether you distribute the three and then move it as an exponent and then create that fraction or create the fraction then move the exponent then distribute the three either way you're going to get the same same exact result it doesn't really matter just make sure you're following the rules just don't make up your own math that's the most common thing so now now this looks like what we want we have two logarithms the same base we know the only way this is equal is if our arguments or insides are equal if we multiply both sides by 8 now we take a cube root of both sides remember cube roots do not need plus or minus the cube root of 128 you really need to simplify that so we're thinking what's the largest perfect cube that i have inside of there that mult that's a factor of 128. that'd be 64. so 64 times 2 the cube root of 64 is 4. the cube root of 2 is well really can't simplify simplify that anymore so we get 4 cube root of 2. that's a positive if i plug it in here that's positive that's a constant that's a constant this is not creating any sort of a domain issue for us it fits the bill for for what we need here that's our only valid solution so i hope this makes sense on the process of identifying firstly when you're going to be able to set your arguments equal if you have all terms there are logarithms with the same base combine it and set the insights equal now i mentioned to you that in the next video we're going to do some logarithms that require exponentials i'm going to preface that right now with this example so let's take a look at it under a slightly different lens now could we use an exponential right here like i mentioned before yeah you really could you can make these both exponents on a base of three base three log base three your you just compose a function on its inverse simplify base three log base three functions inverse you simplify remember what you do to one side you have to do to the other so if you have logarithms of the same base you'd have the same base of an exponential that's the only reason why this actually works i hope that you're getting that if you have different bases you could not apply the same exponential to both sides of your equation you have to have something else to do it wouldn't work that would be a big problem for us so same base is why you're able to do both a three and a three you have to do the same thing to both sides of your equation now here's a different lens what if instead of just combining these as two logs on each side we got all the logs on one side and we combine them to one logarithm and a constant on the other side this is where the next video is going to go with it i want you to see it now to see that we get the same thing so what if we did that well because all of our terms are logarithms if we got everything on one side what would we have another side well we have zero that's okay that is a constant so i'm going to subtract these we'll add that one over to the other side so so we've subtracted and added now hang on all this stuff only works if we really combine to one logarithm on one side otherwise we can't really use the process of changing to an exponential we can't really set insides equal if we have more than one logarithm on one side so we're still going to combine which means we're still going to move our coefficients as exponents first taking the liberty of squaring the 5 and squaring the 10 to get 25 and 100 respectively so that i can omit one step but check it out all that stuff about combining was really important because when we combine we should be able to do this all the time we should understand that all these algorithms are added or subtracted from one another they all have the same base you can create one logarithm not a logarithm over a logarithm that was change of base one logarithm with a fraction inside and i taught you my preferred technique my preferred technique was not doing each little piece at a time just take a look at the whole thing and saying all the positive logarithms and things being added are going to create factors on your numerator all your negative logarithms or logarithms being subtracted will create factors on your denominator just make one fraction so positive numerator minus denominator minus denominator plus numerator now we can clean it up a little bit and you really don't need to distribute this right now but you will be doing it eventually i probably should have done that i always tell you don't distribute denominators even wrote a song about it but i do want you to notice something please get this this is going to be the exact process for the next video when you see lots of logarithms and you have a constant that's not a logarithm like if we would have had seven there or something we are going to gather all our logarithms on one side the non-zero constant on the other now this happens to be a zero constant because we could have done it a different way but if you don't have this way available to you you just take that constant put over here on the on the right hand side or left side whatever one side get all your logarithms combine them to one all your logarithms into one get your constant on the right hand side and then take a look at it can you write this as an exponential because if you can then exponential is the inverse of a logarithm and it will solve this logarithm identify what your base is well logarithms have separated the base from the exponent the base is three the exponent is zero so our base raised to the exponent will have to equal whatever our inside of a logarithm is that's why we had to combine those because you can't set base equal to base to exponent equal to all these different logarithms at once does it make sense we need one logarithm to be able to do that so base exponent and exponential put those together and then sets it equal to the inside of your logarithm that's what exponentials do they are the inverse of some logarithm so this is the way that we really deal with a logarithmic equation in general well which way is easier i don't know there this one doesn't require an exponential this one's a pretty streamlined but it only works sometimes doesn't it only if you have two logs in the same base one on each side this one's going to work all the time and especially when we have a non-zero constant if you have a zero constant understand that you really don't have a constant you have all terms that are logarithms so now we think through it what's three to the zero power well i know that anything to the zero power is one oh how do we get rid of denominators we're going to multiply both sides our denominators simplify this you can distribute and we're seeing exactly the same math from right here same exact stuff we're still going to get one one-third so are there two ways to do it yes but special cases typically make things a little bit easier why i wanted to give that to you was because the next video we're going to start basically right here the idea that if you have a constant that is not any logarithm so that term that's not a logarithm just some constant we're going to gather our logarithms constant on the side combine and then use an exponential because in general it takes exponentials to solve logarithms there's only a special case if you don't have that constant and you have the same base i hope it makes sense i'm gonna see for the next video when we start solving general logarithmic equations have a good day you 

Transcript for: Solving Logarithmic Equations with Exponentials (Precalculus - College Algebra 63)
welcome to another video in this video we are going to finish talking about solving logarithmic equations in the last video we noticed there's a special case we have all terms that are logarithms the same base we can basically combine them and set the inside is equal this is the video that takes care of basically everything else now in the last part of this video i will talk about three what i would consider much more challenging examples i'll show you how change of base can really be helpful but in general here's what this video is going to teach you if you have at least one term that is not a logarithm then we really don't have the ability to combine everything and set insides of logarithms equal there is no no chain or no common base special case that we have in general what we're going to do is say hey look if we have some terms that are logarithms and some terms that aren't we're going to combine all the logarithms into one term on one side of the equation and leave that constant term on the other side then we'll use exponential notation to rewrite it and be able to solve something very very nicely with some techniques algebra we already know and that's basically what all this says so we identify what what category we're in are we in the we've got all logarithms of the same base let's combine them and set the insides equal or are we in the i have at least one term that's not a logarithm or logarithms with different bases in that case you have some other work to do so we take a look at that if we have one term that's not a logarithm that is a constant what we're going to do is we're going to get all logs on one side cool we're going to combine them we know how to do that and then use exponential notation basically writing in exponential form so we're going to work our way through some of these examples we've got many to do the last three are going to be fairly difficult i'll show you those but these ones that we start with not super bad so let's take a look at it uh do we have log all logarithms do you have an equation with all logarithms well no we have at least one term that's not a logarithm we're going to get everything on one side we've done that get our logarithms on one side and a constant on the other side we've got that and then what we do every time we see a logarithm x bar in the special case which we could have used exponentials for anyway every time we see a logarithmic equation you are going to need an exponential to solve it so what solves logarithms is its inverse those are exponentials well let's write this as an exponential identify our base identify our exponent notice that logarithms separate the base from the exponent so our base here is 10. remember it's not written as 10 and our exponent is 1. we can easily write these in exponential notation if we have all our logarithms combined into one logarithm and a non-zero constant even a zero constant really on the other side if you happen to get a zero constant you could have done it a different way but this will take care of it anyway so base to an exponent we simplify the exponent and then solve for our variable using a technique you will have already seen so in this case just subtract 6. as long as we make sure that this does not cause any domain issues for a logarithm remember this inside cannot become 0 and it can't be negative so plug it in that makes 10 and as a matter of fact 10 raised to the first power gives you 10 we know that our solution is 4 and that's valid so that's what we're doing here we're going to take a look at all these identify what category we're in move everything to one side combined and then using exponential let's take a look at it the first thing we do is identify so we've got a log base 2 a log base 2. it looks good and then we got 5. well that's not a logarithm therefore we can't combine and use logarithms with the same base we're going to have to get all our logarithms on one side which we have here that's good but we're also going to have to combine them you can't write one exponential if you have multiple logarithms that doesn't really work that well so we're going to have to combine these we're going to move our exponent first keep it in mind that that exponent goes on the exponent of this entire thing and we keep going we do need to work this down to be one logarithm so when we see logarithms of the same base being added we know we can make one logarithm with a product plus gives us a product inside one logarithm i'm going to encourage you not to distribute i know i've shown it one time i'm going to encourage you not to distribute this until you absolutely have to because sometimes you don't have to we're not going to have to in this example it's really important to not have to do extra work here just think about what's going to happen we have combined logarithms we have one logarithm yes that times four we probably should write this at the front equal to a constant that is something that's easily translatable into an exponential notation our base is two our exponent is five and our argument is four times x minus one to the third power we can write this really easy and exponential takes the base and the exponent and puts it back together so base to the exponent equals inside but you can only do it if you have one logarithm well now let's think about it we know in order to solve equations what we really want is the ability to factor or the ability to isolate a variable to a power and then take a radical on both sides we have that here if we go ahead and distribute all this this is already factored this looks really good in fact what we can do is maybe simplify that into 32 and what we can do is maybe isolate that power a little bit by dividing by four and once we've done that we can take a cube root of both sides had we distributed that we probably never see it so what i'm going to encourage you to do is wait to distribute until after you have written it as an exponential because sometimes you can shortcut the problem like we've done here we wouldn't have maybe seen that here this would be a lot of work so wait to distribute until you've done that step now sometimes you will have to distribute sometimes you won't have to like this case so we've isolated our variable raised to a power we know that all of our x's inside the parentheses let's take a cube root of both sides power matches the root cube root of eight is two adding one we get 3 and now we're going to check does that 3 make any of our original logarithms have a domain issue so plugging this in 3 minus 1 is 2 that looks good 4 is a constant 5 is not in the logarithm this looks fantastic this is what we want to see let's move on to the next one we got log of two x plus one equals one plus log of x minus two we're going to categorize it first so we take a look at it we think all right do i have it's obviously logarithmic do i have all logarithms well no i don't i have a constant a non-zero constant i'm going to group all my logarithms on one side because i know i'm going to have to use an exponential if you don't have all logarithms you're going to need an exponential all right we're going to need that so let's group all our logarithms and combine so that we can write it as an exponential that means subtracting log of x minus 2. that means leaving your constant and if you have more than one you group those two you get all of your constants on one side because you always can combine constants into another constant we leave that constant on the right hand side or whatever side you want now in order to write as an exponential we need to continue to write this as one logarithm of course these are the same base so we can combine these we know that two logarithms being subtracted creates one logarithm with a quotient and now we're ready this is the approach to solving a general logarithmic equation we group our logarithms on one side we have a constant on the other and then we write this in exponential notation our base is 10 our exponent is one our exponential will put that back together and now we solve this because we have a fraction let's multiply both sides by our denominator so 10 to the first power that's 10. and if we multiply both sides by x minus 2 on the right hand side we get 2x 1 on the left if we distribute that's 10x minus 20. now this is linear don't try to factor it it's not a power two you don't need to we just need to subtract a smaller variable so subtracting 2x we're going to get 8x adding 20 we're going to get 21 and dividing by 8 we get 21 array that's kind of an awkward fraction but it's more than 2 so it's like 2 point something all right 2 and 5 8. so if we have something more than 2 evaluate this just a little bit now if you want to plug it in all the way and make sure that it works that's great that you should do that but at least go this far at least make sure this does not cause a domain issue so two point something two point something times two plus one is not zero and it's positive that's good two point something minus two is not zero and it's positive that's good also this does not cause any domain issues that's a valid solution for us okay last one then we're going to step it up a little bit so we have a logarithmic equation sure thing and we have a couple logs base six but something that's not a logarithm with the same base so we're going to need an exponential in order to solve this like we do in general we always use an inverse to solve some sort of a function that's what we need here we need the inverse of a logarithm or an exponential so we're going to get all our logs on one side what that means in this case is we're going to add log base 6 of x 3. we leave the constant we want that because that stands for the exponent of the exponential we're about to create then we're going to have to combine these so because we have two logarithms with the same base being added we know a plus means a product inside one logarithm with that base of six now you can see something here i told you just a little while ago i really don't want to distribute that until i absolutely have to because sometimes we get a shortcut don't have to distribute like we saw in that example now we're going to have to distribute here because we're going to get a power tool we're going to have a factor but i don't want to do it right now i just want to make sure that we understand that one logarithm equals a constant leads us to an exponential then then acknowledge what you got to do then kind of i identify and evaluate what you need to do after that but make sure you get to the exponential before you distribute it's no harder to do and sometimes it'll save you work this is why we do it so we have a base of six an exponent of one let the exponential put those together that's going to equal the inside of your logarithm now i'm going to warn you not warn you just advise you a little bit that you're going to see a lot of ones you're gonna see some zeros occasionally which you could do a different way but you see a lot of ones and twos why well because that constant acts as an exponent if i were to give you like a seven you have six to the seventh power that's ridiculous big uh to be able to factor and really work with well so you're gonna see a lot of ones a lot of ones and twos because two the six to the second power is well that's that's 36 so we can we can do that we can work with that very well six to the first power six we can work with that two as soon as these start getting really big we start getting with some some factoring problems things that we're not able to really work with so just watch out for that not that these can't be other constants but just you're probably not going to see them very often so now that we have this exponential the only way we solve this logarithm is with an exponential we're going to have to solve it now this is going to be some techniques we understand so when we look at this we go right how do i solve it it's not the zero product property right now because i don't have a zero it is something that i don't have all of my x's grouped together raised to a power if i did i could use like a square root method or a cube root method to solve it but i don't this is where we have to distribute so we're going to distribute everything we're going to identify it's got a power 2 that means group everything on one side and factor it or quadratic formula it or if it's really bad rational zeros they're having to find yourself a root so we've distributed we go okay power two that's not zero i need to get everything on one side and factor if i can how do we try to factor what if we can't quadratic formula would work if it's power two or then like i said another techniques can have to be implemented like rational zeros something else to be able to solve that thankfully for us this factors as x plus six and x plus one we said we work that down use zero product property solve it we get negative six and negative one now we're good right uh well well no no the whole point of a lot of the things i've said about domain is so that right now you can identify which of these is good or valid in the domain of our logarithms you see they both have to work to be solutions um if one of them doesn't work we're going to cross it out now both of them are negative don't just arbitrarily cross out negatives i see it a lot that's not what we're talking about we actually have to check whether this number makes any one of our original logarithms have a domain problem have an argument that becomes negative or zero even so take the negative six negative six plus four is negative two you're done i don't care if it works in the next one or not you're done this is not a valid solution it doesn't have to be invalid for all of them even one of them will cause it to not be okay because it causes domain issue sometimes when we combine these and multiply we take we take it negative and becomes like it's a it makes it look like it's a valid solution when it's not so let's look at the next one negative 1. now while this is a negative value when i evaluate negative 1 plus 4 is 3 and negative 1 plus 3 is 2 those are not negative and they're not 0. this doesn't cause a domain issue so even though that's negative it's fine it's going to be a valid solution we just don't want values that when we plug them in or evaluate they cause domain problems this one's okay so that's the thought process i want you going through when we're solving logarithmic equations do we have all logarithms of the same base use common bases do we not use an exponential we're going to move on and see it we're going to start making this a little bit more difficult so by the end of it we're going to deal with some fairly complicated problems hang on for it all right ready for another example so let's take a look at it we're noticing it's a logarithmic equation we're also noticing not everything is a logarithm so now we have everything grouped on one side for our logarithms and a non-zero constant that looks really good we're going to combine our logarithms we know that two logarithms being subtracted the same base will give us one logarithm with a quotient where all of our positive or added logarithms create factors on the numerator and subtracted or negative logarithms create factors in the denominator now i'm going to pause here this is the reason why i'm giving this example um it really helps a lot of times to factor not distribute but factor your your logarithms especially the fractions because if you can simplify them you can actually make your problem easier without affecting your solution i'll show you in just a minute why that's true but you can do it you say wait wait a minute that x squared my signs look like a difference of squares and it's gonna have a factor of x plus three can we simplify the factor of x plus three yes and we get log base 4 of x minus 3 equals 3. well that that's a logarithm can we identify the base and exponent sure can we write it as exponential notation yeah of course four to the third equals x minus three sixty-four equals x minus three and x equals sixty-seven now would we get the same answer if we hadn't simplified that yeah we would is there a different way to not simplify yeah there is i'll show you both of those things right now firstly here's one reason why we're able to simplify this just by another look at it and not affect our final solution so here also keep in mind that we're not running into this whole oh i have a hole in this graph we're not really doing that because we're not dividing by something that equals zero you see this can't ever equal zero so at x equals negative three we don't have a defined point because that's not defined even for our logarithm so we're not really around that issue we're just literally crossing out something that's not a solution i'll show you a different way what if we considered this to be x minus 3 x plus 3 from right here and what if we expanded that we know that because we can combine addition and get multiplication or product instead of one logarithm we can expand a product and get addition because we can do that can you see that this is just combining terms if you have a log base four of x plus three minus log base four x plus three you add two things well if you add the opposites of these two terms you're gonna get zero that's exactly what's happening here this is going to cancel out if you will and you end up getting the exact same thing that we got right here well i know the third case what if you didn't see this and you ended up saying all right from here base to the exponent equals my entire argument there are you all right well let's see um this would be 64. and if you multiply both sides by x plus three we have 64x plus 192 equals x squared minus nine now you've got a power two we gotta get everything on one side and zero on the other side so x squared minus 64 x minus 201 and then you got to factor it you go i don't want to i don't want to either because those numbers are really big but it does factor negative 67 and 3 adds to negative 64 and negative 67 times 3 is negative 201 so this factors as negative x minus 67 x plus three zero product property if we did really quickly gives us positive 67 and negative three well now wait a minute that's the 67 what about that one why doesn't this have that solution look carefully at that solution if you were to evaluate negative three right there negative 3 plus 3 is 0. this is exactly the domain problem that we said that have has you can't even plug in negative 3. so why does it appear it appears right here when you multiply both sides by x plus three it allows this a factor that gives you something that's not even allowed to start with which is why we cross it out at the end so is this way better yes it doesn't cause any problems and it eliminates the factor that has the domain problem anyway so try that if you have to combine your logarithms i'm always thinking can i simplify that can i simplify that argument before i start doing any algebra because obviously it's a lot easier to do i hope that makes sense to you i hope that you kind of see my point on that okay last one and then we're going to go on to some special case ones that are that involve some changing of a base make things a little more difficult i'll say it's uh it'd be kind of optional i would hope that you'd want to watch it and kind of enjoy it be a little bit more uh more critical thinking a little bit more problem solving in it uh so this this last one yeah it's logarithmic yeah we have logs of the same base but we also have one term that's not a logarithm that's a constant in general you combine your constants put on one side all your logarithms on the other and then we're going to have to use an exponential but only after we combine our logarithms so how to combine them because we have two logs same base being subtracted we create one logarithm with a quotient hopefully done correctly now that is set up perfectly for writing an exponential notation from that so our our base is e our exponent is two x dimensional notation takes those and writes them back the way they should be as an exponent so e to the second equals this x plus one over x now how in the world are we going to solve that we're going to see this technique an awful lot when we get into the next video which has to do with solving exponentials it's the same technique i actually showed you when we solved for inverse functions the way that you need to group your x terms factor x and then divide so whenever you see something like this where you're multiplying both sides of the denominator a lot of times if you have an awkwardness like another variable or like some sort of constant that you can't really deal with very well like e squared this is the technique that we should be using so let's multiply both sides by x we're going to have to do that but right here where you see all of those x's floating around if x is here x is here and you're trying to solve for x this should kind of remind you of what happened when we had logarithms we were trying to solve for y we grouped oh sorry uh when we were trying to solve for inverses we grouped all of our y terms on one side because we were solving for y then we factored the y and we divided we're trying to solve for x here but the same logic applies let's group all of our x terms on one side so subtracting x let's do that x times e squared minus x equals 1. now we're going to factor the x and because we factored it creates a product and products can be solved well we can solve for variable involving a product by dividing let's divide both sides by e squared minus one it looks awkward but that is your solution um also i want you to notice that that's a positive number so 1 divided by e squared e squared remember e is about 2.7 so 2.7 squared is larger than 1 something larger than 1 minus 1 is positive positive over positive is a positive if we try to evaluate that that is positive and that is positive it doesn't cause a domain issue for us now you also might want to find what's called an approximate solution so this is exact this is this is exactly all the numbers wrapped up into that but if you had to find an approximation you take your calculator do 1 divided by and use parentheses e squared you usually have to press second to get to e e squared and then minus one close parenthesis it'll give you a decimal approximation for that solution so i'm hoping this is this has made sense so far hoping you're seeing what in the absence of all logarithms you need exponentials they're not that hard you just have to identify get all your logs on one side combine them appropriately using exponential and they're usually pretty not so bad to solve we're going to come back with three more that are more difficult be right back we're going to do three more and we're going to do these three together because they all involve using the change of base formula for logarithms in there somewhere and i think that i think is really cool first off and secondly i think it leads to a lot of a lot of mistakes with students because they get stuck and they never really see this mo most classes i've seen or observed or taught myself really kind of bypass these sort of problems because they're difficult um and because you don't see a lot of them but they're really really neat and i don't want to limit once you understand and so here's how we're going to go through these we're going to see hopefully that having the same base is really helpful for logarithms and we get really stuck when we don't have that so we need a way to to work around that um so we're going to take a look at what happens when we don't have the same base and at the end of these three examples you're going to ask me well yes leonard but you changed one base into another what if you can't change either one then i'll give you one last example so i guess i use four examples so let's take a look at it now this looks all great we look at this and try to categorize and go i got i got two logarithms that's true i don't need constants that's also true um oh wait but i don't have the same base we can use a change of base formula in in a slightly different way than i've told you before so i've told you that you can change one logarithm into whatever base you want and that's true and i also told you we typically choose common log or natural log that's also true but sometimes we can use the change of base formula to change a base that we don't want into something we do want just remember how this works with the change of base you pick whatever base you want and you take logarithm of the argument on the numerator logarithmic a logarithm of the base on the denominator and pick whatever new base you want typically it's a common log of your natural log but what if we did this let me say it all right with this logarithm i want to take a logarithm of my numerator over a logarithm of my did not of my sorry logarithm my argument as my numerator and logarithm of my base is my denominator and i can pick whatever base i want please notice how change of base works this goes on top this goes on bottom and pick whatever base you want it to be well what base do i want i i want i want that base so i want a base of three a lot of these problems because they're contrived they simplify very nicely for instance log base 3 of 7x minus 5 that doesn't simplify but log base 3 of 9 is 2 because it has 3 raised to what power is 9. 2. this is an exponent it's an exponent of 2. so when we do simplify it now we have something that looks a little bit nicer we go this is what looks familiar we have logarithms everywhere with the same base we do need to isolate and so we have one log equal to another log with the same base which means we're going to multiply both sides by 2. so multiplying both sides by two no wait a minute that made it worse didn't make it worse because now we can take a coefficient and move it as an exponent this is the i this is the fundamental concept of having logarithms of the same base if you have logarithms set equal to another they have the same base you isolate it or while at least you made it so that adds a factor to multiplied well that means that your insides have to be equal as well so logarithms equal to one another means you can set your arguments equal so seven x minus five equals x plus one squared now that might look a little bit complicated but it is something we've seen before we're going to distribute everything it's going to give us a power to we're going to get everything on one side we're going to factor it i know i'm working pretty quickly but this is nothing we haven't seen before zero prime property will tell us that x is three and x is two now we're gonna check both of those so take these back into your original and just make sure they don't give you a zero or negative so three that's 21 minus five that's not zero or negative uh four is not zero or negative plugging in two fourteen minus five isn't zero or negative two plus one isn't zero or negative these are both valid solutions they work just fine so sometimes it helps us to use change of base change the basis of what you want hopefully it simplifies now if it doesn't this becomes a little bit of a nightmare but if it does you get something very nice and most of the problems you run into that simplifies a little bit i will give you one at the end that has completely different bases and what we do with that okay moving right along and i hope that you're starting to see or you will see in this example that there is some similarity between working with common bases and logarithms and those of exponents so we have logarithms here and we have a logarithm or we have one term that's not a logarithm so we're going to have to use an exponential but in our case here we're noticing that our bases are not the same we need them to become the same if we're going to combine them and so we're going to use the change of base formula look at your bases and much like exponentials try to write them all as the same base so i've got a base of 2. that looks really good a base of 4 and a base of 16 are going to need to change so we're going to take each of these two logarithms write them with a base of 2. so because of our change of base we can say i'm going to write this as a ratio log of x over log of 16 inside on the numerator base on the denominator and then pick whatever base you want in this case i want to find a base of 2 why because that's the lowest base that's the one that i can make everything into or the most common base we can say too same thing's going to happen here i'm going to have a log of x over a log of 4. pick whatever base you want now to be kind of silly i would pick a different basement to be size two because i'm trying to combine here since we already have a base of two this last logarithm looks pretty good i hope it makes sense we hope you're seeing that this represents the same thing we could go change the base in reverse if we wanted to log base 2 of x over log base 2 of 16 is log base 16 of x it's the same thing by our change of base formula we're just picking a base of two we're going this way so we're saying yeah take your argument put in the numerator based put on the denominator and pick whatever base you want that helps your problem now look at our denominators they each simplify so log base 2 of 16 it's asked 2 raised to what power gives you 16. it's going to be 4. 2 raised to what power gives you 4 it's going to be 2. and what in the world do you do here well we are going to have a simplify this somehow aren't we so we can choose a couple things we can choose number one if you want to we can take each of these make it one-fourth and move it as exponent one-half move it to an exponent and that would become a fourth root and a square root and that's perfectly fine to do we can do that right now or you can multiply everything by an lcd of four and that's going to give you log base 2 of x 2 log base 2 of x 4 log base 2 of x and 4 times 7 which is 28 either way is fine the second way we'll deal with larger numbers so i can show you both ways here's option 1 what i said if that's a 1 4 now we know that we have to combine these all to one logarithm that means your x your coefficients have to become exponents and that means that that's really a fourth root and that's really a square root you go wait a minute i can't have any negatives inside there yeah but you couldn't anyway you can't have a negative inside that no matter what so it doesn't really matter you're not breaking domain issues here and then i would say don't change into fourth roots and square roots that's what they represent but don't write them as that we are now ready at log base two and log base two and log base two they're all added we are ready to multiply these arguments together create one model with them remember that when we multiply i'm going to write x to the first power on purpose here when we multiply we add exponents so let's see seven fourths this is one logarithm it's equal to a non-zero constant it's got a base of two we're actually ready to write this as exponential notation so we have two to the seventh equals x to the seven fourths how in the world we're going to do that uh well there's a number of ways you could do it i would say the easiest way is the way i'm going to show you that's why i show it to you because i think it's the easy way you could write this as a fourth root of x to the seventh couldn't you take both sides to the fourth power and then take a seventh root of both sides you could do that or you could be really smart with your fractional exponent and this is what i'm going to choose to do so if you're really smart with the fraction exponent i want you to think of what you need to multiply by to make that one in order to make that one i'd have to multiply by 4 7 the reciprocal the only way that we can multiply is to raise an exponent to an exponent so raise both sides to the 4 7. on the right hand side 4 7 times 7 4 just one that's x to the first power that's what you want you want to solve for x on the left hand side notice what you're really doing you have seven over one times four over seven sevens are cancelling you're going to get four over one and two to the fourth is 16. and that is your solution and works here too so uh positive positive positive and not zero that looks really good that's your solution how would it look different if you did it differently how would it look different if you wrote this as that you'd have to raise both sides to the fourth power raised to the fourth power you get 28 and you get x to the seventh and then you would have to take a seventh root of this now that's not bad you can do it and there's some shortcuts to it here that's really nice your power matches root you're good to go on the left hand side you just gotta be smart about it um now your calculator will do 2 to the 28th power it's really big and it will do a 7th root of it and that will make it 16. but if you had anything larger much larger than 2 to the 20th power your calculator will explode and start burning and say error or system overload killing me if we're really smart about it we can think about this differently which is essentially what we've done here think about 2 to the 28th as something to the 7th power well that would be 2 to the 4th power of the 7 but still to the 20th power but the power matches the root 2 to the 4th is 16. it's the same thing now i said you could also do differently for the third different way what if you ended up multiplying everything by 4 to get rid of your fractions if you did that everything times 4 to get rid of fractions then multiplying this entire thing by 4 would give you log base of x plus 4 times 2 times 1 half is 2 2 log base 2 of x 4 times log base 2 of x is 4. log base 2 of x and 28. maybe you can see what's going to happen we still have to move these as exponents we still have to combine this here's one two and four when we combine by multiplication you add exponents that's x to the seventh power you still have to change them exponentially 2 to the 28 equals x to the 7th now we're right back down there so it all yields the same thing yields 16. honestly i would think of the fractions as easier i mean it seems counter to like my fraction is going to be easier but they really are if you leave them as fractions and add them together correctly then you can raise both sides to the reciprocal it's just fine it's going to work great this is why it's a more advanced problem because you have some of these ideas going on but i really hope you're seeing the combination of ideas i'm trying to show you that radicals involved in this are very relevant that we can use some tools in our arsenal to combine things and be smart about solving so i hope that's making sense to you okay last one before our last one and man they're both going to look really nasty you know that that's horrible because we have different bases floating around we got stuff being squared we got all sorts of things there's two ideas i really need you to see three ideas five ideas there's at least three a's i really need to see number one we have different bases logarithms are going to have to have the same base to combine them so we're going to work on that number two when you see something being squared and multiplied like three times something else and you can make them the same base you are typically going to use a substitution or some other technique to solve it and thirdly you need to check for simplification of some logarithms that can be simplified if we don't see that it's going to make this problem brutal if we do see that that is 4 to make this problem easy so let's get started with the fundamental problem that we have different bases here we need to get the same base for our logarithms and so we're going to do that so we take a look at it all right uh that's a that's a base four that's a base eight i can't make a base eight into a base four very nicely and have it simplify because these are talking about what exponent it takes so i don't want to deal with a base 4 because we'd have down here log base 4 of 8. well that would be an issue because 4 raised to what power is 8 i don't know not easy but both of them can be simplified with a base of 2. this kind of shows you that like oh i got a base of 2. that's why it's there it's like a little hint usually i would just put four and make you think about that go well the base of four doesn't help a base of two a sub base on both of those would help so i'm going to change both of those into a base of two that way i can simplify both of them and still have the same base the log base 4 of 8 will not work well log base 2 of 8 is 3 that's very nice so let's go ahead and change these into a log base 2. i'm going to leave that there so that you can see the problem of not changing it so log base 4 of x thinking i need the base 4 and the base a to both become base 2 so the same and we can simplify i'm going to pick a log base 2 of x log base 2 of 4 inside numerator base denominator argument attic base basement so i think about it not very mathy but it works and pick whatever base you want i'm picking 2 why because this will simplify and i can have the same base here and that will also simplify argument attic base basement pick whatever base you want but because we're being smart about it we're picking the same base we're picking a base of two now we're going to simplify all of the things that we can in those fractions i hope you're noticing why the parentheses are necessary when you write a fraction out of that both the numerator denominator are going to get squared that's really important we can't forget about that so this is going to be log base 2 of x this log base 2 of 4 says 2 raised to what power is 4. well 2 raised to the second power is 4 this is a 2 log base 2 of x but this asks 2 raised to what power is 8 two raised to the third power is eight that's three now three simplifies to three and that's a wonderful thing this right here says log base two of x over 2 but this is squared and this is also squared we're going to leave this as a power 2 because we are going to use the substitution just a second but we're going to simplify this one squared and that's four we can simplify that and now i can do a couple things but there's one thing i can't do it's a breaking of the rules of logarithms and you can't do it you cannot move this as a one-half here and then move it here that breaks order operations because you're taking multiplication ahead of exponents and you can't do that you also cannot move this two to the front because this is not an exponent on the argument it's the entire logarithm and you can't do it you've got to follow the rules here that would break the order operations you can't do that what we can do after rewriting it is multiply both sides every term by 2 or lcd that's appropriate you cannot move this here as an exponent you cannot move the series of one-half and cancel out that power 2. you cannot move this up front this is not a power on the x you can't do any of those things you got to follow the rules exactly don't make up your own math you can multiply everything by 2. so i want you to know something right now that that log base 2 of 16 can be simplified if we don't we have a real big problem doing a substitution i need you to to remember that this thing's going to screw you up in about 5 minutes if we don't change it so i'm going to change that it asks 2 raised to what power 16 that's going to be 4. and then i'm going to multiply both sides by 2. if i distribute 2 and over 2 that's going to cancel i'm going to get log base 2 of x squared plus this distributes 2 log base 2 of x and i'm going to leave it like that equals 8. now why am i going to leave it like that a lot of times when you see something like an exponent or a logarithm one part squared and the same thing or you've made the same thing and it's another term you want to do a substitution and so we're going to do that right now we're going to say you know what if i let let's call it u u equals log base 2 of x then i can replace this with u and get u squared plus two u equals eight well wait a minute that'll be a quadratic in terms of u if there's a quadratic in terms of u i can replace and get u squared plus two that's u equals eight all power twos should be got on one side factored and simplify factor to use zero product property or quadratic formula or some other technique if you can't isolate the power 2 which we can't and this does factor but notice something i ask you to remember something i asked remember what if this didn't simplify and was left as log base 2 of 16. right here you'd have a real big problem because you'd have to use some quadratic formula with a really awkward logarithm it's still a constant you can still do it but again very very very challenging so if it happens uh double check to see if that's not simplifiable so we can here that's where we got the eight from made it much nicer and this does factor u equals negative four and u equals two and now we go back we go all right how's that going to work well because u equals a logarithm base 2 of x we know that if u equals negative 4 log base 2 of x equals negative 4 it is okay to have a logarithm equal to a negative what's not okay is to have an exponential equal to a negative it's also not okay to have it inside of a logarithm and negative and now we have oh man i hope you see it i hope you see that this is exactly what we want we want one logarithm isolated equal to a constant we have it we can write this as an exponential base of 2 exponent of negative 4 equals our inside it's solved and exponential solves logarithms this is just 1 over 16. we have one logarithm isolated equal to a constant we can use an exponential base of 2 exponent 2 equals x that's 4 equals x both of those are valid those are both solutions for that logarithmic equation now that was kind of helpfully fun i enjoyed it um hopefully you see some utility what i'm showing you that we can use the substitution and really really with change of base get some powerful stuff out of it i'm going to come back with one more to say what if your bases can't remain the same and then we'll be done all right last one uh this is gonna be kind of weird a little bit harder than other ones because we gotta really think outside the box and some some fractions not super outside the box but a little bit um well now what's the main problem here we take a look at it and go firstly it's math that's always a problem we call them problems for a reason uh secondly we go there's some logarithms and there's a constant so we have the need for an exponential somewhere in this problem but we don't have common bases and i can't change them both to the same base nicely so you know what i mean that in all the previous examples we had like this sub base we're all like a base 2 or a base 3 or something like that we don't have that here we've got log base 2 log base 6. i can't change them both into some some simplifiable expression on the denominator so like log base 2 of what gives you a gives us 6. uh well sorry 2 raised to what power gives you 6. it's not going to happen so that's that's an issue so here's what to do in this case follow the same steps i've given you make sure that we're seeing like if i have a constant i'm going to get all my logs on one side we're going to do that also i want to say i'm going to show you log base different bases being added the subtraction would work very similarly but you'd get a quotient instead of a product like we're going to get or something inspected a little differently so i'm not going to show that to you but uh but it is possible so you follow the same type of steps here so log base 2 of x plus log base 6 of x equals 3. you all right in the previous examples i was able to get a common sub base and i don't have that here so what to do when that doesn't happen is pick ln or log base 10 you have to pick some other base and the change in base says you can pick whatever you want but if you can't make them both the same pick ln it's a little easier to write pick log with them you can do that too but we're going to have to do that so i'm going to use ln ln x over ln2 i've taken argument on the numerator base on the denominator i've picked a base of e now inherently that does make the base the same doesn't it so pick the same thing don't be picking natural log here and common log there like log base e and log base 10 that would be kind of silly but change these into the same log we just don't have the ability to simplify our denominators like we did in the previous examples which makes it a little more challenging fraction wise we still have equal to 3. now we're gonna have to combine our logarithms aren't we like like we did all the other times because in order to use an exponential you have to have one logarithm on one side but the problem is in order to add fractions you have to have a common denominator well we're gonna have to get one which means that we're going to multiply by some missing pieces namely ln2 and ln6 so our lcd would be ln 2 times ln 6. we're missing a factor of ln6 we're missing a factor of ln2 so that's going to give us ln 6 times ln x i'm writing that multiplication there on purpose so you see some in a minute over ln 6 times ln2 plus ln x times ln 2 over ln 6 times ln2 that's what a common denominator is and that's how we're able to add subtract fractions so we're going to do that common denominators do not get added but on our numerator we see some some stuff that looks kind of confusing like what in the world are we going to do oh man i hope you see it this is not the fourth time you've seen this think back to what we did with inverses think back to the example we did on this video when you have x's floating around you need to group them and if you can't straight up add them factor them don't both of these terms have ln x as a factor something to be multiplied then yes then we have a greatest common factor the greatest common factor is l and x we're going to factor that so factoring l and x we would get ln x times ln 6 plus ln2 we might want to do one more thing just to make things nicer uh do you remember that if i had logarithms added together same base i can make one logarithm with the same base of our product so ln 6 plus ln2 equals ln 12 6 times 2 is 12. and now we're going to solve for ln x you could have multiplied both sides by your denominator here that that would would be appropriate you could even do it here that would be fine doesn't really matter after you create your common denominator but this may be a little bit nicer you can see your x you can see that i'm divided by this i need to multiply both sides by that so multiplying both sides by ln 6 ln 2 that would simplify and get 3 times ln 6 and ln 2. now i do want to i set my l and x but i need to get rid of my l and 12. let's divide both sides by lm12 what not to do don't try to combine those you cannot get l and 12 out of that at all you could combine ln 6 plus l and 2 l and 12. we've done that actually but this is not ln 12. you do not get to make up your own math you just multiply arguments if you want to these do not simplify don't simplify them you can't simplify them you're practically done on this side of your equation the only thing we have to do now is realize that this is precisely what we wanted we have now isolated a constant on one side and a logarithm without anything added subtracted multiplied nothing over here this is just a logarithm with a base of e our variables in there and this is actually a constant i know it looks weird but if you plug that in your calculator you would get a constant out of it now as soon as we do that as soon as we isolate our logarithm we write this as an exponential so our base is e our exponent is nasty crap and if we say base of e to nasty crap that's going to equal x it's going to solve the force it's going to look weird so e to the all this stuff as an exponent that is x that's called an exact solution uh that's that's about as good as we can make that it looks nasty if you haven't approximated you press second and the ln button that's going to pop up e with the parentheses and you plug in all that stuff um and then make sure you use parentheses appropriately and they'll give you a decimal approximation but it is a constant i know it looks weird but hopefully you're able to follow me hopefully understand like if i don't have common bases it makes our work a lot more difficult um again for the last time that was a minus you could still do this you find common denominator but when you combined you would get a if you got a minus you could come down here and when you factor you just get a minus right there but the same idea would work that's where i'm going to leave you on this i hope you followed i hope it was interesting to you i kind of enjoy working with the logarithms as hopefully you can tell i hope it is making sense though um i'll see you for another video we're going to talk about how to solve exponential equations we'll see a lot of the same ideas in these these techniques like can you use a substitution and for exponentials we're going to see that so hope you're enjoying it i'll see you later 

Transcript for: Solving Exponential Equations with Logarithms (Precalculus - College Algebra 64)
hey there welcome to another video in this video we're going to solve some exponentials so I'm going to show you four different ways to do that with a basic in exponential and one way to do that with some more advanced exponentials so we're going to talk about what in the world it means to use a logarithm to solve an exponential without common bases we'll discuss common bases a little bit but I'm not going to go into this video since we've already done that and then I'll show you some substitution techniques to deal with some exponentials that don't look exactly doable so let's get right into it when we say that we're going to solve an exponential equation with a logarithm what we're doing is we're implying that on this exponential equation we can't do this special case of finding common bases see we've done that several times where we had this exponential equation we said oh hey look magic happened and we have these common bases and once we find the same base on both sides of our equation we can set our exponents equal to one another we've done that already this is the case where what happens if you have an exponential equation there's no way to find a common base like three and five there's no way to change a five into a three or three and five into some lower base to set our exponents equal so here's the idea in solving any equation you need the inverse operation or inverse function because exponentials have an inverse and it's called a logarithm it's going to take a logarithm to solve these exponentials there are a few ways like four ways that I can show you how to do this that are all equivalent what that means is that your solution might look a little bit different than like a textbook or someone else's considering the choice you make on how to solve this uh when we get to not having just one exponential when we have two exponentials that really pairs down what we can do and leads us into um well you have to take a logarithm on both sides and we're going to see that so we're going to jump right into it here's the idea on how you solve every exponential equation in general if you can isolate your one exponential on one side and a constant on the other if you can't that means that you'll have two exponentials pick one on one side and one on the other now in either case if you do not have common bases you going to have to use a logarithm so we're going to do that right here so this is what's called not isolated when you have something added subtracted or multiplied by your exponential and that's on one side and a constant other you have to remove the coefficient or add or subtract to remove the constant in this case we're going to have to divide both sides by eight this is called isolated as far as exponential is concerned we're not really worried about the X+ one because that is in the exponent and it would help if we put some parentheses around that to show this is the exponent now here's what's going to have to happen we're going to have to choose on a basic exponential equation one of four ways to solve this we can either go directly to a logarithm using logarithmic notation or we can use a log on both sides in one of three different bases I'm going to show you all of those things right now so here's your your options I'm going to say this a couple more times but please remember if you have two exponentials like legit exponentials with variables this first way does not work you cannot go directly to one logarithm if you have two exponentials so here's the idea number one way we can do this is if you have one exponential and we have that here one exponential equal to a constant we can solve that logarithm by going directly to logarithmic notation we've actually seen that before so we just identify well what is our base well base is three what's our exponent our exponent is x + 1 and what they're equal to is 5/8 a logarithm will rewrite that for us it will solve for your exponent so logarithms take the base and the exponent and separate it on different sides of your equation so it takes your base of three your entire X X+ 1 can you see why we put that in parenthesis so we don't lose that so we don't accidentally add the or subtract one right now we have x + one on one side yeah we're going to subtract one but it's not from the 5/8 it's from a logarithm and then 5/8 is the inside of our logarithm and we're going to put that in parenthesis not because it's strictly necessary but because when we subtract one here in just a moment we don't want to accidentally subtract it from the argument of a logarithm that's exactly what we're going to do we have hey look a log them will solve for your exponent because your exponent contains your variable it's solving for your variable practically this is the easiest and most straightforward way to solve an exponential equation if there's just one exponential um is writing this directly as a logarithm now if we subtract one we're done that's as basic as this gets that's as simple as we can write this solution and it is a solution this is what's called an exact solution um it is not an approximation it has everything in there if you will if we wanted an approximation you'd have to plug that into your calculator now some of you can't because you cannot do anything beside a base of 10 or a base of of e like a natur a common log or a natural log respectively so what could you do if you had to approximate this we would use What's called the change of Base formula we talked about that it says pick whatever base you want well usually a base of 10 or a base of e and you could write this as a common log of 58 over a common log of three remember this goes on the numerator the base goes on the denominator and you pick whatever base you want in this case you pick a base of 10 because that's on your calculator and the minus one comes after that ratio so you plug this in or evaluate log of 58 now could you write that as log of 5 minus log you could do that is it beneficial it depends I mean sometimes maybe but here if we're just trying to approximate probably not just plug in a fraction then divide by log of three get that whatever that approximation is and then subtract one you could have also chosen Ln so if we take Ln and and use that as our new base we get Ln 58 over n Ln of 3 all minus one and that would equal x these are the three appropriate solutions that we can get out of this um is it okay to have any one of those yeah absolutely we're going to see that in the other three examples that we do so this is the most straightforward way to solve this isolate your exponential and then go directly to logarithmic notation however this does not always work if you have another exponential with a variable this technique won't work because you can't go to one logarithm if you have two different bases that would be a problem if you don't have two different bases you the same base then we wouldn't even be doing this we'd have the special case of hey I have common bases let's set the exponents equal so that wouldn't be relevant so let's go ahead and let's learn learn another technique that says well what would happen if we we don't have just one exponential these are going to they're all going to work but two of them are preferable so let's go to the next one so what if we add 3 to x + 1 = 5/8 again and we don't want to go directly to logarithm notation in x exponential equations you can do almost anything you want as long as you do it to both sides we can take a logarithm of both sides now why in the world do we want to do that well if an exponential's inverse is a logarithm a logarithm will undo that exponential so let's take a logarithm now the next two choices you have to solve these are you choose either a common log or a natural log most people use a natural log a common log is a base of 10 a natural log is a base of e now why do we want to do that is so that we don't have to go and do change of base anyway it already be in a base that's very usable for us for most people and their calculators so we choose a common log or a natural log to do that the last example is what if you were really smart and you took a logarithm both sides with a base that inherently matches here well that would be nice too so when you know what every want long do with both sides let's take a log of both sides let's choose a base 10 so that that way we can evaluate on our calculator when we get to the end very nicely so we would take our 3 x + 1 and our 58 and we would take a logarithm on both sides whatever base you want right but we're picking a base of 10 because that's on your calculator now why in the world this works on the right hand side you still have a constant logarithm of 58 is still a constant on the left hand side though y a logarithm allows us to solve an exponential is because it allows us oh this is a beautiful thing if you see it log base 10 of 3 x + 1 the x + one is now an exponent on the inside of your logarithm by the power property you can move that to the front of your logarithm so we would get x +1 * log of 3 = log of 5/8 they're still base 10 logarithms but by the power property we can move that exponent to the front as a coefficient now why is that useful well because that's now just something I can solve for I can solve for that X really nicely there's a couple things I really really want to point out to you that if you don't pay attention to anything else this is super important this is where almost every mistake comes from um moving on number one you absolutely have to have this exponent in parentheses when you move it to the front it's a must why because most of the time you're going to have to distribute that and if I allow you to write that without the X without the parenthesis some people aren't going to see it some people are going if I don't have those parentheses there are going to go oh I just subtract log of three and I'm done no you're not you make a very important choice and this second thing I want to bring up so number one you got to have parentheses it's a really big deal it shows what you're actually do shows you're multiplying the exponent times the logarithm secondly you make an important choice here the important important choice is you choose whether to distribute or not here's when to distribute firstly if you don't understand what I'm about to say do it all the time you can't really mess it up do it all the time distribute all the time and you can solve for x and not all that bad but if you don't if you if you do understand this if you have no other X's anywhere in your equation you don't have to distribute this you can divide by log of three and then subtract one that would be fun you could do that so dividing both sides by log of three we have this wait a minute that looks really really familiar because the same thing and if we subtract one we would get exactly this right here we would get exactly log of 58 over log of 3us one that is perfectly fine now I said also well wait a minute uh could you distribute you could distribute and it's not all that big of a deal but I want to show it to you to make sure that you see that our our answers can look different when do you have to distribute again you have to distribute if you have more than one X if you have any other X is FL anywhere around here you've got to distribute combine your X terms on one side your non-x terms on the other Factor an X and divide we've seen this is the fourth time that we will have seen this in this class this idea of oh yeah I have multiple things I'm trying to solve for distribute collect them Factor divide that's the idea I'm going to show that to you kind of preface what we're going to do after we finish these these four techniques on the next examples so this is cool we've already seen it it's exactly the same thing now what if we chose to distribute something you will have to do in some of the examples moving forward if we choose to distribute we get x * log of 3 plus 1 * log of 3 which just log of 3 as always I'm trying to train you on what where we're going to get to in a little while in a little while what's going to happen is you'll distribute you'll have an X term here and an X term here maybe somewhere else you will combine well you move your X terms to one side your non-x terms to the other then you'll factor and divide that's what we're going to get to in just a little while here we're kind of doing the same thing we're getting our X terms on one side that's this one that's already there this is not an X term that means you got to get rid of it so that you can divide appropriately we're going to subtract log of three I'm still keeping that 5/8 in parentheses so I don't accidentally subtract and lastly because we have one X term because that's connected by some coefficient this really is a coefficient log three is just a constant it's saying 10 to what power gives you three it's an exponent of 10 to that exponent gives you three it'll be some sort of decimal there but this represents a number we can divide by that so if we divide both sides by log of three here's what we would get remember that when you're dividing you can separate one fraction minus another fraction but take a look at what you would get this first fraction would be log of 58 over log of 3 minus log of 3 over log of 3 which is one and that's precisely the same thing that we get right here so which way is better well it that's a personal choice I suppose uh me I like to divide right here when I don't have to distribute but if I'm not confident on knowing what I need to distribute I'll distribute every time uh there are times when this will not work you cannot just divide it uh if you have X's anywhere else you have to distribute I hope that sounds for you let's move on to the next way so I'm going to start over with uh 3 to the x +1 equals 5/8 I'm going to take a log on both sides again but I'm going to do a natural log this is usually a very preferred way for people because it's Ln not a lot of writing uh less than log one less letter every time um and also that if you ever have a base of e a natural log automatically compos es with that now I want you to think about that for a second could you use a logarithm that automatically composes an inverse with an exponential what base would that be and that's our fourth technique so here we're going to choose a natural logarithm it's a very common thing for us to do and we would get on both sides log base e log base e what you do to one side you have to do the other it's going to model exactly like this so I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time doing this what this lets us do is if you have a logarithm on some exponential lets you move the exponent to the front as a coefficient but you got to keep it in parenthesis so that's x +1 ln3 Ln 58 think in your head right now do I absolutely have to distribute this do I have to absolutely have in parentheses yes do i abs have to distribute this not if there's no other X's but if there are then yes so this is a choice you make right now this is the only time you get a choice is when you don't have any other X's you can choose to divide right now which I'm going to do or distribute subtract and then divide which is modeled right here if you just change this to an Ln you get exactly the same thing so we're going to do x + 1 I'll divide both sides by Ln 3 I'll subtract one now how in the world do we know that this and this are the same as this over here or this right here well we can still do the change of Base but only in reverse think about this for a second if the change of Base says says that I pick whatever base I want just take the argument to the numerator base to the denominator pick whatever other uh base you want and you create this ratio can we go backwards well as long as we have the same base the answer is yeah so if we have log base e of 5/8 and log base e of three this is your new argument and this is your new base of some other logarithm provided these are the same base which they are so you could totally write this as log base 3 of 58 minus one you're just doing change of Base in Reverse these have the same base therefore I can combine them to one logarithm with that as the new base that as a new argument same thing would happen here you have log base 10 hey those have the same base new logarithm would have a log of this would be the argument this would be the base exactly like that one so they're all equivalent they just look a little bit different they're all valid whatever you want now the last one we already know we can do a logarithm on both sides of an equation provided we actually do it to both sides and we also know that like an Ln composed with a an exponential base e or a a common log composed with an exponential base 10 simplify because youve naturally compose an exponential onto its inverse which is a logarithm then that's great well can we make that happen here what if we took this and said you know what we know about logarithms and exponentials being inverses what if I took a very specific logarithm what if I took a log base 3 now why would I want to do log base 3 notice you have to do it on both sides but if you do log base 3 of 3 wait a minute that's a logarithm base 3 an exponential base 3 you compose a function on its inverse they will cancel out they will give you the exponent you could move the exponent to the front and you get a one there and you go oh yeah I remember that property do you remember it log base 3 of three to whatever power you have is the power that you have that's what we're doing right here this no matter what you do you're going to get just x + one if we subtract one we get the same thing we've got every other time this really is the same as writing this as a as logarithmic not ation it's just showing a little bit of more work uh either way you go it's going to come out the same preferentially you'd probably pick a common log or a natural log because that would be very easy to evaluate on your calculator this one you'd have to change your base would you you say hey I want a log base 10 or log base e and write this as Ln 58 over ln3 exactly what we had right there minus one so I hope I've made that make sense these are the four options that you have to solve a basic exponential now we're going to move on and this one's going to fall off the map and so really is this one uh because both of those deal with a very specific base what if I have two bases well then would benefit us for one exponential but not the other and so we typically pick a natural logarithm to do this or a common log in some cases but most of the time just a natural so we're going to come back with a couple more examples and show that all right now I'm not giving you a whole bunch of examples in this video I'm really giving you only five I've done one of them like four different ways but these next two are going to illustrate a lot of different examples kind of in one a lot of different examples look like one of these two uh and the the reason why I'm only giving you a couple is because really there's not much else that doesn't fit in one of these categories there there are some substitutions I'm going to give you the next two examples but if you're going to solve some exponential equations there's typically those you can isolate on one side and then do what I just showed you in the previous example those which have two exponentials but have a common base which I've showed you in previous videos or those have two exponentials that don't have a common base that's what we're dealing with here so we have two exponentials they certainly don't have common bases not not present and and not available you can't write a five as a two you can't write a five and a two as some other base so that's off the table also we have an inability to isolate an exponential here like we have two of them so we can't get one of them on one side and a constant on the other side which is why the first technique I taught you the last example is not going to work here you can't write this in as one logarithm with one base with two different bases that's not going to work so we're on to one of the last three examples uh last three I guess methods in the previous example could we could we choose to do like a log base 2 on both sides yes you could but what's going to happen is you'll end up doing a change of base later if you want to approximate it so I'm going to I'm going to give you one of do one of two things choose to do a common log on both sides or a natural log I'm always going to do a natural log because I prefer it um also when we see in the next example natural log is really nice when we match a base with a base now you could have done that here but we deal with some other issues if we we end up doing that so um not hard issues but but issues maybe I'll show that to you in just a just a bit so so let's take a look at it so it's got two exponentials we don't have a common base we can't isolate one the only way to solve exponentials like this without common bases are to use a logarithm and we're going to apply a on both sides we're going to pick a natural log so an Ln on both sides of this equation what's going to allow us to do is move our exponent to the front right here is also where I always write parentheses around that exponent why because I know I'm going to move it and if I have them now I'll be able to move it later and not forget them so I'm going to do a natural L it's got to be on both sides you don't have an option here what you do to one side you have to do the other but once we've done that we change an exponential kind of into a logarithm and allows us to move by the power property these exponents as coefficients as products next to a logm I've done a mistake on purpose I want you to see it this is I see this a lot when I'm grading test things like that I see students who do this and they understand the property they really get it but then they fail to do one little thing and it leads to a lot of problems do you see how if I do this this looks like a term and this looks like a term and it's not there's a product here this is the case if I write it correctly where you must distribute I hope that you can Jose this with the previous example said oh you might have to might not but look if you have x's in other place beside this one right here beside one parentheses one parenthetical expression if you have anywhere else you must distribute get your X terms on one side your non-x terms on the other side Factor this side and then divide so that's our our necessary process for solving these there's really not another way to go about doing it because X's are in multiple places if we just start dividing here we're going to make this side even worse so distribute everything right now that's why we put the parenthesis and that's why we're noticing multiple X's so we can make that judgment call so we've distributed we know that we can distribute ln2 we can distribute ln5 we're kind of doing backwards distribution but it doesn't really matter and now we're noticing that hey look there's one two terms with x's we need to group those so that we can Factor there's one two terms without X's we need get those on the opposite side so that we don't have to worry about factoring those because they don't have X's they wouldn't anyway so I'm going to add 2X ln5 and subtract ln2 we're going to watch our signs be real careful is really easy to make signs when we're make sign errors when we're moving terms around so I've added 2X ln5 I've subtracted ln2 my other signs look pretty good this is why we want to do it so that we can group our X terms grouping X terms every every term that has an X in it we can factor that X terms that don't have X's don't need that so are on the other side so we don't have to we don't have to worry about factoring something they don't have so factoring X we factor x and get ln2 we factor x and get 2 Ln 5 this is great this is exactly what we want because what it does now is it creates a product for us and how we undo products is with division before that we had two x's we couldn't really divide it wouldn't be relevant but now that we have that factored version of it we can divide both sides by whatever that expression is so Ln 5us ln2 all divid ln2 + 2 Ln 5 it's pretty wordy that's lots of LNS can you see it differently could you see it differently yeah you really could now this is perfectly appropriate you you can you can do this this is approximable but I do want you to see that there is some simplification possible for instance can you combine two logarithms of the same base that they're being subtracted yeah of course you can create one logarithm the same base with a a fraction or a quotient inside so 5 over two inside of a logarithm on your denominator can you combine two logarithms being added if they have the same base yeah you can but you'd have to move a coefficient as an exponent so wait a minute this is ln2 plus Ln 5^ SAR if you move that as an exponent that's Ln 2 + Ln of 25 how do you combine two logarithms being added with the same base well you multiply you that plus creates a product inside one logm so Ln of 50 you could see that you could certainly see that you could even have a 2.5 there but you could certainly see that in the back of a textbook because they combine all this now if you got this and you look at that clearly you're going to go I made a mistake you haven't they've just combined some things in fact we can do one more now I would leave it here because that's easiest to approximate on your calculator it's going to basic be you got an Ln button that's great notice something I'm going to pause right here and just say this could you have done a common log and just put log everywhere and got the same thing with log and log yes absolutely and it does not make a difference this is why I'm not showing it to you I'm not going to repeat this the same steps with just that word log that's fine what you could do though here is because you have the same base in a fraction I'm hoping you see it do you see that we can use change of Base in Reverse we could really write this as a log with a base of 50 and a new argument of five halves now I don't know if that's better or worse uh but that is one logarithm notice it's not Ln anymore you changed the base you said these have the same base of E I can combine this make this my new base and my new argument andate create one logarithm that's as concise as we can make it there nothing better that we can do with that as far as I know now I did say there is another way to do this um you'll see that you have to do a change of Base somewhere or you end up with something just like this so approximate might not be the best but from here could you choose a logarithm with a base of two a base of five and get the same thing yes you can um I don't care which base you choose it's kind of a whatever you want to do in it but if we did let's take a log base 2 of both sides so on this side notice what happens this is the important side for you see if you choose a log base 2 you inherently match a logarithm and an exponential and compose a function with its inverse and you are going to get x + 1 on the right hand side though you have log base 2 of 5 to 1 - 2x well because that is an exponent you have to solve that by moving this to the front of your your logarithm then Distributing then collecting your X terms your non-x terms and dividing I wouldn't say it's better or worse it's just different now do you have to distribute well I just said you did but the reason reason is because you have an X here and X here you must distribute this we got to collect our X terms and our non-x terms so adding and subtracting respectively Factory and then dividing I'm keeping this five in parentheses so that I don't accidentally subtract that one that would be good now that looks decidedly different as what we got right there is it the same thing yes but it might take you some work to actually see it um I hesitated for a second cuz I didn't know if I really wanted to show you but I do cuz always do time darn it uh look if you change this to log base 2 of 25 so move that as an exponent get log base 2 of 25 and then you can write this as Ln 5 over ln2 change of base and ln25 over ln2 change of Base do you notice that your LCD of ln2 on this complex fraction you can multiply ln2 over ln2 it would distribute cancel here and get ln5 minus ln2 that's that it would distribute here that' be ln2 and cancel ln25 here's ln2 and this is ln25 so it is the same thing it just looks decidedly different way way different and that's one thing you find out with logarithms is that sometimes what you get can look fundamentally different from someone else's answer and they're both right because there's lots of different techniques that are equivalent lots of different properties that will do the same desired effect on this and so don't really worry about it as long as you follow an appropriate technique what I'm showing you here one of these two things you're going to be fine I hope that makes sense to you I hope that you see that we can get a different look but it's still exactly the same thing all right we're going to move on to the next one before we do our substitution so we have e to x + 3 = pi to X that looks kind of crazy um this is one reason why a lot of people use LM and this one is for sure you're going to want to do that it's kind of the same reason is using Ln or log of two here because you get this cancel thing going on and you deal with something with a different base on the side that's okay but with a log base e you don't have to write that that base so it looks a little cleaner and a natural log is something we can automatically evaluate on our calculators so that's very nice very convenient so we qual we um we qualify this so we say what what it looks like is this an exponential where you can have common bases uh no that's that's not going to happen is this an exponential equation where you have an exponent exponential on one side and a constant other no we have two valid exponentials both of whom have both of which have variables in their exponent so we cannot do those two techniques we have to we're forced to do a logarithm on both sides so you could choose a log base 10 y or we could choose a log base e yes why a natural log that already has a base of e so when we do a logarithm on both sides and we choose that base of e in our logarithm it inherently composes a function with its inverse and it doesn't make the other side worse like it kind of did over here that was a little bit tedious to work through what it does it says this is a log base e this is exponential base e we know from our properties that's going to simplify and we just get x + 3 do you need to move this to the front of your your your logarithm you can but it's not going to be relevant you're just going to get Ln of e to the first Power you get a one one * x + 3 gives you x + 3 this property is fine you're using a property of exponential oh sorry logarithms right here to say when you compose a function it's inverse it does cancel on the right hand side nothing really happens besides the fact that we have to move this to the front as a coefficient now there's no distribution to do like we had to do over here because we just have that x to the first Power not added or subtracted if I would have put like a minus two here then yeah I'd have to distribute and combine my X it would look very much like this example or this example which is why I'm not showing that to you I've already done that so if that had like a minus two we'd have to have an x minus 2 and then distribute in this case we're going to group our X terms on one side our non-x terms on the other this is telling you you're going to have to factor and divide so I've subtracted X Ln pi and subtracted 3 now that we have all our X terms grouped we can factor that X and lastly we're going to divide both sides we're done that's about as clean as I can make it there's no other there's only one logarithm and so there's no logs I can combine I hope that you're seeing why we like to use Ln a lot it's a little easier to write it's on your calculator and it cleans up every time we see an e and composite with a natural log it's very very nice also you're noticing one thing you're noticing me not really plugging in a lot of these to say hey what about our domain remember something our domain for exponentials is all real numbers so it doesn't matter what we plug in to our exponentials we're going to be able to get something out what that means is that we're never having a domain issue now the range of an exponential is from zero to positive Infinity not including the zero remember that you can't plug in a number to an exponential and get zero unless it's been shifted so there will be some horizontal ASM tootes somewhere on our exponentials what that also meant for logarithms was that your domain has to be reversed from an exponential and your range is reversed from an exponential let me explain a little bit better if your domain of an exponential is all real numbers your range for a logarithm is all real numbers if your range for exponential is from0 to Infinity your domain for a logarithm is from 0 to Infinity is that a problem when we start taking a logarithm on both sides because we should always be thinking of the domain right um two functions are inverses on their domains respectively so so think about that when I take a logarithm of both sides of an exponential do I have a problem am I saying oh that could be negative I'm not because an exponential can only give me out positives it cannot give me out negatives unless it's been shifted around and that would be a constant added afterwards added after your exponential we don't have that that's always positive that's always positive and so when I take a logarithm of both sides no matter which one I do this is always positive this is always positive that logorithm is saying I need my inside to be positive exponential says no problem I can't even give you a I can't even give you zero so we're not breaking a domain issue when we take a logarithm on both sides of our exponentials I hope that you're seeing that seeing that yeah I'm doing a logarithm and the insides have to be positive but exponentials range is from 0 to Infinity that matches perfectly with the domain of a logarithm being 0 to Infinity that we need to use a logarithm anyhow that's why this technique Works they are inverses on their respective domain okay I hope you're ready we got a couple ones that look a little weird um when you see this you see several terms mainly like three terms and you have some things that say I cannot possibly isolate an exponential here um I can't get two exponentials one on each side and so I will not be able to use the common basis directionals equal I won't be able to use a direct take a log of both sides I don't just have one of one of these one exponential I can't combine them and so I won't be able to go straight to a logarithm typically what you'll do here is a substitution technique and so here's the thought process if I've got not all exponentials I can't isolate one and I can't make them equal so I can't use logarithms common basis I'm going to have to change it to something that's not an exponential to solve it and then put the exponential back so when we take a look at it all right can I write this as something where the first term and the second term have the same exponential right now they don't right now we have 2 2X and 2 X+ 2 those are very different they have the same base though that's very important and then a constant well you don't necessarily need the constant but can I write the at least the first two terms or all the terms if you want if there are more than that um as having the same exponential that we can substitute so we're going to do things like use some exponent rules to rewrite these a little bit and I'm going to walk you through that so something like 2 2X and 2 X+ 2 firstly identify what your exponential wants to be we probably going to work this down to 2 to the X well that means I need to rewrite the first term as 2 to the X and the second term is 2 the x times something else or to another power so if I want to write the first term is 2 the X and the second term is 2 the X think about what 2 2x means 2x is 2 * X now how do we get 2 * X for exponentials well that had to come from an exponent raised to another exponent because when an exponent is raised to another one we multiply those so this came from 2 x^2 notice how this still makes 2 2x so we're just thinking through kind of the opposite of some exponent rules and writing this as something that's going to be the same as another part of my function another term part of that term now how about uh 2 x + 2 well I I need to the X but x + 2 how do I add exponents exponents that are added came from common bases that were multiplied that's not right but that is what I want second so X to or 2 the 2x came from x * 2 x * 2 is 2X x 2 x + 2 came from 2 x * 2 the 2 notice how if I were to combine those I would get common base I would get 2 to the x + 2 I would add those exponents that's where that came from and then- 12 so we've pretty much accomplished what we set out to do if we simplify that just a little bit that's just four when you're trying to do a substitution we're trying to make the first term and the second term have the same exact inside in this case the same exact exponential to the X and then we have these Powers whatever we have it doesn't really matter we're trying to get that out of there so when we accomplish that when we look at this and say hey I can rewrite these and I can rewrite them so I have the same exponential in two spots and nowhere else well then I'm going to do a substitution I'm going to call that U now we're going to use that twice we've seen this several times we know that we're going to get away from 2 to the X and then later on we'll go back to it almost always what you get is going to be factorable so get everything on one side get in order first ter POS POS and Factor it if it's not factorable I'm not going to do one for you this time I'm really not if it's not factorable you need quadratic formula if it's higher than a power two you need another technique to solve it but ultimately once you solve it you go back to the hey the U solve for is 2 to the X put that back and then continue with the logarithm and you can do that given you four techniques on how to do that um so but most of these are factorable if not quadratic formula it's kind of nasty but they are they are factorable most times so this would be U + 6 u - 2 = 0 uh we can check it but that's going to be correct zero property says keep on going now you're not done you're so close but you're not done we're remember that we're not trying to solve for U we're trying to solve for x and our X is wrapped up in exponential we said U is 2 X so if U = -6 then 2 x = -6 and if u = 2 then 2 x = 2 now what do we do well we think firstly let's think about this one 2 x = -6 you go wait a minute I thought exponentials had to be positive that's true and sometimes in these techniques we get a false solution this is not valid your exponential can't equal negative do you remember they have a horizontal ASM toote of zero they can't even get below zero unless you start shifting them and that's not shifted so this right here is not okay uh this right here is not a valid solution there's no X you can plug in to make this actually happen now if you tried to if you went to a logarithm you said hey my base is 2 my exponent is X you end up with a domain issue a range issue listen a range issue for an exponential what you get out is a range issue a range problem for an exponential becomes a domain problem for your logarithm why because range and domain switch for every inverse relationship that you have as far as functions are concerned including exponential logarithms this is not a valid solution creates a domain issue for the logarithm a range issue for the exponential either way you just can't have it now what about this one you can write this as logarithm or you can just think about it these have common bases hey that's kind of nice two and two equal which means X has to equal that expon of one now in general this is not what you're you're going to have to do right you're going to have to write this as logarithm so you you certainly can because your base is two log base 2 solves for that so log base 2 of 2 = x here's your base here's your exponent we separate those with the logarithm and this uses a very nice property say you compos a function with his inverse that's exactly what we said you're with the same base anyway and you would get xal 1 I'm going to walk you through a couple others what would happen if this wasn't a two what if this was a one if that was a one you you you can think about it just think two to what power gives you one uh any base to what power gives you one you have to have zero that would bear out right here so if I had base of 2 exponent of x a logorithm separates the base from the exponent puts what the exponent equals to as your argument and says hey that's another property we have log base I don't care of one is always zero then zero would equal x okay what if it wasn't one of those special cases that you showed me Leonard what if it was like seven what if log base L sorry 2 the xal 7 well logarithm still writes it as log base 2 = x and you'd have seven right there this is a solution this is fine you're done you don't have to do anything more now if you're asked to approximate which you almost always are then you could do a change of Base pick Ln pick log base 10 doesn't really matter and you can evaluate that ratio so those are the three cases that we typically get when we're doing a substitution we never get this whole um exponential equals exponential with uh without the common base we never get variables on both sides so those previous examples aren't really relevant for a substitution because we don't really get that well we end up getting something that looks like this or the two previous ones that I gave you and then we can go directly to a logarithm now could you you could you do Ln on both sides move your your exponent and divide you could but it is easiest to go directly to a logarithm and that's why I showed you that first technique in the first example that we did so that this would become easier so I hope that makes sense our real answer was uh was one I just want to show that to you just so we're kind of complete here all right last one I'll discuss one more with you but I'm not going to solve it all the way I'll discuss it this last one that we're actually go way through we're going to look at this and we're going to firstly recognize what it's talking about this is an exponential equation yes but categorize it is this something where I have one exponential well no that means that I can't isolate it and get a constant other side and then use direct logorithm is this something where I have two exponentials where I can get one on one side and one on the other side either for common bases or for logarithms direct use of logarithms no because that five messes it up actually that 2K messes up two I can't just get one log one exponen on one side one on the other and do a log of both sides it's not going to work I'm going to have to do a substitution so if I'm going to have to do a substitution I'm going to make this so that I have the same exponential in two terms of my expression here in my equation so I'm looking at this thinking well what's the best choice for our base uh 49 looks like it be simplified into a base of seven so we're going to do that first so I'm thinking I want to write this as a base of s this is 7 SAR now that's all well and good but that doesn't help us why well because that's 7 to the X and that's 7 to the 2 I need them to be the same but take a look at what happens if I have seven to the second power to the X power I can multiply that 2 * X but wait a minute 2 * X means the same thing as x * 2 so could I just reverse those keep this in mind if 2 * X is 2x then if I put an X here and a two there that would still be 2x I'm really hoping that you see that because multiplication is commutative you can have those two exponents in whatever order you want and they still make um 49 to the X honestly they still make the same thing so whether I have 7 to the x or 7^ s x it doesn't matter so I'm going to choose this one because it fits what we're trying to do here fits with the I'm trying to match the the exact same exponential in two terms of my equation I also show those in parentheses to make my substitution a little bit more noticeable so if my my 7 to the X exponential is going to change into U I've got two and then this becomes u^2 11 U and then + 5 okay so uh let's go ahead and factor that it's going to be factorable almost all the time just be careful when they're not you have to use a different technique uh check your factor it's probably factorable so this is going to factor as common mistake you're not in X's right now you're in U so when you factor you got to use U so we've got 1 U + 5 we've got 2 U + 1 we can double check this that's 2 u^2 plus u and plus 10 U that's 11 U and then + 5 the zero product property is going to set each of these equal to zero right now looks just fine but the next thing we're going to do hopefully you understand this is not so fine when we do this right now we're going to look at this and go wait hang on a second I've got two negative numbers here those cannot be Solutions because exponentials cannot equal negatives now I'm going to make real clear this is not a domain issue for your exponential you can plug in anything that you want this is a range issue this is saying what can you plug in to get this output you can't there is it's a range issue there's no way to get out5 and2 from 7 to the x it becomes a domain issue for our logarithm if we were to try to do it we'd get log base 7 of5 and log base 7 of2 that's a domain issue because it came from a range issue of an exponential hope that makes sense if we would have had positive now we don't I know we don't but if we would have had positive then you'd be just fine you can say all right this would be log base 7 of 5 log base 7 of 12 = X please listen this will give you a negative that would be fine to get a negative out but you can't have a negative inside your logarithm that would be plugging in a negative for your exponential that's okay you can plug in a negative here that'd be fine to plug in a negative but it can't give you one out so what you can't get out of an exponential is what you can't plug in to a logarithm I can plug in negatives I can't get out negatives I can can't plug in netives I can get out negatives for logarithms so these would be your two solutions if these had been positive I just want to show that to you to make sure we saw that one more time um you could show it differently of course you could do a log of both base seven of both sides and Ln of both sides move your X divide a log base 10 of both sides move your expent divide you could also do change of base and get log of five over log of 7 or Ln 5 over Ln 7 same thing over there and get a different different look so that you can approximate it a little bit easier but that's where I'm going to end on these problems is this idea once you get down to here this is something we've talked about already you cannot let them equal negatives in this case you have no solution it's not possible to do okay I felt bad that I gave you one with no solution feels like you didn't get what you paid for even though for most of you this is absolutely free um so I'm going to give you one more I feel like it and I can uh so sometimes these negative exponents just go what and I'm stuck and I don't want to do and I wanted to show how to do that and that you can get one solution out of these at least this one does um so let's take a look at that 3 x - 14 * 3x = 5 firstly classify or qualify it where does it fit is this one exponential no can I combine those no not with subtraction do not try you can't do it uh okay can I get one exponential on one side and one on the other side without a constant to use common bases no because the five messes it up and so is A- 14 can I get one exponential one side one on the other side with different bases and use a logorithm no because for the same reason this is another substitution but you have to set it up correctly we must get the same exponential in order to substitute it and we have to have it in two terms so what are we going to do for our techniques to work by the way what are we going to do if you see a negative exponent there's two choices and this is what your text we say multiply by x to the POS 1 oh sorry um I said that wrong multiply by 3 to postive X you can do that on both sides but it might be a little easier to see why you're doing that if I should and it's the same thing but maybe write a little differently so you see why you're doing that remember that a negative exponent creates a fraction with whatever is being raised to that negative exponent on the denominator right where it's at so this means this this means 3 this means 1 over 3 POS X so 14 * 1 over 3 POS X gives you 14 over 3 x this is why they're telling you multiply by 3 x why because this is now a an equation has fractions in it how do you get rid fractions you multiply by the L CD in this case that's just 3 x now do we have a domain issue by having that on the denominator no because 3 x can't even equal zero oh it's horizontal ASM you can't even equal that so there is no problem all we've got to do is understand that in either case what we want to multiply by is something that makes that negative go away well that's going to be 3 to the X now you keep this in mind it's got to be on both sides whether you do it here or here doesn't matter it has to be on both sides because you're multiplying in equation so multiply both sides by whatever takes that negative exponent that negative exponent means something on the denominator that needs to go away in our case it's 3 to X we're going to multiply and then distribute um if I distribute here I'm going to get 3 to the x^2 don't write three to the uh the 2x don't don't add them write them as what you're going to need for the substitution so 3 x * 3 x is 3 x^ 2 could you write it as 3 2x yes but you're going to get exactly what you got here that's where that came from it came from 2 x * 2 x that gave you 2 2x which we had to write as 2 x^2 so this is the same thing is that but we've written it more appropriately for our substitution work that gives you 3 to X Quan squ this your denominator is going to cancel with that so 3 x * 14 over 3 x you cancel that you get- 14 you go wait a minute my substitution doesn't work ah It's Tricky that's why on the other side of the equation we had to multiply by 5 * 3 x there's your other term with your 3 X in it so we're going to everything on one side because we're going to substitute and then Factor please notice that doing it right here is the same thing you get 3 to x^2 you'd get -4 * 3x * 3 POS XX I'll show it multiplying common bases you add your exponents x * or plus positive x is 0 3 0 is 1 you just get4 either way personally I think that's a little easier to see but they do work the same whichever one you feel confident with it's going to work perfectly for you so now we're set up we have a substitution available to us that's 3 x so we're going to substitute that and get U ^2 - 5 u - 14 = 0 this factors pretty nicely for us if you do it right u^2 that would be plus that' be - 5 U and -4 can you see which of these is going to give give us a nonvalid solution for real numbers hopefully you say I cannot allow an exponential to equal a negative that's off the table your exponentials can't give you a negative it's a range issue becomes a domain issue for a logarithm that we would need to solve that this however looks really good so I do a log of both sides move my X and divide log of any BAS you want doesn't really matter log base 3 cool log base 10 cool log Bas e it doesn't matter I would move this to the front that's one option that's very easy to approximate another option use log base 10 you get log of 7 over log of 3 very easy to approximate or making it more concise from here you can do a change of base and pick the base of three and an argument of seven in a new logarithm and that's exactly what we get if we went directly from our exponential to a logarithm you say hey here's my base here's my exponent log base 3 of 7 would equal x because a logarithm separates base from exponent either one of those is going to work just fine I hope that this has made sense I've gone above and beyond I think as far as our our examples here I've shown you every case I could think of uh to solve an exponential so I hope that you're with me um moving forward we're basically done with what I need you to know with exponentials we're going to go on to how to use them in some real life scenarios like finance and like um differential equations but only as an introduction to exponential growth and Decay so I'll see you for those videos and I hope you do them all 

Transcript for: Review of Compound Interest (Precalculus - College Algebra 65)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about interest just one application of how exponentials and logarithms can work together to solve some financial problems for us I'm not going to be teaching this at length because we've already I've already talked about interest in a lot of other places uh on the channel uh this should be and you should have seen it before somewhere you should have seen compound interest uh what we're going to do here is just a brief review if you've never seen it before it's not a problem I will teach you well enough for you to understand it um and then we'll focus on what we really should be getting to like solving for how long it would take to double an investment or how long it would take to reach a certain goal uh finding some other missing variables not just plugging in like these two examples will illustrate but I will illustrate that also you will need a calculator because we can't do this stuff in our head so hopefully have one handy and let's get started so one application of of exponentials is this type of growth now interestingly open intended is that when we talk about interest growth it is an exponential modeling and that's also the same type of modeling as natural growth or natural Decay if it's uninhibited and we'll talk about that in the next video so really fascinating stuff that exponentials can be used to model some real life things for us that were very used to um so we're going to take a look at compound interest whether it's compounded annually semiannually quarterly monthly weekly daily or continuously there's two different formulas that you need to know so let's go ahead let's review those formulas and we'll get right into it so these are the compound interest formulas for compounded continuously and compounded for some finite number of compounds per year now in a typical finance class I usually go ahead and and and drive these so I tell you exactly where they come from U from simple interest to compound but that's not really the nature of this course we're just using this to model uh some financial instruments with exponentials so here's what these words mean if you have not been exposed to it or just forgotten what they are so let me take a look at these two formulas what the P stands for in both cases is something called the principle or present value of your investment or your loan uh so either way when we talk about compound interest the same formula uh every time you borrow money someone's loaning it so every single time interest is Chang in hand someone is making it and someone is giving it interest is this cost of borrowing money uh so the p is what the money's worth when you start your investment or start your borrowing so it's called the present value or the principle a is the future value so it's what the money is going to be worth to somebody at the very end of this this investment let's say um or the total amount we can say so that's what the a stands for it's what everything would be like if you borrowed five grand then at the end of however many years you're going to pay back five grand plus interest the cost of borrowing that $5,000 for this length of time that you've agreed to uh you see there's there's certain amount of risk and and there's a certain amount of I'm without my money if you loan money to someone so when you invest money you're you're basically loaning money to someone else to use whether that's a bank or private individual or the stock market whatever wherever you're putting your money you're loaning it to someone to do stuff with uh and so that's that idea of making interest well someone's paying you interest uh they're borrowing your money for a certain amount of time even Banks do this when you put your bank your money in a bank account take that money they do a whole lot other stuff with it they make money and they give you a little bit in return and that's why at the end of the month your bank account goes up however much money you have have in there uh it determines how how quickly that's going to rise so anyhow so p is our present value a is our amount or sometimes called our future value R is an interest rate it's always written as a decimal so even though they're going to give it to you as a percentage you're going to write as a decimal we're going to move the decimal place two spots to the left because we're dividing by 100 to remove that percentage all these formulas work in decimal rather than percent notation for our our values for interest rate then we talked about T T is time yes but it's always in terms of years because our interest rate is given in terms of years and so this is always based on years and then we have a choice whether we're going to choose compounded continuously or compounded not continuously depend on what the problem is telling us to do if we have continuously compounded interests we have a special formula now you notice that e there it's really fascinating that continuously compounded interest is natural uninhibited growth the same exact thing that we're going to get in the next video talking about population growth or of like bacteria or things like this it be modeled well by this that's going to become an a sub zero that's going to become an a of T other than that that'll be a k rather than an R uh be a type of growth rate rather than a type of interest rate but the same exact thing I'm going to point you back to this so when we talk about growing money we really are we're growing money like we are a population uh of bacteria except that instead of bacteria this the money is dollars and cents rather than cells um so anyhow this would be for continuous growth but notice it has an a a p an r and a t now this has an n and a lot of people get confused on what that n is if you are not continuously compounded then you're going to be compounded for a finite number of times in one year that finite number is called n so n is the number of compounds that your investment let's say or loan receives in one year's time well that means there's a special word that has to go along with these problems if we're not compounded continuously we're compounded monthly or annually or daily weekly whatever so when we read through that that number of compounds that's happen in one year's time that's our n so for annual annually compounded interest you're only getting interest one time a year at the very end of the year semiannually would be two and we split it evenly and then we work our way down quarterly would mean four monthly would mean 12 weekly there's 52 weeks in year and daily 365 so if you were to receive daily compounded interest you would get a little bit interest every day for the entire year now that sounds really good like I want that one and in general it is better if you're if you're um if you're loaning money or making invest to receive more interest quicker so you want interest as often as possible continuously it would be great so what's continuously mean continuously means every moment of every minute of every SEC of every hour of every day of every month of every year you're getting a little teeny bit of Interest however I want you to notice something here it sounds really good but what does the N practically do the n takes the rate which is yearly interest it's always in terms of years and divides it so if I'm taking my interest rate let's say um let's say 10% and I divide by n well the larger my n gets the smaller this this number gets one plus that's going to be very very very close to one if I have really really really big numbers and then I I take it to an exponent but notice I'm taking one plus some small number to an exponent yeah this will grow but practically what n does is this it says I'm going to divide your interest rate into a certain number why would I do that let's talk about monthly if I were to get monthly compounded interest I'm going to get one 12th of my interest every year or sorry every month so it take let's say 12% and would divide it I get 1% the first month 1% the second month 1% the third month and then by the end of the year I would have got 12% of Interest now what what what's the N doing times the T well if you're getting monthly compound interest how many times are you getting interest in one year Well you getting interest 12 times well that's for every single year so n Cuts your rate and multiplies your years if it's the number of times you're getting interest in one year's time that should make a little bit of sense this doesn't have that why well it's a funny little thing that we have as n gets larger and larger and larger and larger and larger and larger and larger and larger so how how many moments are in a year Well it's not just a number of seconds right there's an infinite number of moments in a second uh so there's an infinite number of moments in a year also like a lot of moments so if your interest is continuously compounding you're getting a little interest every single moment well there's an infinite number of moments but it's really hard to plug an Infinity to something well what this ends up being you can see this is modeled on this to some thing going to Infinity this actually ends up being e you can figure this out in calculus to but this ends up being e so if you take your n to like Infinity this part of your compound interest formula becomes e practically that's a really simplistic way to talk about it but that's what's happening that's why we have two different formulas so what we're going to do is we're going to practice putting this into place we'll see how the N affects this as we go through if that didn't make a whole lot of sense to you it should because we've SE it before but uh it might be time for refresh room so let's take a look at it $3,000 is invested at 9 and 1/4% compounded monthly for two and a half years what we need to understand is a couple things about it number one what formula am I using for each case number two what my key letters mean up here so let's start understanding this uh firstly when we are investing or borrowing that doesn't really matter what we're looking for is what our p is what are what the problem is asking you what our p is what our a is what all of these things are so when we take a look at $3,000 is invested 94% compound monthly the first thing that's popping into my head is am I trying to Sol what am I trying to solve for in this case I'm trying to figure out my future value I'm trying to solve for my a well that means I have to be given a p an R an n and a t or be told it's compounded continuously so let's try to try to do that so if I'm if I know I'm trying to find my future value I need to be given a p so I'm looking for my P it says $3,000 is is invested that's called your principal or present value what that means is this right now in this moment in time if you were to do this today your money's going to be worth $3,000 that's the present value of what you're investing it's invested at 9 and A4 per. okay well that is an annual interest rate and we always write it as a decimal so we move our decimal two spots left because when you change from a percentage to a decimal notation you divide by 100 because uh 1 equals 100% you're divided by 100% dividing by one it's giving the same value with a different look compounded monthly this is the determination of when you use which formula so if this is compounded continuously we have a formula for that this is compounded and gives you a finite amount in a year monthly daily weekly Etc then we think okay how many compound a month to me how many times do months happen in a year how many compounds am I going to get in a year well that would be 12 now that we have some numbers on the board this will make a little more sense look at what the 12 does the 12 takes your annual interest rate and divides it into 12 little pieces why because you're getting each of those pieces one every single month so one of those pieces every month well that means I'm getting it 12 times for those 2 and A2 years I'm getting it 12 times for those two and a half years practically speaking that's 30 times does that make sense if you're getting interest once a month for two and a half years you will get interest 30 times so it divides your annual interest rate the amount that you're going to get every year by 12 so you get it a little bit a month and then says yes you're doing this for 30 months rather than like two and a half years it translates it into the number of compounds that you get that's what that does compounds time year is total number of compounds that you have that's practically what the formula does uh I'm going to give you a a really helpful hint for your calculators most calculators need this to be in parenthesis or it will not work now what it would do if you don't have parenthesis it would do this in order operation as an exponent and if you don't have parentheses there it would multiply your result by 2.5 and we don't want to do that we want make sure that we have this in parentheses so that we get the the full amount also another piece of advice uh man don't be writing stuff down here like I know I usually tell you write down lots of steps but don't write things down because you'll have to round it and we're deal with some really sensitive numbers where the all the decimals matter practically speaking and so if we start rounding things and then we start taking them to exponents and then we start multiplying then we start rounding again we're going to be off by maybe just pennies but that matters financially so we want to be as accurate as possible so the way to go through this is determine which formula write it down have parentheses right here use your calculator so plug it in exactly how it looks right here so 3,000 left parentheses 1 plus you can just do your decimal press divide by 12 write parenthesis exponent button and then put a parentheses there so put your parenthesis write in your number of compounds times years end parentheses and then press equals you should take a moment to try that so what I got out of this was $3,777 17 rounded to the penny should be always rounded to the penny generally yeah um if you have directions to say round to the nearest Dollar that'd be fine I do also want to tell you that when you're talking about things like mortgages that's almost rounded always rounded to the dollar um and we almost always round it up because we don't want to be short on our our investment or our loan so typically even if this had been if we had round to the penny uh like I did here at 17 that's fine but a lot of times financial institutions no matter how much that that next number is will round that to an eight even if it's 171 it' round it to a 18 cents it 17 so just something to keep in mind so you have to read those directions a little carefully so that's it here's what that means that means that that in the future in 2 and a half years what this money is going to be worth to someone the future value of it is $3,777 2017 that is how much is going to be in your account after you make this investment and Let It Go for exactly two and a half years that's what's going to be there you will have received interest every month for those two and a half years 9 and 1/4% interest divided by 12 says that's how much interest you would receive every month added to your amount and then you do that for whatever the 30 the 30 months is I hope that makes sense you I hope you're seeing why the formula works I went into a little bit more detail about this than I planned but hopefully hopefully you're sticking with me on that uh one more thing that I do want to say and I will say at the very end but I want to start prefacing now is that because compound interest adds interest before the term of your loan or investment you will end up getting more than 9.25% in one year why because after one month you get a little money right and then for the next month you you're getting interest on your original amount but also on the part that was added that little bit of interest and so it ends up being more interest at the end of one year than 9 and a qu% that's called the effective yield typically and so I'll show you how to find that at the very end um so that you understand like what the simple interest equivalent to compound interest would be so we'll get there in a little bit okay what about compounded continuously it's the same exact idea we have the same exact numbers it's just a different formula so if you say if you read it it says compounded finite number that's called an N use that formula finite sorry compounded continuously not a finite number you must use that e so it's a little simpler actually uh we go ahead and we put 3,000 that's our principle or present value e is a constant order number natural number raised to the rate times the time and years notice there's no compounding because it's always being compounded it's an infinite number of compounds that's what that e sort of wraps up for you and we use our calculator most calculators when you press second Ln will put an e there with an exponent and parenthesis there's not much you you have to do but we do want to make sure that that does come in parenthesis um it should show up automatically on your calculator and rounded to the penny we have $3,780 52 now this comes as a surprise to a lot of people wait a minute I thought it'd be more because here we're getting interest only 12 times a year here we're getting interest every single moment of every second every minute every hour every day every month of every year that's a whole lot of times you get interest in the grand scheme it's a little over $3 over two and a half years so is it more will will continuously compounded interest always get get you more than anything using this formula yes but it's not as significant as some other things u in finance we really explore this we say what what are the big factors that would cause you to make more money or lose more money number one generally it's it's the interest rate the interest rate is a huge factor in earning or owing a lot of money uh so when we're investing want that pretty high right as high as we can get it and still be secure U if we're borrowing want that as low as possible and that's the one thing that makes the most difference after that it's length of time uh so the length of time really affects how much interest you're going to earn or owe at the end of your your investment or loan respectively all right let's move right along so we got another type of problem this is really what I'm going to focus on finding some missing variables rather than just plugging in to a formula so let's take a look how much should be invested at 85% compounded daily to earn $800 in 3 and a/4 years when you deal with these problems really think through what am I looking for uh because everything else should be should be given to you or be be able to be found but you want to be able to identify what variable you're missing and which formula you're using pretty much at the same time so how much should be invested at okay right there we can stop we can stop how much should be invested what are they asking you for are they missing the amount the present value the rate the years or the compounds if they're saying how much should be invested they're asking um what is the the value of the amount of money that you want to put in right now so that's the present value we're missing the present value that means we're going to have to be able to determine the the future value the amount uh the rate that's our interest the time that's our years and possibly a number of compounds or determine that continuously compounded so we should be able to look for those things all right how much should we invested I know that I'm searching for a p the rest of this should be filled out at 8 and 1 12% okay there's my rate 8 and half% compounded daily so I was reading the daily understand that this is going to be our traditional compound interest formula da daily that's a lot of compounds that's actually 365 compounds what that means is that you would take your annual comp your annual interest rate that 8.55% if you divide it by 365 this is the amount of Interest you're going to get every single day you'll take your principal or whatever's in your bank at that time multiply it by that amount that's what you would get every single day however because you're getting a lot of times well you're getting that that little amount of Interest a whole lot of times 365 times a year for three 3 and a/4 years I'm going to certainly put that in parenthesis that's really important for your calculator so we've determined that we're using compound interest with an N because it's giving us a finite number of compounds in one years time not continuous you use this for everything that's not continuously compounded we've determined that it's asking us how much should be invested that's a present value so we're missing the P we write that down it's given us a rate it's given us a number of compounds that 365 giv us a number of years three and a quarter and says how much we want okay so to earn $800 so if we're going to earn $800 or have that amount out that would be our future value for this money now that is worded a little bit poorly uh that's kind of ambiguous as to well would you earn $800 in interest or would you earn $800 total um if you had to do it another way then you would have to have a p plus 800 over here to get a lot more complicated so maybe a better way to word that what I intended on the problem is uh how much should be invested 8.5% compounded daily to have $800 in the account at the end of three and a qu years that's what I intended just it's poorly worded I'm sorry about that so moving on to how to solve this if we understand that we're solving for p and p is multiplied by all this junk all we've got to do is really divide it so if we divide both sides by this whole amount don't don't try to figure out this stuff and write down an approximation as a decimal don't be doing that because we don't want to be rounding any of this your calculator will handle this at one whole step if you just plug it in with those parentheses so when we divide both sides it solves 4 P for us when we evaluate this on our calculator we put put in 00 press divide and use a big bracket so use a parenthesis then use another parenthesis so this really should be like this it doesn't matter on some calculators but others it might so use a parentheses another parentheses 1 + 85 365 in parentheses exponent button make sure that's in parentheses and then close that up if you need to and press enter I got $66.99 now why is that less than 800 because 800's your goal we want to invest something less than that to ear to get $800 in our account at the end of this um how much how about this how much interest did you earn here could you figure that out in the these examples well if you know that you plugged in uh $66.99 as an investment and you ultimately got $800 in your account and if you subtract those two the difference is your interest so we can always find that uh that interest amount by taking the future value subtracting the present value what the rest of it is interest let's look at compounded continuously so if we dealt with the same thing the formula is actually a bit easier we know that we're still searching for our P we know that we want to have $800 in our account at the end of three and a quarter years under a rate of 8 sorry 5% and that's compounded continuously so we're using the correct formula we just plugged in the appropriate things 800 left that e is e is e it's not a variable R was that 85 and then 3 and a/4 years so if we understand that this is still multiplication we can divide both sides by this entire expression and your calculator would do it just like this 800 / second Ln it brings up parentheses for you on most cases plug in your your interest rate times your years and then you should give about $6.90 slightly less than what this is because continuously compound interest will always give you more interest than anything else with non-continuously compounding so if that's the case it would require us to invest less money to have the same amount with the same rate and the same amount of time because we're you compounding it quicker we're earning interest faster in this hope that's making sense to you I hope you're seeing that we can do some other things besides just use the formula one way we'll come back with one more example where we uh we try to double our investment we'll take a look at that and it'll be done okay last two so same example we're just going to do it twice so you see uh how to deal with continuously compound interest again so how long does it take to double an investment at 4 and a half% interest compound accordly and you go well what's the size of the investment it doesn't matter whether you invest a dollar or a million dollars or a trillion dollars at that interest rate and that compound it's going to take exactly the same amount of time to double both so what are we really asking for here are we asking to find the present value and the future value well not really we know the rate we know the compounds we're asking how long how much time does it take to do this so if we deal with a compounded quarterly a hey you have a iite number of compounds in one year you have this formula it's not continuously compounded if we're dealing with this formula right there then we're really asking to Sol for T well that's that's interesting let's started filling this stuff out so if we're asking to Sol for T I don't know what my P is what's my present value I don't know what my a is which my future value I just told you it didn't matter so show you what you put for that in a minute we do know what our interest rate is and we do know what our compounds are the compounds say compound accordly means four times per year four times for however many years it's going to take hopefully you can read through this and say how long is a I'm solving for the number of years hopefully you can read through and say 4 and a half perents 045 and compound accordly means I'm using that formula it's a finite number of number of compounds in one year's time and that's going to be four now the double in can be tricky the first time you see it so why don't I need an investment well think about this for a second let's say that you invested $5 doubling that would be $10 okay well what's the first thing that you would do because this is multiplied together and because oh man get it because you need a logarithm to solve for that exponent logarithms are the only thing that lets you solve for exponentials without common BAS we certainly don't have that when you are missing a variable in your exponent so logarithms are going to be what it takes but in order to get there you need to isolate that exponential you'd have to divide by five so if I divided both sides by five I'm going to end up getting two equals some sort of an exponential with a really funny base well wait what if it wasn't five what was what it was 50 doubling that would be 100 100 is double of 50 but if I divided by 50 would I still get two yes and that's true for any time you are doubling an investment if you put five or 50 or one it would be a factor of two that's what dou means so it's always going to be two equals some sort of a base depending on your your rate and your number of compounds do you see I hope that you see that what would tripling be well rup would be three quadruple would be four so to keep it easy instead of making up some random amount of present value we we usually say well if it doesn't really matter why not just use one because if I use one doubling one is two so we have this 2 equals really some exponential with a funny base on it and this is exactly what an exponential equation is so how do you solve exponential equations well firstly you isolate the exponential we've done that this is your exponential this is a really awkward base but this is a base right this is a number if you added this in your calculator you would get some constant raised to some exponent that has a variable equal to another constant so how how do you solve it we can choose to do a logarithm on both sides uh what a logarithm on both sides would do is allow to move this exponent to the front and divide and we've done that many many times before which you can't do you can't sit here and say those are common bases so common bases won't do it uh you have to have logarithms also I would discourage you from using a logarithm with this base that's really awkward I'm going to encourage you to use a logarithm with a base of e use an Ln here especially when you get down to compounded continuously we'll see why in a bit but what we're going to do is we're going to take an Ln on both sides so on the left hand side we get ln2 and on the right hand side we get this Ln of 1 + 045 over 4 to the 4T but logarithms let you move exponents called the power property and because those are both multiplied we can divide both sides by the four and this natural log of 1 + 045 over4 notice what I'm not doing I'm not approximating that I'm going to use my calculator so what's the big deal in writing this in parenthesis that way we don't have to write down a round a decimal and get this thing completely wrong uh so I want to make sure that we're we're doing that so I'm trying to solve for T yes that is the number of years I'm going to divide both sides by four and this natural log so ln2 / 4 and also divided by the Ln your calculator will do this just fine so when you do this just make sure because when you press Ln almost always it has a parenthesis that pops up you got to close that parenthesis otherwise it's going to find Ln of 2 / 4 Ln of whatever something else is so close this and then press divide also when you press divide you're going to want to make sure you have another parenthesis this is how it should look when you plug this into your calculator so you press press Ln press two close parenthesis press divide do another parenthesis and then put in all of the stuff exactly how it looks I ended up getting 15.49 years so almost 15 a half years on this remember the t is years that's a long time to double investment but that's exactly how long it would take you to double whatever the present value is whether it's $1 or a billion dollars it doesn't matter if you're going to double it and you're going to give it 4 and a half% compound it quarterly that is how long it's going to take you no matter what your initial investment is hope that makes sense we saw that mathematically but now it should be should be sort of clicking so let's deal with this last one this compounded continuously we'll see that ens are really really nice to use especially with compounded continuously type of Interest so what this idea says how long would it take to double your investment 4 and a half% compounded continuously well continuously as soon as I hear that word I'm thinking that formula so I know I know that I'm looking for the year says how long I know what my rate is 4 and a half% I don't know what my present value is or my future value is but I know the relationship I know that my future value should be twice the present value if it had been tripled you'd put a three here um we can do do this with lots of different things we can say what about um how long would it take to take one amount to another amount given that amount of Interest we just have to know both of those things if it's not giving you a specific uh value like doubling or tripling some sort of factor like that so we have double an investment at 4 and a half% compounded continuously because one times any sort of exponential just giving us back the exponential my one is fairly irrelevant all this is saying is hey you now have an exponential equation there's no way you're getting common bases you're going to have to use logarithms let's use Ln and in a wonderful turn of events we have now composed an exponential onto a logarithm the same base they're going to cancel that's fantastic this becomes even easier than this I hope that you remember that that when you're composing an exponential base of e onto a natural logarithm that's a base of e they're going to simplify you've composed a function with an inverse they have to cancel out and so we end up getting ln2 = 045 T could you have moved this exponent to the front and had a little one here and then used a property Ln of e to the first gives you want you could have but that that's a little bit more work than we need actually all that's required here is now div divide both sides by 045 remember that when you're divide logarithms you really need to close that parenthesis on your on your Ln otherwise it's going to take Ln of 2 divid 045 instead of Ln 2 end it then divide that by 045 so make sure that we're doing that I ended up getting 15 .4 years should it be less than this yes because continuously compounded interest grows faster so this will be slightly less time but not much less time to achieve the same doubling Factor there I hope that this is made sense to you especially this last part uh most of the time you do end up seeing this in like an intermediate algebra class not college algebra well we see it both places uh really but a lot of times this doesn't make sense to an intermediate algebra student uh and if that was you hopefully the second time around then this is making sense that's that's what my goal is just to make this stuff you learn it so make this stuff understandable for you hopefully I'm doing that you're understanding exactly why we're doing a logarithm on both sides because we're solving for an exponent that's only thing it does it hopefully you understand why the Ln makes it nice here why is it better here than here well because we inherently match our base and that's that's nice that's a composition of inverse functions they have to cancel so uh barring the last example of about some effective rate or effective annual yield hopefully this has made sense to you and I'll see you for for a couple more examples in a second all right last little bit we're going to talk about effective rate or um annual yield effective annual yield and so what what that means is the amount of Interest you're actually earning if you were to consider this as simple interest now why would we ever do that well because of how compounding works you actually make or owe more interest than the nominal rate suggests explain that a little bit differently if you were getting a 12% interest rate monthly well you'd get 1% a month that's true but after the first month you actually earn money right so the second month where you're still earning 1% you're not earning 1% on the original amount you're earning % on the original amount plus a little bit so you're earning more than the first 1% so that's weird but the first month you're earning one 1% if it's 12% per year on your amount the second month you're earning 1% still but it's on a larger amount and that happens for the third month fourth month fifth month all the way to 12th month you're earning 1% that's true but it's on a larger amount because compound interest is growing exponentially so this will give you the rate that you're actually earning over one year's time if you were to consider it as simple interest simple interest just says okay take your amount of money look at the amount of time and give yourself that percentage of that value and it's always annual so this is based on one year's time now these formulas look really really familiar but what is the minus one doing why isn't there a p like where does it come from this is a stripped down version of compound interest and compounding continuous interest so here here's what I me I strip down there is no present value or consider the present value to be $1 this is for one year's time so there's no t or consider the time to be one why because if we're only worried about finding the actual annual percentage rate that we are earning the effective APR then what this is going to say is I really don't care about year two I just want to figure out every year how much I'm really earning here or or or paying in interest that would do it consider a dollar consider one year's time this would give you a percentage plus a dollar so subtract the dollar that you invested that's where the minus comes in if you invest the dollar that's one and you figure out how much you'd have after one year and then you subtract the dollar what you're left with because our our our dollars are base 10 and because that pennies represents a percentage uh well that that will leave you with your decimal equivalent of percent that you're actually earning that's what's going on here same thing happens here this says imagine $1 for compound imagine one year well how much would you earn a dollar and some change subtract the dollar what are you left with the change but because that's based on 100 our pennies are cents or part of 100 it's giving you the the decimal equivalent for the percentage of the rate that we actually earned so we're going to do an example right now we'll do it both with traditional interest and with continuously compounded let's find the effective rate of 9 99.75% compounded monthly this the only two piece of information you know it's always over one year so RT is one we don't even write it uh it's always for $1 RP is one we don't even write it and we subtract the one signifying that we're just getting the cents back which represents the percent so let's let's go through it uh because it says compounded monthly we're going to use our traditional compound interest we're going to say here's really what's going on okay you're investing a dollar at 9 and 3/4% you have monthly compounded interest and you're letting this go for a year now we don't show that because it's always a dollar we don't show that because it's always a year but can you can you see it I hope that you can see that this is just your standard formula now where the minus one comes in if we did this without subtracting the one we can do it right now if we did it without subtracting the one we're going to get 1 point something well that one point something would be your future value of your investment of $1 If I subtract the $1 it's going to give me my interest that's true but this interest is only after one year it's only with one so what the interest is going to be is the actual rate of investing $1 so we subtract the one to find the interest we talked about this earlier and that's why I preface it I said if you want to find out your interest take your future value subtract your present value or take your amount subtract your principle it'll leave you with your interest and so this would be the interest that we get I got 1.102 and then minus one so so this is what this is this would be how much you would earn if you put $1 in the bank at 99.75% compound monthly and Let It Go for exactly one year you would have $110 and a little bit more so that 10.2 cents so $112 that's how much you would have if I subtract the $1 I invested take your future value minus your present value I subtract that $1 then I'm going to get 0.102 that is my interest but because it's based on this $1 investment over one year that's also my rate so this is my effective rate 10.2 and you can be a little B more accurate with the decimals I just rounded here quickly 10.2% here's what that means if you invest any sort of money at 99.75% compounded monthly then what you're really earning over one year from the minute the you invest your money to the amount that you're getting out every year you'll actually earn 10.2% on that from start to finish yes you're earning 99.75% but compound and monthly makes it go quicker makes it climb quicker that's what that's saying that's why it's called the effective rate and it's going to be different than your nominal rate uh for continuously compounded it's the same basic idea formul is a little easier we fill this out make sure you got parentheses around that because you don't want to plug this in and say second Ln it's going to give you parentheses you don't want to put the minus one there so close those parentheses then subtract one and we get 0124 that's 10.24% and that right there will show you the difference between compounded a finite number like monthly in this case and compounding continuously you will earn more interest with continuously compounded so we've seen that several times I hope I've made Finance make a little bit more sense to you um of course we're not doing an exhaustive finance class here I just wanted to model some of the finance that's um that's Rel that relates to our exponentials so you can see that so you can see oh yes that's based on E that is exponential growth with a base that's greater than one so is so is are what this is based on that the original compound interest formula that's based on a base that's greated in one we should have some growth on that I hope you saw that hope you saw the necessity for logarithms and when we solved for our exponentials notice we can always solve for the number of compounds although you you rarely see that uh we can solve for time we can solve for present value and we can solve for rate if you need to solve for a rate uh we can do that we can solve for future value so all of these things are open to us at this point but for the solving for time you have to use a logarithm that's only one that you need for so I hope it made sense and next time we'll talk about something very similar actually we'll talk about exponential growth and decay it'll start talking about something called differential equations a very basic introduction to that so I'll see you for another video 

Transcript for: Exponential Growth and Decay (Precalculus - College Algebra 66)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about exponential growth and decay or natural growth and decay uninhibited growth or decay this deals into something called differential equations it's just a very service level but how we can use some exponential modeling to deal with populations population growth population decline exponential growth models a lot of population growth even money which we saw in finance and then exponential decay that's stuff like half-life so we're going to talk about about that or newton's law of cooling that'll be our last example we are not going to get into the logistic modeling that happens more in differential equations and i i couldn't do the service here so if you're interested in that i do cover those topics but that's that in my opinion you need to understand a little bit more about this in order to really make that make sense otherwise it's just a formula and you can do it with a formula but it's much better if you really understand it so this we can understand because it's based on exponential so we're going to get into it we'll talk about what it means we'll take a look at it as an exponential function we'll notice it's very very strongly related to continuously compounded interest it's the same and then we'll deal with three examples on on working through this so firstly the the look of it this looks just like continuously compound interest it gives you a present value or an initial amount it says you are adding to it all the time just like continuous accommodates every moment very many very secure day this population is growing or declining based on some sort of a rate that k is your rate and some time period now the t does not have to be years maybe minutes can be hours should be whatever we want it to be but it is a period of time i hope that you're seeing that this is just like continuously compounded interest it's just we're growing population instead of money a population of whatever it is instead of just a population of dollars and cents very very valuable for us now one thing that we're seeing i've just already defined them but a sub 0 is your initial amount it's like your principal or your present value t is a time period not necessarily years and a is your future value or how much is going to be in that population after a certain amount of time after whatever that time is the issue here that we have is the rate you see in compounded interest your rate is positive meaning you're always growing money well for population growth or decay or decline we have to have the ability to have a downward or decreasing graph and that would be exponential decay that depends on whether the k is positive or negative positive k's mean growth negative k's mean decay so why why would that be the case i really want you to focus here because if you put a negative right there what does it actually mean check it out if this had a negative k then this piece right here you could move that to the denominator of some fraction or you could create a fraction itself do you remember i showed it to you one time before that if i want to change the value of an exponent i reciprocate my fraction i can actually do that here so if i think of this instead of e to the negative kt i think is 1 over e to the positive kt i really need you to make this connection do you remember that with exponentials if bases are more than 1 2.7 we get climbing graphs if bases are less than 1 that's 1 over 2.7 we get declining or decreasing graphs this is why a positive k means grow it's this or a negative k means decay decline decrease that's because it's this that negative exponent creates that base that's less than one i hope you're seeing it we don't really show this very often but i wanted to make that connection otherwise you know why is negative k actually do that because it creates a fraction because it creates that that uh that fraction that's less than one giving us an exponential function with a base less than one that is a decreasing graph that's why a negative exponent here decays hope it's making sense to you so we're ready to go through a couple examples we'll go through a very basic one one that i've contrived for you here and then we'll go ahead and come up with a couple on our own one with growth one with decay then we'll do newton's law cooling which is kind of cool and we'll be done so let's suppose that we're given some sort of an exponential model of the population this in this case was bacteria i think it starts with 100 units of bacteria and it says that you have this .045 what's that mean for a certain amount of time let's say it's in hours can we figure out a few things about it number one can we determine whether this is growth or decay if you look at your rate positive rates mean growth for some reasons i just explained to you negative rates rates mean decay because they would create a base that's less than one this is a base greater than one because that is positive if that's negative we could could create a base less than one that would give us a decline so positive rates cause us to grow so this is definitely growth and you could write the rate the rate is .045 or 4.5 percent growth per time period and let's say that if our time is hours that would be 4.5 growth an hour so every hour this bacteria is growing 4.5 4.5 every single hour that's happening now how about the initial amount the initial amount is always that number in front of your e think about man just think about doing the the continuous compounded interest how your initial amount was your principal or your present value it's the number in front your initial amount is 100 whatever this is units of bacteria or grams something like that so i'm going to leave this unit let's put units how about the amount after five days well because this is asking you for a certain amount the colony size after five days time oh you know what it says days so our hours is wrong so we always have to match this up this would be a mistake and i'm glad i put it i want you to really learn from it whatever unit of time they're telling you so this would be days you need to match that so if i say 4.5 per hour that really conflicts with our days so make sure that your units of time because they can be hours or minutes or days or weeks or whatever make sure they mesh together i actually meant hours here which is why that was i just wrote day so good thing we got this i'm going to change that to hours so that i can match that up so 4.5 per hour 100 units initially it's called our initial amount that's like the present value for talking population how much after five hours well because this is the calling size after a certain amount of time all it's really asking you to do is plug in five so c of t well or t is five hours now just plug in the t of five so on our calculator we'll put 100 second ln and then we'll have our parentheses of 0.045 times 5. i get about 125.2 units whatever that is if it's grams it'd be 125.2 grams or sometimes you do call it units of bacteria we would get that many after five hours oh that makes sense have you seen that this is very much like compound interest what about a different question what about how long would it take to reach 140 units or 140 whatever these these are well that's different isn't it that's saying if you start with 100 that's that's a given that's there for us this is our formula how long is it going to take to reach 140 well 140 is a future value of this population size let's let's make it that let's consider this to be what would be in the future well how long is the future well that's what we're trying to find out we're trying to figure out the t how many hours would it take to reach that so we're going to take our formula and say i want it to be 140 but i don't know what the t is i hope that this looks a lot like doubling an investment because we're going to do that next but in this case we're not doubling it we're just reaching a goal we're saying we're start with 100 how long is it going to take to reach 140. 140 would be the idea of that's going to be a value in the future let's solve for the t in your head right now you should be thinking i'm going to be using a logarithm at some point i have to because that's an exponential equation i'm solving for t that's a must but before we do that before we're able to use logarithms you must isolate the exponential so we're going to divide by 100 so dividing by 100 140 divided by 100 is 1.4 now we have an exponential equation it doesn't matter if it's a decimal or not we're going to do a logarithm on both sides for this just a man just like always use ln please use ln especially when we're dealing with exponential growth and decay because you're going to get a lot of simplification so we're going to take a natural log of both sides and because we match up our bases we compose an exponential onto a log in the same base this is going to simplify we get ln of 1.40 equals point zero four five t it should look just like doubling uh your compound interest when it was continuously compounded last video we're doing the same thing it's just that we're not doubling we're reaching a certain a different goal if we divide both sides by .045 and understand that this is asking for for the number of hours so rt is in hours as it said here and as it said right there number of hours well we're going to plug this into our calculator we're going to evaluate just make sure when you press your ln that you do 1.4 and end your parentheses before you divide that way your calculator knows what you intended to know yeah roughly 7.48 hours now does that make sense does it make sense that if after five hours we had 125 units then it's going to take a little bit longer than that for us to get 140 units well that makes sense to me five hours give us this sentence to be more than that to give us 140 but not like three times as much remember it is growing exponentially at a rate of four and a half percent per hour whatever the time unit is okay last one this is just like doing our continuously compounded interest if we're going to double something and we actually know how much we start with then we're going to deal with the same exact idea doubling means multiplying by 2. when we divide we're not going to get 1.4 like we did we're going to get exactly 2. so let's see how that that plays out how long to double this well if i start with 100 doubling would be 200 and i'm still looking for a time i'm still going to do a natural logarithm on both sides but in order to do that i have to divide first let's divide both sides by 100 isolate your exponential you have to do that before taking a logarithm so 2 equals e to the .045 t that is an exponential there's no common bases we have to use a logarithm and in general we just use ln almost all the time this naturally composes your base of your logarithm of the base of an exponential a function of this inverse cancels we get ln2 equals that .045 t where we divide both sides by .045 we have parentheses after the ln 2 that's really important for your calculator and it should be a bit more than 7.5 so i got 15.4 hours and that makes sense to gain 40 units cost us 7.5 hours to gain 60 more units on top of that would be an additional almost double well little over double that but we're gaining 60 additional units so 100 to 140 was seven half hours 100 to 200 was 15.4 so it makes sense it's not way way out there like a hundred hours or something remember this should be gaining faster and faster and faster it is positively increasing exponential growth hope it makes sense i hope you're seeing all the interplay between this and i hope i'm really making the connection between exponentials this stuff and the finance that we just did i'll come back with another one that we're going to start from scratch and create a formula that models exponential growth then we'll do a half-life for decay and newton's law of cooling all right we're ready for another problem let's give it a try we're supposed to find a formula for a population bacteria that doubles every three hours so let's take a look at this and model this with an exponential growth formula in order to do it we just have to understand a couple things about the process here what's going to happen is we have to find a rate first so it's going to give you enough information to plug in everything and solve for your k that is your first thing to do once you've found your k you can ask any other question that you want on this thing so it's all about finding the k first and then plugging that back in then you answer the question so let's take a look at it find a formula for population bacteria that doubles every three hours there's a lot of information there number one it's saying there's a time period we have three hours so we're in time unit of hours and saying after three hours we're gonna put a three here this should be two times that now what is that who cares it doesn't matter we dealt with this in doubling an investment and doubling bacteria it doesn't doesn't matter where we start if we start at one this would be two start at a hundred this would be two hundred it doesn't really matter and it also doesn't matter because we divide in the very first step to try to solve for our k so let's plug into a few things we know that we're trying to solve for k it's not telling us the rate we need to understand that but it's telling us after three hours that's our three hours this future value or the the population will attain this amount that's double what our initial amount was if that's one that's two that's ten that's twenty that's a hundred that's two hundred the very first thing we would do is try to solve for k by dividing the isolator exponential we divide both sides but whatever initial knot is you're gonna get two equals e to the three 3k this is what doubling looks like all the time once you have isolated your exponential a couple other things about this i would like to mention you can see a few different different things they could say something like hey your population of bacteria is growing at a rate of 5.2 percent per hour if they tell you that 5.2 per hour well that's a k of .052 you can always find that that is your rate so if they're telling you the rate you don't do any of this you say hey that rate would be whatever percentage you're telling me as a decimal you can always do that the other thing i can tell you is instead of doubling i just want to make sure that that's fresh in your head i could say a population of bacteria started with a hundred units after three hours it had 170 units or something and so in that case you'd say i started with a hundred after three hours i had 170. it's the same exact thing i'm just telling you a double because students tend to have a harder time with the double if i say you start with 100 and after three hours you have 170 sure you can divide by 100. we saw this in the first example and it gives you something very very doable very similar to this it's just a different way to look at it if you wanted to see them the first wave right now if i told you that the increase was 5.2 percent and they said you start with 100 units and your rate of increase is 5.2 percent then you are done there's your initial value and there's your rate of increase it's a rate of decrease well then you would have negative point zero five two percent so there are other ways to look at it i'm giving you the most common though all right so we're down to here we gotta solve for our k we need to take a natural log on both sides so we're going to do that because our bases match on our function and our the inverse of the function we end up getting ln 2 equals 3k divided by 3 we get k equals ln 2 over 3. so i got k is around 0.231 now i'm going to encourage you to not round that number very often those can be very very very small numbers very close to 0 and if we end up rounding them a lot that's a problem you might actually choose to leave it ln 2 over 3 and just put that here it looks a little awkward i'm not doing that because i want to show you the rate the rate of increase here is 23.1 0.231 is 23.1 per hour that is how fast this colony of bacteria is actually growing so what does that mean for us now that we have our k and our k is a constant it's like the rate in finance your rate doesn't change every day i mean it can we can but if it's a fixed rate it's going to stay the same all the time we're assuming this is a fixed rate of growth for this and we can see with that k that that is positive that should be exponential growth this is modeling this bacteria and now i can ask a whole lot of questions so i can ask something like if your colony started with 50 units or grams or whatever let's say you start with 50 how much will be there in 10 hours we put 50 here and 10 there i said how long would it take to triple this colony of bacteria that i put one here and three let's go ahead and do that one how long would it take to triple this better be more than three hours right because three hours is how long it took double it but how long would it take to triple this how long asks for a time triple says if you start with one you'll get three that would be triple i start with 100 i get 300. your first order of business would be to divide so we're going to end up getting 3 equals 0.231 t if we do an ln on both sides and we divide by 0.231 we get about 4.76 hours i hope that makes sense i hope that if it doubles in three hours it should triple in 4.76 hours that should make sense in your head that it's more than three it's not way way out there but it's definitely positive in more than three again if i had said suppose you start with 50 units how much would you have in 10 hours you could certainly put a 50 here and a 10 there and figure that out as well this is just designed to give you an understanding of how exponential growth and decay work from an original question like that one i decided to do two examples because they're slightly different and i know i would get questions on that one so i'm going to put up there to make sure that we we understand the differences between them so we're going to talk about exponential decay right now half-life is a really good way to to look at this because if you think about something that's radioactive something that's constantly losing stuff it's going to lose a lot of stuff at first because there's a lot of it to lose but as we get closer and closer to having none of it it's gonna still lose at the same rate but there's less to lose well you lose everything not according to exponential decay you have a horizontal asymptote don't you so can you ever lose all of a substance theoretically no you'll get closer and closer to zero but you never lose all of it so there'll always be some left and that's a decent way for us to date certain items so how in the world do we do these these things the same exact way as the last example but we're going to get exponential dk because we'll have a negative exponent and that would create if we use that negative to reciprocate a fraction a base less than one giving us a decreasing exponential graph that's what's going to happen so let's take a look at it the half-life of radium is 1690 years if 20 grams are present now how much will there be there in 50 years for all of these examples where you have to make your own formula your primary goal is to find k first so let's start with our our function we're thinking half-life means declining our case should be negative so that's important now half-life here's what that means if you're not familiar with it what half-life means is there will be half of whatever you start with after a certain amount of time for radium that there will be half of it after a certain amount of time that time is 1690 years so if you started with a hundred grams of radium after 1690 years there would be 50 of it left the other 50 will have radiated away and that's what radiation does it these particles emanate uh from whatever substance that is that's radioactive so the half-life of radium is 69 years but that gives us something doesn't it it says if you have 20 grams now what a half-life says is there will be half of this after that much time and we're still solving for k notice i could give you the rate of decreasing the rate of degrees decreases whatever percentage that'd be negative so like let's say negative 15 percent that'd be negative 0.15 as your k or if we say decrease 15 negative 0.15 for your k most of the time though they tell you how much you have and how and what the half-life is as far as a length of time so let's say we have 20 grams now there will be half of it that's 10 in this amount of time do you see that will let you solve for k in general they don't have to give you this to find out half-life i'm going to erase this just please watch this what if what if they said the half-life as a rating of radium is 1690 years they don't tell you how much is present now well what could you do couldn't you say imagine i have one one gram how much would be present in 1690 years half a gram or half of whatever that number is you're gonna see this when we go back to our hey you have 20 in 1690 years that's the half-life you'll have 10. what's the first thing you do well if we have to solve for k we're going to need a logarithm to undo the exponential but you have to isolate the exponential first if we divide both sides by 20 it should be very familiar at this point if we divide both sides by 20 10 divided by 20 is oh look at that one half this will happen every time with half-life that's what half-life means there's half of it left after that time now that we have an exponential isolated ready for an ln we're going to do a natural log on both sides and lastly because we simplify here we can simply divide by 1690. i hope this triggers some of your brain i hope that that when you look at this you go oh yes natural logs or any logarithm of fractions less than one should give me negatives do you remember that logarithms increase with basis that are greater than one which we have that's basically logarithms increase and they are negative until x equals one at that point one zero they cross and then are they positive so if you plug in anything between zero and one your logarithm will give you a negative here divided by positive it's still going to be a negative be careful with your calculators make sure you have parentheses after that one half you want to press ln one half in parenthesis and then divide by 1690. i got negative point zero zero zero four one if you get that e to the uh well sorry uh the exponential scientific notation notation just remember that moves your decimal to the left if it's negative so we move left four spaces and we get this point zero zero zero four one that is the rate of decrease this this radium is decreasing at the rate of 0.041 percent per year that is what that means not very quick that's why it takes 1690 years to lose half of it so what that means for us we can put this back into our formula i'm leaving this blank intentionally for a second on purpose to show you that this really did not have to be here in order for us to figure out our k our half-life has always done the same amount you will just have one half of your amount that you started with or 50 0.5 of wherever you started with that's going to come in right there 30 after that you're able to find your k you put it back in your function and then it can ask you any sort of question like suppose you start with whatever amount find this or how long it would take here suppose you want to find this amount however long it would take uh you can you can solve for that we can do lots and lots of different things with these equations we just have to solve for k first now in our case this says that we have 20 grams of radium present how much will be there in 50 years all we're looking for is this evaluated for 50 years you see this gives you the rate of decrease it tells you how much you started with we're saying how much will be there after 50 years has passed so we just plug in 50 and evaluate i got about 19.59 grams so what this means is that the amount that's going to be left after 50 years has passed is 19.59 grams considering you start with 20 grams that's not much well i'm sorry that's that's not much decrease well that's true but if you lose half of it in 1690 years that mean that there would be 10 grams left after 1690 years right that would take 600 years to lose 10 grams well 50 years is not even close to 690 so you're not gonna lose very much in that short amount of time you're losing it is decreasing but the rate is very slow hope that makes sense you hope you're seeing the idea of hey half-life means one-half i can solve for k even if i tell you don't tell you what to start with you can still suffocate then i can ask you a number of questions after that i can have you solve for how much would it would take to get to a certain amount how long that would take all sorts of different questions on that all right we're ready for another example so c14 has a half-life of 5730 years stop right there with just that information you should be able to solve for k and that's exactly what we're going to do first we're going to solve this for k almost right now i'm going to read the rest of it just to get an idea about where we're going but that first sentence lets you solve for k that's a must if we want to answer any of the questions so we're going to we're going to pause right there now if a dead tree has 30 percent of the c14 it originally did when did it die that 30 that is used after you have found kate some students they really want to make the k .30 that's not what that 30 percent is i understand that because you're like oh that's a rate it's really not if i had given you a rate i would say the rate of decrease is 30 and you could say oh okay that's negative 0.30 for my k that's not what's happening here what's happening is we're going to use our half-life to figure out our k and then this next sentence says now that you've done that tell me how long it takes to achieve 30 percent that's a different story and it comes in later it asks something like how much is going to be present in 50 years but a little bit differently it has to solve for a time so number one you got to find your k first the half-life statement up there is enough to do it the half-life statement says if you start with any amount let's call it one and you give it five thousand seven hundred thirty years how much is going to be left half of it i don't care if you start with 10 and you want to put five start with 100 put 50. start with a thousand put 500 the first thing you do is divide and then you'd end up getting one half because that is isolated or exponential for us we just have to take a natural log of both sides you probably should see at this point that half-life is going to look a lot like this a lot of the time because if it says how half-life is this many years well then we know that 0.5 or one-half is going to equal e to the whatever the number of years is times k it'll let you solve for the k so let's do that let's divide by 5 730 okay try to be as precise as possible don't round this as much as you're able to so we because we have to deal with a really small number we really want to be as precise as we can be so what that means is that we have this rate of decrease why decrease well it's negative that negative exponent would make this 1 over e to some other power that is a rate of decrease it's decreasing at let's see 0.0121 percent per year that's how quickly this carbon 14 is decreasing that's the rate of decrease right there so what we're going to do now is going to rewrite this formula that we have but using this information i also hope you're seeing this as a several step process this isn't just you plug in all the numbers and you get it you first have to use your your information to figure out your k and then on your second step like after you've found your k and after you've played in your formula then you can answer anything else now the next question is a little bit confusing for a lot of people to go wait a minute what do you mean 30 i don't know how much i originally had how am i supposed to find 30 of it well here's the point no matter what you originally had if there's 30 percent of it remaining this is going to end up being 0.30 equal to whatever your exponential is why well because how would you do this you start with some amount let's call it one now i don't care because if it's one or a hundred or a million well it doesn't really matter if we know our rate of decrease and we know that the tree had 30 percent of its original carbon-14 so if we start with let's pretend it's one gram how much would be left 0.3 grams that's 30 of what it started with now what if it wasn't one gram if it was uh 10 grams well then what's 30 percent of 10 3 what about 100 grams what's 30 of that would be 30 but the very first thing that you would do in any of the cases is you'd have to self-exponentially you had to solve for t so if you did that you'd isolate it if you isolate you have to divide both sides by 10. but wait a minute if in this case if if you are going to find 30 of this number and then divide it by this number you're going to get .30 or 30 or whatever percentage is every time so if i divide 3.0 by 10 or 0.30 by 1 or 30 by 100 i'm going to end up getting 0.30 no matter what as i isolate that exponential i guess that's just to say that when they give you a percentage it's much like doubling it's actually like half-life if you did if you remember the half-life this said you have half of what you started with 50 of what you started with after that amount of time it lets you solve for k now it's saying okay uh you have 30 percent of what you started with 0.30 of whatever you started with really call it one doesn't really matter because what's what's it saying is you have 30 now figure out the time that it took to get that 30 so same exact idea it's just now you're looking for the time it's taking and since we have the k we're allowed to do that let's do a natural log of both sides and i'm just working that down we we do an ln of course this composes a function's inverse cancels if we divide both sides by that negative 0.00121 hopefully you recognize i have an ln of some value less than one that's a negative divided by another negative should give me a positive that makes sense time should be in the future here or some positive value that's saying this is how long ago this tree died i ended up getting 950.2 years ago is how long ago this tree died and what that means is that that long ago this tree would have died and it would have 30 percent of the original carbon 14 that it had back then and so they go backwards to try to date that the last thing i'm going to mention is this number is is definitely off and the reason why is because i rounded pretty heavily right there it didn't look like it went to like the what sixth decimal place but i cut off a lot of numbers so when you do that you're going to really affect this outcome so i'm saying about 950.2 because i didn't want to write out a whole bunch of digits but in actuality you probably shouldn't round this at all to be honest with you um but that's that's just what i had to do to make you understand what the rate was here so i did that but this is probably off by i don't know two or three years so anyhow i hope that makes sense i hope that you're seeing that half-life takes a percentage after a certain amount of time solves for k and that's exactly what this is doing it's saying what is the amount of time for which you to get that percentage so i hope i've cleared that up what we're going to do in your mind at least what we're going to do now is come back with one more example kind of fun one and then then we'll be done last one we're going to talk about a newton's law of cooling problem i kind of like these i also want to tempt you to get into differential equations because we cover this much much much more at length we talk about where this actually comes from it's pretty neat uh so newton's law of cooling is kind of cool obviously this comes from how long it takes fig newtons to cool once they take them out of the oven um so anyway newton's law of cooling says how long is it going to take if something that is a different temper temperature from the ambient to reach a certain temperature so let's imagine turkey i don't actually like turkey comes out an oven but some people do and i am always responsible for carving the turkey i don't know why but that's just my job i guess so a turkey comes out of the oven 100 degrees celsius and it's 80 degrees celsius in five minutes when will it be 50 degrees celsius so that i don't burn my fingers when i cut it and i keep my house at 30 degrees celsius so i'm going to time this so that right when i cut it i cut it i can serve it it's nice and hot people tend to enjoy it and if you don't think that i actually go through the math to figure this stuff out in your head you're dead wrong because i would certainly do this on thanksgiving day to make sure that it's just right so anyhow let's go ahead and figure out what all this stuff means when we deal with newton's law of cooling there's a one more variable that you really need to understand it's the t t stands for ambient temperature and so what we do whether something is higher than or lower than newton's law of cooling will tell you a relationship for how long it takes to reach a certain temperature or what the temperature will be after a certain amount of time now what about if that's negative well if you plug in something less than your ambient then it's colder than that like taking something out of the freezer well that's reverse cooling it's called heating but newton's law of killing will still work for that so it compares the initial temperature of your item with the ambient and then that is also your ambient temperature so we're going to fill out a couple things right now to make sure that we understand that when they say ambient that is the surrounding temperature to which you are exposing this thing that you want to heat or cool so when we read about the turkey the ambient temperature would be the the temperature of the house so the temperature after a certain amount of time is given by the ambient temperature plus the difference between the thing that you're heating or cooling in this case the turkey and the ambient temperature i'm going a little slower here because it's newer so here's what we would say we'd say the ambient temperature is 30 when i initially take out my turkey it is 100 degrees so the difference would be 30 100 minus 30. it's going to give us 70. now keep in mind what we need to do we have to solve for k first it's a must you got to find the rate of cooling or anti-cooling heating in the situation first so we're not there yet i'm just cleaning this up a little bit so we would get 30 plus 70 e to the kt now comes in this this next statement so we've said the initial temperature the initial temperature right here is 100 degrees minus ambient gives us 70. okay ambient was 30. we knew that here we knew that here now this next piece it's 80 degrees in five minutes oh that relates a future value with a time that is how we go and solve for k that's how it's been every time with extrusive growth or decay so in five minutes so our time unit is minutes in five minutes this stuff will equal 80 degrees that's all there is to it so it's going to be 80 degrees in five minutes you still have to obey this right you still ambient temperature still 30 the difference is still 70 in five minutes it will be 80 degrees we're going to solve for that k right now of course you have to isolate the exponential right there's just one more step subtract your 30. if we divide by 70 and we take an ln on both sides and lastly if we divide by five we have a good expression for k now if i wanted to be very accurate i would approximate that i would leave it i would put it right there and then when i multiplied what i saw for t i'd have a very awkward thing to use but it would be more accurate i'm going to write a decimal right now even though i'm going to lose some some exactness i want to show you the rate so that's why i'm doing that so i got k is about negative point zero six seven three what that says is that there's a a negative 6.73 percent decrease in temperature every whatever the time period is every minute 30 minutes losing 6.73 of its temperature well as based on a scale of 100 um so what that allows us to do though that allows us to put this right here and then solve for the time it's going to take to reach 50 degrees so we've understood it we've put some numbers in the correct place we've used another piece of information to solve for k and now we have a formula that's usable for us so now we're going to answer the last question how long will it take in order for it to reach 50 degrees so all this is set how long says what's the time when our future temperature is now 50. so how long does it take for it to hit a future value of 50. that's based on our original equation that we got we just put our k in there and now we're going to solve for that t so subtracting 30 dividing by 70 taking a natural logarithm on both sides and finally dividing by negative point zero six seven three all right i got 18.61 now remember this is minutes that's what was given right here to us so in 18.61 minutes this turkey will have dropped from 100 to 50 degrees celsius according to my ambient temperature so i can cut into it and not burn my fingers like i do every year so anyhow um one more thing doesn't make sense does it make sense that it took that long because it took it took only five minutes to drop 20 degrees why would it take that much longer to drop another 30 degrees well it does make sense because exponential decay it drops quickly and that drops slower and slower and silver silver silver some sort so imagine this if you're losing point seven point three per percent of your your temperature let's say then there's a lot of temperatures start you're gonna lose big amounts but as you start losing temperatures six point seven three percent is less than it was at the beginning because you lost some it's like the opposite of compounding interest you're losing and so you're making less and less and less or taking less and less and less away so it should take longer it should take longer to lose the same amount of temperature as you start getting cooler or heating up theoretically will this turkey ever reach 30 degrees ever will it ever get down to the point where it's equal to the temperature of my house theoretically practically yeah theoretically no and i need you to see the last thing i point out look right here this is an exponential this is an exponential with negative so a downward exponential decrease in exponential this is a vertical stretch and this right here is a vertical shift i'll see it that's a vertical shift of 30. that's a horizontal asymptote shift of 30. this has a horizontal asymptote it will never theoretically reach 30 degrees it'll always lose but it'll never never get down to that isn't that interesting so that's that's all that interplays with this i hope that you've seen the exponentials that explain it to you i've really tried to make it as though as possible without giving you a background of differential equations because that's just not the scope of this class so hopefully it's interesting hopefully it made sense to you and we are now we're really done with our exponentials that's about as much as i can teach you we're going to move on to something completely different we're going to want to do sequences and series now they do relate to exponentials but they are a different idea so we'll talk about those i'll give an introduction to sequences an introduction series we'll talk about arithmetic and geometric sequences in series and then a proof of induction and and that um and then we start talking about some systems of equations for a little bit before moving on to trigonometry hope you have fun you 

Transcript for: Introduction to Sequences (Precalculus - College Algebra 67)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we are going to start something new we're going to start talking about sequences and series sequences in this video series in the next video and then we'll talk about some some specific types of sequences and series like the arithmetic and the geometric sequences and series discover what they're all about and then have a math mathematical proof by induction and that's uh that's the next several videos so kind of a different unit for us before we move on to anything else so when we start talking about sequences and series I need you to understand what they are how they're created and what we can do with them so when we talk about sequence and series there's a difference between them sometimes students get confused a sequence is simply a list of numbers they're not added they're not multiplied they're just listed with commas between them and they're from some sort of a formula some sort of a sequence expression that's based on the index of your your term and we'll talk about that as you go what a series does a series takes that sequence and adds it up that's the difference between a sequence and a series so a Series has a lot more math involved in it uh there's a lot of formulas that we can do to add up series but sequences we don't have that because you're not adding them you're just listing it out so a sequence is simply a list of numbers that's given by some sort of a a formula really um so that's what this really says a sequence of a list of numbers given by a formula detered by the index of a term what in the world does that mean well an index is the number of the term that you have in your your sequence quence so we should be able to say oh can we find the second term the first term the fifth term the H 100th term given by whatever our formula is for that particular sequence the answer is yeah we should be able to do that um so when we start talking about sequences in the formula you're going to notice that you have this little subscript we call that an index and given an index you should be able to plug that in look how it's related there's an A subn and then inside of your formula you have another n this says to find a term of your sequence you're just plugging in whatever term you want to find so do we want to find the first term plug in one oh that would be a sub one that would be the first term plug in one it would tell you what term what the value of that term is and we can find as many terms as we want to we can find whatever term we want to Simply by plugging in the index of whatever term we need to find um this is the standard way that you see sequences sometimes you'll see them in Brackets it's also very very common generally we we write our our sequence in Brackets like that so let's go ahead and jump right into it a sequence is a list of numbers given by a formula and if you want to find any term you just plug in the subscript or the index of whatever term you want to find so we're going to find the first five terms we'll talk about a little bit more after that uh but we're going to go ahead and practice right now so let's let's say we wanted to find first term a sub one couple questions you might have is well what can n be can n be decimals can n be zero can n be negative well n can be neg be zero like the zeroth term again awkward to say that but you can have that n cannot be fractions can't be decimals can't be negative we call them natural numbers so a sub a natural number the index is always a natural number one two 3 these counting numbers that we have so you're not going to be plugging in like 34 thank goodness right we're just plugging in whole positive natural numbers to get these terms so if we want to find the first term we're going to take one our index we're going to plug it in so a sub one notice how the one replaces the N here and must replace the N here just like a normal function would so we plug in one so a sub 1 would be 1^ 2ar + 1 that would give you two all first term in our sequence is two how about a sub 2 well if you want to find the second term all of these terms are based on their index and then the the formula that we're using is basing whatever value we're getting out for that term on the index as well so a sub 2 says replace your n with two replace your M with 2 that would be 2^2 + 1 that would give us five well how about three three would be our our third term let's replace that with three for the fourth term and fifth term we're doing exactly the same thing so a sub4 says take your index replace it with four replace your n with four they'll give you the fourth term in your sequence 17 and you might start to develop some patterns here you see a sequence should be really a patterned list of numbers it should have a pattern to it so if you look at this we start with two sure um if we had started with Zer a sub Z we would have got one notice that you plug in zero you get one so let's take a look at what's really happening to get from here to here to here to here can you see what's happening can you see that from two to five we're adding three from 5 to 10 we're adding five from 10 to 17 we're adding seven we added 3 5 7 the next term that we get should be added nine it's going to create something with a pattern now it's not that easy to go from a pattern and get this but I'm going to show you in the latter part of this video how to do that um a way to structure your thinking on on how to get back to a a formula from some sort of a list of numbers but in general it could should create some sort of a patterned list for you let's check it this should be let's see um 17 + 9 it should be 26 but let's go ahead and find out so plug it in five would give us 5^ 2 + 1 that's 26 and sure enough this would be add 3 at five at seven at nine the next would be add 11 it's creating a list of number fors that's definitely pattern but we always have a formula to fall back on to see where we can plug your index and get the appropriate term could you plug in zero if you wanted to a sub Z you can do that you can't plug in negatives can't plug in fractions or decimals but if you did we would get one and notice from 1 to two you would add one then add three then add five 7 9 the next should be 11 13 15 we're adding odd numbers to get these it's based on this that's kind of interesting that adding odd numbers up starting with one is you can find any term by that formula so what if you wanted to find out the 100th term would you really want to add up these odd numbers until you get to a sub 100 well probably not you'd have to do a whole long list could you find the 100th term simply by plugging in 100 yes that's why we have a formula so you do 100 SAR + 1 it would give you whatever term you are looking for so we found the first five terms our list of numbers our sequence it has a pattern to it is going to be I'm going to remove the ace Sub Zero 2 5 10 17 26 and then it doesn't end so the way we show it doesn't end is we put a few dots and then we close that Curly bracket so this is the first five terms starting with nals 1 and you should be told that like where do you start Nal 1 n equals 0 I told you n equal 1 so we started there um you you have to be told where to start you don't have to start at Nal 1 do you you could start at Nal 20 if you really wanted to but you're going to be asked find the first five terms of something that implies start with one um so if they tell you zero great but in general you just start with one less otherwise specified and you'll list out the first five terms in that sequence it doesn't end and you can find any term just by plugging in whatever that index is hope that makes sense you hope you're seeing what a sequence is very simple thing uh sometimes we over complicate it it's very simple thing say plug in a number you're going to get that particular term let's let's move on to the next one so b subn = n / 3n so it says to find the nth term you're going to take whatever that value of n is plug it into your formula and get a value out of your term the nth term uh if we leave it in terms of n is sometimes called the general term so we can do things like this would go until you hit your general term whatever your n stops at since our general term is given by n n^2 + 1 we can do it looks a little funny it might look a little funny to you 1 2 3 4 that would be listing five terms in general uh 2 5 10 17 26 the first five terms and you would keep doing that forever following that pattern is what that says to you so let's find the first five terms of B subn let's put them in a list here it's it's not really hard to do you're going to see the pattern as we go so b subn = n 3 to then says I want to find the first term let's plug in zero that would be one oh sorry I I miss I misspoke that would be pluging in one for the first term so 1 over 3 the 1st if I want to find the second term I plug in two that would be 2 over 3 2 and we can simplify as we go but I do want you to notice that it's really important to be able to go backwards and this sort of a pattern to it what's really happening to our numerator what's really happening to our denominator our numerator is getting exactly what this index is three our denominator is getting three to whatever power our index is I'm prefacing something we're going to do in just a little bit what we're going to do in just a little bit is go backwards I'm going to give you a list of numbers I'm going to ask you to come up with that formula for the sequence and it's really important to be able to base whatever numbers you have on whatever index you have for your terms that's incredibly valuable because then you can make the jump to the general term the term based on N that that would be like the general term the term based on N how about the fourth so the fourth term so B sub4 is how we say that that would be four over 3 4th and you can see the pattern the next term is going to be 5 over 3 5th the one after that would be 6 over 3 6 7 over 3 7th n over 3 to n that's exactly what that says to us now we're going to simplify these you get 1/3 2 9th 3 27 4 over 81 and 5 over 243 but when we go and simplify the fraction a bit more especially that guy right there we're going to start losing the pattern it's not going to be as easy to see if you're asked for the first five terms these are it if you're asked for the general sequences listen out this is it you so it goes Forever Until you want to stop it whatever nend you're asked for here we were asked to stop at the fifth term so you'd have 1/3 then 2 9ths then 1 nth um notice how this is getting smaller this might look really funny to you you go what is happening with that uh well this is 3 9ths 1/3 is 3 9ths 2 9ths 1 nth 4 81 5 over 247 these fractions are getting smaller and smaller and smaller it would look like a decreasing function almost like an exponential wait a wait a minute that is an exponential hopefully you find that very interesting that that is based on some sort of an exponential with a a a term or a base of 1/3 something over three so anyhow our sequences are based on our index we plug it in could you plug in zero here well sure you would get 0 over one that would be zero so you'd start with 0 1/3 2 9 if you were asked to start with the zeroth term by plugging in zero and finding b sub Z we list out whatever number of terms were asked to and that's pretty much how we deal with these sequences U we can simplify our fractions of course this would be kind of nice cuz you can see the pattern can't you 3 9 27 81 243 those are powers of three 1 2 3 four five that's our index itself when we start simplifying them of course we start losing that so now now listen please listen to this when we get to the next part of it and we're going backwards we're going to want to make all of these terms we given the same type of form so we're going to say wait a minute that's 3981 not sorry 3 9981 247 we need to make those those look similar to be able to find a pattern to it and so we'll we'll start thinking that way all right let's move on to the next example again find the first five terms we're going to see what this part does what that part of a sequence that negative -1 to an exponent we're going to see that that all that does is alternate signs it's going to make positive negative positive negative positive negative that's important for us to realize as we go back at some of these patterns um that that causes us to have alternating signs so if we see alternating signs we're going to have netive 1 to some exponent the other thing I want you to notice is that even though I've only found the first five terms here and then the general statement you can find any term you want if you wanted to find the the 50th term you'd plug in 50 over 3 to the 50th now think about that 50 over 3 to the 50th 3 to the 50th is enormous 50 over that is going to be very close to zero almost like this horizontal ASM toote like all exponential that have exponential decay or decreasing exponentials get to so this would have a horizont ASM toote somewhere we're going to say the same thing would happen here if I just needed to Simply find uh a sub 10 the 10th term in our sequence I can plug in 10 it'd be very easy to do we're just practicing finding out what our sequence is by plugging in the first five terms so let's start with a sub one so a sub1 says if I want to find the first term I'm going to let my index get evaluated here and on that side as well so a sub1 would equal whatever I get when I plug in 1 to n so even though there can be a bit more work here we're still doing the same thing so we're taking one and evaluating -1 to the 1 - 1 so n is replaced by one everywhere 1 - 1 is z negative 1 to the zero power is one and that fraction that we get is 1 over 1 so 2us 2 * 1 is 2 - 1 is 1 1 / 1 is 1 so our first term a sub 1 is 1 let's do a sub 2 a sub 2 says that if you want to find second term let N be evaluated for two now I really need you to focus on what happens with this piece as we're working down as we do this think about what's going to happen here this was this was a zero power think of it like even even though zero is not really even here but think of it like even and so anything zero power would give you a one this is going to be an odd exponent anything to a negative to an odd exponent is going to give you a negative one the next one will be even it'll give you positive one it's going to alternate all that negative one is doing is giving us positives for even exponents and odds sorry negative for odd exponents it's all that's happening it's alternating our signs for us so -1 to the 2 - 1 is 1 that would be 1 the fraction is 2 over let's see 4 - 1 is 3 2/3 giving us -23 a sub3 going be similar but we should expect that this is going to be 1 raised to an even power giving us positive1 let's see the third term take your three plug it in so we would have -1 to the 3 -1 power well 3 - 1 is 2 and so if we have1 to the second power -1 to the second power is in parentheses that would be POS 1 our fraction is 3 over let's see 2 * 3 that's that's 6 - 1 is 5 that's 3 fths since we got a positive 1 1 * 35ths is 35ths can you see the pattern can you maybe you can see it now you'll definitely see on the next next one we started with 1 over 1 then we got 2 over 3 but it's negative then we got 3 over 5 but it's positive so there's a few things happening here we're going to really see the pattern on the next one if you don't see it yet so a sub4 a sub four says if you want to find the fourth term take the index of four plug it into your n that would be your uh the the subscript of whatever term you want to find it's going to find that particular term for you so take the four and plug it into your formula there for your sequence that would be -1 to 4 -1 4 over 2 * 4 -1 well what's going to happen then this exponent is now odd notice how it's acting like even then odd then even then odd then even then odd then even then odd that's what you get with n minus one you're going to get U an even or odd number it's just going to be off from whatever index you're putting in so if you're plugging in an even it'll give you an odd plug in an odd it'll give you an even how could I make it match up so if I plug it in even it gives me even plug it in odd it gives me an odd I just wouldn't have the minus one so whenever you see -1 to the N or1 to the N minus one it's going to give you a sign alternation for every term every time in this case we have an even number even number of minus one is all OD -1 to the 3 power or an odd in general is going to give US1 our fraction is numerator is four denominator is let's see 8 - 1 is 7 I really want you to think about the pattern right now we started with positive one over one then we got NE 2/3 POS 35ths 47 think about what's happening what's the next one going to be think about the patterns very important for people to find the patterns the next one should be should be positive or negative should be positive the next numerator should be let's see 1 2 3 4 the next numerator should be five the next denominator should be 1 3 5 7 the next denominator should be nine you can do that with the patterns you can find out each little piece am I dealing with a positive or negative in this case I should be alternating signs get positive what's my numerator doing 1 2 3 4 should be five what's my denominator doing in general 2 nus one will always give you odd numbers it's listing at the odd numbers 1 3 5 7 and N because the denominator here would be one remember that denominator was one the numerator is just listen out oh wait a minute if that's based on n and n is always just the natural numbers it's giving my counting numbers for every term it should give me that fifth term and if we look at it this is 5 - 1 that's 4 1 4th power is POS 1 your fraction is 5 over 9 and that's what we expected to happen so if we want to list out our first five terms for our sequence the first five terms are really positive one over one but we've simplified that haven't we we've got one then -2/3 POS 35s -47 and POS 5 9 so if we're asked to just find the first five terms we've done it hopefully you've noticed what's going on here the alternation of signs the numerator matching up with whatever your index is 1 2 3 four five denominator matching up with the odd every o odd number so we're we're basically skipping evens that's what 2 nus one does so we're having 1 3 5 7 9 the sequential odd numbers here if you want to show the sequence in general just to show the pattern you'd have this you just put a dot dot dot and then do that1 n to the nus one n over 2 nus one typically though we just asked to find a certain number of terms um if you want to show that that's that's okay what if you had to find the 10th term well then we plug in 10 and we do whatever the math says in our case we have 10 - 1 is 9 -1 to the 9th is1 then you'd have 10 over 19 so that would be 10/ 2 * 10 -1 and you get whatever term you actually need to find I hope this makes sense I hope you're seeing what a sequence is it's not super complicated but it is important very important for a lot of math that we do especially later on when you get to like calculus 2ish so it's just this list of numbers it's based on whatever your index is and it needs to give you a formula for that right now what we're going to do is we're going to go backwards I'm going to give you the list of numbers I'm going to show you a couple techniques on how to go backwards and find your sequence from it um I'm not going to give you incredibly hard examples to do I'll make them understand to you so you have a process for doing it I'll see a little bit now that you understand what a sequence is really about let's try to go ahead and create our own formulas from some sequences given very important piece of of understanding is how to find a pattern and represent it so that you don't have so that you don't have to list out the sequence to find like the H hundredth term you probably don't want to do that here so if that's your first term and I said find the hund one two three here's the fourth and you go I don't want to find like 96 more terms to just find the 100th term that's crazy I don't want to do that I want to spend the time to find the pattern relate the pattern to the index and in doing so you find the general term if I can find the general term I can plug in any number and then find the 100 term very very easily that's the idea so I'm going to give you a way to do it I'm not saying that with these easy examples is exactly how everything is going to work what I'm saying is this idea will yield for you this this formula for your sequence uh it's the best way I found out how to do it um so some of these can be quite tricky but in general here's the idea on going through and taking a pattern this list of numbers and figuring out your general term from it so number one thing we want to do take your terms and write them down so if I give you four terms write down a sub one is is this term your first term and second term third term fourth term however many you have then make them all look the same so the same form if if most of them are fractions make them all fractions if we have um a sign show that as ne1 out front or one out front if we have powers relate them all to the same type of base if you can so somehow find out a form that all of these take after that make the jump to n we're about to do that right now so number one the first thing I'm doing I'm not really overthinking it I'm just going to write down all four terms next I'm going to do I'm going to make them all appear the same form if I can so for instance I've noticed that these are fractions and that isn't I'm going to write that as a fraction take the one that's off and write it as whatever the rest of them are after that what we're going to do is we're going to try to write them as as something that can be represented the same in all of them are we doing odd numbers uh is there something like we have a power of something so I'm looking at my numerator I'm saying well my numerator is one in every case that that's really good so I'm fairly confident that every single term is going to have a one on the numerator and now I'm going to look at my denominator and think what relates 2 and four now the one's throwing me off so I'm going to leave that for a second what relates 2 and 4 and 8 could you think about the next term 2 4 8 what are you doing uh well it appears that I multiplying by two so 1 * 2 is 2 2 * 2 is 4 4 * 2 is 8 8 * 2 is it's probably 16 now that's that's great I could say I'm multiplying by two but maybe I could also think about about this is powers of two so the reason why is because that doesn't have a two in it so I'm I'm really it's really hard to multiply something by two and get one I don't want to start doal with fractions like that so maybe I think of powers of two like this is two to the first oh two to the 1 two to the second 2 to the 3r next would be 2 to the 4th now unfortunately though you have to have everything related the same so if this is 2 the 3r 2 the 2 2 to the F first what would one be we know about that we know that if I oh wait how about 2 to the 0 2 to the 0o would give me one so I've listed out my terms doing nothing I've made them all the same form they look like fractions um I've tried to relate them somehow to the same something whatever you multiplying by or a common base I found a common base 2 the 3r 2 the 2 2 the 1 2 to the zero and let's double check does this still give me 1 12 1/4 and 1/8 yes they're all the same and now finally once I have them all the same form I somehow relate whatever is changing to whatever my index is whatever is changing to whatever my index is so the one is not changing you know what that means that means that this is going to show up in our final formula as one the one doesn't change one one one one this is going to have a one the two does not change 2 2 2 two this is going to have a two the exponent of the denominator is changing 0 1 2 and 3 I need to relate that to my index so I'm going to try to come up with some sort of an expression based on N based on my index that represents this so how can I do that well let's think about it how is three related to four and two related to three and one related to two and zero related to one it appears that what I'm doing is I'm taking my index and I'm subtracting one from it it looks like this is taking 4 - 1 giv me 3 3 - 1 giv me 2 2 - 1 give me 1 1 - 1 giv me zero so I'm relating this to whatever my index is and now we're ready to make the jump as soon as you have the index listed somewhere in your term that should be the only thing changing is the index should be changing so list those things out whatever is changing 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 call that n so I know that I have one that's not changing here's a one two that's not changing here's a two minus one that's not even changing I'm going to have a minus one the one matches my one my two matches my two my this exponent that part of the exponent is matching my index called that n and this represents the sequence that we have so if I wanted to find check it check it if you want to um if I want to see term number one I should be plugging in one and getting out one so if I plug in one 1 - 1 is0 two the 0 1 1 over 1 is 1 let's check term four plug in four 4 - 1 is 3 2 3r is 8 1 over 8 is 1 18 so it does work and I hope that that that that sequence of steps makes sense to you write out your terms don't change them make them the same form you should be able to find out some relationship amongst the terms is it are you multiply are you adding are you are you adding the same number are you taking a power like we are here and then try to relate it to your n do you necessarily have to show this step no not really um you could probably get there from here and go hey you know what that's that's one - one that's 2 - one that's 3 - one that's four - one that's n minus one you can totally do that I'm giving you as as clear as I can make it my thought process going through this now could you find the 50th term the 12th term the 100th term that whatever you want yeah you could if you wanted to find the 10th term let's say cuz I really don't want to plug in a big number a sub 10 you would just plug in 10 that would be 2 1/ 2 to the 9th because 10 - 1 is 9 that's a whole lot better than writing out all these terms until you get there and you could evaluate that 1 over 2 the 9th figure out what 2 the 9th is and then you'd have a nice fraction so I hope that makes sense I hope you're a lot of times students really struggle with this in calculus 2 teach this in calculus 2 and sometimes student go I don't know what that means um I'm trying to develop for you a thought process for how to take a sequence which is a pattern and write it as something meaningful that you can find other terms with without having to complete the entire sequence it's a very valuable thing to be able to do all right let's move on to the last one we're going to do the same thing uh we're going to talk about this we're going to see what the patterns are we're going to relate it to our index and then we'll have a general term so B subn is 2 then4 then 6 then 8 then 10 then what would the next term be what would the one after that be can you see that the next term should be we'll think about it should be positive or negative start evaluating this sequence I see um positive negative positive negative positive next one should be negative I see 2 4 6 8 10 the next one should be 12 these are alternating even numbers what we're going to do is we're going to try to create a a sequence for that a general term for our sequence but it starts with listing these out so take them and write them down for every term I've given you five terms just write down five terms now let's all make them look the same so what do you mean look the same well let's start by saying these are all even numbers but I'm seeing that they have a negative in front when you see that try to do this try to make it so that you can relate it to one where you either are multiplying by one or negative 1 one or negative 1 one or negative 1 so every negative number can be represented as negative 1 times that value now that would look that looks really funny but that would look funny if we were just saying oh well certain numbers I want are multiplied by ne1 because I feel like it so with the and the 10 and the two consider that it's still being multiplied by one but somehow not giving you a negative that starts to look the same are you seeing what we're trying to do we're trying to get every term to look the same form so here I've said 24 well I really want them to have some feature that's the same this is negative 1 this is positive one this is positive 1 negative 1 positive 1 next one be negative 1 then positive one then negative one then positive one it's giving us an alternation now let's try to to find what that 2 4 6 8 and 10 is and then we'll finalize what's happening with the 1 and netive 1 now we have I have preface this I've shown you an alternating sequence where you're probably going to have netive one to some power that's exactly what we're going to have we just need to tie it into the N somehow so let's take a look at our 2 4 6 8 and 10 um well they're all even which means I can relate this as two times something in other words 2 4 6 8 and 10 are all something multiplied by two so it's write that at this point when I took this class or something similar to it or studied this for the first time I thought how in the world this how in the world is this person figuring this out I'll never figure that out um it it does come with practice I will tell you that but it's also this thought process of getting them to look all the same will really guide your thoughts like how can you make these all look the same I know 2 4 6 8 and 10 well it looks like they're all something multiplied by two I just write the two this would be two * 1 2 3 4 5 that would give us that would give us 10 that would give us8 64 and 2 it's the same sequence but now I have it written differently so I can evaluate how it's related to my index now we start looking at for the pieces that are changing and the pieces that aren't changing so what's not changing here what's not changing is going to show up as a constant in your formula what's not changing is 2 two two two and two that's not changing another thing that's sort of changing but not really is you are going to have a negative one here a negative one not all these have negative 1es that's true that's because that will be raised to an exponent that is changing whenever you see this positive negative positive negative or negative positive negative positive or 1ga 1 1ga 1 or negative 1 one you're going to have a negative one in there raised to some exponent that's what alternation does now it is up to us to figure out what that exponent is we're going to do that in a minute but these are two things that aren't changing the two and there will be a negative one on every one of those terms what is changing needs to get related to the N the index so we start doing that uh one two whoa that's cool one matches with one two matches with two three matches with three four and five and N notice how that is exactly what we're doing here this is five matches with five so n matches with n that's what we're doing we're relating the things that are changing to the ends that are changing our index and in this case it's just whatever end shows up so one should have a one here and two should have a two here and three should have a three here and five should have a five here and 10 should have a 10 there and that's exactly what is happening now we got to do our sign so the way to to deal with this is to either take this to the N or the N minus one power depending on whether the first term is positive or negative so if your first term is positive you need a zero to get that if your first term is negative you need a one to get that since we start with our first term and we have a positive you're going to have to take that one and subtract one from it and you know what right now probably the best way to deal with this just trial and error until you really understand what's going on try to plug in one and see if it gives you gives you a positive one if it doesn't then uh then change this and just make it an N so let me show you let's pretend I did that if I tried to plug in one for my first term I would get1 to the first it would give me 1 i' go oops that's not right so what would I do with that subtract one and it'll work now I'll plug in one 1 - 1 is 0 1 the 0 power is 1 1 * 2 that's 2 * 1 would give us two oh that works try the rest of them let's plug in two uh 2 - 1 is 1-1 to the first is -1 got it and then remember we're plugging in two here 2 * 2 is four try the third term plug in three so if I plug in three 3 - 1 is 2 1 to the second power is positive great and then 2 * 3 is 6 it works it's going to work for all of them this is much nicer than writing out the first 50 terms if you need to find B sub 50 or the 50th term for the 50th term would actually be that bad for the 50th term we'd have negative 1 still that doesn't change only the ends change that's why we write this in the identify the only things that are changing because if only the NS change you just need to see the things that are changing and call them NS somehow that's all we're doing just takes a lot of thought to do it so negative 1 doesn't change 50 minus one while that seems like a large number it's really just about being even or odd so 50 - 1's 491 to the 49th power 1 to an odd power is negative two doesn't change two is where we're getting the evenness from this is how you represent even numbers is 2N for whatever N is a positive whole number so 2N would give you all even numbers the first whatever even numbers you want 2 4 6 8 10 are the first five even numbers and then 2 * 50 would give you 100 it should make sense to you that the 50th even number is is 100 there's 100 digits in a row right if you count them the first 50 odd numbers are 1 through 90 uh 1 through 99 yeah you don't count that zero and the first 50 even numbers end with 100 so hopefully that makes sense to you we just have negative 100 because we have that alternation this is how and this looks a little awkward I really should have a little more space the exponent you know that's just on the negative one typically your alternation is written first though so that you can immediately identify and go oh yeah that's alternating signs it's going to start with a positive then the next would be a negative positive negative positive negative if we start with nals 1 okay this is a really common example to get on like a test or something like that uh so just check out how it really works um make sure that when you're trying to go and find a sequence from a list of numbers that you write them all out you try to make them the same form I'm just going to give you this extra one because I think you should try it on your own I really do um try to follow that try to try to write them all out all four of these terms try to make them the same form identify what that negative positive negative positive negative positive negative positive doing the next term should be negative it's alternating try to identify that they're all fractions write them in the same type of a fraction you know what do youan the same same type of fraction see if there's a root fraction here that's repeating itself Maybe by a power sometimes you can multiply the say number sometimes you have to find a power um so for here we're going to take and say this is -1 * 23 this is postive 1 * 2/3 and - 1 sorry 49s doing the math in my head again 4 9ths and -1 * 827 and positive 1 * 16 81 now these fractions don't look the same but see if you can make them the same think about 2/3 can you relate 4 9 to 2/3 8 27 to 2/3 1681 to 2/3 or all of them to some other fraction like we did here can we relate all these to two times some number so for us keep your netive 1 keep your 2/3 keep your one but let's think about four nights can you write four kns as sub root fraction well this would be 2/3 to the 2 power 2 2 over 3 now you could write it that way too 2 2 over 3 2 this is 2 1st over 3 1st and 2 3r over 3 3r and 2 4th over 3 4th can you make it even simpler can you say well wait a minute because the the numerator denominator both raised at the same same power can we really factor that power out over Division and have 2/3 to the 1 2/3 to the 2 2/3 to the 3 2/3 to 4th now we're about ready to start writing down our general term or the formula for our sequence identify the things that are not changing the things that aren't changing are you will have a 2/3 you will have A1 and you will have some exponents nicely our exponent 1 2 3 and four matches our index so if that matches our index our index here will represent that exponent so 4 4nn just like every other index matched its power as far as our negative 1 goes we need to we need to get that alternation correct so we start with a negative number so try something try n is -1 to the first power going to give us the negative that we want yes this matches I think guessing and check until you understand guessing checking is pretty pretty okay to use for your um your alternation so because we start with a negative we need to start with an odd power our first term is odd so let's start with the first power or the second power for second term third power for third term fourth power fourth term nth power for the nth term is how we really determine that this is the general term for whatever that sequence represents one other thing um keep in mind that for for odds it would look up very similar to that but you'd have to start subtracting one maybe I'll go ahead and do that one too okay my personal opinion is that the odds can be quite difficult U because while they're easy to define recursively you understand what's going on as you look at your pattern and you can base it on your previous term that's what recursive means for instance I can look this and go 1 3 5 7 9 the next one would be 11 13 15 they're odd numbers I can see that I can see how to find it I can see that I'm taking the previous number adding two previous number adding two previous number adding two previous term adding two that's a recursive formula and it'd be pretty easy to find you can say that a of n would be the previous term + two that would actually do it if I want to find the fifth term oh man this this pretty Advanced actually for recursive formulas if I want to find the fifth term I'd look at the fourth term and add two if I want to find the fourth term I'd look at the third term and add two so if I wanted to find a sub4 I'd look at 4 - 1 is 3 and I would add two so if I want to find the fourth term I'd look at the third term and add two and now ignore the A's versus B's I'm just give an example here but this would be look at your previous term and add two sixth term would be look at the fifth term and add two You' get 11 do you see how recur Works do you see how it's looking at your previous term and doing something to it to find your next term it's almost like induction when we get there but it's saying you need to know your previous term in order to find it sometimes you need to know your previous finite number of terms to find it so if I wanted to find the H 100th term this would not do it because i' need to know the 99th if I want to find the 99th term I need to know the 98 so while we can Define things by the pattern and say yes there is a pattern the pattern is look at your previous term ter and add two to it look at your previous term and add two look at your previous term and add two look at your previous term and add two that's exactly what it says it's not beneficial to find the nth term or general term this is not it so it's quite difficult really because when we take a look at this and go ah man I don't know I can't how am I supposed to relate all these to the same thing it's you have to think outside the box here um we try to relate to n 1 equals n oh okay but this doesn't equal to n 3 doesn't equal 2 and 5 doesn't equal 3 and S is equal four it looks like it's uh one more then two more then three more then it's predictable but it it's not really matching up perfectly to the thing that's changing so instead let's try to relate him something else let's try to relate him something that's not changing for instance I noticed that uh while this is 1 and 3 and 5 and seven and 9 I can think of it as this is 1 less than two 2 1 less than 4 1 less than 6 1 less than 8 well and in doing so I have something that's not changing I have this minus one I have a minus1 that's not changing okay now that that took some thinking outside the box though didn't it because it's it's really hard to relate that if you're not used to it but now you've seen it doesn't mean you're going to be perfect at it right now but at least you're you're kind of exploring that thought now how about 2 4 6 8 and 10 can I relate those little pieces to something that's not changing well it appears that 2 4 6 8 and 10 are all multiples of two again that's 2 * 1 - 1 and 2 * 2 - 1 and 2 * 3 - 1 and 2 * 4 1 and 2 * 5 - 1 we have another thing that's not changing we have a two every one of those is true it's going to give you nine and seven and five and three and one and we've identified the pieces that aren't changing do you see the point the point is you need to identify the pieces of your sequence that are not changing and write them down then relate the thing that is changing and it has to relate the same way in every term to your nend that's why this screws us up so much it's not related the same way to our n every time we can't just go oh this related to n is equal but this one is you add one and this one is you add two that doesn't work that doesn't work at all for sequences it must whatever you have done here the changing piece must relate to your n the same way for all of them which is why this takes so much work you know well I don't know let's this doesn't look like it relates really really well it's relate to something else this is 2 - 1 4 - 1 6 - 1 8 - 1 10 - 1 oh I'm subtracting one every time great I have a minus one let's look at our 2 4 6 8 10 do those relate to something well I I have two times some number for every one of those so I've related that that's why we got a two now it's pretty nice because we have 1 2 3 4 and 5 for n = 1 2 3 4 and 5 it appears that our index is here two and two three and three four and four five and five the piece that is changing is just our index it's n 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 n n to relate the part that's changing to your index and we've done that it's just our n whatever our index is appearing this is actually the sequence this is the the general term and that is how odd numbers are defined in like number Theory and things like that even is 2N odd is 2 N and you just subtract one so you'd get 2 4 6 8 10 and subtract one from it you get 1 3 5 79 it's actually much more difficult to Define right because you have to base them on even numbers and say oh I'm subtracting one from it which is where this this comes from here's all your even numbers and to get the odds you subtract one that's why I wanted to show that one to you I hope it's made sense you can do this recursively like I said you can say my next term will be based on my previous one my next term my sixth term would be based on my fifth term plus two and you can do it that way this is a recursive type of formula it says based on previous terms this is not this is a straight up formula for the sequence this one will allow you to find the H 100th term if you want to uh the 100th term be 2 * 100 that would be 200 - 1 is 199 199 is the 100th odd number this will not let you do that you'd have to know the 99th term to be able to figure out that 100th term and it does work though so like if I just told you B sub 100 is 199 the term right before that would be 197 so the odd numbers would be 197 and 199 the 99th term would have to be 197 and then we get 189 those are sequential odd numbers so check it out if I wanted to find the the 100 term this 100th term this way I would have B sub 100 should equal B sub 99 the previous term notice how 100 - 1 is 99 100 - 1 is 99 plus two well do you know the 99th term yeah because I gave it to you the 99th term is 197 plus two so recursive formulas have to look at the previous term or terms and do something to get your your current term so B sub 100 says look at your previous term and add two look at your previous term 187 and add two oh I should get 199 that is my H 100th term but it requires a lot more information uh to do that requires previous terms information all right I've I've really gone way further than I intended to on this video I just got kind of excited about the sequences so hopefully you understand a lot about sequences now you understand that they're list of numbers they're not added they're just a list of numbers you typically find the first five or so by a formula the hard part is going backwards getting a list and then creating a formula for it I have given you some very good ideas on how to do that how to relate it in the same form how to relate it to something that's not changing how to write those not changing pieces as part of your general term and then relate the piece that is changing somehow and it does not have to be easy to your index and that will be your n in your general term so I hope I I made that make sense to you where the stuff comes from it takes a lot of practice uh but in the next video we're going to talk about series taking your sequences and adding them up so I'll see you for that e 

Transcript for: Introduction to Series and Summation Notation  (Precalculus - College Algebra 68)
welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about series and with all the time we spent on sequences this should be a little bit more understandable because uh we already really explored a lot of the hardest parts and sequences how do you take a series and go backwards what's series mean um what's it based on and are there formulas for it uh the formulas are going to make the math so much easier for series you see here's what a series does a series adds up the terms of the sequence so they are not unrelated things that we have they're not the same and sequences in general are just a list of numbers and that's what we have we can talk about convergence and divergence and things like that but a series takes those terms and adds them now there's some very interesting things that happen with series some very predictable formulas that we can prove by proof by induction we can prove a lot of these things i'm going to show you how to do that when we get there and do proofs by induction that's in a few videos from now so we're going to be able to prove them some very interesting things happen and especially when we get into some calculus like calculus 2 we're going to find that you can actually add an infinite series an infinite number terms and get something it converges there's some very special cases to do that we talk about that in some geometric series in just a little while but some very fascinating things happen it's really worth our time to understand how a sequence works so that we can understand how a series works so we can understand a lot about some calculus later and do some very interesting things with it i won't go into everything that we have but some very interesting things happen with like pi and e and a lot of these numbers that are transcendental when we view them in a type of series so here's what the series does and how they work if you've never been exposed to it before this is what they look like you know what in the world does that mean a series is just taking a sequence and adding up the terms so here's what this tells you mathematically this sigma is it is a sigma it's a greek letter s and it stands for a sum your sequence is right here if you ignore this that's just a sequence in fact your series tells you where to start and where to end so your series is built like a sum of a sequence could you find the first let's say n terms of this well if the series is telling you where to start this says i want you to look for your k whatever this index is i want you to look for your k here's my k i want you to plug in 1. okay i'm going to plug in 1 to this it's going to give me my first term then i'm going to plug in 2 and 3 and 4. and then natural numbers because it's based on sequence you don't plug in like 1.5 you plug in all the natural numbers because it is a sequence you're just adding or subbing it up until you get to that term so here's what we would do starting with whatever this is it could be zero it could be one could be anything just start with what this is and plug it in so our first term says replace your index with one and then two and then three until you get to whatever this is now now that's an n so we're not going to be able to stop but we show that we would do this continuously until we reached the end notice that the two different letters that we have this k is the index of your sequence this n tells you where to stop sometimes n is infinity and it'll be an infinite sequence we get that a little bit later but most of the time that is going to be an actual number so what if that was what if that had been three if that had been three it would be exactly this it would say you plug in one then two then three then you stop that is how a series works it takes these values starting here plugs it into the sequence that you know how to deal with and stops with that term and then you add it up so one two and three from our one our two and our three if that had been 31 you do one two three four five six all the way to thirty one you plug them in here and you add the whole thing up is it possible yes is it annoying of course because if you have 31 terms here and you've got to add them up that's a lot of number crunching are there formulas thank goodness there are imma show them to you in just a little while in this video on how you would do this quickly very quickly because there's formulas that allow us to do that the k squared so i'll show you those things when we get there but in general that's health series we're going to just intended to to give you an example on how you'd find the first number of terms the actual doing of the math and finding the sum while you could do it this way there's better ways most cases there's better ways if this was left as n we would have to show that we continue until we reach whatever that number is that's an important step to do by for proof by induction when we finally get there okay let's do one that looks a little bit more complicated it's not going to be all that bad this says that here's your series here's the sequence on which this is built so you are summing or adding the terms of this sequence by starting at zero and ending at n minus one how to end minus 1 you just plug in n minus 1 just like we just plugged in n you just start here show a few terms then go yeah some stuff happens and we end here how do we end there i took n and i plugged it in and we got that term we're going to do the same thing so this says i want you to start adding these terms of the sequence by starting at zero so if i start at zero i can do two times zero plus one the next term would be i plug in 1 then i plug in 2 then i plug in 3 it would give me an another term for each of those inputs this is the zeroth term the first term second term third term uh you can consider a first term second term third third fourth term but you you notice that you start at zero so we typically call it that uh case of zero or the uh the n sub zero term n sub one has a two it's a three and where we would end is take your two and plug in whatever that is if we had had just watch this if we would have had a three here this is where we would stop we would plug in zero one two and three and we'd be done that's it that's all we would stop or right where we stop that's all we do but if you have an n minus one then you go okay i'm plugging zero and then one two three four five six blah blah blah blah blah blah going for a right down here going for a really long time and then you would have plug in 2 or you have a 2 plug in your n minus 1 plus 1. it's just an evaluation like you plugged in 0 and then one and then two and then three and then where you stop so take this and evaluate it that would be two times n minus one you do have to have parentheses i hope that you see it's a composition function you just plug in one number it's just n minus 1 and you can simplify all this stuff this would give you 1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 7 plus look at what this does this would be 2 n minus two plus one wait a minute two n minus two because i distributed plus one is two n minus one isn't that exactly what we got for odd numbers in the last video for sequences yeah that's it and this is really interesting because if you notice this you can define odd numbers two different ways you can define them by what if i started at zero well then i would have to have two times zero plus 1 to get 1. what if i started at 1 then i have 2 times 1 minus 1 to get 1. you can define them two different ways and some of these series and sequences can be done that way this defines odd numbers the same way that this does if you think about it and you want to do it on your own i might spend a lot of time on it but if you think about it this is going to give you exactly the same thing that this does exactly plug in one two times one minus one is one plug in two two times two minus one is three plug in three that would be five plug in seven that would be seven or sorry plug in four that would be seven plug in n plug in n you get two n minus one two minus one same stuff so this does teach something that says that you can manipulate one series into being something else by altering where you start and where you stop and it might even change your your sequence that you're working with so i hope that makes sense i'm trying to teach you some pretty advanced things just by looking through a couple of examples here so in general a sequence is a series it's just a sequence added up the sequence is given to you it tells you where to start it tells you where to stop those can be finite numbers in which you have a finite number of terms or they can be left as n and n minus one in which you have an infinite number of terms and you just show what that last term is by plugging in or evaluating your n that's all that series do in general we're going to see that there's some formulas that would solve all of these things for us very nicely and let us add up the terms of your sequence without having to do a whole lot of writing out because this is annoying and if you went to 50 terms that'd be crazy that would take you so much time with a better way all right another thing that we can do is we can go backwards on a series like we went backwards on a sequence we can build a series from a sum and so we're going to show that it is the same exact technique so if you have not watched the sequence video on how we build a sequence from a list of numbers you need to because we're going to do the same thing here but quicker so how we do this the same exact idea is take whatever you're given and write the terms down so we have two then negative four then eight and those are being added the next term think about what the next term would be the next term would be let's see two negative four oh wait it's not six it's eight these are not just even numbers because let's skip one two negative four eight and the next one would be negative 16. so if you remember what we're trying to do is we're trying to make all of these the same form and then figure out the stuff that's not changing it and then relate it back to our n our index now there is one other thing here this series stops this series does have something some number as a stopping point so we're gonna have to figure this out we're gonna figure what the k is because we're gonna write our series and have a finite number there we're gonna figure out what that is actually gonna be eight but we'll figure out what that is as we go so we have to relate it back i'll do a different example like if you weren't given that how you would do it how would change but this is the way we go through it we list our terms out then we try to make them all the same form what do you mean try to make them look like they have the same stuff and represent the stuff that's the same as unchanging things in your series so i'm looking at this going hey i have a negative here a negative here and no negatives here i'm going to relate this to a negative one eventually so i'm going to say this is negative one times four one times eight 1 times 2 negative 1 times 256 so i know that there's a 1 in there that's not a negative 1 in there that's that's not changing my exponent will be changing we talked about alternation so we're going to have that in our series the next thing i do is look at our 2 4 8 and 256 and try to relate them to the same thing something that's not changing now this is not even numbers so it can't just be two times something like two times one two times two two times weight two times four two ten that doesn't work but they are all powers of two so this is two to the first to the second two the third two to the you'll figure that out but it will answer that question for you so to the first to the second two to the third two to the eighth the next one will be a negative one times two to the fourth and now we're ready to start making the jump for our series so i know it's being added so that says we have a series i know i have to start at 1 and so we're going to have this case of one so i know that our first term is is going to be our first term in this series as well i now need to start representing all of this stuff that's not changing just like we did a sequence what because a series is based on a sequence you need to have the same exact sequence so our sequence should have a negative 1 in it our sequence should have a 2 in it because the negative 1 and the two are not changing what is changing the sign of the first of our terms our negative one to a power that's changing so the exponent here needs to model that well let's take a look our first term is positive so if our first term is positive it needs to take negative one to some power and give me positive one it needs to take negative one to some power for our second term and give me negative one the way we do that is we take our k and we subtract 1. now please get this y k and not n k is the index for a series because you show where you end at the end you want to be able to plug in that n and get your general term and so we have to have a different index we can't use n and then plug in n to the n and represent a different n that doesn't make any sense so you start at k and you go okay k is my index that way i can plug in 1 and two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight and end at my n i can plug in n later and it actually makes sense i just need like this dummy index we call it k hopefully you're you're okay with that so plugging in one let's just double check this negative one to the one minus one one minus one zero negative one to the zero is one that works two i have a two in every single one of those terms and now we relate the other part that's changing one two three 8 back to my index it appears that 1 and 1 2 and 2 3 and 3 my index is matching and so this is going to match my index again it's k it's not n you can't do that because you're going to end with an n you can't say that n equals one and then two and then three and then end at n it's not correct form you'd have too many ends floating in here you use a different index we call it k now the last thing how do you know when you end because all of this stuff you could have just had this and got this so i'm gonna say two things number one if you were not given this last term let's pretend that wasn't there if you weren't given that last term and you didn't have this information you would just put n and you would be done because you would be able to represent that series and you would say it has no end to it so this this and this that would give you 1 negative 1 1 2 to the first second third you'd have negative 1 to the k minus 1 that matches our signs 2 to the first second third that matches our index the first term would give us positive 2 to the first that's what we got second term we're plugging two i'd get two minus one that's negative negative one two to the second that's what we have the next term if i plugged in three i would get three minus one is two negative one to the second is positive one two to the third that's exactly what we have and we say if we were not given an end you put an n there and that n says you go forever until you reach an n do you see how you could write remember imagine that's not there you could write the same series that we have here and your ending term would be let's see 2 negative 4 8 then negative 16 then blah blah blah blah blah and you would plug in n and you get negative 1 n minus 1 2 to the n that would be your nth term that'd be your general term that's why we use two different letters k for your series and the sequence that is series is based on and then n to represent your nth term because you need a different variable to plug this into it's inappropriate to plug an n into an n you're kind of switching variables there we don't want we want to show that we don't want it to be ambiguous now we don't we don't have a general term we have an end so what's very nice about this is because because our index matches our power index matches power index matches power index has to match that power it's got to be an eight and that says oh okay this has to be an 8 then you know that's the eighth term if you know that's an eighth term and it's the last term you've just found where you end this series is represented as here's the sequence we know it's right we've just spent like an hour long video finding sequences we know that that's represents a sequence we know it starts at one and now we know it ends at eight that is the eighth term this is how you would represent that series in series notation hope that makes sense hope you're seeing the relationship between the sequences that we already talked about now we're just kind of relating it back to the sum and showing that a little better with some different letters again we need those different letters because you need an n to be able to plug into something and we need to end with an nth term a general term in terms of n so we need a different variable to base our sequence on that's the only reason we're going to do now is i'm going to show you the formulas for how to add series because we don't want to be doing this with a calculator or something i'll show you that and then what we'll do is let's practice a couple okay so how do we actually calculate the sum of these series we don't want to actually write it all out and do it because that'd be crazy i want you to imagine something because we're going to do this problem and you're going to find out that it's not as bad as it looks right now this looks horrifying why because if you had to actually add that series what would you do well let's let's look at it this series means sum of what this sequence it is a sequence is based on an index k of 1 to 12 so you'd you do this you plug in one figure it out plug in two figure it out plug in three figure it out plug in four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve all twelve terms you'd figure that out and then you'd have that that's a lot of work and we're going to do something that's still a lot of work but quicker work also hopefully you can tell i kind of enjoy this stuff i don't know why it seems like some sort of a puzzle i really enjoy it don't know why that is but this is one of my favorite things is the the sequences in the series i like the the challenges i suppose there are some formulas that are going to help us solve series how to add the terms without having to actually have the terms now you're going to ask the question where in the world does this stuff come from one of them is very common sense and needs no proof same thing as that one but the rest of them would require proof we prove most of these by induction if you want to know where they came from originally you could ask someone like carl frederick gauss well you can't because he's dead but if you could he solved that by himself in like fifth grade or the level of fifth grade which is insane he did it like out of a couple minutes because he was super genius but anyhow a lot of these were discovered by pattern and then proved with with induction and so i will show you how to do that there's other ways to prove it but i'll show you how to do that in the last last video in this little little kind of sub series that we have on on sequence in series so here's what this means here's what the formulas look like because at first they look a little confusing i'm going to do this one last actually even though it's the most basic one i'm going to do this one so how how you can add up the terms of a series without actually doing the addition is with a formula like this now i want you to understand how this works this says let's suppose that your sequence is based on just k it's a mean that means that you plug in 1 2 three four five and that would be the terms of your sequence one plus two plus three plus four plus five if you add it up would create a series you'd stop at n so if this was ten here's what this would mean this series would be add one two three four five six seven eight nine and ten that's about b now you can do that pretty quickly on a calculator but this is actually even quicker than that here's all you need to know in order to find the series find the sum of that series quickly just know where you end this is the second reason why we need different letters here is so that you understand that this is based on the end of this series so if i'm adding the series of the sequence k from 1 to n i just take my n i plug it in here and it's going to give me the sum so if i go from 1 to 10 and i know it's based on k then i just plug in 10. 10 times 11 over two ten times eleven over two is fifty-five that's going to add to fifty-five if you take calculator right now do one plus two plus three plus four all the way to ten it's gonna be fifty-five why because this actually works and it's provable i'm not proving them now because i haven't taught you abduction but i will prove that one to you at a different time now there's some other ones why are there other ones because not everything can be simplified to just having a sequence of k what about k squared and k cubed we have two other formulas for that now there are other ones out there but these are the most common ones so what if you had a sequence based on k squared well what you would need to know is that you're starting at one and that you're ending at whatever like 10 or 12 or whatever that number is because if we have that there's a formula to add it so if we were ending at let's say seven or something so we knew the sequence was k squared we're starting to one and that's seven take your ending number seven seven plus one is eight seven times two plus one is fifteen seven times eight times fifteen and then divide by six that will give you the sum of one squared two squared three squared four squared y squared 6 squared and 7 squared all added up it will do it for you it's pretty fascinating same thing works here with k cubed if you know where you end take your ending number plug it in and it will solve for you now what if you don't know where you end then this is a this is still relevant but it won't give you a finite number there are some infinite series that will but they have special names like geometric series and their special conditions like you have to have a ratio of uh less than one common ratio so there are some special conditions or between negative one and one there's some special conditions there and there's some other series that have the same type of things going on but in general to add a series you need to know where you end otherwise it's going to go to infinity do you see that like if you just kept on adding this forever and k was numbers one two and three and four it's gonna go to infinity i it's getting really really really big even going from like one to twelve if this was one to twelve so you'd add up 1 cubed 2 cubed 3 cubed fourteen that's already big 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 all cubed and you added them we can do the same thing by taking the ending number let's say 12 12 times 13 divided by 2 78 squared and then square that whatever that is well that's going to be pretty big i can't do that in my head i was trying that's a little outside my range so this is what the formulas do and how they work they'll add the terms of your series very quickly very cool now let's look at this one because this one confuses a lot of people they go how do you get the n where the world's that coming from i want you to think about it this way first and then see that that makes sense so one thing that we can do is we can say if you have a constant in there nothing would change there's no k in there so what this would be this would say plug in one i can't there's nothing to plug into so what that would do is say for the first term take one for the second term take one for the third term take one for the fourth term take one for the fifth term take one for all the terms of the edges take one and add them up so if i went from one to seven of the sequence one here's what it would do it would take one one one i wish i would have picked a smaller number than seven because i'm gonna write seven ones one two three four five six seven here's the first term it's one second term two one third term one fourth term one you're giving it back fifth term one six term one seven term one and then i end because it terminates it says i end at seven the seventh term not plugging in seven you're you're trying to but it's only yours it's only giving out one it's a constant what do constants do they're the same value all the time so one one one one one one there's seven ones what do you get when you add seven ones wait a minute that's repeated addition of the same number repeated addition is multiplication how many times have you repeated it seven times whatever is here that value got repeated okay what would happen here you'd have a constant c would be a constant there's nothing to plug into the cc would be something like one or maybe five let's say five what would that be then well if i went from one to seven of let's say five now these wouldn't be ones anymore you'd have five five five five five five and five one two three four five six seven the first term will give you a five second term five third and five it's a constant seventh term five well how many times have you added the five well there's seven terms seven times 5 would be 35 this is where that comes from it says take your constant that's not changing see how many times you have it repeated every time from 1 to n there will be n repetitions of that constant the other way that you can view this and this is why it says or is is this it's quite important you can always take a constant being multiplied by something inside of your series and move it in front of the series so you could do this you could say this is the same as same thing as k equals 1 to n of c times 1. because c is a constant i could make this c times the series of 1 to n of 1. this would be c times we already know that this piece is n c times n that proves that to you so we do get that out of it we'll see that working through our one example that we're going to get because it i've involved everything of every one of these formulas in that so we'll talk about what you can do when we get there right now i just need to be really really clear on these formulas actually work they're very relevant we're going to use them in just a minute this one makes sense but you really have to think about a little bit okay so back to our example we don't really want to plug in 1 through 12 and add them up because that's really annoying and we have some formulas that do this for us so the couple things that i need you to know in order to be successful at solving that or adding up that series finding the sum without writing it out is that you can separate series by addition and subtraction and multiplication now get why it worked on what i showed you if a series means addition adding stuff up and addition is commutative it doesn't matter the order adds stuff it's also associative and separable which means that i can add stuff separately and add it back together later okay what does that mean that means i can look at adding these things and these things and these things and these things have separable and or associative grouping and then add it back together so and long story made short is i can separate by pluses and minuses i can separate my series into several different series by pluses and minuses i can move constants in front of factors in front of my series why because we know that you can factor out the same thing being multiplied in every single one of your terms addition and subtraction is factorable by multiplication so i can take multiplication and factor it in front of my series it is factorable because addition subtraction is factorable by multiplication so in other words i can break this down some really simple pieces that match up what we have here so we're going to do that we're going to say all right because addition subtraction is multiple way it's associative it's commutative i can move stuff around i can separate things it's also factorable by multiplication i'm going to start separating this i'm going to separate it first by addition and subtraction and then pull my factors out so i can consider one big series to be a sum of little series adding up different stuff and then adding together is the same thing as adding up all the stuff at once what we're trying to do our goal is to get the insides of every one of our series to look just like one of these things you'll notice that you have to keep the same starting spot and ending spot you'll also notice i'm not doing a whole lot of work in my head it's way too easy to start making little mistakes on this like for getting signs if you're getting fours or if you're if you want to be smart about it and go well i know i can separate that but i can pull the 4 out front that's true but sometimes we just lose the four and make a signed error so i never do it that's up to you whether you want to i prefer to write this stuff out so this series can be represented as one two three four different series because i have one two three four different terms and we can break that up and we can associate it group it by addition and subtraction so k cubed okay minus 4k squared got it plus 5k cool plus 7. you'll also notice that i'm keeping the subtraction and the addition that's fine we want to make sure that we we do understand what's going to happen later though that i'm subtracting whatever this gives us that is important now there's some more work that i have to do i need to make sure that insides of these four series separated by the four terms that i had match up with one of these formulas i've given you so we're gonna do that this is great k cubed is done we love that we're going to have a formula for that in just a minute in fact it's going to use the 12 that i referenced i'm going to be putting for this one term this one series i'm going to say this starts at 1. so what i wanted this has a k cubed that matches perfectly that's the sequence for that mini series mini series and then it ends at 12. 12 is going to get plugged in here and here and i'm going to square whatever i think it was 78 did that's it 7 8 squared is what that is going to be we're done with that one this one not so much so this one says i have very close to what that says but there's a four that four because at four man i hope you see it that 4 would be on every single term in the things that are being added it's factorable you could factor it out of every term right that means you could factor it and move it in front of that stuff that's being added it's factorable that means you can move that four up front hope you're also seeing why i'm not giving you lots of different examples this pretty much covers everything that you do except for one example which i'll show you in just a minute same thing here you could factor out a 5 from every one of those terms so we can move our 5 in front just like a factor does this k squared is what we're looking for this k is what i'm looking for and now the constant you can do one of two ways it doesn't matter to me which one you do you can leave it as this or you can write it of it as seven not seventy-one seven times one you could pull out the seven and leave the one either way and you just see if you do the same thing if you leave it as a seven you do twelve times seven that's what that says leave it as a seven a constant you would do n 12 times 7 no problem if you do it like this you say all right if i am adding up lots of ones how many ones am i adding 12 you're n you're 12. so you'd say here's 12 times 7. either way you're going to get 12 times 7 it doesn't really matter what matters is being able to separate this into our number of terms gives me number of series then making every one of those series look like something about formula 4 and then applying the formula correctly so the formulas are all based on your n where you end your n is where you end your series i know that sounds similar when i say it so our k cubed says there's a formula for that it's right there so i'm going to take my ending value my n i'm going to plug it in my ending value my n is 12. so i'm going to apply this formula and say that this part is 12 12 plus 1 over 2 squared this is exactly what that should be i should take my n plug it in appropriately and then we'll do the math a little later minus four times keep that four don't lose it remember that's being multiplied by whatever you get out of this the sum is represented in this expression we're about to write but four gets multiplied because that is the factor you factored out now because this is based on our k squared it says find your ending value your n here's our k squared here's our formula for k squared just plug in your n 12 12 and 12 our n is 12. a good question would be will you ever get fractions out of this nope they all work out to whole numbers so if you're getting a whole lot of fractions you're doing something wrong uh those fractions should simplify so we have a 12 12 plus 1 and 2 times 12 plus 1 that's coming from our n then we do our plus 5 so we have a plus we have a 5 and then we look at the formula for that series since it's based on k we're going to go all right we have an n of 12 i'm going to plug in 12 12 plus 1 over 2. lastly no matter what you do you'll get 7 times n which is 12 or 7 times 12. either way you're going to get 7 times 12 and we've already talked about why that is you're welcome to plug that in just like that on your calculator and get whatever it is that this equals you can also you're welcome to simplify this stuff however it seems best to you to do i'll simplify because i don't have a calculator handy i would do things like this i'd simplify all of my fractions because they all will so this is going to be 6 times 13 squared minus this would give us 2 times four is eight so four times two is eight thirteen twenty-five this is going to give us six that would be 30 5 times 6 is 30 times 13 plus 84. that's probably what i'd plug into my calculator i might double check it to make sure that i did everything right but i'm going to come back with this the answer here the sum in just a bit okay borrowing any little mistakes that i've made i could have i don't know i haven't really looked back at it yet but if i've made any mistakes then there should be small errors but if i haven't then that is the sum that you get by adding up the 12 terms of that sequence and that's exactly what you should get there you can try it i suppose if you really wanted to but that's what you should get so i hope it made it make sense as far as how to manipulate a series into something that's manageable by the formulas that i've given you i'm going to give you one more example about how to manipulate something that doesn't match this like what if you don't start one when you start like four i'll show you how to do that all right so what do you do when it doesn't match up with where you're supposed to start like if you start at k equals four and you're supposed to start k goes one is this gonna work no and don't try to make it work the way it is right now it will not work um so let's be smart about it what if it what if it was a one like could you make it work if it was a one if it was that it'd be fine we could say yeah okay i know that that matches perfectly this i know what the formula is i know i'm ending at 24. putting 24 24 plus 1 over 2 and then take that and square it you find the sum of the series very quick and easy the problem is is that this is not what this is so what is this compared to this let's think about what i don't want out of this i don't want the first term i don't want the second term and i don't want the third term in that series i do want the 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th and 10th so here's how we can think about it this series is the same thing as taking the whole series that that formula needs removing the first three terms i hope that you see what this does this says here's my whole series what don't i want here i don't want terms one two and three this is terms one two and three of that series so we can always always really do that if you don't start at one take the whole series and subtract off starting from one to all the stuff that you don't need so up to but not including that that beginning index that beginning term so hopefully that you can see that that actually does work um that should kind of make sense you just have to start at one in order for these these formulas to work otherwise you're going to start subtracting things and this is the way that we do it i want from 4 to 24 i want the whole thing but i don't want the first three terms that's the first three terms but i can work that out for you can easily do that on your own i just want to show you that's the process you're going through so i hope it made it make sense i hope now that see the sequences and series aren't a huge mystery to you hope that you can see they're very manageable we even have some formulas for series that really really help us so we're going to start talking about specific sequences and series over the next four videos we'll talk about arithmetic sequences then arithmetic series geometric sequences then geometric series and finally how to prove some of these formulas with proof by adduction so i'll see you for those videos and i hope you're doing well 

Transcript for: Arithmetic Sequences (Precalculus - College Algebra 69)
it's time for us to talk about some very very common different types of sequences and series that are very specific and useful later on in math we're going to talk about arithmetic sequences and then series geometric sequences and then series in the next four videos this video and three more so we're going to start with arithmetic sequences something that's very useful very common in fact you're going to see that we can we can talk about some sequences we've already defined in a different way and it's much much easier so here's what an arithmetic sequence does it's a sequence where the difference between any two sequential terms is constant now here's what it means in plain speed you're adding the same number over and over and over again so you're like adding three three three three you're adding that to every single term now what's it gonna take to do that you need to start with some number that's given and then you need to know what number you're adding over and over and over and over and over again well that number that you're you're adding it's called the common difference why is it called a common difference why are they defined that way because if you take any two terms that are right next to each other and you subtract them it's going to be the same number over and over again that is the number that you're adding to get from term to term let's take a look at one right now so if i went from 2 to 4 10 to 14 to 18 can you identify where we start what's the value of the very first term two you need to start somewhere with it with an arithmetic sequence you have to start somewhere like two and then you need to be able to tell what you're adding to get to the next term and it's got to be the same every term so take a look at this if i take any two sequential terms that's two and six or six and ten or ten and fourteen fourteen eighteen and subtract them six minus two is four ten minus six is four uh fourteen minus 10 is 4 and 18 minus 14 is 4. the number i'm adding over and over and over and over again is called the common difference and in this case it's 4. this is how arithmetic sequences work and how they're structured why are they called arithmetic sounds like arithmetic and arithmetic means adding it's exactly right so we emphasize the wrong syllable when we say arithmetic instead of arithmetic but it's the same idea you're just adding the same number over and over again in this case we start at two we're adding four you could find out any other term in here if you continue the sequence you know it's going to be 22 and 26 and 30 and blah blah blah blah blah blah you do this forever and ever now that's great and that defines a a sequence for us recursively which we've talked about briefly and i'll do it again right here when we talk about odd numbers and we'll define us a sequence recursively for us that's not quite what we're looking for we want to be able to find out any term that we want like i want to find the 100th term and not have to do a whole lot of work to it so here's how we can do that with arithmetic sequences they can always be written as a sub n equals a sub 1 what is that well that's the first term you do need a starting spot for arithmetic sequences to be structured appropriately and you know where you start so find your first term it should be like 2 or 1 that's that example and then n minus 1 times d now why n minus 1 times d if d is the common difference d is the what you're adding to get from term to term well what do i want to be able to do to get to my hundredth term now get this if i want to get to my hundredth term and i know i start at let's say two if i want to do my hundredth term and i start at two burns up one of the terms there are 99 terms to get to the 100th term so i would add 99 common differences not a hundred common differences i got 99 differences but the first term ain't one all right you've burned up that first term you've called it two you're going to add 99 common differences in this case four to get to that hundredth term so if they're always structured that way i hope that makes sense to you i hope you see like if this is the way that arithmetic sequences work your first term counts right that counts as one term how do you do the hundredth add 99 common differences to get to that hundredth if we want to write any arithmetic sequence and we can define it this way it's really easy to do all you need is the first term and the common difference that's 4 and then we can structure appropriately so our arithmetic sequence is structured as let's see a sub 1 that's my first term 2 plus n minus 1 y n minus 1 again n minus 1 is not the same thing as n because this is your first term it counts as something so if i'm going to add up a whole bunch of common differences how i get from term to term check it out how would i get to the third term third term i would add four how many times do i add it once then twice that's one less why is it one less because this counted as one of your terms you didn't add four to get here you you start in a two that counts as one of your terms therefore it takes one away from whatever index you want to end at that's what happens now that's it i mean that is arithmetic it really is that easy identify where you start identify what you're adding or the common difference take two terms subtract them identify that it actually does work here so four four four four four it's going to be added four um and then simplify it because this distributes gives you 4 n minus 4 we would get 4 n minus 2. this will give you the terms of this sequence which is very nice if i want to find the hundredth term right now i wouldn't have to do a 100 i would have to do what is that 90 95 more terms i would just plug in 100. the hundredth term is 4 times 100 minus two that's going to be let's see 400 minus 398. the hundredth term in this sequence is 398. now get this please please do not confuse us with series these are not series we have not added this up we will talk about how to do that but this is not it okay this is just the 398th term it's not adding up the first hundred terms that would have to need summation notation this is not what we're doing or to show that this is a sum somehow this is just the hundredth term here and if you want to write this out you can do it you could do add four a whole bunch of times and you would eventually get to 398. i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing the idea of you're taking four and you're adding it over and over again but if you want to end at the let's say 100 term you need to add 99 fours not a 100 because that counts as your first term there's 99 more to go that's what's going on now do you have to simplify from here to here you really should you should also look at the fact that this common difference becomes not a slope although it is linear it's going to increase the same rate but your coefficient of your your nth your index i would say so that is where your common difference can be found also which is kind of fascinating and not too bad there's really not much more i can explain about this beside identify your first term your common difference and you can simplify what you get out of that let's look at the next one if you remember from our sequence video we defined odd numbers 1 3 5 7 9 as a sequence we did it two different ways the first way we did it was we made 13579 as terms we related it and got that the terms of our sequence should be given by 2n minus 1. just like this if i wanted to find the third term i should be able to plug in 3. well 4 times 3 is 12 minus 2 is 10. that should be its work this also works if i want to find the fifth term i plug in 5 two times five is ten minus one is nine that actually does work but it took us a lot of effort to actually get there if you remember if we know that this is an arithmetic sequence this is a lot easier so i i don't know if you remember that from our sequence video but it took us some time it was kind of a headache because we had to relate it back to even numbers and subtract one if we if we can if we understand this is arithmetic sequence we understand that oh look at this my first term is one i'm adding the same number over and over and over again one plus two plus two plus two plus two or take any two numbers and subtract three minus one is two five minus three is two seven minus five is two now my 7 is 2. that's a common difference i'm adding 2 over and over and over well if we have a first term and we can identify a common difference it is arithmetic we get first term plus n minus one times common difference common difference here is two that is a whole lot less work than what we did with sequences so if we can identify if we can identify that something is a specific type of sequence or series it becomes a lot more predictable we have a lot more formulas for it becomes easier so that's a very important concept to understand is we want to try to classify stuff when you get into calculus 2 you're going to try to classify this as what type of test is going to show me convergence or divergence of this particular series and then we can use that on stuff like well we can use that it's really important that we're able to identify stuff if we can identify arithmetic look how much work it saves us way more work than how we did that with sequences the other thing that we did and i want to refresh it because i didn't really go over it very much but the other thing we did is we defined stuff recursively so can you take and define recursively what recursively means is based on the previous term so for instance if i can define my first term as one can i say what my second term is my second term would be my first term plus 2 my third term so notice that my second term is my first term plus two my third term would be my second term plus two my third term is my second term plus two we can deal with recursive formulas by basing them on previous terms you would just need to know what your starting point is and then a formula to get your next term that's what recursive means it's very similar actually to this except that it doesn't wrap everything up in a nice little package it says in order to find your 100th term you would have to know your 99th you'd have to know all the terms before it that's what recursive does so this is a way to define a recursive formula you basically get a first term and how you find your next term notice that it does work this says start at one i have one what's your next term okay if i wanted to find a sub two i would look at a sub one plus two since a sub one is one that would give me three what if i wanted to find a sub three or how about a sub five maybe if i want to find a sub five i would need to know the fourth term because it says take a look at your previous term and then add one my fourth term was seven seven plus two gives my fifth term of nine that's how recursion works it's looking at the previous terms and doing some manipulation to get that next term so hopefully that makes a little bit of sense as far as a recursive formula goes i just wanted to illustrate it here you do deal with it occasionally so what we're going to do now is we're going to um we're going to come back with one example about kind of a manipulation what if you're given a couple terms can you figure out a formula from it so we'll talk about that okay last example very very common one you see this a lot a lot of homework a lot of tests a lot of people like to ask this question so if you have an arithmetic sequence they're giving you two terms can you find out the formula and then use that formula of course to find out any determinants you want yeah yeah of course otherwise you wouldn't be doing this before i've said nope then we're done video ends that'd be kind of funny i would do that someday but yeah of course we can do this i'm going to show you exactly how to do that one thing to notice here is that if eighth term is 75 and the 20th term is 39 can you have an arithmetic sequence that is decreasing sure you're just adding a negative number that would be subtracting your common difference would be negative and in this case we're going to get that here's the idea behind doing this if you have two terms that are given then what we're going to do is we're going to create a system of equations based on those two terms we're going to write out what those terms are use the things that are missing which is the first term and the common difference you don't know what the first term is here you don't know the common differences here if you did you won't have to do this problem be kind of nice but we don't know those two things that's two unknowns we need two terms to create two equations to solve our two unknowns that's how systems of equations work we're just starting to delve into that right now we'll deal much more with systems of equations after we we do trigonometry so here's what we know we know that the eighth term that's a sub eight we know that the eighth term is 75 eighth term equals 75. well let's do two things with that let's fill out as much of this as we can now we don't know the first term but we do know that n is eight now we don't know d but we do know that the eighth term this represents the eighth term is seventy-five this is one equation with two unknowns that represents half of our system the other thing we don't we know that the 20th term is 39. now we still don't know the first term but we do know that the 20th term would have an n of 20. we still don't know the common difference but we do know that this represents the 20th term and it's equal to 39. i hope that you see the utility in knowing how to solve a system of equations this is one equation with two unknowns another equation of the same two unknowns we can use the two equations to solve for the two unknowns this just helped us set up so what we're going to do is we're going to take a look at this part of it just this and treat that like our system so we're going to simplify a little bit so a sub one plus eight or seven d that's eight minus one d that's seven uh 20 minus one's nineteen and then we're going to find some opposite terms that's how solving systems works is you find some opposite terms when you have two variables and and two equations these would be pretty hard to get to the opposite terms these are pretty easy so choose one of them and multiply by negative one thereby getting opposite terms i'm going to choose a top one because i feel like it's really convenient isn't it then since both all both of these formulas are always going to have a sub 1 you just multiply one of them by negative 1 and you automatically opposite terms so that does change the sign of everything though so negative a sub 1 minus 70 minus 74 negative 75 now we can add that system a sub negative a sub 1 plus a sub 1 is 0 minus 7 d plus 19 d is 12 d and negative 75 plus 39 36 negative 36. so when we divide negative 36 divided by 12 is negative 3. it's okay to have a negative common difference it just means that you are subtracting three and if you did this if you started with 75 and you subtracted 3 12 times you're going to get 39. now just like every other system of equations ever you can solve for one variable but you have to plug it in somewhere to solve for the other one so we've just found the common difference we know it's negative 3 but we need a starting term an a sub 1 to figure out what our formula is and then we're going to use this to plug in and this will be very simple but we need to find that a sub 1. so use either one of these i'm going to use this top equation i'm going to plug in negative 3 because i don't want to multiply 19 times negative 3 and then i'm going to subtract it from 75. so 7 times negative 3 is negative 21. if i add that to both sides we get positive 96. that should make sense if i'm subtracting 3 then my first term should be more than that because i'm subtracting three seven times in order to get there so our first term is 96 by the time we get to our eighth term we'll subtracted three seven times not eight times that's our starting term it takes up one of those terms i'd subtract seven times negative three to get to uh to our eighth term and we would get 75 out of that so now we're going to take this information we have our first term we have our d we now can fill out that formula so our sequence is our first term plus n minus 1 times our common difference of negative 3 which we've already found let's go ahead and distribute so distributing that's minus three n plus three writing this a little bit differently you can leave it like this is totally fine negative 3n plus 99 this is probably more appropriate it doesn't matter which one but let's check a couple of these let's make sure this actually works let's plug in 8. if we plugged in 8 that's negative 24 99 minus 24 this is probably easier to see 99 minus 24 that's going to be let's see 75 oh hey that works this one's also going to work if i plug in 20. so plugging in 20 here 3 times 20 60 99 minus 60 is 39. that works now can we just find a 12 term yeah easily all we have to do is plug in 12. either one will do it plug in 12 here you're still going to get 36 or negative 36. so 99 minus 36 99 minus 36 is 63. that's a bit easier than subtracting three another four times from 75 but if you did it if you subtracted three four times that's subtracting 12 you would get let's see minus 12 that'd be 63 and that's exactly what we get there so either way you want to go but this is definitely easier if you don't have something very close to a term that's given i hope it made any sense i hope you see the utility and having the system of equations it's not all that bad but you do need to know how to structure it otherwise it can be very confusing or start create for yourself a system and then we can find the starting term a sub one common difference d and put it back together simplify just a little bit and then you're done so hopefully i've made arithmetic sequences make sense to you next we'll talk about arithmetic series and then we'll move on to geometric sequences and series have a great day you 

Transcript for: Arithmetic Series (Precalculus - College Algebra 70)
hey there i think i might be going for record for conciseness on how concise i'm going to try to make this video it's not going to be long-winded could be very to the point about arithmetic series i'm going to give you a very straightforward approach to finding the sum it's a partial sum not an infinite sum of an arithmetic series i'll do one very quick example that'll make perfect sense i'm going to do another example that makes sense and i'm going to blow your mind on this example and relate it back to some of the formulas you're like what that's cool you should be like what that's cool because it is cool so arithmetic series what they mean we just talked about arithmetic sequences about how they're these list of numbers that are adding the same number over and over again well if you're adding the same number over over again and i add up all your terms there should be a very very predictable way to add a certain number or finite number of terms of that series that should make sense to us if we're adding the same number over and over again and we know where we start we should be able to find the sum very nicely so here's what this means if you have some sort of arithmetic series so notice the series adds up terms a sub 1 a sub 2 all the way to a sub n this would be what the series looks like notice something about it please get this this is an arithmetic sequence this is the sum of an arithmetic sequence hence an arithmetic series you start at one you need to know where you end so here's what this says to you and basically most of the time i just show from here to here here's how you find in general speaking the sum of an arithmetic series you need to know your first term you need to know your last term and you need to know how many terms you have is this hard to find no this is your first term that's your last term count up how many they are and then put those numbers here so if your first term is 60 and your last term is 120 and you know there's 16 terms which we don't know that yet but we will then you put 60 120 16 and you do the math on it is it hard to find if you have a formula like this no it's not because all you would do is you plug in one that's your first term plug in one to whatever your sequence is that goes here plug in wherever you end let's say that it's 16. so whatever your sequence is that goes there and then you plug in your n itself here it's very easy i'll show you that in this example so what if we wanted to add this but we didn't actually want to list out all the terms because there's 16 of them we only have five listed we missing 11 terms i want to do that let's try to build our sequence so our sequence says all right do you know your first term yeah do you know your last term yeah do you know your common difference i know if i subtract any two terms i get four can i create a sequence from that yeah of course of course we can we can create an arithmetic sequence from that we know arithmetic sequence is our first term n minus 1 times common difference so that would be our 60 plus n minus 1 times 4. well let's simplify that a sub n is 60 minus sorry plus 4 n minus 4 or 4 n plus 56 4 n plus 56. now there is a little issue that we don't know what our final term well we know our products versus 120. but we don't know what term that is this is how you can solve this if you understand that a sub n is 120 we can solve for n if we plug in a sub n hey that is a sub n if we plug in a sub n as 120 this will solve for what term this 120 actually is it has to so if i subtract 56 from that then 64 equals 4n if i divide both sides by 4 it says n is 16. we have found our first term founder common difference and created the arithmetic sequence upon which the series is based then we said all right well we know the last term we know less terms 120 we just don't know what term it is instead of sitting here and adding 4 until we get to 120 we go all right well i know the last term is 120 let's just plug in 120 and figure out what term that has to be plug in 120 subtract 56 divided by 4 we know that a sub 16 is 120 we know that that is the 16th term of this particular series now i'm going to go a little further you could be done right now you would hopefully understand that all you need to know to add this up is the first term we have it the last term we have it and what term that is it's the 16th term so what we're going to end up getting is 16 over 2 60 and 120 and we're going to add that very quickly however i'm going to show you what this would do too okay so if we understand that this is a an arithmetic series then this is the sequence upon which this series is built if you want to write this in series notation which sometimes you're required to do then we would start at one we'd have our sequence notice i'm switching to k i have to switch for k we've talked about why in previous videos but you can't start with n plug in some ends and end at n that doesn't make any sense you start with something different than n and end with whatever term you just found i need you to recognize that this is this thing if i were to take this sequence and put it in a series start at 1 and end at 16 this is exactly what i'm going to get and this is exactly what this would look like once you've found your sequence it's doing the same stuff actually we could prove it plug in one here if you plug in one you get four times one plus 56 that's 60. plug in two that would be eight plus 56 that's 64 and then 68 and plug in 16 you would get 120. so in either way you go find your first term find your last term a sub 1 a sub last that's 16 and then plug in n 16. so if we wanted to do it either way here's the way from kind of a logical standpoint and here's the way from our series i'll do the series first if you are just giving this you can verify its arithmetic series then here's what you do what you can do is you can take your first term plug in 1 that would be 60. plug in your last term a sub n plug in 16. that'd be 120 take whatever that n is and divide by two this will give you the sum of this series now as soon as you found this 16 you could have done it up here so if you wanted to make it even quicker take your first term take your last term take your once you found out that there's 16 total terms and divide by two we have the same math now once we figure that out that would be 8 times 180 1440 which is the sum of those 16 terms i hope it made that make sense to you i hope that you can see the creation of the sequence utilizing that to figure out how many terms are in the sequence and then using the formula that i gave you here as far as the the sum is concerned now what i will tell you is that this is provable by some stuff that we've already done and i'm going to show that to you right now oh man okay i'll believe my twice in this video if you look at this and you see right here can you recognize that this could be separated into a series of 4k plus a series of 56 the four could be moved out front and you have a series with just k in it do you remember that that was n times n minus 1 over 2 because that's exactly where this is coming from and i'll show you that in this example so what happens if you don't have an ending value what happens if you have this this series that goes from 2 plus four plus six all the way to two n but you don't know exactly what your n is then then you would do this you'd say all right what's my first term my first term is 2 my last term is 2n how many terms do i have n n terms not two n terms you have n terms now can we simplify that well sure sure if we distribute actually you know what i would do different i'm going to factor out the 2. i'm doing this on purpose so you see something if i factor out the 2 i get 1 plus n my two simplify i get n times n plus one now i told you i was going to blow your mind here it is firstly i hope that i made this make sense to you hopefully you can see if that's a series that's my first term my last term and you have n terms here since you don't know what n is there are n terms here just keep your n and then divide factor out that and simplify now here's the here's the cool part could we represent this as a sequence in some sort of series well i see 2 as my starting term i see 2 as my common difference i know that my sequence could be represented as 2 plus n minus 1 times 2. if i simplify i get simply 2 n just 2n now this is pretty cool if we write this as an actual series we would get the series of whatever the sequence is you write as a k but this is the sequence upon which that series is built you can see it right here if you start at one you'd have two times one that's two then put put in two two times two is four plug in three two times three is six put in n put in n that's your ending term that's what that is put an n two times n is two n that's why that's an ending term that's why you don't put 2n there it is the nth term it's just you're multiplying it by 2. now watch we did some formula work with some series a little while ago we know we can pull out constants we know there's a formula for this there's a formula for having k inside of our series it's a funny k if we go from 1 to n of k we know that that k is found by n n plus one over two now this would all be multiplied by two so here's our two here's our formula the twos cancel out and show you that this is exactly what we got right there all that formula stuff actually works if we can find a sequence for whatever we are dealing with hopefully it's fascinating to you hopefully you're seeing that that's where this stems from it stems from the idea that you can always break that down check it out this is a constant you could write this as a different series this is a k that relates to here you could write this somehow after factoring out a d you could write this as a series of k that's going to give you n times n n plus one over two that's exactly what we've done it simplifies gives us the same result that is the sum of that particular series which is the sum of even numbers this right there n times n plus one is the sum of any n even numbers so if you want to find out the first 20 even numbers and add them all up well you could just plug in 20 and that would add the even numbers 20 times 21 uh 420 i think if i did my math right okay one more thing so what if you're like yeah that makes sense or if you're like okay i can see your formula work but what if you also think what about that one does that still work that's clearly an arithmetic sequence we have talked about why we actually found that this is therefore an arithmetic series and the sum of an arithmetic series should be able to be found like this can it still work can we still take n over 2 our first term so plug in one that would be two our last term plug in n that would be plus two n and we can see that it does it gives us exactly the same thing as that right there so either way you go on any of this stuff you have to end up with the same sum of n times n plus 1 the sum of even numbers so anyhow that's the sum of even numbers i hope it made it make sense a couple connections there at the very end kind of fun you need to at least be able to do this to be able to find um a arithmetic series find the sequence make the series and find the sum of that thing so we'll see you next time for geometric sequences and a geometric series 

Transcript for: Geometric Sequences (Precalculus - College Algebra 71)
welcome to another video now that we have talked about arithmetic sequences and arithmetic series it's time to jump on to another very very common sequence and series called a geometric sequence and from there we're going to talk about geometric series when we add up the terms of that geometric sequence on which it's based so we'll talk about what exactly a geometric sequence means how it's built how to figure them out uh from one term or maybe two terms um deal with what the the the the sequence should look like formulaically and then next video we'll talk about the series how to add those terms up there's some really interesting formulas that we get we'll talk about something called convergence and Divergence of a series that's about it so what a geometric sequence is it's actually quite similar to an arithmetic sequence except that where when you had an arithmetic sequence what you did to get from term to term is you added you added the same number over and over and over and over and over again term by term by term and term by term you added the same thing over and over again and therefore you had what was called a common difference which meant if you took two successive terms and you subtracted them you're going to do the same thing over and over and over again that was what number you're adding well we have something similar except instead of adding the same number over and over and over again we're multiplying so geometric sequences and series are built on the idea of taking some starting number and multiplying to get to the next term and the next term by the same number over and over and over now that number that you're multiplying by is is called the common ratio and the idea goes back to an arithmetic sequence and says all right arithmetic sequence if I took two terms and I subtracted that's going to give me the number that I'm actually adding well if I take two terms here and I divide them the second term by the first term or the third term by the second term or the fourth term by the third term and I divide them it will give me the number that I'm actually multiplying to get to term to term to term to term so what we need to know is very similar to arithmetic you need to know where you start you need to know what number you are multiplying to get to the next term and every subsequent term after that that number that you're multiplying is called the common ratio because when you divide two successive terms it's going to give you the same fraction every time now sometimes we get a whole number but it still is a fraction common same ratio fraction I hope you're seeing the similarity between this and arithmetic sequences they're built the same way except instead of adding over and over we are multiplying over and over and over you still need to know a starting spot and that's what all this says so it's a sequence or the ratio between any two successive terms is constant called the common ratio so what we're going to do we're going to take a look at these examples we're going to figure out which ones are arithmetic which ones are geometric and which ones are neither um sometimes you have a sequence that has a definite pattern but you don't exactly know well you maybe do know what it is but you don't have the ability to call it arithmetic or geometric because it doesn't fit that that model and so let's take a look at these when we take a look at something like this 2 -6 1854 162 if we're trying to classify this maybe we try to figure out if it's arithmetic first arithmetic means that you're adding the same number over and over again how you can always determine if you have an arithmetic sequence is take two terms and subtract them this minus this so -6 - 2 is8 okay take these two terms 18 -6 is not8 that's 24 well if you don't get the same common difference then you're not adding the same number over and over again obviously we're not doing that if I had to add from 2 to -6 well that would be8 and then -68 I'd have I'd have to add 24 well that's definitely not a common difference this is not arithmetic let's see if this one's arithmetic from 2 to 9 I'm adding let's see seven from 9 to 16 I'm adding 7 from 60 16 to 23 I'm adding 7 from 23 to 30 I'm adding 7 this is arithmetic this would be a sequence like we dealt with two videos ago this is an arithmetic sequence because the common difference if I were to subtract two successive terms 9 - 2 7 16 - 9 7 23 - 16 7 30 - 23 7 do you see how taking two terms and subtracting them is giving me the number I'm adding over and over and over again this would be arithmetic with a common difference of seven it's not geometric because I'm adding to get from term to term to term let's go back to this one for a second now since it's not arithmetic maybe we think about it being geometric can I multiply to get from here to here to here to here to here we can think of it one of two ways sure you could think what do I multiply by to get from 2 to -6 uh that be-3 can I keep doing that 6 -6 * -3 well that would be POS 18 * is a positive 18 * -3 well that's 54 * -3 that's 162 that is what's happening this is definitely a geometric sequence but you can also think about it this way if you take any two successive terms and divide them so -6 / pos2 or 18 ID -6 or-54 / 18 or 162 /54 in each case we get get the same number the number that you get by dividing is the same that common ratio is the same number that you are actually multiplying to get from term to term to term so this is definitely geometric because we have the same exact ratio between any two successive terms meaning you are multiplying by the same number over and over and over and over and over again to get term by term by term the next term could be found by multiplying by another neg3 and another neg3 and another neg3 this is geometric with a common ratio of -3 the common ratio is called R so when we hear that word that common ratio common difference was D it was a d because it was a difference and it's a term we're actually adding from term to term to term the common ratio is called R for ratio and it stands for the number you're multiplying in a geometric sequence from term to term to term in our case it's just3 that's really the difference between arithmetic and a geometric arithmetic you're just adding whatever number you're adding over and over and over again that's D that's your common difference um geometric you're just multiplying so whatever number you're multiplying by over and over and over and over again to get that sequence that's your common ratio that's R you of course can find them by subtracting two successive terms and it's the same for all of them you arithmetic sequence or dividing two successive terms it's the same for all of them every pair you have a geometric sequence now how the next one so 1 2 4 7 11 16 well we can try let's try geometric first in order to get from 1 to 2 I would multiply by two that's great in order to get from two to four oh I'd multiply by two that that's also great maybe this is geometric in order to get from four to seven I'd multiply by two no so even though the first two terms if I were to divide them 2 / 1 is 2 and 4 / 2 is 2 but 7 / 4 is not 2 and in order for this to be called a certain type of sequence you can't say like oh it's geometric for a little while and then athetic for a little while and then I don't know for a little while doesn't really work um so it has to maintain the same exact pattern if you're going to call it one of these things so this common ratio would be well the a ratio would be two and two and then not two this fails to be geometric because I'm not multiplying by the same number to get from term to term to term I'm not actually multiplying at all do it from term to term to term it looks like it may betimes 2 * two time but that right there starts failing it this is not geometric so maybe we try arithmetic and all right well let's try to add so if I was adding from here to here I would add one from here to here I would add two that already fails because a common difference for arithmetics says I should be able to take 2 - 1 and 4 - 2 and 7 - 4 and get the same thing that's what a common difference would do for arithmetic that was the last video 2 - 1 is 1 4 - 2 is 2 7 - 4 is three well wait a minute that's not common that's not the same number being added to go from term to term to term in fact there is a pattern here but it's not geometric it's not arithmetic we've taken geometric off the board this proves it's not arithmetic the pattern is you'd add one then two then three then four then five then six probably you're going to add seven next it would be 29 then eight then nine then 10 you're just adding successive integers on that U we could certainly find a a sequence for that but it's not something that we're actually studying by name here so that's the way we go ahead and determine whether or not something's geometric or arithmetic or neither you just try them just see if you're multiplying the same number divide two successive terms just do it for all the pairs um see if you're arithmetic by adding the same number just subtract successive terms see the same um or if you get this this would be neither arithmetic nor geometric the next one is is a little bit easier than what we've done so far hopefully you can look at this and just say well um I'm fairly certain I know what that's going to be because we have the starting spot of seven now think how you get to 14 and think how from 14 to 28 28 to 56 are you adding the same number every time 7 + 7 gives us 14 + 7 is not 28 so it's not arithmetic let thing geometric 7 time what gives us 14 * 2 14 * 2 gives us oh 28 28 * 2 gives us 56 if I were to divide this uh it's Pair by pair 14 divided 7 is 2 28 divided 14 is 2 56 divided 28 is 2 our common ratio for this geometric sequence is two now what's kind of interesting is that much like arithmetic sequences did a geometric sequence has this this very uh repeatable pattern and so repeatable you can has a formula so there is a a model for every geometric sequence all we need to know is what the first term is and what our common ratio is now just like we did arithmetic sequences I really want you to see why there's an N minus one here so think about this if you burn up one term by starting somewhere a sub one then how do you get to your 100th term well if this is where you start and this is how many times you have to multiply to get to whatever term you want then let's say I wanted to get to the 100th term if I want to get to the 100th term I start somewhere that's one term I would need to multiply by 99 RS to get to the 100th term I'm going say that one more time in just a slightly different way by taking up one value by a starting number in order to get to whatever term you need it's one less uh one less iteration of multiplication than the index than the index you're trying to find so so again for the 100th term I'm using one as my starting term and I need to multiply once to get the second term twice to do the third term 99 times you the 100th term this is losing one of those NE it's it's taking away one um necessary multiplication because you're starting with one of those terms so we would say all right if I know that my common ratio is two and my starting value is seven then I can easily write this in terms of a geometric sequence I can say that this sequence is take your starting value you don't necessarily need parentheses but you're going to see it a lot especially with fractions take your common ratio that's the number you're multiplying over and over and over again to the N minus one do not multiply that and give me 14 please break an order operations you can't do it now does it work if I wanted to find the third term check this out if I want to find the third term is 28 if I want to find a sub3 think about what that would mean a sub3 says I would take seven as my starting term how many times would you have to multiply by two to get your third term well if this is my starting term that counts as one I'd multiply by two once for 14 and twice for 28 not three times that's why there's a minus one right there and this would actually work uh 3 - 1 is 2 2 the 2 power is 4 and 7 * 4 would be 28 I hope I'm making that make sense to you that you're you're only having to multiply by one less iteration of that common ratio than the term you actually want to find so now we can find any term though so if I actually you find like the 10th term man this is really nice because you wouldn't have to continue this pattern say multiply by two two two and then like four more twos or five more twos you wouldn't have to do that all you'd say if you wanted to find the 10th term we know where we're starting seven and if we're starting at seven we would have to multiply by two nine times to get to the 10th term this takes up the first term I need nine iterations of multiplication repetitions order to get to the 10th term so that would be 7 * 2 9th so we figure out 2 the 9th and then multiply by seven whatever that is that is your 10th term and you can do this with any term that you want to with the geometric sequence very similar idea to arithmetic we're just multiplying over and over again let's go back to this geometric sequence and see if we can write that one so in order to write any geometric sequence we need to know where we start and what our common ratio is we already found our common ratio but if we know where we start if we take a look at that and understand that our starting value our first term is two then our geometric sequence can be modeled by our starting number times our common ratio to one less than the N term so n minus one and this actually does work if I want to find the 1 2 3 four fifth term I'd start at two I would need to multiply by -3 let's see 1 2 3 four times let's see if that works plug in your five start at -2 that counts as one 5 - 1 is 4-3 4 power is postive 81 81 * 2 is 162 it works just fine this works very well so let's go ahead we're going to do uh three more examples these two and then one more where I give you two terms I'll show you a special way to deal with that and then uh then we're done this is all we have to deal with in geometric sequences then we'll add them up in our Series so if you were to look at that how do we know when something is geometric well we can always divide two successive terms or think about what number I'm multiplying over and over again so how do I get from -3 to 1 now that might be kind of tricky to think of multiplication sometimes it really does benefit us to just divide all of our successive terms and see if it works out at the same Comm ratio so if I take one divided by three notice is always that way it's always the second term divided by the first or the third term divided by the second the next term divided by your current term so this one divided by that one 1 /3 or- 1/3 / 1 or 1 9th / 1/3 1 / -3 well that's 13- 13 ID 1 well something divid 1 gives you back that something that's- 13 that's looking pretty good this one we probably want to verify maybe multiply by nine as an LCD 1 9th * 9 is 1 - 1/3 * 9 is -3 and we get -3 1/3 for every single time we comp comp two successive terms that is a common ratio so that's the reason why we do in this order um we want to make sure that when we divide we're actually getting the common ratio we don't want to divide -3 by one to get -3 because that would make us assume that R is3 it's not if we divide in the order I've just told you take the second divide by the 1 the third divide by the second the fourth divide by the third it'll always give you out your common ratio and you don't have to change it our common ratio is 13 with our first term of -3 we can easily go ahead and model this with a geometric sequence we know it's geometric because it gives us a starting spot and it gives us the same exact multiplication term by term of 1/3 so our geometric sequence says you'd start at -3 you'd have -3 to the nus1 and that's perfectly appropriate there are a couple ways you can manipulate that um but this is just fine for most of our cases so starting number3 that's what this says right here and then your common ratio 1/3 we figured that out to the N minus one again remember that what this says is this takes up your starting position your first term therefore you need one less multiplication than the term you're trying to reach now what happens when they give you U some term uh but not the starting one but they do give you the common ratio can you figure out an arithmetic sequence from that it's actually not that hard to do we just need to remember what this says so this says any term that you want is modeled by that sequence well let's plug in the things we know what do we know we know that the sixth term is 243 so if I put 243 for my term that I know I know that's 243 while I don't know my first term I do know my common ratio and I also know that 243 is the sixth term so my n has to be six so my term that I know is 243 and that represents the sixth term in that sequence so let's just fill out the formula after that you should be able to see that this is pretty nice to solve for it's not all that bad so this is 243 = a sub 1 -3 to the 5th power is - 243 and if you divide both sides by - 243 you're going to get a sub1 is1 now this allows you to plug this into this formula so we now know the general formula for that sequence we know the first term is1 you generally would want to write the negative 1 but I'm showing that to you here you know your common ratio and that would be the form of our of our sequence we have our first term and our common ratio to the N minus one power that's about all there really is to it you're just trying to figure out from your sequence what your com what your first term is you need that and then you need to know what your common ratio is from here on all these examples you should very very easily be able to find whatever term you want if you want to find the 50th term you just plug in 50 or find the 50th term here plug in uh plug in 50 wherever right here wherever that that says to do so find the seventh term whatever we're just plugging in n and then using that formula to find the specific term of the sequence so I'm going to come back with one more and then we'll move on to our series let's try one more so what happens when they say you have a geometric sequence but they don't give you the common ratio and you really can't find it easily we got to set up something from our our our formula for it and then use not really a system but some way to set these things equal to find our first term and to find our common ratio so I'm going to show you one way to do this there are other ways to do it I'm just showing you one so if you know this is geometric and it says I want you to find the formula for it let's start using this and fill it as much as we can from the information we're provided so if we know that our nth term is a sub1 r to nus1 and we know an n a term like a third term and we know the value of it well we can set that up so we know that 1/3 is I don't know the first term I don't know the common ratio but I know that's going to be a three so 1/3 is our term I don't know my first term I don't know my common ratio but I know this would represent the third term and we'd have to multiply two iterations of that common ratio to achieve 1/3 I also the same or something very similar here I know that the sixth term equals 81 now I know I still know the first term I still know the common ratio but what we do have here is the ability to set parts of this equal and so here's what I'm going to do what I'm going to do is I'm going to solve this solve both of these for a sub one and set them equal to one another we can also solve for one and set them equal and divide by a sub one but uh some it looks a little funny and it feels like you're divided by variable you're not because it's a constant but I like this a little bit better it doesn't really matter which is why I said there's multiple ways to do this um but I'm going to solve this for a sub one so if we do if we divide by R 2 and we divide by R 5 multiple ways you can solve for for this by dividing by different things um but if you have this and that's the first term and this and that's the first term then if you've solved for something you know has to be equal you can set these two things equal to one another now it might look a little funny but think about this this is a proportion and you can cross multiply and set equals so 3 R 2 * 1 or 1 * a81 R to the 5th or realize that 1 over some variable equals 1 over some other variable these two variables have to be equal anyway you go you're going to get 3 R squ = 81 R 5 now what we generally don't want to do with variables we generally don't like to divide both sides by a variable because it could equal zero now our common ratio can't equal zero it's impossible it's it's a constant um it's not zero because otherwise you would get zero every single time that's not going to happen so we are perfectly okay dividing both sides by 3 R 2 all right so 1 = 27r 3 power well wait a minute can you isolate that power three yeah sure let's divide by 27 and when we take a cube root we're going to get 1/3 and that shows us what our common ratio is from here you have to go back and solve for your your first term this is why I like writing it like this it's it's already solved for you we just have to plug in 1/3 here so if we do be careful on your fractions but if you plug in 1/3 1 13 2 is 1 9th so I'm using just like kind of a substitution or system of equations Works many times I'm using this as solve for a sub 1 it's Sol for my first term I'm plugging in my R because now I Know It r^ 2 is 1 9th 3 * 1 9th is 13 so 1 nth 3 * 1 n is 1/3 and 1 / 1/3 is 3 so we now know our common ratio we now know our first term and this is pretty easy to be able to um to write this as as our our geometric sequence so we'd say our geometric sequence is our first term that's three times our common ratio that's 1/3 to the N minus one now there are some things we can do to manipulate this uh I'm I'm not going to do it um uh you know what yeah I'm going to do it it just it gets a little bit confusing for a lot of students um however sometimes you're going to see this in the back of your text go how in the world we get n minus 2 where' that come from here's where it comes from if you see a a number here and a b kind of like a base here that you could somehow make the same you can combine these via multiplication and addition of exponents so here's what I mean if you can make this somehow into that common ratio like 1 / three three so instead of 3 to the first Power think about a negative exponent you could write this as 1/3 to the 1 power in your head right now that has to be the same thing as three 1/3 to the ne 1 reciprocate and change the sign is three but you have it multiplied what do you do when you multiply common bases you add the exponents so you could combine these get the same base you have the same base and add your exponents -1 plus and minus one is not n it's n minus 2 and you'll see some of that fancy stuff where sometimes they won't show you this they show you that and you go but I got that it is the same this is usually just fine but sometimes you will see that and I wanted to mention that to you it is more concise right it is a little bit nicer to work with but that's where that's coming from so I hope that you learned in this lesson what a geometric sequence is um that it's similar to arithmetic but instead of adding or multiplying you can always find a common ratio by dividing all of your successive terms just make sure they're the same you don't want to stop after two and assume you're right you really want to check um the formula is really easy just have your first term have your common ratio to n minus one the N minus one is there because we need one less iterational multiplication to get the term that we want considering that our first term is taken up by a sub one um after that I've given you as many examples I could find or come up with about how to create a geometric sequence just from either some sequences themselves or knowing one term or several terms um after that I've shown you a way to take and make more concise some of these geometric sequences when they have a a first term that can be written as your common ratio usually it's with a negative exponent usually it subtracts here somehow it can be positive exponents just usually not um and then you get that m - 2 so I hope it makes sense what we're going to do now is come back with a geometric series and learn how to add these sequences up 

Transcript for: Geometric Series (Precalculus - College Algebra 72)
welcome to another video with what we know about geometric sequences we're going to now learn geometric series so what a series does if you don't remember a series takes the terms of a sequence and adds them up so a geometric series says take your geometric sequence it's built on a geometric sequence you should be very familiar with that yes we're using k to match our series we've already talked about series but all we're doing is saying this is a geometric sequence this adds the terms from the first one to the one i tell you stop of that particular geometric sequence so geometric sequence series adds it up there's actually a formula for how to add that so here's what the formula says for a geometric series if you can identify your first term now i'm saying that very specifically because this will still work if you think about that as a first term it'll still work even if that's not k minus one i'm gonna show you right here in this example that i'm covering up i want to show you that so you take your first term divided by 1 minus r and multiply times 1 minus r to the n whatever that n is also you might notice at this point that most textbooks show this differently most textbooks have a sub 1 and then this divided by that i'm not doing that i'm doing not doing it for a very specific reason that you're going to see when we get the infinite series in the last half of this video so we'll talk about infinite series what do you mean can we add up the terms of a series forever and get something out wildly the answer is sometimes not all the time but if our common ratio is between a certain two numbers negative one one the answer is yes it converges it will add up to a certain value it's very fascinating um you're all very smart and you've made this far you're going to be just fine some of your brains are going to hurt a little bit because we're going to talk about taking a value to infinity and sometimes it hurts our heads when we talk about infinity so much so i'm going to i'm going to teach that to you but this is gonna be much better for that so what we're learning is we're taking a geometric sequence it has a common ratio and a starting value we're adding the terms up and this is the formula for how to do that so what we're going to do is we're going to take that series this is a geometric sequence maybe you can see it and we're going to add up the terms well now what we get out of that when we add it up is called a partial sum why partial well because you're adding for the first n terms you're not adding to infinity and therefore we consider that a partial sum so let's take a look at this example um now firstly how do we determine whether something is geometric at least a sequence of what the series is built or not well we have to have a starting term we see that three nights and conveniently they haven't simplified it made it one-third and we need to identify what you're multiplying by so how do i get from three to the first to three to the second to three to the third with the nines not changing well i'm multiplying by three by 3 by 3 by 3. my common ratio is 3 here and my starting term is 3 9. now i'm going to show you something that's really really nice when they give you a sequence or a series and it ends with a term that's based on n you do not have a lot of work to do your sequence is 3 to the n over 9. wait a minute is that easy it is you don't have to do the following if you do if you repeat what i showed you a long time ago with your your sequences you go well what's the first term first term is 3 9 and the second term is 3 squared over nine and the third term is three cubed over nine and if you remember that the whole goal was to get down to what the end term is it's to get down to that and what we did a long time because we said okay well what's not changing remember we wanted the same form find out what's not changing what's not changing well the 3 is not changing the 9 is not changing so this would be 3 to the first over 9 and 3 to the second over 9 and 3 to the third over 9 and we'd say whatever's not changing is going to end up in your formula and relate what is changing to your index so it's not changing 3 is not changing 9 is not changing and our whatever is changing our exponent here our exponent is exactly what our index is every time so 3 3 2 2 1 1 n n but that's exactly what they're telling you there so if they give you your sequence or your series and it ends with the nth term that nth term is your geometric sequence it's telling you that and you get exactly the same thing it's very convenient and so when we do this we say hey what's up what's our what's our formula for the sequence on which a series is built well it's just your nth term if it's in terms of now if they didn't give this to you then yeah you'd have to go through and do exactly what i've shown you but i've shown you that already it's it's the same thing that we've been doing as far as our series are concerned so we're going to take that we're going to write it with the appropriate index so watch this crucial nuance step is that if our sequence is the nth term is three to the n over nine notice number one the nine is not being raised to nth term it's just three to the nth over nine then if that's to the nth term remember that we have to match whatever this says so we need to say this sequence is three to the k over nine why why that because you'd start at one now imagine this plug in one you're going to get 3 to the first over 9. that's that plug in 2 3 to the second over 9 that's that plug in n 3 to the negative 3 to the nth over 9. that's why we have this as a different variable or index so that we're allowed to plug in something different to it and we can end with that nth term now if you're thinking that this looks different than that it does it looks a little bit different than how a geometric sequence normally does it's not what we're used to i really need this to make sense to you i said this is the first term not necessarily just a sub 1 for a reason and here's the reason it does not matter at all if this looks exactly like this this makes it easier a little bit but it doesn't matter all you have to be able to do promise is the case is identify your first term and identify your common ratio so let's talk about the first term how do you identify the first term the first term is always identifiable by taking this and plugging it in so even though it doesn't look like that take one plug it in here 3 to the first is 3 over 9 is 3 9. that's exactly what we have here and that's exactly how you can fill out this partial sum which is kind of nice now the common ratio it is more difficult to see if you don't have it written like that it's not hard to do but just think about the thing that's being multiplied what's changing here what's inside of the thing being raised to the power well it's three three is your common ratio so your first term is three nights you find it by plug in one every single time your common ratio is three now could you write it differently yes that's why i have a different example here so here's what you would do if you really needed to match up first thing is you'd strip off that 1 9 that's in there so that would give you 1 9 times 3 to the k because 9 is not being raised to the k power that's perfectly appropriate to do the other issue though is that that says k minus 1 and that one doesn't so what do you do well that doesn't say k minus one you can change it but you have to really think outside the box here i know that looks funny but i want you to really think about it is it true is it true that 3 to the k is the same thing as 3 to the k minus 1 plus 1. well k minus 1 plus 1 would just give you k so again it's true this is the way that you reduce a power so you write this as minus one plus one and think how how do you connect addition of exponents well that has to happen via some sort of multiplication so the only way exponents are added is if they came from common bases being multiplied so think backwards on this three to the k minus one times three to the first you would add k minus one plus one that would give you k minus 1 plus 1 which would give you k this is the same but it's taken and stripped off a power and you can always do that it's it's not as hard as what i've i've explained it to you this is explaining why it works but it's really not that bad to strip off one factor from any sort of exponent and reduce the exponent by one we actually could do it all the time just think about it for a second if you had three to the seventh couldn't you write that as three to the six times three to the first yeah we do all the time we do it when we factor all the time we just think well yeah seven is six plus one so it'll be pretty easy well isn't this seven minus one yeah that's exactly what that is you're subtracting one from the the x to the power the exponent and then you're using one of those powers to represent some sort of a constant and that's exactly what we're doing here so we can take this and say hey this right here that 3 to the k you could write it as 3 times 3 to the k minus 1. that's exactly what we've done here 3 to the first times 3 to the k minus 1. if we put that 1 9 back so 1 9 here this is written as 3 times 3 to the k minus 1 and if you simplify that yeah these really should be written a little bit better i'm going to do this there that's better that matches what we have here this is in if you take a look at it if you match it perfectly to this so you start at one that's a sub one that's your common ratio to an exponent it says this should be your first term well it is three ninths is one third this should be your common ratio it is it's three now could you find the same thing by just plugging in one yes i've said that to you if you plug in one three to the first is three over nine that is one third this is your common ratio of three now which way is better it doesn't really matter as far as finding the sum so what we've done so far is we've identified what a geometric series is we've gone through an example shown that if they give you at the term you find your series very easily and now we're going to find the sum of these series i'm going to show you it gives you the same thing no matter which of these you actually write so let's give it a try here's what a geometric series adds up to in a partial sum again partial means you're not going to infinity and so you consider this to be up to a certain point now we're going to go from the first term all the way to the nth term well what does that mean you just leave the n that's okay here's what this says find your first term divide by 1 minus the common ratio and then multiply 1 minus your common ratio to the nth power whatever that power is so let's identify the first term this way it's pretty easy because it matches up perfectly okay your first term it fits the model perfectly your first term is 1 3 divided by you take 1 minus your common ratio that's 1 minus three so we have first term one third here one minus common ratio one minus three times 1 minus 3 to the n this needs to be simplified so you don't leave it one third over one month you just take a little bit of time and simplify that so one-third divided by negative two is negative one-sixth times 1 minus 3 to n there's not much you can do to simplify that let's see if it gives the same thing here now remember even though this is not fitting this model all this means is find your first term and find your common ratio let's find the first term how you find the first term is just plug in that number if i plug in this number well our first term would be 3 to the first over 9. why i'm not going back to here is what if you're given this without this what if you don't have that you can't just say yeah first term which is one-third but plug in the value so plug in one three to the first just three over nine is one-third notice it's giving you the same thing identify what's on the inside of your parentheses being raised to the power that is your common ratio so our common ratio is three and if you simply understand that this really does stand for the first term and you can find it by just plugging in that value it's going to save you a lot of time here and a lot of time in calculus 2. because a lot of times we have to if you don't realize that you have to manipulate a lot of junk to get it to fit the exact model just to find out what the first term is when it's very simple you just plug that in it's going to tell you your first term and you put it on your numerator it's plain and simple you can see it's exactly the same now this is adding up to a partial sum of the first n terms what if what if we just wanted to add the first 12 terms what would you do in either case if you're going to a finite number of terms this will add it this says if you're going to the 12th term then you're gonna do exactly the same thing your first term here one minus your common ratio that's what that says and then one minus your common ratio to whatever your n is in our case we change this to negative 1 6 1 minus the common ratio to the 12th power that's all there would be to it 3 the 12th is fairly large so i really don't want to do that but you take 1 minus 3 to the 12th and then multiply whatever that is that is times negative 1 6. it will give you whatever these terms add up to that's pretty fascinating so if you took 1 3 and 9 9 and 27 ninths and all of those things and added those fractions up for the first 12 terms you're going to get exactly what this tells you i ended up getting 88 573 and one-third i just couldn't leave it alone i had to figure out what that was so i hope that made any sense i really hope that you're seeing that these two things are equivalent i've shown that to you and that you are are ultimately going to get the same sum whether you write it in the same exact format or not just realizing that all that's really asking for is the first term what we're going to do now is we're going to come back we're talking about infinite series these were partial this was going to a finite number i could have stopped at 5 i could have gone to 50. it's in the same way you're just plugging in whatever your exponent is it's very nice because it's only in one spot that's very convenient so we'll come back and talk about when a geometric series will add up to a finite number with an infinite number of terms okay here we go last little bit talking about infinite geometric series what in world does entail what if i didn't stop and i just added up all the terms of this geometric series sequence from the first term all the way to infinity so i never stop adding them up is there a time when this is going to add to a finite number that's a wild thought and can really hurt your head a little bit if we start thinking about infinity that's not possible it is possible and i'm gonna prove it to you but only certain cases so we're gonna figure out when a geometric series will what's called converge add up to a finite number or diverge add up to either positive or negative infinity it will be one of those two cases that's the only two things that we can possibly have with a series adding to a number or not all right well let's figure out what in the world happens i want you to look at the subtle changes i made between the last part of this video and this part instead of going from one and stopping at n this is now an infinite series i start the first term i don't end that goes to infinity now we still have a sum this is the sum of every single geometric series ever and i know that if you see this in your textbook that's not there we're going to talk about why right now so on a partial sum you have the ability to stop right you have the ability to stop somewhere and say all right i can plug in a value here here's when you should know when this series is going to converge or diverge i really need to listen very carefully about this let's imagine that n goes to infinity so a certain thing kind of a limit idea what would happen if n goes to infinity if i just don't end what would that happen well r your common ratio this is key your common ratio would be raised to a really really really big exponent infinity is this always going to be infinity now you might be thinking well man if i take a constant comma ratio and i i multi i just you know take infinite power it's just going to be really big or maybe really negative but it's just going to be really really big is it though let's think about this what would happen if this value is i don't know two well then two to the infinity would be infinity but what would happen if that was one half think about the values of of fractions when you start multiplying them so one half times one-half is one-fourth one-half to the third power is one-eighth one-half to the fourth power is one-sixteenth what would one-half to the infinity power be well that would be one one to any power is one but how about two two to the infinity power would be infinity now this is the key what would one divided by infinity be close to will be close to zero so wait a second if i take certain values of common ratios i take them to an infinite power this part goes to zero not infinity what's one minus zero well one minus zero is just one so if i have certain values of a common ratio this part actually disappears why because that common ratio to infinity power would be zero one minus zero would be one one times whatever i have is whatever i have by the multiplicative identity that one is i would just get this for my infinite series but only if get this only if r is a certain range of numbers what are those numbers you can't just say fractions because some fractions are greater than one but one and negative 1 are the cutoffs here man i hope i made that make sense to you i kind of went through it fairly quickly but the idea is if r is between negative 1 and 1 then when you take it to the infinite power you're going to get close to zero you can say that two ways if r is a fraction between negative one and one or if the absolute value of r is less than one these two things need to be the same same in your head you go yeah okay absolute value wise these make the same same thing if this is true then your partial sum when i take r to the infinity if we have a fraction when you take fractions to exponents as exponents get larger those fractions get smaller one minus r to the infinity if r is a fraction between negative one and one this is going to go to zero if this goes zero one minus zero is one this times one gives you this but only if r is between these two values so this only what we call converges has a finite sum if r is between negative one and one so what happens if one if r is one or more so outside of this interval so less than negative one or more than one or equal to negative 1 and 1. that's what this says what if the absolute value of r is greater than 1 or equal to 1. well if it's equal to 1 then what we would get here is we would get 1 but this would count for whatever first term is for infinity so you'd have like maybe that's one ninth one-ninth plus one-ninth plus one-ninth plus one-ninth plus i don't know i don't care how many times you add one-ninth if you do it infinity times you're going to get infinity this would be diverging or this would diverge what if a r is more than that like two well it's going to diverge even quicker so if r is outside that interval so imagine that imagine r is a number like two two to the infinity is infinity you're you're smoked you're done because one minus something that's infinity is negative infinity i don't care what you have here it's not going to be zero something times negative infinity is going to be negative infinity unless it's negative it's positive infinity but you're not going to get a finite cell so the long story that i just explained is important but i hope that you understand this this more concise wrap up if you have fractions between negative one and one when you take them to the infinite power you get zero and that means that this part is gone and this would be your sum but it only works if that part goes to zero and that part only goes to zero if this happens if your common ratio an absolute value is less than one or other words between negative one and one a fraction less than one raised to a power gets smaller that's what we needed to make that not be infinity on the cons on the contrary if your common ratio is more than one that keeps growing this whole thing goes to infinity and if your commemoration is more than one that's what's going to happen every single time we call that diverge or diverges we can say divergent you might have noticed something too you better know something this is not even going to be here this is the formula that's in your textbook but i just showed you why that was so why is this why did i write it that way why i write as a sub 1 over 1 minus r times some other piece instead of the way your textbook writes it as this they usually write it as what i have here over 1 minus r this shows you what happens with this if r is less than 1 the absolute value that's gonna go to zero and then one minus zero goes to one that's great this gives you the formula for an infinite series this is exactly what the formula for an infinite geometric series is that's where it comes from but here's the thing you might have noticed that no matter what r is you can still plug it in couldn't you you could still find out what your first term is and you still plug in an r this means that you're able to find some solutions that mean nothing if your r is more than one or equal to one so don't can't equal one it's going to be zero but don't don't be plugging in things if you know it's done if it diverges so here's the order of operations of figuring out your infinite series number one find your common ratio number two determine if it's in the range of numbers that interval that allows this series to converge to a finite sum if it's not just write divergence and you are done give me 30 problems that diverge probably think i'm tricking you uh but right just right right diverges if your common ratio is more than one you're done now if it's not then you find your first term just plug in one whatever it is plug in your first term and then divide by one microphone ratio and it's very easy it's not bad so we're gonna run through our five examples here i'll reiterate this i'll talk about how um taking that partial sum and letting your n go to infinity is how we're finding this and what would happen if your r is less than uh one in absolute value so we take a look at it is that a geometric series well yeah it's got a it's got a common ratio it's being raised to an exponent is an infinite series yeah it's got infinity so that we're getting used to this right now the first thing we do is we identify what our common ratio is so our common ratio is one-third it's always the thing in parentheses being raised to the exponent in general it's the thing being raised to the exponent so our common ratio is one-third now classify it if our common ratio is between negative one and one this infinite series will converge and we talked about why if i take one-third to the second power let me get one-ninth how about you the hundredth power well i'm going to get something really really small in fact to the infinite power so small it doesn't matter so the formula we had before says if my one-third goes here and my n gets absurdly large then this gets absurdly small one-third to the infinity is going to be zero one minus zero is one that's why that partial sum actually works for an infinite series because this disappears but only if your fraction is between negative 1 1. that's exciting that's very interesting we're using some pretty cool stuff here most people never get that they never see that ever so we're going to determine our common ratio we're going to say this fits here this is less than one absolute value that means that this series will converge and now after we've determined that it converges we're going to find the sum you see it's really pointless to say diverges and then try to find the sum when you say that this diverges you're saying the sum goes to infinity that's what you're saying so divergence says it doesn't go to a number goes most of the time goes to infinity or negative infinity so you're saying that right here saying it doesn't have a sum that's what diverges me doesn't have a finite sum okay so it doesn't have a finite sum why would you go and find it if it diverges if it converges it's saying it does have a finite sum now once we determine it converges we find it how we always find the sum of the geometric series is find your first term then divide it by one minus common ratio so what i always do i just plug in one i don't care what form it is it does not matter just plug in one so one minus one is zero one third to the zero power is one and eight times one is eight what i walked you through that whole one minus one is zero thing that's why this is written as first term here because if i plug in one one minus one is always zero combination zero power is always one and one times this is always going to give you first term so that's why that's your first term here is eight then divide by one minus common ratio and simplify it a little bit so this is eight over two thirds i think we get 12 out of that number of ways you do it use your calculator eight divided by two thirds uh you could do eight divided by two times three that would give us 12. uh you could multiply both the numerator and denominator by three and get 24 over two which would also give us 12. now i mean the first time i saw this kind of bloom of mine like wait a minute you're telling me that i can take this and i can start writing out my my terms of my series like you plug in 1 you get 8 plug in 2 you get 8 over three plug in three you get eight over nine uh and i could i could do that forever and then add them all up and it's going to equal 12 like exactly yeah that's exactly what this means why is because that fraction being between negative 1 and 1 when i take that to very very large terms ends up being 0 it all matches up to give you 12. it's a fascinating piece of math let's move on a little bit so we have another geometric series we know oh can you identify your common ratio can you right now look at this and say common ratio is the thing that's being raised to the power it's not one half it's three can you identify your first term if you had to well it fits our form and so our first term would be one half or plug in one one minus one is zero zero three to the zero power is one one times one half is one half now before we find any sort of sum we need to identify the two things that are very very important number one we already did r is three so if r is three think about what that means if our common ratio is three three is not less than one three is more than greater than or equal to one now why would that make a difference imagine plugging in three here think about this this is the formula for a partial sum we're just letting this go to infinity it's only part of this that can change because we're the only part we're letting go to infinity so if this goes to infinity then 3 to the infinity is enormous 1 minus that is really negative and that's our first term we're going to have this is going to negative infinity there's no way that this could ever go to 0 because 3 to the infinity is enormous so this would diverge and that's why i'm trying to walk you through why this makes sense again and again so that it'll stick with you so this says yeah your comma ratio is more than one in absolute value it's going to diverge for the reasons we just talked about so would it benefit you to do that what a benefit you take your first term divide by one minus your common ratio uh one minus three notice how you can get an answer but notice that we already said it's going to negative infinity and i showed you that right here this is nonsense it's absolutely useless this only works if this thing goes to zero this thing only goes to zero if your common ratio is less than one in absolute value the only way it works so if you just if you go well i mean i'm just taking this piece of it look what you're missing you're really missing this this is the formula this only disappears if r is less than one so this is the formula with this here and you start eliminating this piece the only way you can eliminate it is if your r is less than one if your r is three then really what you would have here is the missing piece that you're taking for granted that works even though it doesn't it's it's not going to work for divergences if you write diverges that's going to infinite in this case uh no actually positive v because that right there would give you a negative so that would go to infinity and you cannot add this up it's impossible here's what i hope you're seeing right now i hope you're seeing that the only reason this disappeared from our partial sum to an infinite sum is because that piece goes to zero in certain cases if that piece is not going to zero because it does not qualify for those certain cases you basically can't eliminate it and then this does not work without that piece and with that piece it goes to infinity that's the idea so we don't want to show that let's move on to this guy so we have a series of from k equals 1 to infinity of 3 to the negative two-thirds to the k minus one negative two-thirds of the k-minus one first thing we always do we identify with a common ratio is in our case the common ratio the thing being raised to the power is negative two-thirds we look back over here where we think about it just thinking about it is enough think about how your partial sum was this and now i'm trying to plug in negative two-thirds that's a fraction less than one fractions less than one between negative one and one raised to infinite powers or raised any powers get smaller and smaller and smaller this thing if i raise it to the infinity is going to be close to zero that disappears one minus zero is one i get this i get that sum out of it and that's why this is so valuable so i know that because of that because my combination is between negative one and one this will converge it will go to a finite sum all right if it converges well you need to find out what it converges to so let's find our first term because we know that's going to work let's find our first term either plug in 1 or if it fits your model perfectly take your first term it's going to be three y minus one is zero negative two thirds to the zero power is one and one times three is three divided by one minus my common ratio of negative two-thirds just be careful on your signs you are subtracting a negative so you're going to be adding that so let's see three-thirds plus two-thirds is five-thirds that's going to be nine-fifths so if i add all the terms from here to infinity from three to infinity you're going to get a sum of nine fifths really really cool stuff i hope i'm making it make sense that you're seeing why this piece goes did disperse if r is between negative one and one i hope you're seeing that and why it doesn't if r is greater than one in absolute value okay just two more so we're taking a look at this we're gonna move a little bit quicker on these things uh this next one we have an infinite series from one to infinity we're identifying what our common ratio is the thing being raised to the exponent we identify that first always then we classify it is this uh is this common ratio between negative one and one or is it outside negative one and one in other words is the absolute value less than one or not well the absolute value of this is five fourths five fourths is one and one fourth this is greater than one absolute value or it's it fails to be in our interval from negative one to one this is not going to converge this diverges we always determine that before we find the sum so at this point here's what this says if your common ratio does not fit a convergent model and it diverges then we say there's no sense in finding the sum because this is either going to be positive or negative infinity this is not going to add up to a finite number therefore this formula does not work because we'd be missing this piece and this piece would go to infinity that's what happens when r is greater than one and you take it to an infinity it goes to infinity as well either positive or negative and so this says now we're not going to get there that diverges don't go any further don't use this formula because it doesn't make sense to do without that piece and that piece says infinity last one so the sum from one to infinity of three times two thirds to the k let's identify our common ratio first notice it doesn't have to look exactly like that our common ratio is just the thing that's being raised to the exponent it's two-thirds well let's let's classify that does that fit in converges or diverges think about it if two-thirds is our common ratio and that's between negative one and one or that's a fraction less than one absolute value then when i take it to infinity it's gonna go to zero one minus zero is one this falls out i get this as my formula that's exactly what we're looking for so we say yes this does converge that's exactly what this says our common ratio and absolute value is less than one it is going to add up to a finite sum that's really cool and now we can find it all we have to remember is that when you're adding this up you need to find your first term and put it on your numerator that's what that says that's why i put first term there so your first term is not 3. now i've been prefacing this with every example we've actually found a sum before but i always do this i take 1 and i plug it in whatever you get is your first term that's what the 1 means so if i plug in 1 i get 2 3 to the first power ah not 0 power i get 2 3 to the first power times 3. so this when i plug in 1 is my first term and then 1 minus r could you take the time to manipulate this to make it fit that model exactly yes and i showed you how to do that in the previous example i'm not going to do that i really am not the same because it's it's a lot easier just to understand what this is talking about what this is talking about is take your first term whatever it is how do you find your first term plug in that number so if i plug in that number and take that on my numerator divide by 1 minus a common ratio take that on my denominator and then simplify it so 3 times 2 thirds is two over one third one minus two thirds is one third that's gonna give me six so if i have all the terms from one to infinity i'm going to get exactly six i hope that that you had a little hope you had fun i hope you enjoyed thinking about the infinity and when that would go to zero and when it wouldn't and how that affects going from a partial sum where that is to an infinite sum where this either goes to infinity or it goes to zero depending on what your common ratio is i hope it made that make sense that you really really see it if you can then this this really if you've taken calculus 2 you understand how this idea will really help you there or probably would have helped you if you would have known that before taking account too so if you're you're going to get there eventually when you get there this idea of understanding how infinity works with fractions can be very very very valuable which is why i'm teaching it to you now so hopefully i've explained it in such a way that you understand what's going on with that that formula i know that your textbook will not show this to you for an infinite series i did so that you understand where it's coming from in relationship to a partial sum which they show a little bit differently so i hope you enjoyed it i hope you got the concept and i want to see you for the next video when we talk about proofs with mathematical induction have a good day 

Transcript for: Proof by Mathematical Induction (Precalculus - College Algebra 73)
welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about something called proof by mathematical induction and even though it might sound like a really weird cooking technique induction is the idea of if i can prove for the next idea the next term the next term the next term i create a proof that's very similar to knocking over a domino and having to knock over a lot of other dominoes induction is the idea of prove one prove the next one and if you prove the idea of the next one you can always iterate that further further almost like recursion but in the future so we're going forward instead of going backwards now here's what the mathematical induction does and then i'll show you why it works as we go through because at first it's going to seem like that shouldn't prove a darn thing but i'll explain it to you why it does so here's how induction works number one you have to show that at least one term is true so we're going to show that whatever we're trying to prove is true for at least the first term so we're going to show that n equals 1 is actually true then what we're going to do might seem a little fishy the next thing we're going to do is assume that it's true for some other number not 1 but something between 1 and n whatever end is that might look a little funny um but here's here's what it says it says if you show the first one then you're going to assume it's true for some other term so n equals k now what what's the k k could be anything k could be the second term or the third term or the fifth term the 500th term or some other number so we'll assume it's true for something else so we show it's true for one we assume it's true for another one and then we show it's true for the next one well now what would the next one be the next one would be whatever is after the one you just assumed so hang on a second if i assume the third true term to be true then the one that would actually be four if i started to assume the seventh term one after that would be eight if i assume the k term is true the next one would be k plus 1 the one after it and this will actually prove the truth of whatever you're trying to show and we'll talk about why that is as we go through it one thing to keep in mind this is kind of fun and this is where sometimes it makes your brains but wait a minute you would assume this and assume it to be true for fact treat this step as fact it's important otherwise you can't finish your problem i always like to treat my assumptions like fact anyway but here we actually get to do it which is kind of fun i'm going to walk you through it there's there's no more to explain you show first you assume one more and then you show the one after that and that's how mathematical induction can be quickly summarized so we're going to do two examples and i'll show you exactly what i mean this is probably the most important thing is treating as this assumption like fact so here we go first to maybe get an idea of what's going on so what is this actually saying this is one three five seven nine odd numbers the sum of odd numbers is equal to the number of the term one number of numbers squared whoa really yeah that's true so here's what we're going to do we're going to show the first term like n equals one you know all right well what would that mean what that would mean is add up the first odd or odd number that would be one is that equal to the number of odd numbers squared that would be the first odd number squared yeah one actually does equal one that shows that that's true we've proved the first term true now i'm going to go a little further but you wouldn't have to i'm just going to show you so you get a feel for how this this series actually works um now keep this in mind what i'm doing is not additionally proving i'm not doing that i'm just showing you the formula this does nothing to prove it you could show how everybody wanted you'd have to ultimately show that the next term is true well you can't do that right like you can't keep going forever so at some point we'd have to stop we'd run out of time in our lives to show every single iteration of uh imagine the 500th odd number being added or the 5 billion well you can't do that you have to set up a series of dominance and say if i can show that the next one's true then the next one will always be true if the next one's always true then there's no stopping that falling of the dominoes so let's do this how about this how about adding up the first two odd numbers that would be one plus three is that equal to these are two odd numbers and this two notice what we're doing the first two odd numbers should be found by plug in one that's one plugging in one then two that's one and three and then plugging in two here that's two squared four does equal four that is really kind of cool if you wanted to find the sum of the first 50 odd numbers just take 50 and square it you have it we're proving that's true right now i'm gonna do two more just so you the feel how about the first three odd numbers the first three odd numbers would be one plus three plus five i've added three odd numbers three squared is nine that's nine that's nine how about adding the first four odd numbers one three five and seven is that equal to the first four odd numbers squared so four numbers four squared that would be the four odd numbers and adding and these are the values of the odd numbers that would be 16 that is 16. it actually does work now i'm going to say this one more time you could do this forever and it still wouldn't be enough proof to fundamentally prove that that is true you would have only shown it for a finite number of values what we need to do with deduction or what we intend to do with the notion instead of this idea that if i can now prove that the next one will always be true then i can use that to say well the next one's true but then the one after that will be true and then one for that will be true we can only do that by assuming something and proving the next one that's our next two steps so in general we just show this and then we go okay let's let's assume it's true for another one too we've actually shown several more but this is not enough to assume it's true for a general next one so this is step one right here and step two is now that you've proved one of them let's assume it's true for something else now that something else could be anything past the first one it could be the second term or the third term or the fourth term or the fifth term but in general we would just say okay if this was true for the first one let's rewrite this but let's assume it's true for some other number now it looks funny in saying let n equal k all it's saying is assume this which is based on n is true for some other term call it k what would that mean what that would mean is like i showed 1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 7 is the same thing as four squared i would show one plus three plus five plus seven plus all the way up to whatever the k is is going to equal k squared that's what it is it basically it replaces end with k but the idea is more important than that the idea is what you're doing is you're saying yeah that worked for the first one is it going to work for a second one or a third one or a fourth one well let's assume it will we showed three of them but we'll let's assume it will let's show that maybe it's not the fourth term maybe it's the seventh term then i show one plus three plus five plus seven plus nine plus eleven plus thirteen plus fifteen all the way to wherever i wanna stop is equal to that number by numbers squared so we say assume it's true for k okay well let's let's just go up to that specific term and say yeah that's going to equal k squared it's more important than just replacing this it's understanding i'm showing this for some other term past one pass your first one if it was 50 i'd do 1 3 5 7 all the way 50 equals 50 squared whatever the 50th odd number would be um 99 it'd be 99. so i'd show that all up to 99 it would equal 50 squared i hope that makes sense to you i hope that you understand that i've shown the first one i hope you understand what this actually means it's not just replacing it with k it looks like it but it's saying assume it's true then this would be valid for some other number k some other term k now the most important part we are going to treat this like fat this is true so whenever we see it come about and we will this is going to equal k squared we can use that we can use it so the last thing we do is now we need to show this we set up a series of dominoes and say the next one is true the next one is true the next one is true so we need to show this for k equals us or n equals k plus 1. well now what would that be if i show this for n equals k plus 1 then what would happen is i would take this and i would stop not at k but i'd stop at k plus one that's the next one that's showing that next one's always true well you can't stop that if you show the next one's always true then when you get to one you're sure the next one's true but when you need that one the next one's true when you get to that one the next one's true it will go forever and you'll always be able to prove the next iteration is true the next term is valid this holds for the next term so here's what we would do we're going to take this and go okay if i stopped at k i would stop at k minus 1. all right okay sorry 2k minus 1. but if i go to the next term now i'm going to take and not plug in k that's what this was i'm going to plug in k plus 1 to there so this is stopping at k we're assuming that's true this is stopping not at k but notice we have one more term we have let's stop at k plus one so this is the idea of the next term i hope that you're seeing that we're taking this and we're going one more further than where we stopped here for this one we said let's plug in k let's assume it's true for when we plug in k okay and now we're saying let's go one more than that so we're not going to stop at plugging in k that's here we're going to stop at the next one plug in k plus 1. well that'd be 2 k plus 1 minus 1. that would be the next term now what should that be equal that should equal k plus 1 quantity squared showed it for the first one assume it's true for some other one and now based on this based on that that that's true show for the next one so plug in this assuming this is true here's the whole idea if you can assume that this is always equal to k squared then wherever you see it this part is this part we just want one more term so why would it be appropriate to say if this part is this part and we know that this is true because we assumed it if we know that's true then this is k squared well we have one additional term okay let's maybe distribute that 2k plus 2 minus 1. this is 2 k square k squared plus 2 k plus 1 and so is that if i distribute it that shows that this side equals this side and it's shown that if i have an additional term if i have the next term that the formula still holds true so this is showing that provided i can prove it up to one term the next term will be true now here's why this works because you might be going this is fishy because you're assuming something's true you haven't proven yes but we sort of have remember this will hold true for any next term and since we've shown one term wouldn't this hold true for the term after that i.e the second term yeah it would so if i just had this let's make k equals 1 the next would be 1 plus 1 the next term so if i can prove one term if this is always showing the next term is true then i've already shown one term this holds for term two but wait it holds for term two i can show the next one holds return three well wait a minute if i hold if i show term three then this holds for the next one do you see how i'm knocking dominoes over if i show just the first domino and i show that it's true for the next domino and i use a general term not to show here but show it in general that i'm knocking over the next domino and then the next one and then the next one and then the next one it will never stop that's how induction works so even though it seems a little fishy like wait a minute you're assuming something you haven't proven that's true but we're basing on the fact we've proven one and showing it that the next one even if i start with that one i just proved is always going to be true thereby going forever as this true true true knocking down thing this this um array of dominoes falling over and that's the way induction works so show one assume for some other one and then show the next one treating this like fact because we've already shown it for one and it sets up the series of falling down and that's kind of cool we can always use this as true it'll show up somewhere when you're solving it um as hey replace this with that and then you show that both sides are equal let's do the same thing here but we're going to be a little bit more concise about it i'm going to do the very minimum to show you how the induction works so number one thing with induction if you're trying to prove this by the way this would prove all of the the formulas for your series that you would get improve all of them sometimes it takes a little more work but it would do it so let's show the first one does it hold true for one so if i plug in one i would get one is that equal to 2 times 1 squared minus 1. remember i'm showing the first one because i have to have somewhere for this domino to start somewhere to say yes but i prove the next one will be true what's the one after one two i've proved the second one's true what about after after two let's prove the next one's true so i've proved the idea of the next one being true so is this true if n is one one would that equal two times one minus one that's one yes this is true i have now proved the start that my dom my first domino can fall over that's too many s's assume it's true for something else so assume is true for like the second one or the third one or whatever one we use k to represent the idea of another term so something else besides the first one we're going to assume that that's true and then show that it keeps on falling show that the one after that would be true so we've assumed it's true for something else then it will hold and now we're proving an idea we're proving that the next term will also be true given that this one was true so if this was true the next one's true now why is that okay well we've already shown that one's true so showing that that's true given that then another one will be true the second one given that the next should be true we're proving an idea a concept okay well if that's true then what we're going to do is we're going to go all the way to here we're going to show that in terms of k and then one more so all the way to here and then the next one we need to show this we need to show this exact thing because it will come up again we just did it and then you need to show the one after that how you show the one after that is you you evaluate it's basically composition you take k plus one and you replace that with k plus one you've already placed it with k now go to the next one so it's four k plus one minus three over here we do the same thing but remember you're replacing with k plus one now you're talking about the next term that's how this series is added it says take however many terms you have plug it in there if i went to five terms i plug in five and five if i went to k terms i plug in k to k that's what we did right here now i'm going to k plus one terms i'm going to plug in k plus one and k plus one show the first assumed it assume this is true for some other term besides n and now based on that assumption we said assume this is true take it as fact assume uh show it for the next one so if i show for the next one i take k plus one i plug it in here that would be the next term and that would say based on my series i have to evaluate k plus 1 and k plus 1 because that is a term that i am now showing to be true so that's what this says here's the k here's the next term k plus 1 just evaluate it and then that would equal well the k plus 1 term inside of my cell so k plus 1 squared minus k plus 1. hopefully you see where that comes from because now we're going to make make use of that assumption we're going to say if this is true and we showed it for one of them if that's true then this piece this piece right here it is 2k squared minus k so that means this piece is also 2k squared minus k this i can distribute i can simplify a little bit and you know a couple things but what i would recommend is get to this point all combined and then distribute that just see if they're the same that's really the whole point is make sure that both sides are the same what that's doing is showing that the next term is still validated by the sum that you thought it would be by the sum of that next term so you're showing that they're equal satisfying the idea that the next term is true watch your signs there that's minus k minus one that's it those are true you've now shown that if you can start with one term being true and you've assumed the next one's true then the second one has to be true but then the third one has to be true because you've shown it in general for the idea of the next term that sets up that whole sort of waterfall idea where it's just going to keep on falling and falling and falling i hope that you have a better understanding for what mathematical induction does that you understand that it actually works it seems a little funny when you when you first see it but after that it really is a very powerful way we can prove a lot of these series that we find in this class and in calculus 2. so i hope that you enjoyed it hope you have a better understanding and i will see you for another video 

Transcript for: Introduction to Angles (Precalculus - Trigonometry 1)
hey there welcome to another video in this video we get to start trigonometry which is awesome i actually love trigonometry i love it because it's kind of fun sort of in a really weird way but super useful if you have a good grasp on trigonometry calculus becomes much much easier because usually when students get wrapped up in the hard parts of calculus it's either algebra which i've taught you very well or trigonometry but you're going to learn very well so being that we're going to start trigonometry and it has almost everything to do with angles we're going to look at angles first so the outline of where we're going is we're going to study angles we'll talk about degrees we'll talk about radians how to convert between them some real life examples and then we'll start getting into what's called the unit circle which you're going to use like the rest of your math lives to kind of memorize it so we're going to start with what an angle is where they come from and have a very good grasp about what degrees and radians are without that foundation it's very hard to understand why you need both how to convert between them and really what they mean without understanding the foundation of them so let's start with what angles are really anytime you take two rays and they have a common starting spot like an origin or we call that a vertex you're going to get some sort of an angle between them remember a ray is a line with a starting point pretty much it's not both directions it goes in one direction looks kind of like a vector well if you give those uh the same starting spot even if the the angle is zero zero degrees zero radians even if it's zero there's still something between them like we could say well they say the same uh same direction there there's no distance between them but we can call that angle zero so anytime you have that you have some sort of an angle exactly what we say here so a couple things when we get started when we put an angle on what's called standard position that's on the x y axis with the origin representing that vertex of an angle and the initial side on or x-axis and a terminal side measured counterclockwise positively so i'm going to show that to you right now so anytime you see an angle in standard position which is pretty universal here this right here this x-axis side is called your initial side and where that angle stops the angle is this swept out portion so where that angle stops is called your terminal side this distance between them or this swept out portion that we see between the initial side and your terminal side is called your angle please make a note here that all of your angles are measured positively counterclockwise so counter-clockwise or or anti-clockwise is when we go in reverse direction of how a normal standard face clock goes so like this that's called counterclockwise another side note here is if we happen to measure angles clockwise they're measured negatively from where that initial side is so typically your positive x-axis so your initial side always positive x-axis we measure positively if counterclockwise negatively if clockwise and we can do a lot of different things with that so this angle that's swept out is this part right here and we show that which show that we're going counterclockwise from the initial side to the terminal side and that's our angle a lot of times you're going to see an angle represented by this greek letter theta it's very standard we can call them different things i'm going to use alpha in a second we call them lots of different letters but this is very standard as we see a lot in trigonometric notation like the sine cosine tangent which we're going to get to you've probably heard of that an angle is represented a lot of times by alpha beta and theta we do fees and everything other things also but that's pretty common so a little bit of recap hey look if you have two rays and they start at the same spot you're going to have an angle between them even if it's zero a measurement of zero radians or degrees and so two ways to measure angles when we sweep out that distance from an initial side starting on the x-axis to its terminal side where this angle ends or where the other ray is we call that positive measurement if counterclockwise and negative clockwise and we show it with the direction that we've measured and we show it with an angle name like theta so what we're going to do now is explore a little bit and get this this idea of what a degree means we'll see that a lot more a little bit and then talk about what are called quadrant angles so let's look down here what if we have an initial side our initial side in standard position should always be on the x-axis and just like it is right here so if this is our initial side and we start measuring positively so remember positively is counterclockwise and we measure we go around and around and around and round and round and round and round and round around and we come back to where we started if our terminal side is where our initial side is and we've made one let's call it the full rotation we've swept out an entire rotation on that x y plane from our standard position that is called a 360 degree angle so this angle that we'd show notice how we did we did the same thing here we said here's our initial side here's our terminal side and we showed the direction of measurement which has to be positive because we measured counterclockwise and we showed where our terminal side is also we named this an angle this right here being that this is one full rotation we call that 360 degrees for an angle measurement so if one full rotation of that that let's say terminal side compared to our initial side sweeps out of that full thing there that's 360 degrees so we can also think of this as one degree equals one 360th of a rotation let's talk about a few other ones so let's say that we have our initial side on our x-axis like is very standard and we make that angle so our two rays are on the x-axis positive and the positive y-axis and we're going to measure counter-clockwise you should know that's positive at this point that's our angle so we've measured that positively we've shown that that's sweeping out of that portion of our xy plane we've called that theta well if if one let's see if one full rotation is 360 degrees and we have these things called quadrants so there's one two three four we name them as we rotate positively so it'll be a counterclockwise naming of quadrants one two three and four then if we sweep out the first quadrant and all of them are equal let's say sizes if you will or have an equal angle between them then this would be 1 4 of a rotation 360 degrees divided by 4 or 1 4 times that would be 90 degrees and that's why we get that 90 degree angle between the positive x and the positive y by the way just a little side note do you have to put that little degree thing you really do it's important because if we don't have that we can lose part of what we're talking about and we're also going to have a different type of measurement called radiance and it's really important to put what type of an angle you're talking about most people do not understand what a radiant is they just go it's radiance you know what that means we're going to talk a lot about that because it's really crucial and it's very important and a lot of your formulas that we're going to be using only work with radian measured angles not degrees or you have to convert between them now what if we keep on going what if we have our initial side on the x-axis and we have our terminal side on the negative x-axis and so when we show this positively measured angle going counter-clockwise we go all the way to here well if that's half of a full rotation and a rotatable rotation is 360 degrees that will be 360 divided by two that's 180 degrees this is where that that idea of because we know an x-axis is a straight number line this is where the idea of a straight line contains 180 degrees that's where that really comes from what if we kept on going we said all right uh you know what let's go ahead and let's have our initial side here let's measure counterclockwise so positively but let's end on the negative y-axis so we always show the direction that this angle has rotated or swept out would maybe be a more appropriate term we show the initial side we know that show this terminal side we show that this is the angle that we're talking about and now let's think about it this is three quadrants or three-fourths of a full rotation so 360 times three-fourths was going to be 270 degrees what we've got here are what what are called quadrant angles so if your initial side and your terminal side happen to be on any of your axes we get what's called a quadrant angle and that's the angle that sweeps out a full quadrant or two full quadrants or three four quadrants or full four four quadrants and that's the 90 180 270 and 360 that you're probably familiar with what about the other one what if what if here i didn't actually sweep out anything i had an initial side and a terminal side that didn't sweep out well our angle would be zero in that case so if we don't sweep out any distance let's say or any any angle really then we would have this this angle of zero so a lot of times on the x-axis you're going to see this represented in standard position as this is zero or 360 degrees that's what that quadrant angle could be it could be another full rotation we get that 720 and we can do a lot of things like that so that's why that's there because if you didn't have this if i just imagine that that rotation is gone that that angle that terminal side didn't sweep out a full rotation of this x-ray plane then that would have an angle of zero i hope that's making sense to you i hope you understand that really we're talking about something very simple with a lot of great things that come from it these angles so we're talking about two rays that just start at the same spot well depending on how much they sweep out we get a larger or smaller angle we always measure those angles counterclockwise for positive and clockwise for negative we're going to do that in just a second where where our terminal side terminates we can say if that's on an axis you get a quadrant angle and those are very standard numbers that we're probably used to 90 180 270 364 zero degrees depending on what axis you're ending on if we don't terminate on one of those axes we end in what's called a quadrant so we'll talk about that really quickly right now we'll practice about six of them in just a minute but our quadrants count like i said before the same way that we measure an angle positively so on our quadrants and we would typically use roman numerals for that we have quadrant 1 two three and one less than four five so we get four and that's where our quadrants are located so notice that you there is no quadrant five there's no quadrant six if you happen to make a full rotation you end back up in quadrant one and we like that because a lot of time well later on like when you get to calculus we do some some different things without angles we can get what are called reference angles and it lets some of our identities work very nicely and so it's nice that we don't have to really think about that for some of the math that we do we just look at what quadrant we end up in and that determines the sine positive negative of our trig functions a lot of the time for us very nicely so that's pretty much it for right now i i really need you to know that angles are not complicated things they're very simple things but they have to be measured accurately and they have to be being understood fully before we can continue so you really need to understand what standard position means you need to understand what the quadrants are we talk a lot about that we need to understand that we measure counterclockwise for positive and clockwise for negative for instance if we had to measure this negatively i'm going to do this for all three of these if we measure this negatively so clockwise rotation i call that alpha alpha would be 270 degrees but negative why negative because you measured that clockwise you said hey here's my here's my initial side here's my terminal that's a positive or counterclockwise sweeping out here's a negative or clockwise sweeping out ending at the same terminal side but going in a different direction and that creates this idea of positive and negative rotation for us being counter clockwise or clockwise respectively so we can do the same thing here if we rotated or swept out clockwise it'd still be 180 degrees but it'd be negative 180 degrees giving us the direction of that notice also how i can't call this theta anymore i have to give it a different name so i'm going to call it alpha and likewise here with an initial side on the positive x and a terminal side of the negative y we do have two choices the positive direction would be counterclockwise the negative direction of angles is clockwise i would call that negative 90 degrees i hope you're with me i hope it's making sense that's really about it if we understand that you're going to be just fine we're going to talk about six angles just seeing what quadrants they end up in which direction they're telling us to measure then we'll be done with our video all right let's practice a few angles just six of them to get our head wrapped around what they mean make sure that's really solid in your head so we're going to start talking about positive and negative angles we're going to see what quadrants they aim they end in we're going to identify the initial the terminal side the direction of rotation whether we're going to be going counterclockwise or clockwise and identifying what that angle is and showing that direction so let's start with theta equals 45 degrees now this does not end on one of our axes and so this is going to be in a quadrant and it's not a quadrant angle so how we always always start with our angles in standard position is we label our initial side first which is always that positive x-axis so i'm going to say all right we're just going to show that our initial side is on that positive x-axis because this is a positive angle it makes me go counter-clockwise to sweep out that angle and so i'm going to show that now because our first quadrant angle would be 90 degrees 45 is exactly half of that which means and it's very nice that this is going to cut through just like a y equals x line would look that array is going to start at this origin and go right through let's call the middle of that quadrant so our initial side is here on the positive x our terminal side is right in the middle of that quadrant i've done my best to show that and we're going to show that this is our angle so we always show we always show that that measurement that's been swept out and that's going to be exactly 45 degrees force if we've got it right and so we're going to show that so shown the theta we've called it theta it said that right there and shown that's 45 degrees i hope that makes sense i hope you're saying yeah we should start with the positive x it should be positive measurements go counter clockwise for us and because it's 45 degrees between 0 and 90 right in the middle of that we're doing our best to represent it now how about theta equals negative 30 degrees we're still going to start by having our initial side on our x-axis but that negative 30 makes us sweep this out clockwise so maybe that's counter-intuitive that counter-clockwise is positive but that's that's the way these things are set up for us and so we're going to sweep this out clockwise 30 degrees and wait a minute the quadrant angle here would be negative 90 so negative 30 should be exactly one third of the way through not one not one half and not a little bit not two thirds but just one third of the way through that's going to represent negative 30 degrees so i'm going to show my terminal side i'm going to do my best to show that i'm just kind of approximating here but i'm going to do my best to show where that is i'm going to show the direction of that angle being measured clockwise i'm going to show that this is 30 degrees that gives us a good visual representation of exactly what that means now thought i'm not going to answer it for you but i want you to think about it could you have got the same angle measured positively could you tell me what that is if i asked you for it so if you thought about this and said hey i'd have to go all the way around here counterclockwise that would be what would that be if i measured positively and not negatively hopefully it'd be 330 degrees that would be that full positive rotation minus that 30 degrees how about 225 so we're going to start we're going to put our initial side on a positive x-axis we're saying that's a positive angle that makes us go counter-clockwise well how far past 180 is that that's why i always do this is it's between 0 and 90 quadrant angles between 0 and 180 quadrant angles between 0 and 270 quadrant angles well this is somewhere between 180 and 270 and so we're going to say well how much if this is 180 degrees here then we are 45 degrees past that so that says 90 80 and then 45 degrees past would be somewhere in this quadrant and halfway between 180 and 225 270. so i'm showing that i'm saying i'm passing the first quadrant second quadrant halfway through the third quadrant and that's another thing we should be prepared to do we should be prepared to say this angle terminates in the first quadrant that's quadrant one this angle terminates not in a negative first quadrant kind of fun to do but but no this terminates in the one two three in the fourth quadrant so that is our fourth quadrant this terminates in our one two in our third quadrant and they're always measured that way they're measured or counted i should say the same way that we measure positive angles so one two three and four negative 135 we do have to start that on our positive x-axis for anything that's in standard position it says you do have to measure that or sweep it out clockwise because it's a negative angle so i'm thinking hey this would be negative 90 and this would be negative 180. so i'm somewhere between negative 90 and negative 180 in fact i'm 45 degrees between negative 90 and negative 180 so i'm going to show that so here's 90 here's another 45 that makes that negative because we're clockwise rotation and that makes our angle negative 135. again could you find the negative version here and the positive version here we just did i really want you to see that that whether we measure positively 225 degrees or negative 135 degrees we end up with the same terminal side so what's it what's that mean it means you can get the same picture from two different directions as should seem obvious because either way we're getting to their that ending point now does it make a difference sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't it really depends on the context of what you're dealing with sometimes it's nice to be able to change negative angles and sometimes it's nice to change the positive one thing that i do want you to do is add these up if you add it up 135 degrees and 225 degrees you're going to get 360 degrees and that that really does show you that that is the same terminal side so i hope this makes sense you hope that you're understanding and it's really sinking in this point what angles are and how we determine where to put them in relation to our quadrants in relation to our quadrant quadrant axes i'm sorry axes are quantum angles and why we can get the same terminal side positively negatively you really should try the last two on your own see if you can do them they're more than a full rotation but start with your x axis as your initial side go positively for positively or counterclockwise 4 405 go negatively or clockwise or negative 540 and see where you end up of course we're going to do that now so 405 degrees man that's that's more than one full rotation so how we showed that we'd say all right if we have a positive 405 degree angle we still have our initial side but we've gone all the way around and then we're going to keep on going it looks kind of like a spiral so you can do this for really really large angles just going to be a spiraling out that would be 360 degrees so remember that this angle right here is 0 degrees or 360 degrees that would be 90 that'd be 280 and this is 270 and those are our quadrant angles so if i'm going 405 degrees let's see that would be 45 degrees more than 360 and that's really how i think about it i try to figure out what quadrant angle am i just past so i've gone past 90 pascal 80 past 270 past 360 but not not past 360 plus 90. i'm somewhere between that 360 and that whatever that would be plus 90. now we've got 450 and so this is between there well where where where between there well if this is 360 and this would have to be 450 think about that 360 plus 90. then i'm 45 degrees between that so 405 let's just do minus 360. that's what we've done we said this counts as 360 degrees 405 minus 360 is 45. so this says i am 45 degrees yeah i don't really like that it looks like it's right in the middle but 45 degrees past that full rotation so i'm going to show that that shows that i've kind of spun or rotated one time around that that entire plane and then a little bit further now could you do the same thing negatively sure could you the same terminal angle with just a 45 degree angle yes sometimes it matters how many times you've rotated and sometimes it doesn't if we're dealing with sine and cosine and things like that we usually uh take the domain and restrict it so they're easier to work with in a lot of cases and when we get there that's going to make a little bit more sense when i'm prefacing where we're going with it so you understand that sometimes we need those rotations to be there and sometimes we don't all right how about the negative 540 negative 540 says you're going to start with your standard position the initial side right on the positive x it says you're going to sweep out clockwise 540 degrees so let's do that this would be negative 90 negative 180 negative 270 negative 360. so we're going to reverse those negative quadrant angles so that would be that negative 360 degrees well how much past that is that uh see let's see 540 minus 360 is 180 so i need to go 180 degrees in that clockwise rotation past where i am right now so i'm always breaking it down like that how many rotations or how many quadrant angles am i am i filling out and then where do i end between that since this is 360 and an additional 180 in that clockwise direction we end up there we can do this angle lots of different ways to get the same terminal side but none that have that same direction same rotation same number of rotations and the same terminal side so we'd show this we'd say that's negative 540 degrees and that's where the angle would be and that's what that represents so i hope this has given you a good introduction to what angles are i hope that it's very solid in your mind how they're created and what direction is positive and negative that you understand our quadrants and our quadrant angles so we have our quadrant one two three quadrant one two three even though they're measured positively and negatively respectively quadrant one this is a quadrant angle and then we have a quadrant one two three four and a quadrant one so i hope you're with me i hope it's making sense next time we're going to come back and we're going to talk about what minutes and seconds are so in terms of a degree now 360 degrees that sounds like days in a year uh 60 is a is a factor of that almost three or three sixties close to days in here um 60 is a factor that just like we have 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in kind of an hour we're gonna have 60 minutes in a degree in 60 seconds in a minute i'm going to give you how to translate back and forth so you understand what we're talking about so see you for that have a great day you 

Transcript for: Converting Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds (Precalculus - Trigonometry 2)
welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about these things called degrees minutes and seconds we go what in the world does that mean well it's a it's a way that we can measure smaller than one degree you see one degree is one 360th of a rotation or there are 360 degrees and one roll full rotation from an initial side to a terminal side that stops where it starts or terminates where it begins so if we want to get more specific than a degree we need something to do that so we need minutes and to get more specific than minutes we need seconds or we can use decimals you go why don't we just use decimals oftentimes we do but minutes and seconds are also very common and so i want to show you how to convert between the minutes and seconds fractions of a degree and decimal portions of that of that same degree so i'm going to show you that what they mean and basically that's what i've just explained to you so minutes and seconds are fractions of one degree if one revolution is 360 degrees well then parts of that degree can be broken up where one degree is equal to 60 minutes we make a minute like this looks almost like a foot notation if you're familiar with inches of feet and then one minute has 60 seconds now appreciate how small that is so one degree is already fairly small break that into 60 parts you're really really small break that really small thing into 60 seconds 60 other parts that are equal that that's exceptionally small so degrees minutes and seconds give you the ability to measure very very small units sometimes we can talk about minutes of angle if you've ever studied trajectory minutes of angle is what they're talking about here this is a minute of angle and we would talk about angles being in minutes so that you can be very specific with it hardly anybody would say seconds of angle that is exceptionally small so minutes and and seconds can give you very very accurate determinations of whatever angle you're talking about and so we're going to go ahead very very quick video here to show you how to change between minutes and seconds of a degree into decimals of degree and then we're going to go backwards from that in just a little bit so let's take a look at this if one degree equals 60 minutes and 60 minutes there's a one minute equals 60 seconds then we can think about a little different way too so that we can translate into degrees one minute is equal to one sixtieth of a degree just divide both sides by 60 and you will get 160 to the degree equals one minute or one second equals one sixtieth of a minute we'll take both sides divided by sixty you'd get one sixtieth of a minute equals one second but wait a second if literally if if one second is one sixtieth of a minute and one minute is one sixtieth of a degree then one second is one sixtieth of which means multiply 1 60 of a degree it's 1 60 of a degree squared that's one over 3600 of a degree that's very very small unit of measurement and so this is the way that we're going to convert this i'm going to show you that with just a couple examples obviously we don't need to convert degrees to degrees so leave the 61. we're just going to add some decimals to it and here's how if we take our minutes and we understand that if one minute is 1 60 of a degree then 42 minutes is 42 times that 1 60 of a degree so we can do that this right here notice the unit change this is 42 times one minute this is 42 times one minute this is one minute so just multiply your minutes by one sixtieth and put that degree there because you've just changed units you've just converted now how about the seconds 21 seconds means 21 times 1 60 of a minute or 1 60 of 1 60 of a degree so we can multiply that way so 21 seconds is 21 times well i'm not just going to do 21 times 160th of a minute because i'd have to convert twice so i want to do 21 is 160th 1 60 of a degree remember we're trying to convert two degrees here so it doesn't do me a lot of good to leave this in degrees and do this in degrees and then do this in minutes that doesn't make sense because i have to redo this and either add up my minutes and do it again or i'd have to convert twice and so let's make sure that all our units are correct so degrees that's that's great degrees are degrees minutes i've multiplied by 1 60 of a degree because one minute is 160 of a degree seconds i've multiplied by 1 60 of 160 of a degree because 1 second is 1 60 of a minute and that minute is 1 60 of a degree so we have a double conversion here this is what you're going to add up so i don't really care whether you add it this way and add this 61 plus whatever you get here plus whatever you get here or if you want to write out a little bit differently and say this becomes this is kind of the way i prefer because a little bit straighter here 61 degrees plus this portion as a degree i can easily see that those are both in the correct units plus this portion as a degree and now i have my degrees of degrees that's cool my minutes are degrees that's great my seconds are now in degrees can you see how we're just multiplying by 1 over 60 twice two times to get this into minutes and then this into degrees just like we had to multiply this to get into degrees and i like this because you can put it in your calculator just like it says and if you do that you're going to get that this is 61.2 but now it's in degrees that's how we change from this minute and second notation of fractions of a degree into a decimal version of that which one's better it really depends but notice something that this is let's see tenths hundred thousand ten thousand hundred thousandths of a degree this might be better notation sometimes because there are no decimals here you know exactly what to the second you're ending at um but that's how very very specific and accurate these minutes and seconds are they're exceptionally small measurements of of what that angle is doing so they are valuable don't throw these out just because maybe we prefer some decimals uh they work very well now some of the the uh the adding and subtracting are a little bit different because well we don't have a we don't have a base 10 we have a base 60 really 60 seconds is one minute 60 minutes is one degree and so that that can be a little rougher but as far as accuracy that's very accurate also notice one other thing if you ever get more than what that degree is you've done it wrong if these are ever more than 60 you can simplify that also so if you do your conversion you go i now have 89 degrees you go you probably mess that up a little bit because that is 61 and then a fraction of one little degree there and that's what that's saying to you so i hope that makes sense hope you understand where this comes from how i've explained from here to here hopefully pretty well for you and now i want you to practice one so me personally i would go straight from here to here understanding that three minutes is three times one over 60 degrees and 51 seconds is 51 times 1 over 60 times 1 over 60 degrees go ahead and try that now and see what you come up with okay hopefully you've taken the time to go ahead and try this on your own if we're going to convert from degrees minutes and seconds into decimals of a degree we're not converting away from degrees we're not getting something called radians which we're going to talk about in the next video very interesting exceptionally useful and that's what most of our calculus and working angles deals with honestly is is in terms of radians because the formulas work a lot better for a lot of formulas we deal with some are not even really possible very well in degrees so when we have this 101 degrees and then 3 minutes and 51 seconds 101 degrees is going to appear in your final answer so why because the rest of these are fractions or decimal of one degree it will never get you above that degree that's listed here if these are less than 60 each if they're more than 60 it should be translated first anyway it's a little bit nicer to work that way so we say okay well if these are fractions of a degree i can add those portions of the degree and the way we do that is we say that our three minutes is one sixtieth of a degree so if we multiply that we're going to get a decimal for this little part and 51 seconds is one 60 of a minute which is 1 60 of 1 60 of a degree so we multiply twice and we should end up with exactly that now i have a mistake on the board you should see it please please recognize that we are still in degrees and you need to show it so 101 degrees 3 minutes 51 seconds is 101.0641667 degrees i hope it makes sense i hope you're able to get it what we're going to do now is we're going to go backwards i'm going to give you a decimal in a degree i'm going to show you how to translate to minutes and seconds and then we're going to be done with our video all right let's go backwards let's go from a degree measurement of an angle into minutes and seconds i i think this is a little bit easier because you're multiplying by 60 instead of 160 we're going to see that bear out just a bit one thing i do want to mention though is that we should still be able to determine the quadrant in which our angles reside in which they terminate so we should still be able to think about this as hey 18 degrees that doesn't make it to 90 yet that should be in quadrant one and 29 degrees should be in quadrant one the previous examples that 61 degrees and whatever minutes and seconds that 61 degrees is still in quadrant 1 but that 101 degrees that we we converted a little while ago would have been in quadrant two that's past 90 but not to 180. so even though it has minutes and seconds we can still identify the quadrant usually you just look at the degree the minutes and seconds are parts of one degree and so you can determine what quadrant that terminal terminating side or terminal side lies in all right let's get back to it so if we have 18.255 degrees how can we translate that into minutes and seconds well by realizing that that .255 is just a fraction of one degree and so we can write it this way we can say 18.255 degrees is 18 degrees plus 0.255 degrees wait a second one degree is one is 60 minutes and so how this really works out you can think of this as this is 0.255 times 1 degree it's true statement 0.255 times 1 degree is 0.255 degrees but that degree is 60 minutes that one degree is 60 minutes so if i take my 0.255 and multiply by 60 minutes which is the same thing as one degree it's going to give me the number of minutes i have and then a decimal in this case it's 15.3 so this right here if i take my .255 times 60 minutes this is 18 degrees plus 15.3 minutes stick with me i hope that's it making sense i hope that 18 says yes it's my degree no problem this is a fraction of a degree fractions of degree can be translated into a different type of fraction of degree minutes and seconds let's multiply by the 60 minutes that are in our degree so i have 15.3 minutes but wait the 0.3 well this would be 15 full minutes and 0.3 of another minute we can do the same thing as we can here so i'm going to take this down and say this is 18 degrees 15 full minutes and 0.3 of another minute but that minute has 60 seconds in it so we're going to do the same thing as we did here we can say 0.3 minutes is 0.3 times 1 minute that's a true statement but 1 minute is 60 seconds we see right here 1 minute 60 seconds and so because point three minutes is point three times one minute and that one minute has 60 seconds in it we can take that point three and we can multiply it by 60 seconds and get that trans translation or that transformation um into into seconds so 18 degrees plus 15 minutes plus 0.3 times 60 seconds 60 seconds in a minute is 18. that would be 18 seconds and so we can put this all together we can say this is 18 degrees 15 minutes and 18 seconds now which way's better it really depends on the context they mean the same thing this right here is a very very accurate and people understand what that is decimal sometimes we can't wrap our head around really how accurate that's getting sometimes the reverse is true sometimes we really want a decimal version of that that degree so i hope it makes sense on where it's coming from that's the big part understand that 18 degrees is the whole degree and that's a fraction of it so multiplying by 60 will give you a number of minutes multiplying whatever decimal you have by 60 again will give you the number of seconds now this is very convenient for us because .3 times 60 was a whole number if it's not then you're going to round we're going to see that in the next example i want you to try it right now i want you to break it down you don't necessarily have to show all of this stuff what i'd rather you understand is that taking a decimal of a degree is less than one degree and therefore you can multiply by 60 minutes for that degree and get the number of minutes 60 seconds for that the decimal of the minute you get the number of seconds go ahead and try that now see if you can do it all right so we're going to give it a try the first thing we're going to do is we're going to understand that 0.411 is less than 1 degree it's a fraction of 1 degree and it's equal to because 1 degree is 60 minutes it's equal to 0.411 times 60 minutes so we're going to show that so 0.411 times 60 minutes well that is 24.66 so what that means is if there's 60 minutes in one degree and we have point four one one of one degree then that's going to be 24 minutes now 24.66 minutes well that's all well and good but if we're trying to get away from the decimals and into minutes and seconds this says you have 24 full minutes but .66 of the next minute and that next minute has 60 seconds in it so we're going to break that up or say this is 24 minutes plus 0.66 of the next minute notice how it's not just 66 seconds notice how 66 seconds would be very inappropriate to write you can't get above that otherwise you start counting minutes remember that if you were to actually count on a clock here once you get to 60 seconds you you don't really go 6162 you go oh that's one minute and one sec or yeah one minute and one second or one minute and two seconds you start counting the next next place value over and in this case since we're base 60 you're counting up minutes every time you get to 60 seconds so that can't be right what that means is that's a fraction of one minute but wait a minute one minute contains 60 seconds let's multiply if that's 0.66 of one minute and one minute has 60 seconds and 0.66 times 60 seconds gives us 39.6 39.6 seconds typically we're going to round this so in this case that is more accurate than what we're going to get because we're going to round this to 40 seconds and when we put that all together notice how we're still 29 whole degrees and a fraction of that next degree but written in terms of minutes and seconds and not just a decimal that's about it that's how we can translate from our minutes and seconds into a decimal version of degree or in from degrees and with decimals into minutes and seconds i've explained both of them hopefully pretty well for you hopefully you understand how they're they're used uh sometimes people get really kind of confused with um minutes and seconds because they don't know where they come from and now that you do hopefully it makes more sense to you so we're done with this now it's about as far as we need to go it's just that understanding and next time we're going to explore something different so we've explored how one full rotation sweeping out a full rotation with an angle is 360 degrees we're going to talk after we because we talked about minutes and seconds already we're going to talk about how we can measure that a different way we can measure with some angles with something called radians and it's a completely different thought on where that angle comes from so i'll see you for that video that's a really important one don't skip it and come prepared to really really focus on it alright have a great day 

Transcript for: Introduction to Radians (Precalculus - Trigonometry 3)
hey welcome to another video so in this video you're going to learn about radians so we're going to learn about radians and how they're different from degrees where they come from where they see what the foundation of them is and how to convert between them actually it's probably the next video but we're going to have a very good foundation when we get there about why in the world they are different how they're different how to how to use them so here's where radian stems from a radian is an angular relationship between a radius and an arc length that's equal to that radius in other words if you take a radius of a circle a central angle that cuts an arc and compare them a radian is the angle that makes the arc equal to the radius and that's what that statement says it's kind of kind of wordy but a radian is a central a angle needed on any circle and that's a big point it doesn't matter whether the circle is small or large one radian is the same relationship on any circle that we have very much like one degree it doesn't matter the size of the circle one degree represents a swept out angle well a radian does the same thing but it's measured differently it's a relationship between a radius and an arc length being equal and so the radian on a central angle a radian is a central angle needed on any circle to make the arc subtended which basically just means this arc that's cut by two radii equal to the radius so how's it look if we really wrap your heads around what the idea is it's kind of a simple idea the idea is hey take a circle and cut an arc with two radii that's equal to the radius that's what it says it says if your radius is one or your radius is four i'm going to put that up there in a minute if your radius is one or four or 20 or 0.5 it doesn't matter if you take those radii they're going to be the same from the center of a circle that's what a radius is it's the distance from the center to the edge of your circle and you start opening that well your arc length that portion of the circle that you're cutting is growing and growing and growing and growing if you make it so that the arc length is equal to each of the radii which have to be equal almost looks like an equilateral triangle except one side is the arc well then once you have that angle that central angle that's at the center of the circle is called one radian that's that's the unit of measurement that we use for radiance it's what it means it's not some magic thing it's very much like a degree but measured differently so the size of one radian never changes it's just the relationship that makes the radii equal to the arc length that they are cutting and so i'm going to show that to you so let's suppose that we have a unit circle what a unit circle is is a circle with a radius of one i don't even care what the unit is notice how those radii are creating a central angle and also how those radii once they're they're opening that arc length if that's equal to the radius whatever units they are then the angle around the center of that circle right here that is one radian let's call that alpha for now we would say that alpha is one radian that's where that comes from now what if the radius is four it doesn't really matter as long as or 14 whatever as long as the arc that's cut by two radii equals the radius itself well then the angle swept out the central angle that central angle is just an angle that has its vertex at the center of a circle let's call that alpha as well alpha is also equal to right one radian we can sort of abbreviate that rad sometimes you'll see that which is kind of rad uh anyhow that that's all the radian is so if you really want the long story you're basically just opening up two radii and cutting a portion of the circle that's a subtended arc that's equal to the radius and on any circle you do that the angle that you get is one radian i hope that makes sense i hope that it's kind of taking away some of the confusion maybe you heard this word rating i have no idea what that means well this is exactly what that means now on the on the other hand what if we open up an angle of 1 radian could you tell what the arc was very easily it would be equal to a radius well what happens if the angle isn't exactly 1 radian well then we can use a proportion to find it i'm going to walk you through that right now so let's suppose that we have a radius r and r and we're going to open this up exactly one radian where alpha is equal to one radian now do you know the alpha is one radian right now you kind of have to because if this is r and that is r and the arc that's subtended or cut by those radii is also r we understand that's the definition of what a radian is and so we we would know right now it looks kind of like an equilateral triangle of course it's not because we have an arc but if radius equals radius which it has to that's the center so that has to be that way but if this is also equal to r that arc that is one radian in the middle you have to trust that because that's the definition of what a gradient is so what happens if we have a smaller or larger angle can we figure out the arc length from that i'm going to walk you through how to do that hopefully it's obvious to you that this would still be r and this would still be r but this right here would not let's call this arc length s and let's call this angle here theta in your head right now i want you thinking is theta 1 radian is it more or less well it kind of looks less we don't really know it's not really down on the scale but we do know a few things about this we know that this would all be one radius or the whatever the radius is because they all stem from the center of the circle we do know that if this arc length is r that that is one radian if this is less than r this would be less than one radian by a predictable amount on the other hand we know that if this is one radian that creates an arc that's equal to radius if this angle is less than one radian it's going to create an arc that's less than your radius and by a predictable amount by a proportion and so we can find a very nice formula for arc length right now i'm going to show you how to do that if we have this proportion where the radius compared to the angle or the i should say the arc length the arc length compared to the angle that cuts it has to be in the same proportion as the arc length compared to its respective angle that cuts it or subtends that arc length so let's look real careful make sure we understand it make sure we understand that hey r this arc length compared to alpha which is when radian we'll get to that in just a second must be the same proportion as a smaller arc length cut by a smaller angle those have to be equal i hope you're seeing i hope you've seen the proportion r sort of equals s yeah they're the arc length idea and alpha sort of equals or corresponds to corresponds to that theta we can put that in the same relationship now one thing that i just said please remember that in order for this r to be the radius and the arc length this angle has to be one radian now this is a big deal because what it means is that the formula we're creating will not work for degrees it will only work for radians why because it's built into our proportion and so we're going to say that this is 1 radian now if we hadn't done that then we can use some some things with degrees but we do do that and we see this formula very often in math where s is going to equal r times theta and a lot of people try to use that for degrees you can probably see it's going to happen and that's wrong because we're making this assumption that we're dealing with one radian to get that arc length of r so if r divided by one rating the arc length that's created by one radian well okay that we have that's gonna be equal to the radius has to still be in the same proportion as a smaller arc length compared or a different arc length compared to a different angle if we multiply both sides by theta if we multiply both sides by theta check this out what we really have multiply both sides by theta this is going to say all right theta cancels here we got theta we got all r times theta but notice something what happens of that that really would be down here now now use your unit conversions to think about what it would take in order to cancel out that idea of a radium that unit well that's a unit of length r is an arc length and it equals the radius because we had chosen an angle of one radian but that's a unit of length it'd be like centimeters or meters or feet or whatever well this is a radian that's one unit one rate one of that particular unit of a radian in order for that to be cancelled this has to be measured in radians do you see it are you seeing that your angle would have to be radians to get rid of that unit so that your arc length matches the units here that's very important if you try to plug in into degrees sorry plug in degrees to the formula we're about to get you're going to run into some very major issues now if we hadn't put one rate in there it would be okay but we'd have to have a degree a degree for that particular relationship between radius and arc length that are equal so going back to here just making a note on this this only works for radians because of what we did right there and so their units simplify so our length is always equal to r times theta the central angle that's creating that or subtending that arc but it only works for radians i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing the why why that is so if you want to do a little recap we're going to do some convergence here in just a little bit uh finding arc length and finding some angles from this but if you want a little recap here here it is a little 20 second recap radians are different than degrees in how they are measured so a degree is 1 360 of a circle or a rotation around stopping where you start a radian is is different from that a radian comes from a circle idea and it says what a reading is is if you have a radius one radian is a central angle that's needed in order to create an arc length that's cut by two radii that equals the radii so basically open it up and tell the arc length equals the radius and you have a radian now we work a lot with radians and this is the first formula that we really get with it and you can see it only works with radians and this happens very frequently in math where we get some formulas that only work with a certain type of angle in this case that angle is radians and it has to be there in order for our units to cancel right here in fact everyone knows us so much they don't even put over 1 radian because we understand it only works for radians and that's why we don't put that but can you see how a lot of students who don't grasp this you've never seen this before they go radiant i don't know just whatever let's put anything in there it doesn't work it does not work and so make sure that you understand that this only works for ratings because the reasons i've said don't plug in degrees like some students are prone to do don't be one of those students now let's go ahead and see if we can find arc length from angles and angles from arc length so let's suppose we have a couple examples we have a circle with a radius of 6 feet and we have a central angle of 1 3 radians notice how i have to put that radians there otherwise we have no idea that we're dealing with any sort of angle whatsoever it's definitely not degrees so what that means is that we have this idea of oh right well what if this angle isn't one radian one full radian it's just a third of a radian well we should understand what that means now we understand that that arc length should be well not as big as the radius it should be a actually a third of that and that's exactly what this formula does it's very very nice so we can use it but it's kind of an intuitive idea it's just a proportion so let's set it up 4 radians because of that right there you got to cancel that out that you know our arc length is always equal to the radius times the central angle that's creating the arc length now it appears here that we have a unit issue it appears that we we're looking to go okay 6 feet times 1 3 radians would be let's see two feet radians but because of where the formula comes from assuming that we're dealing with a uh first subtended arc length that's created by one radian this really has this over one rating idea we normally don't put that radian because of that reason because i explained to you that this only works for radians we only try to plug in radians and we rarely show that but it is there and we would get just six feet times one-third that's two two feet so if you have a radius of six feet and you have this arc that's subtended by an angle of one-third radians a central angle one-third radians that arc length is going to be exactly two feet it's kind of cool that we we can measure around a circle we use this for some very valuable things in fact in a little while we're going to use it on how to convert between degrees and radians radians and degrees now let's do the next one what if we had a radius of 12 meters an arc length of 16 meters could we figure out the central angle that's needed to create that that situation now now think about it if this arc length is more than the radius your central angle should certainly be more than one radian and that's what's going to bear out for us we can still set up the same way and when we put this in here we understand that when we when we substitute and evaluate this we'd have 16 meters as our arc length we got a radius of 12 meters times whatever our angle is now keep in mind because this only works for radians when you divide 16 meters by 12 meters and you get four thirds the meters cancel and it appears that theta is a unitless measurement it's not radians are built in it's right here we just don't write it so just keep that in mind when we get an angle out of formulas that only work with radians they're in terms of radians so four thirds of a radian or one and one thirds radians or one point three three three three radians i'm really hoping i explained it well enough for you for you to understand what a rating is where it comes from the relationship i know i've repeated myself several times i'm doing it on purpose so that we understand what it really comes from because we're about to start converting between degrees and radians and we need to understand several things about them number one that while they measure differently they can do very similar things tell you the size of an angle that sweeps out an arc or a portion of x y axis we need to be very comfortable going back and forth between them but we also need to understand that a lot of the formulas that we deal with only work with one type of unit measurement or you have to convert or go back and redevelop the formula so be careful with that most of our our trigonometry as we deal with calculus is in radians almost all of it there's a few times when that's not the case but almost all of it deals with this radiance it's just the general way that the people go it's a little bit nicer you're going to get a lot of pies like 3 pi over 2 and things like that and so we're gonna we're going to get into that next video i'm going to show you how to convert between degrees radians radians and degrees so i'll see you for that you 

Transcript for: Converting Radians and Degrees (Precalculus - Trigonometry 4)
hey there welcome to another video i hope that you're doing well and i hope that you watch the last video on what radians really were because what we're going to get into is how to convert between degrees and radians why well because both units of measurement of angles are very important and they're used in real life quite often a lot of our math is going to be geared toward radians a lot of real life stuff is geared toward degrees and we have to be very comfortable and confident with using both of them and so what we're going to do today right now is learn how to convert between radians and degrees if you've ever studied radians and you've heard of them and you really don't didn't know hopefully watchlist video didn't really know what they meant hopefully now you do hopefully you understand where radiant is this idea of the angle that's needed on the center of a circle to sweep out an arc length or cut or subtend an arc that is equal to the radius that's it that's all it is it's different than degrees and a lot of formulas only work with them so but if you understand that you and you've been or maybe you didn't understand that and you've you've seen some of the radians like what does pi over 3 mean why why do radiant type measurements have a lot of pies in them why do why do we get that why do we have this man we get 3 pi over 2 or whatever we have or 2 3 pi or 2 pi over 3 or negative pi y is pi so involved with radians we're going to find that out today so let's get started with it what we learned last video was that if we have an arc length that's cut by some central angle theta we can determine what that arc length is or if we have a radius and arc length we can determine the angle is needed to get that particular argument then we had a formula and we made a big note that said this is only for theta radians because there is a one radian idea built into that proportion from when we did it last video so i hope you watch it i hope you remember that we did a couple examples not too many of them we're going to get to some applications a little bit but let's come back to an idea let's come back to this idea of arc length is proportionally related to the central angle that cuts it what if what if we took this circle here with a radius of who cares just r and we went not just a little angle not just a big central angle but a full on rotation around that that circle so if we went and measured this counterclockwise so positive and it sweeps out one entire revolution so our our theta here is the central angle that terminates the radius where it initiated hopefully on the positive x-axis we should have got the whole thing well then what would the arc length be well the arc length would be s and we'd say okay well we know a couple things about this right we know that arc length equals r times theta but we know a little bit more uh we know that arc length is also the full circumference of a circle here so so this is kind of cool this says if we sweep out an entire central angle that represents one full rotation it terminates where it begins it's going to have an arc length of the entire circle which is the circumference and that's what that angle represents well then we can keep on going and say hey that that arc length we know that we know circumference of a circle in this case would equal arc length but circumference of a circle is 2 pi r which says that in this particular case if we allow that central angle to be the entire circle there then 2 pi r would be our arc length the circumference and that would equal r times theta now here's what this means watch very carefully remember that theta is in terms of radians it's always radians for this formula we just use this formula we just said hey imagine the state is the entire swept out portion of that circle it makes one revolution then the arc length is the entire circumference of the circle but we know the circumference circumference is always 2 pi r so if the arc length is the full circumference the circumference is 2 pi r then 2 pi r has to equal r times theta radians and we're going to remember that this was over 1 radian that is why this had to be only in radians so if we remember that we understood that this had to be in terms of radians 2 cancel it out well if we want to divide by r which we can certainly do because r is not zero if r were zero we wouldn't have a real circle we'd have a little dot we had that which had no breadth it would not have this this idea of a circle to it so provided that we have a real circle here we can divide by r and we can get 2 pi r's would cancel equals theta over 1 radian let's multiply both sides by 1 radian and here's what this means i hope that you followed me i hope that you saw that if we sweep out one entire rotation of a circle and that is our angle a central angle represents that entire circle and our radius here's our our arc length is going to be the entire circumference of a circle which we know to be 2 pi r so arc length is circumference we know that arc length also equals radius times theta in terms of radians if we divide by r we have that there are two pi radians in one rotation of a circle one full circle now that's impressive but it's also where all that pie junk comes from so when we see oh man when we work with radians is always pi over 3 or pi over 4 or 5 pi over 6 y is always have pi in it because of this right here because of circumference actually so because circumference represents the entire arc length and we divide both sides by r we get the central angle needed to represent that arc length well the arc length the the central angle is now too high because of that circumference and everything that we do that cuts that angle smaller is cutting the circumference not circumference but arc length smaller and so it's based on a proportion of two pi let's say that again willing to sink in because the full circumference is 2 pi r and hence we get the central angles 2 pi anything that has a smaller angle will have a proportionally smaller arc length but that's based on the circumference of 2 pi r so it's a proportion of 2 pi for the central angle that we're dealing with which is why those radians always have pi in them almost always have pi in them it's because of that reason so i hope that you're seeing that connection it's not magic it's just the circumference that's it we're taking parts of it to create central angles smaller than the theta creates the arc length of a full circle let's go ahead and let's let's go a little further but wait a second one full rotation of a circle contains two pi radians we also know something we know that one full revolution circle is 180 degrees sorry 360 degrees if one full revelation revolution is two pi radians and one full revolutions 360 degrees then those two things have to be equal they both represent the same exact measurement of an angle that has the circumference of the circle i hope that makes sense to you it should be kind of straightforward i suppose uh one full revolution or rotation or whatever you want to call it had 360 degrees that was the definition of what a degree was 1 360th of a circle or rotational revolution but we also found out that there's two pi radians in that same measurement so they must be equal and this gives us a way to convert between radians and degrees just depends on what you want to solve for so if we divide both sides by 360. we would get one degree we can simplify that a little bit so 2 and 360 have that common factor of 2 so we can reduce this to pi over 180 this is actually how we convert between degrees to radians if we understand that one degree is pi over 180 radians that's pretty small right because think about that pi well pi would be half of a circle and if we divide that into 180 little parts well 100 that's pretty it's pretty little there in 180 little parts that's going to be one degree so pi over 180 radians is that one degree now what if we divided both sides by two pi well then we're going to get one radian equals into this terms of degrees so let's divide both sides here's one way divided by 360. let's divide both sides by two pi with a very similar simplification we would get one radian equals 180 degrees over pi or 180 over pi degrees is a good way to state that as well so one radian this thing that represents this central angle that represents an arc length being equal to the radius that one radian is equal to 180 degrees divided by pi that would be the degree measurement it would take for a radius to equal a subtended arc length in any circle that we have these are also the ways that we go ahead and convert we're going to practice a couple in just a second but i want to get you used to two different starts of a unit circle we'll talk about unit circles in a little while if you've ever seen one i'm going to show you where they come from and a very easy way to to remember it because you will you'll want to memorize it you'll want to not have to always look back at the inner circle even though a teacher might give it to you it's really nice to have it down and so we're going to learn kind of two different types of unit circles one based on degrees and one based on radians because they're they need to be interchangeable on your head because we use both of them so how we started with an x y axis or coordinate system we said this initial side always starts on the positive x-axis and if our terminal side ends right where it initiates we'd have an angle of zero degrees or if we did one full revolution or rotation we would get 360 degrees if we went to one of the first quadrant angle we would get 90 degrees second quadrant angle was 180 degrees 270 degrees and we also know that we could measure clockwise negatively so negative 90 negative 180 negative 270 negative 360 degrees am i going to show that but that was something that we could do now what happens if we have these these radian measurements well if we have no let's think about what this comes from if we have no angle being swept out then that idea of hey your terminal side doesn't move from your initial side there's no distance between them so to speak then you still have an angle of zero whether you have radians or whether you have degrees so we'd still have zero but it'd be in terms of radians don't put the degree there now what would happen if i go all the way around the circle one full revolution well we learned that right here we said one full revolution is equal to two pi radians so on this different type of way to represent our angles you'd have 0 or 2 pi for the positive x-axis but they're in terms of radians now now what happens let's think about this what happens if we go to half of a circle well think logically about that if one forward relation or rotation is two pi then half of that would be two pi over wait a minute 2 pi over 2 would just give us pi so the second quadrant angle there would be pi pi and 180 degrees are equivalent units of measurement for your angles that's kind of what it says here pi over 180 and pi over 1 over 180 over pi represents like this idea of one it's the same thing when you're comparing those measurements degrees and radians now what if you did only a fourth so we know that one full revolution was two pi we already studied that we said if we cut that in half that'd be half a revolution that'd be pi but what about half of that what about a quarter of a revolution well it seems that if this is pi radians half of that would be pi divided by 2 and that's exactly what we get for that positive y axis there it will come about that you will memorize that 90 degrees and pi over 2 mean the same thing and they do whether you have the first quadrant angle representative degrees which 90 or the first quadrant angle represented range which is pi over 2 they mean the same thing now what about the last one well if we count by pi over 2's that might be a good way to go so 0 pi over 2 1 pi over 2 2 pi over 2 which would be 1 pi or 3 pi over 2 and if we go a little bit further we get 4 pi over 2 but 4 pi over 2 is 2 pi that's exactly what we can do here too 90 nothing plus another 90's 180 plus another 9270 plus another 90's 360. pi over 2 plus another pi over 2 plus another pi over 2 plus another pi over 2 gives us every one of those quadrant angles this is what i'd like you to know i'd like you to know what the quadrant angles are whether we're talking about degrees or radians it's very valuable it's going to start us off on what a unit circle is in just a couple more videos and then we're going to use that for basically the rest of our math lives you're always be coming back to a unit circle or at least having your head and understanding the translations between them so i hope this has made sense to you so far we're going to come back and show you some conversions between radians and degrees but at this point we really need to understand the interplay between what a circumference of a circle is the fact that this arc length is that circumference and this is the reason why we get a lot of pi's in our radiant type measurements so i hope it's making sense i'll see a little bit for uh for some conversions now that you have hopefully a good idea about where the the conversions come from between degrees and radians radius degrees we're ready to do a few examples i know that i probably could have just given that to you and you would have been fine but a lot of times students do not understand why readings have pie in them and i really need to see i wanted you to see and understand that it's based on the circumference of a circle and proportions thereof and that's where that comes from so now i'm going to show you how to use this we're going to go from degrees to radians that's typically a little bit easier to do as far as understanding where the quadrants are because we're more used to degrees and then i'm going to show you a nice way to count with radians i'll show you exactly how to do that so let's uh let's go ahead and get right into it if we ever have to convert from degrees to radians here's the idea one degree is equal to pi over 180 radians and so that's substitutable and so what we're going to do every time we change from degrees into radians we're going to show that we're going to show that hey 60 degrees is the same thing as 60 times 1 degree but because we know one degree has the same central angle measurement as pi over 180 radians so remember pi is 180 it's a straight line the angle of a straight line is 180 or it's pi if we divide that into 180 parts well then we get what run rating of one degree really represents and so we'd say okay this is 60 times one degree but because one degree is pi over 180 radians we can make that substitution you're going to really like it when your numerator and denominator simplify it's going to give you what are nice for radians and this is what happens here so i'm going to start trying to introduce some of the very common radiant type measurements for us to get used to them so 60 divided by 180 well that's going to be one-third and so we have pi over three and we typically write that way we usually don't see 1 3 pi we see pi divided by 3 and simplified fractions within that so 60 degrees is the same it's the same thing as pi over 3. now i really want to start thinking about the quadrants also we need to be very good at understanding that 60 degrees and pi over 3 represent the same thing and they're in the same quadrant so 60 degrees very nice on this sort of degree driven unit circle which is where we're going or degree driven xy plane so 60 degrees we probably understand that's somewhere between 0 and 90 closer to the 90. can you do the same thing with pi over 3 the answer is yeah i'm going to give you a the way that i think about this here's what i understand about it and hopefully this works for you too if i know that pi represents this straight angle is what they call that or the second quadrant angle if i understand pi represents that i always think about my straight angle like the upper half of my xy plane and i cut that into whatever my denominator says so my denominator says cut that into one two three parts so first part second part third part i've got a picture in my head now my numerator says how many of those parts to count so one remember one part two parts this would be the third part my numerator says count one of those parts well i know i haven't made it past halfway yet so that's going to be in the first quadrant still that's how i always do it so again i take my straight angle that represents pi remember that is pi my denominator cuts it my numerator counts it for me that's the easiest way to go about do it i don't make mistakes because of that i would think okay this would be one two three i'm sweeping out numerator one of them that's the same exact quadrant same exact angle is 60 degrees and get used to it that those are the same of the interchangeable now how about 150 degrees 150 degrees well we can write that as 150 times 1 degree but because that degree is pi over 80 radians 180 i should say we can simplify it it's not as nice but remember that 150 and 180 are both divisible by 10 and 3 so that means 30. so that would be 5 over 6. now you can divide both by 10 get 15 over 18. then divide both those numbers by 3 that also works you get 5 over 6 either way we get 5 pi over 6 radians you know what as some some students they just hate to simplify these things just leave it um you can you can't it's not appropriate but you can't leave it and it doesn't mean the same thing but think about this in order to count that would you really want to divide that up into 180 parts and count 150 of them or would you rather divide the straight angle by six and count five of them well that's a little bit nicer to do so let's look back at this figure out the quadrants for both of these angles represent the same angle represent two different ways 150 degrees yeah that's going to be somewhere between 90 and 180 60 degrees past 90 30 degrees from 180 so that's going to be closer to 180 than the 90. well now let's think about how that would affect our movement or our terminal terminal side on our our radian driven xy plane so 5 pi over 6 is what here's what i think of i think of here's my straight angle of pi if i divide that into six parts that would be one two three four five six so three parts would equal that pi over 2. three parts of six is halfway through so i'm going to count one two three four five or one two three four five that gives me the same angle as 150 degrees but just in terms of radians so i know both of them because of the same end up in quadrant two just getting in the in the habit of thinking of that so that pi represents straight line denominator cuts it numerator counts it hopefully that helps it helps always help me how about negative 45 degrees well negative 45 degrees we know that measuring clockwise 45 degrees is right between 0 and negative 90. so we're going to be in that quadrant quadrant number four if we convert this to radians it should yield the same result notice how the conversion between degrees and radians has nothing to do with the sine so whether you measure degrees positively or negatively you're going to measure ratings the same direction so negative 45 degrees negative 45 times 1 degree we know that negative 45 times 1 degree can be represented as that pi over 180 radians and if we simplify that well 45 and 180 45 goes into 180 how many times 45 goes into 90 twice 90 goes into 180 twice it's four times this would be negative pi over four but now we're talking about in terms of radians so let's think negative means i'm still going to go clockwise pi over 4 all right well if i think about this as pi then pi over 4 would cut that pi over 4 that forward cut that into four pieces so here's my here's my pi my straight angle i would count one two that would be halfway through and then three four so my four pieces are here here here and here well i'm counting now just one of them the denominator cuts it the numerator counts it so this would cut one part two parts three parts four i'm going to count down one of them that's still in quadrant four that's the same exact angle as negative 45 degrees represent a slightly different way last one 107 this is nasty and when you simplify it it's not going to work in that case it's okay to use decimals but we start running into an issue of how to represent that on a unit circle or xy plane that has radians let me show you that in a second so 170 degrees would say all right well 107 times 1 degree we know we're measuring counterclockwise we know that we're past 90 by 17 degrees so that's just about right there so we know we're in quadrant two and we would get 107 pi over 180 radians if you didn't simplify and it doesn't simplify it but that's very hard to think about why because you'd have to think of 180 little parts on a straight angle and count 107 of them well that ends up being exactly 17 degrees past 90. in which case this would be a better way to go like you'd think about it a little bit easier when that happens and it doesn't simplify it's appropriate to use a decimal i think i get 2.8 or something like that oh sorry about 1.8 1.868 so on your calculator just do 170 times pi show pi button divided by 180 and you'll get that one point now how in the world could we get 1.868 in terms of radians on that go i i don't know that's all in pies this is not pie so so in the world this is a radiant stone so so think about it if pi is you should know pi you should know that pi is approximately 3.14 all right well half of 3.14 is what 1.57 so half of that this is 1.57 1.68 is past that that's one way that we start thinking about where these radians lie even if we don't have the pi i'm restraining myself from making jokes about rhymes but i have to so that 1.86 well that that's that's past that 1.57 so that would still be in quadrant two now notice how that was a bit more difficult to deal with right because you had to you had to approximate a lot to get there and that's what we have to do when we can't simplify and have it in terms of some sort of a nice denominator to cut our pie into that's where 180 is divisible by our denominator that makes things nice and that's going to yield some very nice things for radians if you're 180 your pi is divisible by your denominator that's a nice thing to be able to to to deal with anyhow um what if i had like 90 degrees so we should understand this that we've already kind of done it if i'm giving you 90 degrees and actually change to radians it's a really easy conversion you're going to get pi over two and the reason for that is because if we have 90 over 180 we're going to get a denominator of two and that's going to be a nice quadrant angle for us you don't see that super often we're gonna see here but that that can happen now let's go backwards what if we have radians and we we want degrees let's give that a try all right so we know that pi over six radians this radian type angle measurement but we also know what one radian is one radian equals 180 degrees over pi so we can go about the same conversion just backwards so pi over six radians is the same thing as pi over six times one radian you're taking a fraction of that radian but one radian is 180 degrees of apply and lots of things are going to simplify it's kind of fun okay i like doing that oh the pies are gone and 180 divided by 6 is going to give you well it's going to give you 30 degrees can we determine where both of these lie well pi over 6 means 1 out of that pi cut into six parts so if pi is a straight angle and we're gonna cut that into six part denominator cuts it numerator counts it cut it into six parts one two three four five six now count one of them oh that's right there so denominator had cut in six parts and the numerator just counts it up which counts one of those six parts that's going to be a very low not very low a lower angle closer to zero than pi over two but your your angle certainly being quadrant one they go up 30 degrees 30 degrees is one third of this distance just like uh this was one third of this distance so 30 degrees closer to zero than 90 that's the same angle they're both in quadrant one let's keep on going how about three pi over two radians now if we're in radians we go through the same conversion we can still take that three pi over two times one radian 1 radian is the same thing as 180 degrees over pi pi simplified i would probably do 180 divided by two and then multiply by three but you have a calculator it'd be kind of nice to do a fraction times 180. either way you go you're going to get 270 degrees and we kind of should see that right here's three pi over 2 that's quadrangle here's 270 degrees it needs to be the same and we see the math here that it does it does equal the same thing don't forget to put the degree how about negative 3 pi over 4 radians we can still measure angles negatively with radians just like i showed you a little earlier with that negative 45 degrees and the conversion's the same it's not going to change the sign of your angle measurement or the direction in which you angle you you measured your angle so we take our negative three pi over four times one radian we know what run rating is we know one radian is pi 180 degrees over pi so the pies will simplify 180 divided by 4 probably a little easier to do than 3 times 180 divided by 4. so 180 divided by 4 is going to be let's see divided by 2 90 divided by 2 you get 45. 45 times 3 well that's going to give you 135 so negative 135 degrees let's think about the quadrants and see if it actually makes sense so negative 135 degrees is negative 90 not negative not past 180 though negative 90 and then halfway between negative 90 and negative 180 that's almost like having a 45 degree angle starting from here and going downward and that's exactly what we get from something called a reference angle we would get something very similar to that so negative 135 degrees or we can think negative 3 pi over 4. just do the same thing here's your here's your straight angle of pi if you cut into four parts that would be one two three and then four now we're counting numerator negative three of them so denominator cuts it into four parts numerator counts it one two three that's going to be still in quadrant three for us so we can we cut one two three four parts and count three one two three that's quadrant three it's the same exact angle as negative 135 degrees and they they mean the same thing we just got to be very good at and uh and going back and forth between them and the reason why i'm sending so much time is so that you you're starting to see them you start to make the connections that they are measuring the same angles in two different ways and that they they're interchangeable so we're gonna do two more examples and then we'll be done all right we've got just a couple more examples so let's get after these two and then we're gonna be done how about 7 pi over 3 radians now we're going to convert that to degrees and i've done something kind of tricky we can still measure more than one full rotation on this it's okay to do that with radians as well and we can still convert to degrees the same exact way but let's start thinking about the quadrant here let's say i took my straight angle of pi and i cut it into three parts that would look like one two three now if i had to count seven of them i'd have to think of a little bit further than that one two three four five six notice that my numerator is counting more than the six parts that would that this denominator would cut two pi into so what i'd be doing is thinking straight angle does one two three another straight angle does one two three that's six and then one more so if i had to count this remember what we do your denominator cuts your straight angle into that many pieces so first straight angle is one two three second string angle is four five six multiples of three next triangle is seven so we are going to end up in quadrant one here this would be cut this into three parts one two three cut the next right angle in three parts one two three cut the next triangle straight angle in three parts and then go to the first one so that's one two three four five six and then seven so we're going to be 60 degrees above that that zero that that first initial side um when we do our conversion but we're going to have gone one full rotation around there to get there or pi over three past zero but haven't gone one full rotation to get there so we're still in quadrant one if we convert two degrees that's seven pi over three times one radian for sure but that one radian is 180 degrees over pi the pies are nice they simplify 180 degrees divided by 3 is 60. 60 times 7 is 420. well let's think about that 420 degrees probably right away for you is a lot easier to think about than seven pi over three because this is nice and and countable by 94 so we can 90 180 270 360 and then let's see 420 is 60 degrees past that so we've gone all the way around and then 60 degrees puts us well into quadrant one at the same angle as that ended but with a different type of a measurement so we're still quadrant one we've gone one full rotation in 60 degrees or pi over three degrees or pi over three radians past that they represent the same thing last one four ratings there's no pies what are you going to do with no pies well if you have no pies it's not going to cancel and you're going to probably end up with a decimal so 4 radians before we go any further and do that four radians think about where that would be on a unit circle on this x y plane do you remember that pi is 3.14 because remember that this is the number of radians this is zero radians this is pi over 2 radians that's like 3.14 divided by 2. this is pi radians that's 3.14 radians this is in terms of radians so where would four radians fit well if this is point one four radians this would be three times three point one four divided by two that's like four and a half a little over four and a half so four radians would be somewhere between three point one four and close to four and a half somewhere between that that is what 4 radians would be now that's in quadrant 3. let's see if the same thing works out with our degrees so 4 times 1 radian and nothing simplifies nicely so in this case yeah you just take 4 times 180 and divide by pi what we're going to get is 229.18 degrees if we if we approximate that well where is 229 degrees here's 180 so going half of a rotation but not as much as 270. granted this is much easier to place on this then four radians is on that because we'd have to think about pi in terms of a decimal number that we kind of understand when we're putting four on there i hope that makes sense i've gone hope i tried to go above and beyond and give you some examples that are a little weird but the main thing i hope that you you have realized is that both are very valuable we'll be using value using these in all of our math radians are what we typically use for formulas so i'm trying to get you used to it i hope that you understand the conversions and but most importantly where they came from where where we understood that because the circumference of a circle is 2 pi r we divide by r radians have pi's in them a lot because it's a proportion of that circumference that we're sweeping out with a central angle i hope that you you notice the idea of cutting your straight angle with your denominator and counting it with your numerator that's helped me out tremendously i hope it helps you out i hope i've done a good job i've explained this to you i hope i've explained it well enough for you to understand i hope that you're ready for another video we're going to go for for some real life examples here in just a little bit have a great day 

Transcript for: Area of a Sector, Angular Velocity, Applications (Precalculus - Trigonometry 5)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to do a few applications of some angles as they relate to some circles so things that involve arc length and area of a sector and then some angular speed so that'll be kind of interesting and we'll figure out how fast we're going at a certain location on the planet earth so that'll be kind of fun so just a few things to get us realizing that these angles are very useful and i've picked three examples that i thought were kind of fun so let's get right into it so i live at about 48 point whatever that is degrees latitude and there's a city that i have to go to and i've been to a few times that's at 43.6 so odd degrees latitude and roughly the same longitude so if you're not familiar with latitude and longitude every line of longitude is a great circle a great circle means a circle that goes around a sphere that if you cut it would pass the center of that sphere longitude goes between the poles and always those circles would go through the center latitude is like climbing up the the um the face of the earth from south pole to north pole and so only one of those is a great circle at the equator all the rest are minor circles they don't go through the center if you were to cut of make it smaller and smaller and smaller so if we are at this many degrees latitude versus another degrees latitude and it's on roughly the same longitude so a great circle which means the radius would be the same from the center of the circle to those two cities can we find out how far apart they are now of course it's going to take a lot more miles to drive this than what it is because we got hills and detours and i like to stop and take breaks and see cool things but could we find out the the literal distance if the earth was a perfect sphere and we can we can't with just the the length of an arc so our plane so let's do this if we have this this picture in our head of on one circle we have a difference of 48 basically minus 43 degrees if we find the difference between those two locations of latitude on that one longitude that can be our angle that sweeps out or subtends a certain arc length all we need to know after that is what our radius is so when we run into problems like this and we're thinking this is on a circle we can do things like subtract angles and get a distance or an angle between them which is very nice to do so we're going to do that first so let's take our 48.6 ish degrees minus our 43.6 degrees and the difference between those angles will be the distance orbit practically that that angle between them and that only works because they're on roughly the same longitude if they weren't don't you imagine this if they weren't on the same longitude you'd have a great circle going this way and another one going a different way you'd have some sort of a a distance between them kind of sideways if you will not straight up and down that's why it required this in the same longitude so so practically if we have this ball then we're going on one great circle from one city to another that's going to be the same radius to the center that's going to be one straight let's say above the other and that's why we can subtract these angles if this wasn't there this would be a problem so when we subtract that we get about 5.1 but we're going to be a little more specific 5.083055 degrees so given that and that the radius is about three thousand nine hundred sixty miles from uh any longitude to the center of the earth the longitude remembers it's a great circle and so it goes all around around the earth and if you recut it would go through the center so therefore the radius from that to any longitude of which both of these are on the same one is 3960 miles um so that's our radius from the center to protein well i mean the earth isn't a perfect sphere but if it were to any point on that sphere including these two and this becomes kind of a nice problem really easy actually arc length would give us the distance from one point to another on a circle since we're on the same circle remember that was heat then we're finding the distance from this first city to the second one by simply finding our r plane so 3960 miles times 5.08 3055 degrees whatever that that distance between those angles are or the difference between the angles now of course there's a problem with this and i really hope that you see it whenever and it's meant it's such a common mistake i see it all the time whenever we're given something in degrees which is great can we use it for formulas that are not based on degrees well no this is what was so important about understanding that with degrees and radians a lot of our formulas only work in radians or we have to convert them i mentioned that last video and now we're seeing it in play so this right here this works only if we have radians why because there's really this hidden over one rating when we started to create uh that proportion so this is only in radians you can't do this can you see how a lot of students would make that mistake they go oh yeah i get miles i got an angle let's multiply that we're going to get i don't know close to 20 000 miles probably not because the circumference of the earth on any great circle is only about 25 to 26 000 miles so probably not with only five degrees what happened there is we used a formula that had only the ability to plug in radians and we used degrees so this has to be translated fortunately for us we know how to translate that we know that we can take this and say okay 5 degrees times pi over 180 would be our conversion between um 180 degrees times one radian or pi radians so if we do that conversion what we're going to end up getting out of this is that this degree converts to point to point zero eight eight seven one six zero four five radians all i've done there is taken on my calculator and done five degrees times pi over 180 radians the degrees cancel we're left with radians that's our conversion we learned in last video now this is what we use for our formula so we know that because our arc length only works in terms of radians we've got to do that it's really common to to make that mistake also notice that because this has a hidden over 1 radian our radians have to cancel that that's the reason for the the the problem with our degrees this is really over one radian your angle has to be in radians in order for our units to work correctly if not we'd get something weird we'd get like uh miles times degree radians well you need to convert one of those in order for your units to match up so here we get miles times radians so mile radius doesn't make sense but remember there's really a hidden over 1 radian there that's why the units actually work so when we multiply we say all right first thing make sure on the same longitude that's one circle therefore we're finding arc length on one circle it's got to be a great circle for that to work we subtract that's the difference between the angles on that same circle well that gives us the swept out portion if we find arc length of that angle with whatever radius we have toward the center of the circle that's great but we had to have that in terms of radians for our formula work we made our conversion not hard just to convert from degrees to radians you're multiplying pi over 180 the degrees have canceled you're left with radians this has a built in over 1 radian from our original proportion and then we multiply what we're going to get out of that is a unit of length that's that works great for us as long as our units have matched so our arc length is whatever this is so we're going to multiply about 351.3 miles now how accurate is that it kind of depends on if these are actually on the exact same longitude these are probably not really close um if the earth is perfectly spherical on that portion or if it's been dented somehow if there's a big mountain in the way but if you were to take this on a sphere that's that's the close to the exact distance that you would get between these two cities so i hope that makes sense i hope that you understood the key point here was first two key points firstly it had to be on the same circle same longitude secondly we had to have this in terms of radians and i can't tell you how many times i've seen students try to plug in degrees because they were never taught where this formula comes from and that there's really an over 1 radian that you have to cancel out and that's why it needs it necessitates the use of radians there so i hope that makes sense we're going to go on we're going to talk about area of a sector all right so if we're going to talk about the area of a sector what are our plans going to be because we don't have a formula yet is we're going to create a proportion very very similar to what we did for arc length but instead of using the circumference of a circle the distance around that circle compared to the arc length or proportion of that we're going to look at the area of a circle compared to the area of a sector which is a portion of that so we're going to create a proportion to do that so start thinking about it if we remember back to the area of a circle we get this pi r squared pi times the radius squared would give us the area of any circle so let's say that's the area in one full revolution or one the one time around the circle if you will sweeping out the entire circle will give us an area of pi r squared whatever that radius is but what's the angle of that well well the angle in terms of radians here now that's something right because we're using not 360 degrees we're using radians and so what the formula we're going to get is it is only going to work with radians so if we go all the way around a circle number one we have an area of pi r squared number two well the angle that we just swept out is 2 pi do you remember that there's 2 pi radians in one full rotation of that circle or having a terminal side that ends where your initial side begins that's what we know we know that one full circle pi r squared one full circle two pi so that's a proportion we can use now what we're going to do is say all right what if i don't want to go one for rotation what if i want to sweep out just a certain what we call sector a certain sector to find the area of that sector well the amount of area that sector contains will be proportional to the angle that creates it so we're going to set up a proportion for sale right suppose that we sweep out the sector a a compared to the angle that sweeps it out has to be equal to a full area of a circle compared to the angle that sweeps it out that 2 pi the full 2 pi radians that create one full rotation that circle and we're going to set that up so a the area of the little piece like a piece of pi that sector compared to the angle that sweeps it out must be some proportion must be in proportion comparable to the full area of the circle compared to the angle that sweeps out that full area so the piece we're looking for compared to the angle that makes it has to be in proportion to area of a full circle compared to the angle that makes that which is that 2 pi radians and this is really nice you can see it's really nice because a lot of things start to simplify that wouldn't happen if we had used degrees so this formula while it only works for radians is a very nice formula if we multiply both sides by 8 we end up getting this equation for the area of a sector of a circle so i'm going to take one half you can easily leave this over 2 but one half r squared times theta if we multiply both sides by theta the pi's are gone you have this over two idea one half r squared theta but theta has to be in radians the reason why it's got to be in radians is because that's what we chose as the angle measurement that sweeps out a full circle we said all right the angle that sweeps out this portion or this sector area of the that sector has to be proportionate to the angle that sweeps out a full circle but we chose radians and that's why that works so this creates something really nice for us we're going to do a couple examples really quickly about finding the area of a sector given that we have a radius and an angle or a radius an area can we find the angle that needs that it needs to be to sweep out that certain area so let's give it a try if we have this radius of three meters and we have an angle of 120 degree weight 120 degrees is that a problem well it's certainly going to be a problem we try to plug it in here because if we were to do that and we'd say hey our area of a sector that has a radius of 3 meters and an angle of 120 degrees is not going to work here this is a big problem for us uh the reason why this is a big problem is because there's a hidden two pi radians right there and you need to see it you see why this is a second time just like we did on on arc length is that by not writing that radiance sometimes we forget that this really when you simplify this is one-half radians r squared times theta radians uh is just one over two radians what it is one over two radians times r squared which is a a distance squared that's that's a that's a unit of area times theta radians so when we do this we have to have radians to cancel that out it's a really important thing but if we don't show that we don't say this is really over two radians on the denominator that becomes an issue we start plugging in things like degrees and we make very big errors so so don't don't do that let's make sure that we understand that these formulas only work for rates because that's what we chose here and you have to simplify those units some textbooks even don't show that they just kind of assume that you understand it but that's what's going on we oftentimes have in these formulas that are based on radiance this over one radius or in this case over two radians that have to simplify units so that would be a big problem because we'd get let's see nine over 2 radians times degrees so that'd be um let's see 540 units of measurement degree radians and degrees over radians that that's that's very awkward um so what we're going to do here is we're going to translate that so we can't plug in the 120 but we do know that we can convert it pi of radians over 180 degrees is our conversion so when we simplify that we would get 2 pi over 3 radians that's what we need for a lot of reasons that i just explained to you it's very similar to the arc length but in our area of a sector we had to use that radiance and that's in that formula it's hidden but it's in there and this is one of the problems that we have by losing some of our units it's very common to do but remember this this is meters so we're going to get 9 square meters here this is 1 over 2 radians our ratings are going to cancel there's a lot of things that actually simplify here we get our 2 simplify this would give us a nine simplifying three was going to be three pi three um sorry nine squared over three that's going to be three but squared square meters there so three pi meters squared oftentimes we don't think of things in terms of three pi we go what's three pi i don't know well it's it's roughly uh 3.425 meters squared and so that is a unit of area i really want you to watch the units here sometimes we ignore that we just go it's 9.425 what is that i don't know i have no idea or because it says area we're finding an area which is true but look at why that is look that this goes here that's three meters either square is going to give you a unit of area there this is one over two radians this is radians the radius cancel you're left with those meters squared so everything else works itself out we get that 9.425 square meters or meters squared it matches up and we know that's the area of the switch the sector swept out with that angle measurement 120 degrees or two pi over three that's going to be in in quadrant two and then a radius of three meters so kind of a large area i hope that makes sense to you now we can go backwards so if we have an area of a sector eight meters squared and we have this radius of 6 meters and we put in the right numbers in the right units in the right spot i am on purpose not writing those units so that you get kind of used to it because a lot of people don't do that now should we yes we honestly should we should be putting meters squared and meters and over 1 radian because that's really there or in this case over 2 radians because i want you to see what actually happens here so i didn't write it first because you need to be used to it but secondly i want you to see that it actually works and that what we're getting out of this has to be in terms of radians so if we have 8 that's little but meters squared and this is 36 meters squared and divided by 2 and we keep that radians then what we're going to end up getting is this 8 meters squared equals 6 squared 36 divided by 2 is 18 meters squared over radians if we multiply both sides by that 1 radian and divide by 18 meters squared notice you're going to get 8 meters squared over 18 meters squared radians will switch to the numerator what you're going to be left with is in terms of radians so just simplifying a little bit looks like 4 9 radians now a few things we could do with it could we could we change this into degrees yeah if we wanted to we'd multiply by pi over 180 i've started 180 over pi i'm making this smoke there we multiply by 180 over pi that would change this in two degrees to be kind of nasty but you could certainly do that i'm not going to do that but you can try it i've taught you how to convert so that's 4 9 radians remember it would be 180 degrees compared to pi radians and so we can simplify radians 180 or pi times 4 9 you get the number of degrees there you can also make a decimal that'd be point four four four four four four four forever radians and you could do that as well so i hope it makes sense i hope that you're understanding the idea that radians are super important that's what you're gonna get out of these formulas because they're based on radians when we can when we complete them when we make them also the units do work a lot of times we don't show them because we kind of infer that they're going to work because we we set it up correctly and that's okay to do that but i want you to at least see a few times that this is what's happening and this is why right here why that angle comes out to be radians in the end because it's hidden in there right there when we write this formula very beginning so i hope it made it make sense we're going to come back with one more hope you stick around for it it's about um angular velocity angular speed and uh velocity uh on a kind of a rotating sphere so i'll see it in just a second all right let's do one more example i'm going to try to go pretty in depth in this example i think it's going to be kind of fun so we're going to talk about how fast we are going as we are standing on the earth right now so the earth is spinning around its axis i've tried to represent this here with our axis a little bit off kilters not perfectly straight up and down and we're go we're going around this thing so how fast am i moving where i'm at right there this is me hmm well interesting question right because right now it doesn't feel like i'm moving at all but we are also traveling around the sun and we are spinning we're talking about just the spinning just that that uh that linear velocity as we are spinning on the surface of this sphere and we're going to talk about that right now it's going to take a few things to first get there we're going to need to know well our angular velocity so how fast our angle is changing and in which direction we're going to call it positively but positive angular change is going to be swept out at a certain rate that's going to be our angular velocity we also need to know linear velocity so how fast our arc length is changing well that's going to be a measurement according to time and we're going to put those together and see how just about how fast we're going as we're standing on this this spot now a couple quick questions about that does your linear velocity change depending on where you are on this great sphere that we call the earth yeah yeah it really does where would be your fastest change and why well because our axis goes right through the two what we call poles of our earth the closer that we get to that the slower we spin because our radius starts getting closer and closer and closer to zero to on the pole that's interesting where you'd spin the fastest would be right at that equator and so we're going to look at that a little bit later but i'm kind of prefacing where we're going with it so let's talk about angular velocity angular velocity we're going to call this a little little w it looks like a w at least um is going to compare our angle that we're changing with time and so our angular velocity is kind of a logical thing that we get here angular velocity is the angle we're sweeping out compared to the time it takes to sweep out the angle well if we sweep out let's say degrees just because we're usually 60 degrees in 10 seconds or 60 degrees in five minutes it's going to be a different rate of angle sleepage if you want to we're sleeping at an angle at a slower or quicker rate so that's our angular velocity is what we call that now how about linear velocity linear velocity we call that v is how quickly our arc length is swept out so how fast we're traveling along that arc of whatever circle in this case this minor circle why not a great circle well it's a minor circle because it's it's perpendicular to our axis but not going through the center and so yes it does cut a circle but not not the biggest one that's possible on our sphere it's a minor circle goes not through the center perpendicular to an axis that's going to create a smaller circle than an equator every latitude besides the equator is a minor circle it does not go through the center every longitude does because every longitude has those poles of the axis as part of that circle and so every single circle that goes this way is a great circle goes to the center every circle that goes this way up that or perpendicular to the axis is not that's our latitude so our linear velocity is going to say all right it kind of depends on on a couple things it depends on our arc length compared to the time it takes to traverse that arc length that distance well now that's kind of cool because we know an arc like this our arc length there's another formula for that isn't there this arc length is r times theta now stop right now and make sure you understand this because we're using this formula our angles have to be measured in radians if there are degrees we have to convert them because right now we're putting that idea in there remember this is like over 1 radian we don't write that but that's there so let's make a little substitution if our velocity is equal to arc length compared to time and arc length is r times theta let's put that in there right now in your heads you should be thinking this makes perfect sense this is arc length compared to time arc length is a distance so covering distance in a certain amount of time that gives us a velocity we have a direction here so we're thinking positively measuring though this does give us a distance converge time or a velocity now wait a second if you look really closely here this angular velocity is whatever our angle is compared to how much time it takes to sweep it out but our velocity our linear velocity is a radius times the exact same thing so we're going to take that and substitute it that right there is angular velocity so doing a nice substitution hey arc length compared to time that's kind of a logical intuitive approach to saying yeah uh how fast you're sweeping out a distance is a velocity or how fast you're covering a distance i should say our arc length is r times theta that is a radian idea well let's substitute that in there so we have arc length over time great that's velocity and now this little part is our angular velocity how fast we're covering that swept out portion that angle and that right there is how we'd find linear velocity it's going to take two things we number one have to find angular velocity and then substitute that in there for a rate with a radius and we'll find out how fast we're going on the edge of our minor circle on which we're standing it's kind of cool so let's think about angular velocity right now if we wanted to take one full rotation of our earth so one full rotation on on any circle really one full rotation on any circle is going to cover two pi radians now why am i using 360 degrees right there i want my units to match and so i'm going to use that two pi radians as a way to say if i were to go around one full revolution have you noticed that we're always really doing that we're always taking one full revolution because we take proportions thereof to find all these other formulas so if i want to find out how fast we're going on any of our our minor circles or great circles around our earth then i would say let's do it for one revolution in one revolution we have two pi radians think what we're doing right now i'm saying if i want to on any of our our circles here on any of our latitudes if i'm going to go all the way around and end where i started well then that's going to take us 2 pi radians to do that all right well if that's 2 pi radians how long does it take to complete the two pi radians in other words if you start where you stop or sorry if you stop where you start you've made one day how long does it take to sweep out two pi radians on on our planet uh to sweep out one full rotation one revolution well it takes 24 hours i'm going to write the radians there so that we see that that's a united measurement has a unit to it does it make sense you that on our earth on these circles on which we live whether you have a minor circle here or a great circle here or you're down here it's going to take you 2 pi radians to complete one full revolution and no matter where you are it takes 24 hours to do that that should make sense to you you should see that you should see that yes going around one circle is two pi radians as far as the angle being swept out that's angular velocity two pi radians no matter where you are you're going this way around the axis it's going to take you 24 hours a day is 24 hours whether you're here or here you're just moving faster here than you are here than you are here interesting okay well let's uh let's simplify that a little bit so on earth no matter where you are our angular velocity is pi over 12 radians per hour that is exactly what we're going to do there that's exactly we're going to put all we have to understand now is well what's the radius where i'm located for me not for you because you don't live in the same planet you live in the same latitude that i do that that'd be cool doesn't work for you too but you don't say live at the same latitude as me probably so your distance from where you are to the axis is different from where i am to the axis of rotation our axis of rotation we call that uh going to the north and south pole our axis of rotation has a different distance depending on where you are on this longitude so as where i am this 48.6 degrees north that is a radius of 3 000 miles approximately now that's saying something because the radius as you get to the equator which would be the furthest distance from the axis of rotation is about 3960 miles so i am 960 miles closest to the axis closer to the axis of rotation than someone who lives on that latitude that we call the equator i hope you're getting this i hope you're following it's kind of interesting so my radius is three thousand miles so 3 000 miles times pi over 12 radians per hour wait a minute i'm seeing the miles per hour but what gets rid of my radiance well this came from arc length arc length had a hit hidden over 1 radian this has a hidden over 1 radian there's a hidden over 1 radian here the radians are going to cancel and you're going to get 3 000 times pi over 12 miles per hour if you approximate that that works out to about 785 miles an hour so where i stand right now even though i'm not moving because i'm spinning around that axis of rotation at that minor circle it's not the equator it's something smaller it's a smaller circle because i'm further up that axis around that circle on which i stand i am traveling approximately 785 miles an hour what about someone who's more north than me they're traveling slower they have to cover less distance to make it around in a day less arc length to make it around a day less circumference because their circle's smaller what i'm saying at the equator they are traveling faster the radius is larger they have to cover more distance more arc length to make it around to where they started in a day that means they're traveling faster to do that but some more south well it starts getting slower and slower and slower and slower to get to the north pole or the south pole depending on where you're located what atmosphere so i hope i've made that uh made that makes sense to you i really hope that that you're seeing the interplay between this that you say this formula makes sense that's the the amount of angle compared to time the amount of arc length compared to time we can have an arc length and it creates for us this angular velocity we can do a substitution all we need to know is the radius from your minor circle where you are on the ser the uh descriptions of that to your axis of symmetry and then for everyone on earth we are all traveling at 2 pi radians for 24 hours that's what a day is so that's pi over 12 radians per hour so if you want to do this on your own um there's some some places on the google that you can look up what your latitude is and then from there you can figure out the distance it does require a little trigonometry sometimes if you're gonna do it on your own find out the distance from where you are to the axis of rotation just plug it in you can see how fast you're going if you want to do this on the equator to see what uh what the fastest people on earth are doing all you'd have to do is plug in 3960 miles that's generally the the radius from uh the center of the earth to any edge now you might be thinking that wait a minute why isn't this from the center of the earth to the edge because the earth is not spinning around that center it's spinning around an axis that goes through that center and so we find the distance to that axis that is the distance or that is the um the thing around which we are spinning so we're not just tumbling we're going around an axis so if you want to find out the fastest people and say well the equator is the distance furthest away from that axis of rotation that radius would be 3960 miles and you can figure that out okay i couldn't just leave it so i did this with on the equator and how fast people are going just by standing still the linear velocity of someone who's standing on the equator right now and it's uh not an insignificant difference so 1037 miles an hour a bit under let's see 250 ish uh 250 miles ish greater than how fast i'm going just by living in a different part of the world so interesting so some of you are going a lot faster than i am and some of you are going a bit slower not much i live fairly far north um but anyhow i hope that uh that it's made sense i hope you found it interesting it's kind of fun you can do it on your own if you really want to but most importantly i hope you're seeing the interplay of some of the formulas the necessity of measuring and radians for these particular formulas to work or doing some sort of a conversion so i hope that you've enjoyed it and we're we're gonna move on to something called the unit circle on the next video i'm gonna show you all about it hope it's making sense hope you're having a great time i'll be having a good day we'll see you soon you 

Transcript for: Trigonometric Functions and the Unit Circle (Precalculus - Trigonometry 6)
welcome to another video so in this video we're going to start talking about trigonometric functions exactly what this class is pretty much all about most times call them trig functions because trigonometric just takes so darn long to say so we're going to study trig functions and where exactly they come from i'm going to show you two different approaches the reason why i'm going to do that and not just talk about the unit circle is because at this point most people have seen like a right triangle trigonometry at some point in like a geometry class or something like that so i'm gonna i'm gonna relate these two so that you know they're talking about the same thing and why they're talking about the same thing and why sine cosine tangent cosecant secant and cotangent work uh how they actually work to represent the same angle depending on the relationship of our sides so we'll talk about that of a right triangle uh we'll talk about that i'll discuss what a unit circle is i will go in length about what that what that does we'll talk about defining some quadrant angles and then what we're going to talk about is how to deal with the unit circle and how to use it in the next video so let's get right into it when we talk about a trigonometric function there's two real ways to think about this one that's defined on unit circle and one that relates to a right triangle so here's one way to think about what a trig function does what a trig function does is it relates an angle to two sides of a right triangle so what what's that mean depending on what angle you're talking about typically one of our acute angles here not generally the 90 degree angle but on a right triangle with one 90 degree angle if we can somehow create this relationship from an angle and two sides that relationship is what's called the trigonometric function and there's a certain way to do it usually people have seen like sine cosine tangent so i want to explore this for a little bit we're not going to go very deep into this right now what's going to happen is i'm showing you this now so you'll be able to see it on a circle so we'll make that connection now and in many many videos from now i'm going to show you these relationships on a right triangle again and say you remember that one time so here's that one time that one time is if we can define the way an angle relates to two sides on a right triangle it will not change if we make that triangle larger same scale but larger that's called similar triangles so through similar triangles we can prove that it does not matter the size of the sides it's the ratio between them that that matters and that relates to an angle that is unchanging i'm going to show you that to you in a minute so let's discuss a little bit maybe it's review for you maybe it's brand new it's okay i just want to get in your head right now what sine cosine and tangent are for an angle on a right triangle remember sine can't equal anything this makes sense and cosine can't equal anything tangent can't equal anything it's a way to relate an angle to two sides so you need three things in every trig function an angle and two sides when we're talking about a right triangle here's how it works so if we talk about sine of an angle what sine typically does is relates an opposite to a hypotenuse side on a right triangle so for us that would be this a that's the opposite to the angle i'm talking about you draw a straight line through that's opposite and that's the hypotenuse you might remember the hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle it's also opposite 90 degrees remember i'm not trying to teach this to you perfectly right now just to give you a reference point so sine for us would be a over c cosine for that same angle we're talking about angle a or that theta right there relates the adjacent side over the hypotenuse namely b over c that's typically how we'd like to see cosine now tangent tangent relates the opposite over the adjacent now i want you to notice something very clear that it's going to show up on our unit circle if i relate tangent of whatever angle i have to the opposite over adjacent that's a over b but it's also true that it's sine divided by cosine take these two things a over c divided by b over c and notice with your complex fraction your c's will cancel you will end up getting a over b we're going to see that bear out right now we're going to see that sine relates to this opposite idea well opposite is a vertical idea a think of it like a y-axis idea or along the y-axis over the hypotenuse while a unit circle or hypotenuse is going to be one cosine cosine is an x-idea look at the x-axis here cosine is an x idea over hypotenuse with the hypotenuse is 1. tangent relates the two tangent takes r y and divides by our x or our sine and divides by our cosine we're going to see that now some students really don't grasp that some students think sine is some magic number it's not it's a relationship between an angle that creates a ratio of sides so it's cosines those tangent so here's what i want you to think about imagine if we made this bigger so just a bigger triangle now it's still a right triangle but i want you to kind of ignore this don't think about that anymore and let's think about this side as f over g here's what i want you to notice look at the big triangle and remember the small triangle are these two triangles similar similar what similar means is just a bigger shape at the same angle so same shape blown up just made bigger um it's not like it's sort of close it's exactly the same shape just larger in similar shapes our sides are still proportional here's what that means a divided by b is exactly the same fraction as f divided by g that's a true statement notice how when i make my triangle bigger that angle does not change at all so it doesn't matter how large or how small your triangle is sine and cosine and tangent of one angle is always going to be the same it's very predictable it's very very repeatable and all it does is relates an opposite to a hypotenuse side that hypotenuse is growing also but the relationship between a and c and f and h are exactly the same this is why we're able to use sine of say 30 degrees and it's always the same no matter whether we're talking about a huge triangle or a small triangle no matter we're talking about something with a radius of 50 or something with a radius of one it doesn't matter so if it doesn't matter what size our circle is or a triangle is if a sine and cosine and tangent of all these trig functions of one particular angle do not change because it's based on the relationship of one side to another that in proportionality of similar triangles goes with the same rate that's a lot of words then why don't we just make it easy and use a radius of one or a hypotenuse of one and make all of these things nice that's what we're about to do right now we're going to jump into the unit circle but i wanted you to see this i wanted to see that i don't care how big or small my sides are sine of a particular angle is always the same ratio a over b is a ratio just as f over g is or in the case of sine a over c is a ratio just like f over h is they are identical tangent would have been a over b compared to f over g that ratio is always in proportion because we have these similar shapes for a particular angle that we're given that's why sine cosine tangent and all the trig functions the reciprocals do not change based on the fact of how big your triangle is because if that angle doesn't change they're always in the same proportion and that's that's magic that's a beautiful thing so what we're going to do now is we take that that idea kind of put it put in the bank for just a second we're going to take a look at what is called the unit circle it's a different way to approach what sine cosine and tangent are defined as but you're going to see that they're very strongly related because you can make a right triangle i'm going to show that to you so what a unit circle is it's just a circle with a radius of one so you can see that right here so if we have this superimposed on the x y axis then there'd be a point where my circle intersects my x-axis at one comma zero this would be x equals one and y equals zero and zero one and negative one zero and zero negative one now here's the idea if we start taking an arc length of t starting with remember our initial side typically goes it's typically at this zero one oh sorry a 1 0 on this positive x axis and we start giving a positive arc length for counterclockwise and a negative arc length for clockwise we start getting these points on this circle let's call that arc length t in a moment we're going to use t to replace the s for our plane from that formula we're going to see something very very neat about it well there's a couple things that we need to understand about this number number one is that arc length like angles are measured counterclockwise positive clockwise negative arc length for a unique arc length it will define a unique point on your circle on that unit circle it will also define a unique angle we call that a central angle so that's what we have here so arc length is t great it's positive for counterclockwise awesome it's negative for clockwise good deal and each t creates a unique point we denote that x and y because we really do have an x axis and a y-axis here denotes a unique point on that unit circle it also denotes a unique central angle here which is quite interesting so can you see it can you see how if my arc length is t great if it's t and a little bit it'd be a different point t and less a little bit it'd be a different point and it'd also be a different angle you should see that so what we're trying to do right now we're trying to relate a few things we're trying to relate that every point on the circle has a radius of one of course the unit circle it has a unique angle and a unique arc length and we're about to define some trigonometric functions based on that now let's go a little further and let's really take a look at arc length if you remember arc length is s and it's equal to the radius times the angle the central angle the angle that sweeps out that particular arc length and it's always in terms of radians you need to remember y remember there's really a hidden over radiance there and so we had to have that so that length made length and not length over radians or something and so there's a hidden thing in here that says you have to have radians well let's take care of this let's say that okay if s is our arc length but wait a minute we're calling our blank t let's change this just a little bit our arc length in this case is whatever t is it's creating a unique point on the unit circle and unique central angle positive for counterclockwise negative or clockwise we're going to call it t so because t is our arc length we can do that our arc length is equal to r times theta no problem that makes sense well what's what's our theta our theta is our central angle so that's fantastic we know that every arc length creates that unique central angle for every unique arc length but wait if this is a unit circle our radius is 1 would that be true at every point along the circle well yeah of course that's exactly what a radius means is that that that radius is always one and so for every value of t every particular unique arc length for every particular unique central angle that sweeps out that arc length our radius is one so and this is what we learned a little while ago is that if your radius is one your arc length numerically is the same thing as your central angle so if it's remember this is only in radians it only works for radians so you got to get that but for your radians numerically your arc length is equal to your angle why is that the case numerically because one's length right and one is is radians well it's because right here this radius has a length to it and it's over radiant so when you multiply it by an angle that's units is in radians it cancels gives you numerically length equals length and that's what that says to us so if we disregard the units you're on a unit circle your arc length is equal to your central angle that should fascinate you like wow that's that's kind of interesting and what that does is that allows us to define our trigonometric function sine cosine tangent cosecant secant and cotangent as either along an arc length or a central angle now listen very clearly care for this next thing if your radius is not one then your central angle no longer equals your arc length and your trigonometry functions are no longer defined as just equal to that arc length uh or using that arc length because that's based on a unit circle i hope that makes sense to you that's pretty important one more thing i'm going to write just make sure that you're using radians here so here's what trig functions are going to do for us they're going to relate either the arc length or the central angle to the point on the unit circle remember that that circle is only the unit circle so let's let's really go through this one more time just to make sure that we're all okay and then we're going to talk about sine and cosine tangent cosecant secant cotangent here's one way to look at it one way to look at trig functions is relating an angle to a pair of sides depending on what pair we're comparing we get sine cosine tangent or the reciprocals of those things that i have not shown on the board the reason why i'm showing you this is will be apparent in just a minute but the reason why i want to make sure you understand this is because no matter how big or small our triangle is if that angle doesn't change the proportion between the sides that are being compared will also not change that means it's predictable repeatable and it's a single value sine of an angle is always the same for whatever that angle is that's important i need to understand that also no matter what your hypotenuse is all right it doesn't have to be one be anything now when it is one we get something very specific but that's where these trig functions that's what these trig functions are relating to as far as a right triangle is concerned now we took a look at a different look at and said if we had some sort of a arc length which sweeps out some central angle and our radius is one well there's some very interesting things we can do with this we measure arc length the same as we measure angles positive or counterclockwise well if our t is our arc length and our radius is one then numerically our arc length is equal to our our central angle but only on a unit circle because that's the only time that our radius is actually one other than that well we can't really say that those are the same that's why we had a formula for arc length uh that depended on the radius and so that that matters it's important and so what this is going to ultimately do is relate the arc length and central angle which is identical on a unit circle to some point on that particular circle and that's what trig functions do okay so let's take a look at this what i've done is i've written some abbreviations for sine looks like sin don't worry i have anything wrong to sine cosine tangent cosecant secant and cotangent i've related them in such a way that hopefully it'll be apparent to you that these things are reciprocals so sine and cosecant cosine secant tangent and cotangent are going to be reciprocals of one another and we're going to see that in just a bit so let's discover what these things are as defined by the unit circle and then how it relates to what i've shown in the beginning we've come full circle on this thing now here's how this is defined you'll notice also that sine of t and sine of theta what's the difference there is no difference when we're starting to relate r2 sides or point on the unit circle there's no difference between those but keep in mind that the only time that the arc length is defined like this easily is when we're using that unit circle and so our radius would have to be one so we can define this with real numbers we can also define this with central angles and that works works both ways usually we use them interchangeably so we we can deal with sign and understand what it is based on that unit circle so here's what it is as we're defining it by the unit circle sine of t or sine of theta is going to be equal to y y why what what is y y is this y coordinate of your point which is actually quite fascinating really when you think about it so if i sweep out an angle or take a certain arc length on a circle with a radius of 1 it's going to give me some point on that circle that point is going to have a coordinate x and a coordinate for y sine of my angle or arc length for that particular point is actually equal to the y the y coordinate numerically that value now why in the world is that if you've never seen this before this is why i showed you this part check this out let's just pretend that we drop a perpendicular right here now wait a second that creates for us some x and some y value along the x axis and y axis for this right triangle hopefully you see the right triangle how points work on a rectangular coordinate system is that this height is our y and this distance right here is our x notice how y goes all the way up to the circle the x it does not why not because we're shifting along that so check it out if i wanted to take sine of whatever this angle is notice sine when relating it to triangles works with the angle the angle not the arc length because this does not have to have a radius of one and that's what i was just saying a little while earlier so if this is related to this angle then what would sine be according to this angle well it would be opposite over hypotenuse but y over 1 is just y that is how this relates to right triangle trigonometry we're going to see that in many more videos i'm going to relate this back again and say okay now that we understand this now we're going to talk about right triangle trigonometry so this really should be y over 1 and y over 1. that's exactly what this would be because based on that right triangle would be opposite over hypotenuse but the hypotenuse on your circle is one that's pretty neat so how about cosine cosine is going to be x [Music] y x well for the same reason notice how this point has a distance over on the x axis along with the distance up on the y that's how we're taking it the rectangular coordinate system works and so according this central angle notice i'm relating to the central angle when i'm doing this again because as far as arc length it doesn't really work on the right triangle but it would work here so by the central angle we would get x that's the adjacent over the hypotenuse but the hypotenuse is one so really it's x over one but x over one is always equal to x lastly we're going to get that tangent t and tangent of theta is y over x and so that makes it really easy to see that tangent theta is equal to sine of whatever it is theta over t sine of theta over cosine theta so we can see right here if tangent theta is y over x hey sine theta is y cosine theta is x we can also define it that way or tangent t equals sine t over cosine t so now it's time to move on and talk about what we call reciprocal functions of sine cosine and tangent and they're very strongly related obviously because they're they are just reciprocals and so what we're going to do is take a look at cosecant secant and cotangent as reciprocals of sine cosine and tangent respectively now i'm not going to go back to the the triangle to really do that we're just going to define them right now based on our original three trig functions so if we take a look at cosecant of t and cosecant of theta those are reciprocals of sine t and sine of theta well i guess that i am going to go back there a little bit so if they're reciprocals well we have to have a fraction well if it's a reciprocal of sine t which is y well what's under the y well it would be one wait a minute opposite over hypotenuse that is our hypotenuse and so what cosecant does is takes hypotenuse over opposite instead of opposite over hypotenuse on a right triangle but also on our unit circle so we're going to define this as 1 over y and likewise secant is the reciprocal of cosine for either t or theta whatever arc length on a unit circle or central angle we have and that would be 1 over x cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent that would be x over y which relates to adjacent over opposite we're going to find some really interesting things about co-relationships in trig functions so sine and cosine tangent and cotangent and what they actually mean when we get there so that's that's really it that that is what trigonometry comes from uh what what these well at least trigonometric functions come from is either from considering an angle relating to two sides that's three parts an angle and two sides or an angle or arc length and two sides of a right triangle that creates this point on a unit circle with a radius of one creates a very very nice succinct definitions for us for sine cosine tangent and the reciprocal functions of cosine sorry cosecant secant and cotangent respectively i hope i've made it made sense i hope i've made some connections for you that you might not ever see before i really hope that you understood the similarity idea so making larger similar triangles has the same proportion and therefore the sine cosine tangent the trigonometry of an angle that's not changing will not change either it's it's constant for a particular angle it's very interesting hopefully i made it relate to hey you can't build a right triangle so they are related but if we have a unit circle central angle equals arc length four radians not degrees four radians like we talked about and then we can relate that to any point on that circle for a unique central angle unique arc length and then we have some trig functions from that so we're going to come back we're going to find some quadrant angles then what we're going to do is we'll also talk about what if we don't have quadrant angles and it will lead us onto something called the unit circle where we have all of these very common degrees and radians filled out i'll show you how to use in the next video let's start using the unit circle to figure out some trigonometric relationships between central angles or we can think arc length since this is a unit circle and some measurements of those central angles with the the coordinates x and y so we're going to do that it's going to lead us into how to use a unit circle and i've developed one for you well i haven't developed it i drew a nice big one then i'm going to show you on the next video on exactly how to use it this is just the jumping off point so it seems fair enough to start figuring out our trig functions as it relates to just our quadrant angles if you remember quadrant angles that's 0 90 180 270 360 degrees respectively or 0 pi over 2 pi 3 pi over 2 and 2 pi radians if we're talking radians and that's what we're going to deal with here i'm going to reference degrees as we're going through this but actually right now zero radians is zero degrees pi over two remember that that is 90 degrees i'm not drawing so that you'll start remembering it i don't want to have to always have out that sheet of paper as a crutch so you know that's 90 degrees or pi over 2. 180 degrees or pi 270 degrees or 3 pi over 2 and then 360 degrees or 2 pi and so we're going to find the quadrant angles for those things notice i'm not going to be doing what are called coterminal angles i'm not going to deal with positive 90 and negative 270 because those will have exactly the same point x is 0 y is 1. so there's no need to do that we can define them one way and get exactly what that the sign of that angle is whether it's positive or negatively defined and so we're going to start doing this right now so sine of zero remember sine always deals with the y coordinate of whatever point that angle is referencing on your unit circle so if we have sine of zero that's going to be a point one zero well the y coordinate is zero sine of zero is zero cosine represents is represented by the x-coordinate that's how we define that remember i spent the whole long time in this video explaining where that all came from so that and where this stuff came from so that we can just use it now i'm not going to re-explain it all the time so our x coordinate is 1 so cosine of 0 is the x coordinate 1. tangent divides those two so tangent is 0 divided by 1 y divided by x that would be zero the other three take these and reciprocate them so notice that tangent because it divides and sometimes we divide by zero there cosecant secant and cotangent will be undefined at some values some angles some arc lengths sine and cosine will not sine and cosine are defined everywhere we get a graph of that you might have heard of a sine curve it just keeps on going and going and going between two values what two values negative one and one why get this because this is our y-axis and sine is the y-coordinate the range is negative one to one the range of a sine curve is negative one to one it can't get outside of that so it goes just like that same thing with cosine cosine is defined by x what's the domain negative one to one of this of this non-function if we want to call it domain but the x coordinate let's say ranges so the interval goes from negative one to one cosine can only give you out negative one to one that's exactly how this relates to that graph we're going to talk about that when we get graphs of trig functions so anyway back to this as a long story for a kind of cool thing but what that means is that cosine and sine are going to be defined everywhere but the rest of them won't you're going to have something that's undefined and get the first one right here and so we see that we see that sine was zero over one remember our angle would have an initial terminal side right here that would be a y coordinate over the radius well that's zero over one if i reciprocate it as one over zero this is undefined well cosine is one over one why because that would be x coordinate right here remember this angle this is just an example this would be right here one divided by one that would be adjacent over hypotenuse would be one reciprocated i still get one but cotangent is zero over one if i reciprocate that i get one over zero that's undefined now let's go on we're going to do this very quickly there's a lot of them to do hopefully you can go through right now and just pick out them the ones that match up to our x and y and get the rest of them from it that's why i do it so if i talk about sine of pi over 2 pi over 2 is right here remember this was just an example we're not really looking at that right now we're thinking quadrant angles so if i think of quadrant angle at 90 degrees or pi over two my y coordinate would be one my x would be zero so sine of pi over two is one and cosine pi over two is zero tangent divides those 1 divided by 0 is undefined cosecant of pi over 2 would take 1 over 1 and reciprocate it it would give you 1. but cosine of 0 well this is 0 over 1. if i reciprocate that i get undefined now this is very interesting so notice that cotangent of pi over two is not undefined why not well it takes x and divides by y zero divided by one is zero i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing the interplay there i would strongly encourage you to go through and do the same thing with pi that's 180 degrees then 3 pi over 2 that's 270 degrees and see what you get of course i'm going to do it right now how i always start these is i start by identifying the sine and cosine they're the easiest i divide them to get tangent and i consider what's next for my reciprocal functions so sine of pi sine is y so i'm going to go over here and say sine of pi is zero cosine pi that's the x is negative one tangent divides them zero divided by negative one uh y divided by x sine divided by cosine gives you zero okay cosecant would take zero over one and reciprocate it that's one over zero that's undefined negative one over one reciprocated is still negative one zero over one reciprocated is one over zero that's undefined hopefully you're noticing some of the things that are happening i want you to see this really see it see how our sine our sine is all positive for these two quadrants why sine relates to y why outputs are positive for all of these points all of the points up there are above the x-axis they're all positive but our cosine changes signs right here x remember cosine is x x is positive here and so cosine of any of these angles is positive until i get to here now x changes to negative so cosine for any of these angles is going to be negative i hope you're seeing that tangent relates the two divides positive by positive or positive by negative in these two quadrants and so we're going to get some sign changes we're going to learn about this in the next video about you might have heard all students take calculus or some variation of that all sine tangent and cosine for what is positive in those quadrants interesting so the last one sine of three pi over two remember sine is y so it's negative one and zero for x tangent divides and that's undefined and i want you to see that for both this quadrant angle of pi over two and this quadratic angle of three pi over two uh right here we get undefined now we reciprocate so negative one over one is still negative one zero over one becomes undefined but 1 over negative 1 over 0. so remember that's what happened here we took y over x negative 1 over 0 becomes 0 over negative 1. well that's zero and that is defined notice how cotangent is defined for both pi over two and three pi over two so this is saying something to us there's something called a period uh for these trig functions they repeat every so often we're going to really study that as we get into the graphs of trigonometry but i want you to see it now so you start building toward that like there's this portion of the x-axis on which these trig functions will repeat in fact for cosine and sine they're going to start repeating after you get back to here aren't they so they're going to repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat every time you make a full rotation that's a period here well tangent is a little quicker than that it's going to be every 2 pi over 2 every 90 degrees it's going to throw every pot it's going to repeat so every little portion these things have that that repetition so i hope that makes sense to you we're going to do one more and then we're going to call it good for the video so last one is what would happen if you were given a point could you from a point that's on you in a circle and you can verify this with uh with what is called the pythagorean theorem you can say this squared plus this squared equals radius squared you're going to get one and so if that's one then that point is on that unit circle would have a radius of one so it's very easy to verify that that point is going to be right about here from that point could we determine based on the angle it swept out what sine cosine tangent and their reciprocal cosecant secant and cotangent are based on that point notice this is in quadrant two so i want you to think about this in quadrant two please get this in quadrant two the x values are negative the y values are positive that means sine has to be positive here cosine has to be negative here tangent has to be negative here because it divides a positive by a negative we're going to see that right now so if we think about sine of theta the angle that creates this point this unique point on the unit circle sine theta is going to be the y value it's simply three pi sorry square root of three over two cosine is the x value negative one half notice how sine is positive and cosine is negative for that particular central angle because that is in quadrant two y's have to be positive there x's are negative tangent divides them and this is where it gets a little more difficult because you actually do have to divide it tangent divides sine over cosine for that particular angle or y over x for that particular point that's going to be negative square root of 3. so we can think of this divided by one-half well if i divide by one-half i can reciprocate and multiply 2's cancel but i do get a negative square root of 3. and now we're going to go ahead and do the rest of them so notice that when we reciprocate things with square roots we're going to have to rationalize the denominator a lot of the times also notice that i'm really getting my my only two i'm only really getting two from a given circle i'm using those two to develop my tangent much like i did here i'm using those three to get my co my uh my reciprocal functions out of that i'm not going back to my unit circle very often so cosecant is the reciprocal of sine relate that in your head so if i reciprocate that i'm going to get 2 over square root of 3. you'll often see this as two root three over three how about secant secant is kind of nice secant is the reciprocal of negative one-half that's negative two notice how your signs do not change which gives you the same sort of signed quadrants for cosecant as sine and secant as cosine and cotangent as tangent because it's dividing the same signs there or look at the same signs but reciprocate them signs don't change with reciprocation and now we're going to take negative root 3 over 1 and reciprocate that 1 over root negative root 3. if we if we multiply or rationalize the denominator by square root of three over square root of three we're gonna get negative square root of three over three i hope that makes sense i hope that you've seen that we can use the unit circle to find sine cosine tangent of whatever central angle gives us that unique point on our our unit circle we're going to look at a much more robust unit circle next time that has some very very common values of of our central angle and our points that relate to those central angles we'll look at like 0 pi over 6 pi over 4 pi over 3 pi over 2 and every one of those intervals around that unit circle and it's going to be very useful so that's uh that's 30 45 60 and 90 degrees and every multiple of those things around a unit circle notice i'm not going to give you more than one rotation because it starts over and that's that's that's great you can count that far but you're going to get the same points if we go more than one rotation so one rotation on a unit circle gives you a unique set of points and unique central angles that create those points so we'll talk about that i hope it's made sense i hope that i've given you a very good outline of where this unit circle comes from where trigonometric functions come from and how they relate both to a right triangle that we've built on this and to the unit circle which makes it a lot nicer so i hope it's made sense i hope you're doing well i'll see you for another video soon you 

Transcript for: How to Use the Unit Circle in Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 7)
welcome to another video so in this video i'm going to show you how to use this thing which is called a unit circle we're going to discuss many examples some that have a little bit of a little bit of math in them where we add and subtract some different things using the unit circle i'll show you how to how to deal with coterminal angles so what happens when you do more than one revolution or some negative measurements so it'll be clockwise angular angular movement we'll show we'll talk about what that means we'll talk about how sine is really just the y coordinate of a point on the unit circle and cosine of whatever angle we have is just the x so we'll deal with that the whole idea is can you find the angle identify your y for sine x for cosine and uh and divide them for tangent and then we'll find the reciprocals for our other trig functions so we're going to deal with that i'll show you exactly how to do it so this is what is called a unit circle and even though it doesn't look like it this radius is one one unit of measurement so what i've done here for you is created i think the best unit circle like ever that's why i use it all the time and there's a whole lot to it so i'm gonna spend the first about five minutes explaining how this works and what is what all is going on there's one that you can find on the internet pretty much anywhere any of them will work but one looks very similar to this i didn't make it up but it's very valuable so here's what happens i'm going to start by telling you that because this radius is 1 we can relate arc length and radian degree measurement of angles to sine and cosine very very easily as it relates to the y and the x coordinates of points on the unit circle respectively that's a lot of words but here's what it means in practicality if you look at any one of these points cosine of whatever this angle and sine of whatever this angle is is given by your x and your y coordinate i've color coded it so cosine is red sine is blue even as far as the sines themselves positive and negative go in each of the quadrants one two three and four i've also talked about what trig functions are positive for each of those quadrants all of them sine only cosine tangent only and cosine only and the reciprocals of those so cosecant cotangent and secant so that's how that's how this works i've also given degree and radian measurements for all of these angles these are the most common angles that we really deal with and if you just follow the color coding behind it it comes out really nicely in order to get tangent i've written this as sine over cosine that's x over y for any of these angles as well i've omitted the the angle so like theta or t because they're universally used and we have more of the idea here that sine is the y coordinate cosine the x coordinate that's why i did it like that so you can really see that so we're going to get right into it but we'll talk about firstly um how to find an angle on the unit circle and then what in the world we do what there's a definite order of thought and how to find all six of these standard trigonometric functions so let's get right into it let's look at 2 pi over 3 or 120 degrees now i am going to mostly use radian measurements versus degrees but they're interchangeable so whether you have sine of 120 degrees or sine of 2 pi over 3 as far as a unit circle is concerned they're interchangeable if you converted them you could convert between the two very easily that's what i mean by interchangeable so here's what we're going to do first we're going to find sine and cosine first for any of these angles that we're looking at then we'll find tangent and then we'll reciprocate all three so let's take a look firstly where 2 pi over 3 is 2 pi over 3 is in quadrant number let's see 2. in quadrant 2 so sine should be positive it says quadrant two it says cosine will be negative and sine with positive red remembers cosine blue is sine y look at where this point is at two pi over three when the angle sweeps that out the point is right here here's the point x's will be negative y's will be positive that's exactly what it says cosine would be negative that's x sine will be positive that's the y and so we're going to write those down so sine of 2 pi over 3 is exactly what the y coordinate of that point is for some reasons i explained in the previous video that's 3 sorry square root of 3 over 2. cosine of 2 pi over 3 is the x coordinate of that point for some reason i explained last video that's negative one half tangent takes a bit more work now there are other tables that you can just look at and that's fine but i really want you to understand where it comes from not memorize the table tangent is taking the y coordinate and dividing by the x coordinate remember this really creates a right triangle right here where the height of it would be root 3 over 2 that's the y and the let's say length of it i suppose would be negative one-half we use it with the sign dividing y over x would divide opposite over adjacent for a right triangle or root three over two divided by negative one-half or sine over cosine blue over red however you want to think about that that's what this does so at 2 pi over 3 tangent would take y divided by x or sine divided by cosine we can do the math really quickly you can use your calculator if it has the ability to give you back square roots the ones i recommend always do you can do in your head though kind of nicely with a lot of these common ones if we divide by negative one half so sine over cosine for two pi over three then we're going to reciprocate and multiply your twos are going to cancel you're going to get negative square root of three once we've done that now it's time to find the the reciprocal functions for sine cosine and tangent of whatever angle we've just talked about and it's really easiest to do it after you've done sine and cosine you just reciprocate them that to me is a lot easier than looking back here and reciprocating doing a lot of the math in your head so unless you have to find just one of them usually if you find all six find sine then cosine the tangent create a pattern for yourself that works every time so cosecant says take a look at sine of the angle and reciprocate it that's 2 over the square root of 3. normally we have to rationalize that denominator so you multiply by the square root of 3 over the square root of 3. so here's 2 over square root of 3 rationalizing we get two square root of three over three that's what cosecant of two pi over three would be it'd be two square root of three over three how about secant well secant takes a look at cosine and reciprocates it that's going to be negative 2. that's a kind of easy one and then cotangent does the same thing it reciprocates tangent so negative square root of 3 over 1 becomes negative 1 over square root of three by the same exact logic as this we're going to get negative one times square root of three over three that is how to find your trig functions stemming from the use of these these things called the unit circle now obviously you're probably not going to want to carry one around this big when you're doing like a test or your homework or something but print one out have it in front of you use it as little as possible what do you mean start trying to memorize these things not memorize why they work that's important to understand that but it will come to you a little bit better if you're not always looking at your unit circlemen oh i don't know what sine of pi over two is let me look at my unit circle seven pi over two we should pretty much identify that as one almost all the time sine of pi over two that's that is one the more that you memorize it the less likely they are to to make some mistakes um later on in math especially if your teacher does not let you have a unit circle on the test or something so use it until you get used to it and then try try to not have it right next to you all the time see if you can do it without it it's valuable it really is valuable make your math much more efficient that speed with accuracy okay so we don't we don't really want to be relying on it all the time for from here on out for now of course it's brand new and that's totally okay i generally let students use it on a test for trigonometry but as we get closer to like calc 1 calc 2 calc 3 it kind of goes away and you're just required to know it and so that's what i want to start training you on now we're going to deal with one more reaction i could do much about it but i want to show you something called the coterminal angle so let's say that we took a look at 8 pi over 3 eight pi over three it's not on my unit circle that's true it's actually more than one full revolution eight divided by three is well let's see think about this for a second eight pi divided by three eight over three is two and two thirds so eight pi over three says i'm gonna go to two pi and then two thirds of a pi that's what that means here's what it would do eight pi over three says you'd go all the way around this that's two pi and then two thirds of a pi one two thirds of one pi you can count like that if you wanted to count thirds you can do a different way i want to count eight thirds or eight one-thirds of a pie just count the denominator of threes so here's one two three remember three over three is one four five six six over three is two 7 8. that's the same thing as 8 pi over 3 or 480 degrees take 480 subtract 360 you're going to get 120. the sine cosine tangent cosecant secant cotangent of 8 pi over 3 is going to be identical to the sine cosine tangent and the reciprocal functions of 2 pi over 3. the 480 degrees works out the same exact trig functions as 120 degrees does so most of the time what we do is we try to figure out what these trig functions are on one rotation if we get more than that it's just going to match up to something that we already know in one rotation and that's something that we can do so i want to point that out to you i'm not going to redo it because we get the same exact things here so no matter whether you make one rotation or 50 rotations where you end up is what matters as far as sine cosine tangent are concerned now that is going to be very important when we get to graphing because when we get to graphing we're going to notice how it oscillates it repeats every so often it's called a period so every so often you're going to get a repeating graph and a repeating graph and a repeating graph and the outputs will repeat themselves time and time and time again and that's what we're noticing here going more than one full revolution let's get right after it again we're going to take a look at pi over 4 and find all of our six standard trigonometric functions from that pi over 4. remember pi over 4 and 45 degrees are exactly the same so you can see written both ways sine of 45 degrees can be exactly the same as sine of pi over four i just have that on there so we get used to it mostly we're using radians as we continue so i'm going to use that the most often but please don't let that sway you please understand that either way you're going to get the same exact relationship amongst the point and the angle so sine of pi over 4 we're going to locate it first pi over 4 is in the first quadrant in the first quadrant all of your trig functions are positive why because both x and y are positive and because the trig functions relate to the points x comma y they're going to retain those same signs and so we're going to look at pi over 4 say hey that's right here that's 45 degrees sine of pi over 4 or 45 degrees is the blue one that's y that's root 2 over 2. that's also true of cosine you see cosine is the x coordinate that's also root 2 the red one in this case and we've seen that right there well what's going to happen with tangent well tangent of pi over 4 it's not shown here it's shown here tangent says you have to take the y and divide by the x well the square root of 2 over 2 divided by the square root of 2 or 2 is 1. so tangent of pi over four is one let's move on once we've done that found sine cosine and tangent of the appropriately given angle whether 45 degrees or pi over four in this case quadrant one we're going to move on to the reciprocals but i do want to show you something notice how all of them are positive it says both x and y are positive sine and cosine are positive and dividing a positive by a positive will also give you a positive when we reciprocate that none of the signs are going to change although these should also be positive this will have the same sign as this this is the same side as this this for this for anything that's not a quadrant angle i can't say that about quadrant angles because some of them become undefined at that at those values but for anything inside of a in a quadrant you're going to have the same sign so let's reciprocate cosecant reciprocates sine notice how it matched up for you i want you to make those connections cosecant reciprocate sine so 2 over the square root of 2. we're going to rationalize very quickly 2 over square root of 2 gives you 2 square root 2 over 2 or just the square root [Music] two for the exact same reason because these are identical you're also going to get the square root of 2 for secant so secant would say reciprocate cosine of whatever the angle is so secant pi over 4 is reciprocal cosine pi over 4 we're going to reciprocate and rationalize well 2 over square root of 2 we'd rationalize and get the square root of 2 again they are identical for pi over 4 sine cosine cotangent is a reciprocal of tangent or whatever angle you have 1 over 1 gives you one over one notice this divided by this or well actually this divided by this for cotangent either way we'd get one i hope you're able to follow me i hope you're seeing that it's not all that hard but it's very easy to make mistakes on it so we need to be very used to our unit circle and starting to really get what's going on here let's take a look at 7 pi over 6 or 210 degrees let's find out on the circle let's find sine cosine tangent the reciprocals and then move on from that one so seven pi over six let's find it first seven pi over six you can count you should be able to count them here's one pi over six two pi over six three pi over six that that simplifies to pi over three and pi over two four five six pi over six six pi over six should give you pi it simplifies and seven pi over six and that's where it is but think about how we're counting i'm gonna start training on how to count the pi over 6 as pi over 3s so that way when it's not on a circle you don't get stuck and so 7 pi over 6 yeah we can find it but count it make sure you know how to do that if we want to find sine cosine tangent the reciprocals of seven pi over six well then we're going to start with sine sine is the first one we come to right here that's the blue one that's the y coordinate it's negative why is it negative really think about this at this particular angle it creates a point on the unit circle that's in the third quadrant in the third quadrant x's are negative look at the x-axis y's are negative look at the y-axis both sine and cosine therefore because x's and y's are both negative those should both be negative but tangent tangent should be positive why well a negative divided by a negative which is what tangent does to x sine divided by cosine will become positive that's what this says says sine is negative cosine's negative but tangent here is the only one that's positive and cotangent will be as well so let's go ahead and do it sine is going to be the y-coordinate so for us sine is going to be negative one-half cosine is the x so negative root 3 over 2 tangents going to divide them in the particular order sine of cosine y over x opposite over adjacent remember this would be that opposite is y over the adjacent which is the x if we simplify that remember they're both negative so negative divided by negative is a positive if you reciprocate and multiply this reciprocate and multiply the twos will cancel the negatives will cancel but you'll get one over the square root of three we really shouldn't leave it we're going to rationalize by multiplying the square root of three over three not sorry square root of three over the square root of three we're going to end with the square root of three over three our reciprocals can be nice for things that don't have square roots in them but for square roots we typically have to rationalize so cosecant notice i'm not going to look at the unit circle i already have that down at y of x i've got the division of those two things reciprocate don't change the sign we're going to get negative 2. reciprocate don't change the sign we're going to get 2 over the square root of 3 negative can you tell that you're going to get really good at rationalizing denominators multiply by square root of 3 over 3 negative 2 square root 3 over 3. and lastly cotangent don't reciprocate this one don't do that because you have to rationalize again you know what you're going to end up with just that if i reciprocated that i get the square root of three which is exactly what you'd get if you took this reciprocated and rationalized you'd end up just getting the square root of three i think i actually did that on a previous example so you could follow the steps but let's be smart about it if we're just reciprocating pick one that is one over something that's kind of nice hope that makes sense we're going to come back we're going to start looking at something in quadrant 4 and then some negative negative angles so swept out clockwise all right let's take a look at just a couple more before i give you some special cases and how to do some kind of arithmetic with some sine functions and cosine functions so let's take a look at 5 pi over 3. let's locate it identify the quadrant whether sine and cosine can be positive or negative identify sine and cosine the tangent then the reciprocals 5 pi over 3 or 300 degrees here's 1 pi over 3 2 pi over 3 3 pi over 3 four pi over three and five pi over three so we're counting thirds that's of course in quadrant number four 300 degrees is also quadrant number four now if we identify that we can easily see sine and cosine so sine is going to be negative square root of three over two and cosine is positive one wait positive y positive look at quadrant number four where this is in quadrant number four our x's should be positive that means cosine should be positive our y's are negative i mean sine should be negative associate that sine with y cosine with x tangent should be negative why because a negative divided by a positive is negative the only one that's positive here is cosine and secant because that's the reciprocal of cosine and that's what this says cosine is positive in quadrant four cosine's positive signs negative tangent will be negative also so let's go ahead and find that because sine deals with the y coordinate and 5 pi over 3 that's negative square root of 3 or 2 and positive 1 half for our x and therefore cosine for the point that's on the circle at that particular angle tangent divides them in that order y over x sine over cosine for that angle the two and the two are going to simplify when i multiply and reciprocate that gives me negative square root of 3. now the reciprocals of those are going to give us our other functions so negative 2 over square root of 3 you probably have recognized this is going to be negative 2 root 3 over 3. so don't be afraid to reciprocate quickly in your head you're going to get very used to these secant is going to be positive 2. we already talked about how secant was going to be positive and cotangent reciprocate that negative square root 3 that's negative 1 over the square root of 3 or negative square root of 3 over 3. those are the six common trig functions that we have for that particular angle all right i'd be remiss if i didn't put in a negative angle of some type so i'm going to do that even have it on at least a fourth quadrant negatively just give you a kind of a head start on what to do here so let's take a look at negative 3 pi over 4 or negative 135 degrees um so one way that we can do deal with this is to sweep this out by counting like pi over fours or counting and taking 360 and and subtracting off that that 135 and what's going to give us is some sort of an angle positively so we can we can do that i i prefer just to count them to get used to it so negative 3 pi over 4 is here's negative 1 pi over 4 2 and 3. negative three pi over four it's coterminal with five pi over four you're going to get the same exact sine cosine tangent all these trig functions as if you had five pi over four or 225 degrees so that's what we're going to be looking at again that's one two three soaked out clockwise that's negatively and it terminates right there so that's what we're really looking at that just like five pi over four it's actually going to lead to some identities later on we're going to see that oh there's certain things we can do with negative conversions to positive types of angles for our trig functions so let's go ahead let's do that if we look at five power four or 225 degrees notice what i said ones of 360 subtracting 135 is going to give us that 225 degrees as well so let's look at that sine should be negative root 2 over 2 cosine is negative root 2 over 2. this is in quadrant 3 not quadrant negative 2 or something quadrant 3 it's going to have sine and cosine both negative tangent positive what negative divided by negative is going to be a positive that's showing that to us so negative root 2 over 2 for both sine and cosine of the angle positive 1 for tangent can you see why hopefully you can dividing y by x or sine divided by cosine for those particular angles is positive 1. that's kind of nice we just deal with cotangent the same way reciprocate that now for our cosecant and secant we're going to reciprocate they should end up being the same also shouldn't they because they're reciprocating the same exact value so negative root 2 over 2 becomes negative 2 over square root of 2. we've seen this before when we multiply by the square root of 2 over square root 2 you're going to get negative square root of 2 after simplifying the twos that end up coming up so just negative 2. and because of the same reason we have that as well i hope i made it make sense on how to use a unit circle basically i'll deal with some some kind of unique or or different sorts of examples in just a little while we'll talk about what would you do if you got just tangent of six pi or something that'll be our first example um so when we're dealing with that we don't necessarily have to find all six trig functions it takes a little bit of time especially you have to rationalize everything so we'll come back for that in just a little bit okay last little bit any less big bit i don't know let's see how fast it goes let's go ahead and we're just going to practice as quick as i can about how to find some of these trig functions i don't need to find all six maybe more than one revolution or negative angular measurement i will also talk about some some of these arithmetic sort of math problems that involve some trig functions so not all that bad i'm also throwing some degrees up there just to get us used to it to make sure that we can do the same thing so let's take a look at something like tangent of 6 pi tangent of 6 pi that's not on here obviously just count your pies count from zero positively which would be counterclockwise one pi two pi three pi four pi five pi six pi so pi is half a revolution that's going to be tangent of same thing as 0 or same thing as 2 pi y divided by x so we've made our rotations we understand that we're coterminal with 0 degrees or 0 radians or whatever you want to consider that as you're going to look at your y divided by x that's what tangent does is sine over cosine y over x is 0 over 1 or just 0. how about secant of negative pi at this point the reason why i correlated your your trig functions for you is that you should start identifying that cosecant and sine are reciprocals cosine and secant are reciprocals so i'm going to do it this way i'm going to think negative pi that's negative half of revolution that's right here the same thing as pi coterminal pi so i'm looking here i'm thinking that well let's see cosine would be negative one secant is a reciprocal negative one over one reciprocate that would be negative one still i hope that makes sense to you i hope you're seeing that we're co-terminating with something that's on our unit circle we're just measuring in a certain different way and then we're looking at our one of our original three trig functions and then maybe reciprocate so secant that's x that would be cosine and then reciprocate that how about oh man sine of 11 pi over two you know you can also do something else this is going to get to our properties of tree function a nice segue to our next video that you can do things like just subtract multiples of 2 pi all of these things repeat themselves on an interval of 2 pi at at minimum that so if we think about that subtracting 2 pi let's see 6 pi minus 2 pi is 4 pi minus another 2 pi is 2 pi minus another 2 pi is 0 gets something between 0 and 2 pi subtract 2 pi until you get there and you will end up getting that so we can do that so if i do that well that's uh be zero if i tangent of 0 is still 0 or secant so subtract or add 2 pi even adding 2 pi is going to say negative pi plus 2 pi is pi that's exactly where we terminated same thing here 11 pi over 2 if i subtract enough two pi's i'm going to end up at some sort of coterminal angle it's on my unit circle you can also count them here's 1 pi over 2 2 pi over 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11. this is where that's going to terminate at 3 pi over 2. if we subtract 2 pi enough we're going to end up right here as well so we're trying to find sine of 11 pi over 2 that's the same as sine of 3 pi over 2 or 270 degrees that's going to be negative 1. sine is our y coordinate for any point on that unit circle we can do something very similar with degree measurements you'll also notice i put parentheses around some of these and the reason is it's absolutely useful when you have math like in equations to put a parenthesis around any sort of angle degrees or radians it doesn't matter it's really nice to do that also if you have negatives we don't want to accidentally infer that subtracting somehow even though secant by itself makes absolutely no sense uh without some sort of an angle there so when we do this we like parentheses so let's take a look at sine 45 cosine 60 and then add them together it's all that same so we're going to go quickly through it sine of 45 degrees says i'm in quadrant one here's 45 degrees sine is the y coordinate on a unit circle that's square root of 2 over 2. plus cosine of 60 degrees here's 60 degrees quadrant 1 cosine is the x-coordinate that's one-half conveniently they both have a denominator of two so we could write that as one plus square root of two over two you could also find a decimal approximation i'm not going to go that far but this is an exact answer for what that represents now when we deal with things like cosecant of 45 i really need you to understand that cosecant relates to the reciprocal of sine so what we're going to do is we're going to find sine of 45 degrees we're going to reciprocate it and that's what this is going to be so here's 45 degrees or pi over 4. sine is square root of 2 over 2 but i'm going to reciprocate that so if i multiply by the square root of 2 over the square root of 2 what we're sorry if i reciprocate that i'm going to get 2 over the square root of 2. if i rationalize the denominator that's 2 root 2 over 2 or just square root 2. so this becomes square root of 2. i hope you followed that i hope you followed that hey this relates to sine it's the reciprocal of sine so find sine got it reciprocated got it rationalize it okay that is what cosecant to 45 degrees is they do make tables for this that's fine if you want to have one but i want you walking through the mouth now because that's being multiplied tangent of 60 degrees tangent of 60 that's a little bit harder too that is take your y divided by x square root of three over two divided by one half we're going to get the square root of 3. multiply by the reciprocal we get the square root of 3 all together that's the square root of 6. that's an exact answer for what that represents because we multiplied those they both had square roots i hope it's making sense to you i hope you're seeing where this comes from trying to make some connections between what these are and what our basic functions are and what our unit circle is doing for you all right just two more maybe try them on your own see if you can figure out what cosecant of pi over 3 is remember that cosecant relates to the reciprocal of sine so we locate pi over three quadrant one we find sine root three over two we reciprocate it then we rationalize it that's going to be the square root of 2 square root of 3 over 3. so this whole thing says look at sine i got it find it for pi over 3 we got it reciprocated we got it rationalize it we got it three times that thing is what this represents that's it plus so we're going to add cotangent of pi over 4. now this one's a little easier cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent so let's look at pi over i four a force here well let's see tangent would be this divided by this or 1 tangent of pi over 4 is 1. cotangent is the reciprocal of 1. well that's also 1. so if we simplify we get 2 square root 3 plus 1. okay our last one we're going to take sine of pi over four multiply by two tangent of pi over four multiply by three and then add them together so sine of pi over four we should be fairly confident in doing this at this point sine of pi over four says look at your y that's root two over two plus 3 times tangent to pi over 4 says take your y over your x that's going to be one simplify them and we get the square root of 2 plus three well i hope i've made that make sense for you i hope that you're really seeing how to use a circle it takes some practice of course and some of these things like cosecants can kind of mess you up a little bit but make it go down or think about it in terms of its root function its reciprocal function figure that out reciprocate and rationalize it typically it goes okay now the last thing last question is what happens if you have some of these angles that aren't on your unit circle like 28 degrees well that's not on here how are you going to figure out sine and cosine from that that is what your calculator is for so if we have sine of 28 degrees and you cannot locate sine of 28 degrees or pi over 12 or one degree or one radian on your unit circle use your calculator that's absolutely fine just make sure that you're in the right mode you see on your calculator you'll have something called degrees or radians dag or rad you want to make sure that you're in appropriate mode before you start plugging stuff in so try it right now try plugging in psi or press sign and press 28. if you're in degrees it's going to be the right thing if you try to do sine of 28 radians it's going to be completely different so if you're trying this on your calculator right now notice that these are approximations they're not going to be exact for you sine of 28 degrees is about 0.47 why well 28 degrees is just less than the hopefully you have a circle in front of you right now 28 degrees is just less than 30 degrees sine of 30 degrees is one half so sine of 28 degrees is just below one half and that's exactly right that's what it is now notice i talked about degrees and not radians because we're in terms of degrees when we start talking about radians well we're going to have to switch our calculator so you can do things like sine of 20 degrees in terms of degrees sine of one degree one degree is one degree is about 0.02 why so small now picture this in your head one degree is just like that just barely up there sine takes the y measurement the y value it's it's almost it's very close to zero because it's so close to that x axis it's barely lifted up so your y coordinate doesn't have time to move very far with that that motion when you see a lack of a degree you are talking about radians and your calculator must be changed into radians so what we're going to do is go into your mode and click on radians and then plug this in so cotangent some calculators have cotangent some do not if you don't what would you do we plug in tangent of pi over 12 and then hit one over that and find the reciprocal of whatever you're getting in this case try it out make sure you're in radians and you should get 3.73 now let's look at this let's look at the difference with that is there a difference between one degree and one radian absolutely we know one degree is one rep one 360th of a revolution one radian is the angle that would take to make an arc length equal to a radius of one well that's way up there there's only two pi radians in an entire circle well two pi radians that's like close to six six point two something all six point three so there's only six point three ish total radians in one circle that would be almost one-sixth of that circle that's gonna be much more well what this would work out to is sine of one radian is going to be the y-coordinate of whatever that swept up angle is in our case 0.84 that's fairly close um fairly close to pi over 3. not exactly but close all right last thing so what about the point negative i think i said last name like five times but last last last last thing uh so the point negative three comma four that is not on a unit circle kind of obviously right because the radius would have to be one and this is way more than one wait a minute how much is it actually could you find the radius because that's what it's going to take in order to find sine cosine tangent trig functions of this um yeah you can if we understand that this would make a right triangle our height is 4 or let's say our opposite consider that opposite would be 4 and our adjacent would be negative 3 or 3 in terms of a measurement there you can use pythagorean theorem really nicely so leg squared plus leg squared equals the hypotenuse squared that's going to be 25. if you take a square root r equals by rights it equals plus and minus 5 because you took a square root of both sides you should have a positive negative but because we want our radius to be positively defined otherwise you're going to be in the wrong quadrant positive radius would be here negative would you do this and then flip it over we know that our quadrant is in two so we want a positive radius to be in quadrant two we can do some other things with negative measured radius but that's that's usually reserved for like polar coordinates when we get there so our radius we're going to say is 5. so we know this is 5. if we want sine cosine and tangent of that angle then all we really have to do is take the y over the radius x over the radius for cosine or the y over the x for our tangent notice how the signs still match up our sine needs to be positive our cosine will be negative and our tangent will be negative all students remember sine should be positive in quadrant two and it is cosine should be negative and it is tangent should be negative and it is so if we wanted to find this this is the reason why i've showed you that triangle the very beginning of talking about a unit circle is that you would understand that we can make a triangle out of it and the only reason why we get just a y on the unit circle is because the radius is one it really should be opposite over hypotenuse well that's we're going to do but in terms of sine and cosine of tangent our opposite is four it's the y we just have to divide by a radius that's not one so divided by that radius sort of shrinks down into a unit circle idea so we're just going to divide it by that five cosine theta same thing would be adjacent or the x over our radius make sure you use the negative tangent is going to divide your y by your x you can divide sine by cosine the fives will cancel get negative four thirds or four over negative three is negative four thirds i'm going to leave it to you to be able to find the cosecant secant and cotangent be very easy just reciprocate reciprocate and reciprocate but i do want to i did want you to see the signs that sine is still positive cosine tangent is still negative i did want you to see that you're still taking y for sine and x for cosine and y over x for tangent but if we do not have a unit circle if we have something off of the unit circle you basically have to divide by that radius so find it and then we'll convert it to something that's similar to a unit circle so we're dividing by five and you're going to see right away the connection between trigonometry on a unit circle or not a unit circle and the triangles i drew at the at the beginning so i hope i made it make sense i hope you really seen the interplay here i've done my best to explain it to you in several different ways hope you're doing well and i'll see you for another video 

Transcript for: Basic Properties of Trigonometric Functions (Precalculus - Trigonometry 8)
welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about some of the basic properties of trig functions sine cosine tangent cosecant secant and cotangent just as as they relate to each other start building some of these ideas called identities and toward the end of this video we're going to start talking about that how identities let us discover a lot more about trigonometry than we would know just by given one trig function so we can we can extrapolate from that or infer from that based on these these identities that we're going to start unpacking right now so we're going to take a look at a unit circle very quick talk about what sine and cosecant how they relate to each other in terms of the x and y coordinates of the points on the unit circle same thing with cosine and secant same thing with tangent and cotangent so let's get started when we talk about sine of some sort of an angle that's swept out counter-clockwise positive on a unit circle or another circle for that matter but unit circles is very convenient for us is when we when we correlate these things with the sign of an angle and a point that's on a unit circle we understand hopefully because i explained a lot that sine of whatever angle this is is going to be given by the y-coordinate of whatever that point is so in our case we're going to have sine of theta equals y remember what trigonometry does trigonometry relates an angle to actually a a ratio of y over one or the opposite over the hypotenuse and the hypotenuse is 1 because we're in a unit circle of a right triangle and so we're always doing that we can't just say sine equals doesn't make sense but sine of some angle is going to equal the y coordinate of a point on the unit circle well because cosecant is this this idea of a reciprocal relationship to sine we can define cosecant of theta as one over that y notice what this is doing because sine theta is y over one i know that one's not there but that one is that radius right there y over one if you reciprocate it is one over y or instead of looking at this if you remember opposite over hypotenuse cosecant would be hypotenuse over opposite for whatever angle that is this is going to play in pretty big when we start talking about domain because while y we're going to get all real numbers we're letting the bag here cosecant we're not because what's going to happen is when y equals 0 that becomes a problem do you remember that i hope you remember that how domain when we have fractions it's an issue when our denominator equals zero we get some undefined values so we have some domain issues things that we cannot plug in and we're going to get that here how about cosine well cosine theta when we take a look at this cosine we've associated with the adjacent or the x side of this so when we take a look at our unit circle cosine of whatever angle we're sweeping out is going to be the x coordinate we can think of this as adjacent over hypotenuse that would be the adjacent side or x side over the hypotenuse of one that would give us just x because secant is defined as the reciprocal of that cosine we can put 1 over x here so instead of adjacent over hypotenuse it's hypotenuse over adjacent that's 1 over x i know that i'm relating this back to the right triangle i'm doing that on purpose because we're going to get there it's a really long time from now but i don't want these two things to be separate i wanted to i want to understand that whether we're talking about sine cosine tangent this these trig functions on a unit circle or a right triangle we're talking about the same thing we can relate them the same way the only one of the main issue differences here is that we can also talk about arc length as it relates to a unit circle but in general i want you to understand that how sine is associated with the y output or the y coordinate but it's also associated with opposite over hypotenuse that same thing for cosine tangent and all the reciprocal functions we can relate them both ways now for tangent tangent is this idea on a right triangle of the opposite side over the adjacent side of a right triangle but for us that would be a y over x we can also get sine over cosine and likewise for cotangent we're going to reciprocate that and get x over y we can think about that a right triangle as adjacent over opposite those are really the the major relationships that we have when we're thinking about trigonometry on a unit circle now we're going to get to inverse functions eventually as well where we're going to be using a unit circle in a slightly different way to go backwards but as it stands right now i really need to get that i need you to understand that sine cosine tangent have reciprocals cosecant secant and cotangent respectively i need to understand that sine of theta relates an angle to the y coordinate cosine is an angle to the x coordinate tangent is an angle to the ratio of those two things and that's really important so now we're going to transition just a bit we're going to talk about domain and range of these trig functions and we're going to do it just by looking at what the outputs could possibly be so let's start with sine remember when we're looking at domain we're trying to think what can i plug in that gives us an actual output not just plug in anything you want what can i plug in or evaluate into my function that's actually giving me something and so really what we're looking at is what angles give us some realistic outputs here that's how we're going to start to find our domain we're going to start with sine and work our way through this we'll do all of the domains and ranges of each of these functions as we go because they interplay off each other a lot especially down to tangent and cotangent so just just remember with domain that one issue we have is that if you ever try to divide by zero or something gives you an output that is divided by zero that input's not valid i'm going to repeat that a slightly different way what we're looking for is to exclude any angle that's our inputs remember talk about domain here exclude any angle that will give us an undefined relationship something over zero so let's take a look at that for sine if we think about sine and if sine is the y coordinate that's why i kind of pounded that into your head just right now if sine of theta is giving you the y coordinate of whatever this points are in the unit circle well let's let's look at y the y coordinate starts at zero so for this angle you start at zero and it's going to get larger larger larger larger larger until it peaks at one one is the largest value that we can get for y and it starts dropping again dropping dropping dropping drop remember i'm focused just on the y coordinates just sign i'm gonna show you slightly different ways a second and then it starts dropping dropping dropping y starts becoming negative here until you get down to negative one that's the lowest it ever gets and it starts climbing again still negative but it's getting closer and closer to zero and then it starts to repeat so for our y values are there any y values that are undefined well what i'm asking is is there anything that i have an angle where my y value is like i don't know or i get something over zero well no that's not true i'm going to show you slightly different way i'm going to use my left hand on the y axis and my right hand to go around the circle and check this out as we climb the y value just gets higher on the switch it gets lower it bottoms out at negative one and then it comes back to zero so all my finger did all my y axis finger did is it moved from here to here then from here to here back from here to here and then back from here to here when we get to graphing i'm trying to make the connection right now when we get to graphing sine is going to do exactly that it's going to climb fall climb from zero to one back to zero to negative one back to zero that's what the sine function is going to look like just this nice repeating curve what do you mean repeating well as soon as you make one full rotation this two pi you're going to get back to where you started and you're going to start getting the same exact y values over and over again that's called a period we're going to get there in just a little bit so if i if we're looking at this think about your angles right now are there any angles that give you this undefined output are there any angles that give you a y that's not on here well no the only y's that we're getting out are from 0 to 1 and then from 0 to negative 1 back and forth between that so all of our angles all of our thetas are actually defined we can plug in any angle and it's going to give us this actual y value it just goes from 1 to negative 1 or negative 1 to 1 that's it so what we're going to say is that for sine we're going to get all real numbers there's not an angle that you can't plug in that's not going to give you something in terms of sine so that y is always defined for us it's always between negative one and one and that's exactly we're going to get for our range right now so you can plug in any angle that you want notice that anything you want anywhere on the circle as many times around as you want to go but ultimately your your y-axis finger is just going to go from here to here somewhere between there well how many numbers are between negative one and one an infinite number of them but you can't get outside of that well that's the range the interval of outputs that you can get is called your range now you can plug in anything sure and get out something between negative one and one so our domain is theta can be all real numbers anything that you want to as many times around as you want to go positive or negative but you can only get out negative one to one now there's no hidden missing numbers in there there's it's continuous here from negative one to one as far as our range is concerned but we don't have anything undefined we don't have anything outside that so our range is you can get out negative one all the way to one we're going to use a bracket to represent that so so we can show two different ways we can show interval notation negative one one or we can show this with inequality notation here negative one bracket and one bracket the sine theta that's that's the largest indicator remember this is actually y and so we can see that y never gets less than negative one never it's bigger than one i know i spend a lot of time on sine but the rest of these are going to flow from that so that or at least the idea let's look at cosine cosine is just x remember cosine is the cosine of whatever angle you have is mapped to the x coordinate let's look at x the same way we did y if i start here with an angle of zero radians or degrees and i start going positively around my circle our x starts at one this is the point one zero as we start going my x gets smaller until it gets a zero then it starts getting negative until it gets to negative one that gets pot of well grows again until it gets back to zero and then positive until i get to where i started so for the same exact reason that sine has a domain of all real numbers cosine also does you can plug in any angle and it's going to give you some sort of an x value not nothing that's undefined nothing that's outside of the range of negative 1 to 1. and so these look very similar so cosine of theta the domain for theta is all real numbers whether you're talking about sine or whether you're talking about cosine remember that both of these things relate an angle to some sort of an output x for cosine and y for sine our range is also the same you can get out for cosine negative one to one anywhere along that interval of the x-axis remember we're just looking at x right now i want to point out a few things just some common misconceptions that students who are just seeing trigonometry the first time or really have never understood it make the first one is that while sine and cosine have the same range and they have the same domain they're talking about different things remember trigonometry really relates three pieces of information it relates an angle and a ratio of two sides or an angle and some way of relating these these coordinates of a point and so what we're talking about here is is really a different type of domain i know that you're used to a domain being an x-axis idea that that's true for for all of our functions that are defined in terms of x and our outputs in terms of y but really we have one type of input which is a domain of an angle and so when we're talking about domain we're talking about what angle can this actually get well sine you can give me any angle why because our outputs are one of two different types of outputs um a y or an x or a comparison of them and so our inputs are angle ideas not an x idea and that can be confusing for students that's the second thing that people get confused on is to say well i thought my domain was just negative one to one and it's not that's actually your range so the first thing is that sine and cosine are different they're not the same thing the second thing is that when we start talking about domain and range it's a little different from normal our domain is what angle can you plug in any angle will give you out some sort of a real y value for sine and some sort of a real x value for cosine i hope you're seeing that i hope you're seeing that the domain is is different than normal it's not just an interval with x it's an interval of an angle so an interval of where you can go on a circle how what radians can you get or degrees can you plug in and get something out for sine for sine and cosines any angle will give you a y or an x respectively what can you get out for those y's x well well now the x axis gives you this interval for cosine this range for cosine and the y axis gives you an interval or this range for sine and that's an idea it's completely different right and so our domain is yeah you plug in any angle but for sine you can't get out anything besides negative one to one or some value between them for cosine it's an x's x axis idea you can't get out anything from negative one to one or some number inside of that um along the x and along the y for cosine sine respectively and i hope i'm making that that makes sense to you um the last thing i want to talk about is graphically notice how sine when i start at zero sine starts at zero gets larger smaller to zero negative and then back to zero cosine does that but shifted and we're going to get an identity later that says that but cosine starts at 1 so cosine is going to start at 1 drop to 0 go negative and get back to 1. so it's a different looking graph they're very very similar in how they're they're shaped and in fact you there's identity transfer one to the other to translate a little bit to shift it uh but for now i need to understand they are different even though they look very similar because one is a y idea and one's an x idea okay i've talked a lot about that let's talk about tangent now tangent's different you see tangent takes out a relationship it says what angle can you plug in such that i get a real defined output out well we know something about domain we know that we can't plug in numbers that cause us to get some sort of fraction with zero on the denominator out and so we're really going to start taking a look at that first i'm actually going to define the range first and then the domain why well because the range is x's y's the the angle is what angle caused or that sorry the domain is what angle causes that that output so we're going to take a look at some outputs for tangent that we really shouldn't allow remember that tangent is y over x and so we're going to look for this as all right if it's y over x then our x where our x is 0 we have a problem so let's start taking a look at our unit circle here our x is one that's no problem remember we're looking at tangent as this y over x so let's see zero over one that's fine and we're going to get positive number over positive number that's not a problem until we get to right here at that point we have the first instance where tangent would have a major issue tangent is one over zero here remember if x is zero this is a problem our x starts from one and as we're going around it goes to zero here negative and then back to zero so at the first and third quadrant angles at pi over two and at three pi over two we have some major issues and so we've sort of taken a look at the range when we're thinking about this thinking what outputs are wrong and then eliminate those inputs that angle from the domain of tangent in this case so we said hey look x is 0 here that means that pi over 2 we're going to get something that's undefined well what that means is that input that pi over 2 is not allowed for tangent same thing happens as we go all the way to here 3 pi over 2 that means that 3 pi over 2 that input is not allowed because it would give us negative 1 over 0 that's something over 0 that's undefined so we've taken a look at range and now we're going to define our domain because of that and so that that's pi over 2 90 degrees 3 pi over 2 270 degrees 5 pi over 2 and you can see that we can go around the circle positively or even negatively so like negative pi over 2 and have some domain issues with tangent we have a slightly easier way to write that in a little bit but these are this is just your idea so every pi over 2 that you get sorry pi over 2 or pi over 2 plus or minus pi that we get we have an issue 90 degrees 270 or another 180 degrees past that or subtracted from that we're gonna have some major problems here i hope you understand that i hope you understand that there's certain angles of tangent because x can take the value of zero right there that we're gonna have some issues with now what was our range well this is this is quite interesting for tangent because tangent takes two values y and x and puts them in ratio y over x x can get very very small when y is close to one well what that means is you get some very very large numbers and say that again when y is close to one x is very close to zero so what's a number very close to one divided by a number very very close to zero it's getting close to infinity so as we approach this pi over two we're getting close to infinity that's why we can't even plug in one over pi over two because we get one over zero that's taking one divided by zero you can divide one by zero it's undefined but just to the left and right of that we're close to positive or negative infinity we're going to see that graphically in just a little while so our range is you can get out anything for tangent now that we've dealt with these we can deal with the reciprocal functions quite nicely as long as you understand this idea the idea of why these can't happen is because of those inputs would give us an undefined output that's a problem so that that means we can't allow that in our domain if you understand that hey taking a ratio of two real numbers on an interval of one to negative one or negative one to one for both these cases you can get anything out of that if you divide them in uh in those relationships that i've shown you like hey y is getting real close to one and it's getting real close to zero one divided by something real close to zero is getting to infinity well if you understand that then we're going to get some very similar things here i want you to think about cosecant so cosecant of theta says what you're going to do is you take 1 over y well wait a minute this is going to have problems if we allow some angles that let y equal 0. so all we've got to do is look at our unit circle and realize that hey if sine gives us y and cosecant is 1 over that y then where y equals 0 we have issues other places are going to be fine but here at this angle 0 we're going to have a problem because this is going to try to take 1 over zero and then oh well that's positive y all the way from here to here that's going to try to take one over zero this is negative y from here to here that's fine so we're going to have two values on the first revolution around the circle they're not allowed at zero and at pi and and so on and so on and if we talk about degrees that'd be zero degrees and 180 degrees and 360 degrees and every 180 degrees past that so we can go round and round around and every so often at every one of those times where our y is equal to zero we'll have something that an angle that we can't plug in that we can't evaluate that is giving us an undefined output and so what this means is that is that in terms of our range we can get out something kind of strange you see this is this is kind of interesting but if we're going to start dividing 1 by y remember that's what this is right this is 1 over y well y's largest value is one and y is large the smallest value is negative one so if we divide one by one i'm sure we're gonna get one or one by negative one we're gonna get negative one but one divided by something between there remember this is between negative one and one well those all those values are smaller than one one to a one divided by something that's mostly smaller than one is going to give you values larger than one what in fact the closer you get to zero the larger these numbers are that doesn't change that oscillates between negative one and one so one divided by negative one is negative one that's that's actually one of our bounds of this of our range and one divided by one is 1 but 1 divided by let's say 0.5 well that's 2 or negative 0.5 that's that's that's negative 2 or let's say 1 divided by 0.1 well that's 10. these numbers can get really big 1 divided by .00000 can it be there yeah we can have that here's why it's very very small one divided by very small numbers is very large or very small negative numbers is very large negatively if you will so what our range becomes is we can get out a lot of negatives up to negative one and then one to infinity so the only things we can't get out is this interval between negative one and one it it should make some sense that i'm basically reciprocating everything right so we're going to get this this outside idea of negative one to one sure we can get out negative one and one just by dividing but remember that y is bound by that y is it can only be smallest value negative one largest value one everything else is between there dividing one by some numbers smaller than one you're going to get values larger than one or out or outside that that range of negative one to one now how about secant the same exact thing happens here you can probably see it it's just that our domain is going to be different because we're looking for where our secant is one over zero where x is zero so where is x zero x is zero at pi over two and three pi over two okay now why in the world would this have the same domain as tangent does why well this says if i take y divided by x where x is not matter where x is 0 that's given us issues and this is saying the same thing look at our denominator here's a denominator of x here's a denominator of x y is defined everywhere one is a constant so the only issues we could possibly have are where x can equal zero they're the same exact angles where x can equal zero remember our inputs are angles here where our angles are pi over two three over three pi over two five pi over two and etc you're going to get x values of zero that makes these inputs give us an undefined output for both of those cases now our our range is going to be the same as for cosecant but remember we're talking about a different a different output this is 1 over y and this is one over x so he's talking about x values okay last one then we're going to talk about the periods of all of these these trig functions uh period is how often they repeat so we'll talk about that a little bit how about cotangent well for the same exact reason that uh secant matches up with tangent cotangent is going to match up with cosecant what does that mean cosecant says if your y equals zero you got problems well same thing with cotangent if your y equals zero you got problems here so cotangent takes a relationship of the x divided by the y so any angle that gives us an output where y is equal to zero is going to give us a problem something that's that's that input is undefined and so what we're going to say is that r theta cannot be the same exact values that are cosecant is cotangent is creating this relationship of an angle to the x coordinate divided by the y cosecant is creating this relationship between angle and one over y so where this equals zero is the same place where this equals zero and both of those would be undefined so we're just going to basically copy down those so at zero at zero your y is zero and at high your y is zero and at two pi or why is it zero and lots of other places as we keep going around and around that unit circle both positively and negatively for the same exact reasons that tangent of theta can give you an output of all real numbers anywhere y divided by x same thing happens here x divided by y well x is all real numbers and y is all real numbers the only things that we're excluding are where your y is 0 you can get everything out of that as well i probably could have just given all this to you and said hey here's your domain but i hope that you stick with me and that you walked through it and understand why why it is you can plug in any angle here hopefully you understand a little bit more that what trigonometry does is relates an angle that is what you're plugging in here that's what you're evaluating and your outputs are something on the x-axis or something on the y-axis or ratio of those two things hopefully you understand that now so our domain is talking about what angles can you plug in any of them because your y is defined between negative one and one everywhere for cosine any of them because your x is defined negative one to one everywhere on the x axis tangent you can't plug in things where where your x is zero well that's going to be these particular angles you can get out of everything because of that ratio cosecant you can't plug in things where y equals zero any angles where y is going to be zero why well because it's based on your sign and your coseting can't look at anything where x is any angle where x is going to be zero and that's why we exclude those cotangent you can't plug in anything where y is equal to zero again because that's the reciprocal of tangent so hopefully you understand a little bit more about where that's coming from we'll talk about what our periods are in just a second when we hear about what a period is in trigonometry it's an interval on on which a repeatable interval on which your outputs of that trig function repeat and so that idea of being a repeatable interval on which your trig functions output or repeats what that means is that we can we can really repeat a lot of the outputs every so often and that period is going to really help us in graphing really understand what these trig functions are all about so let's take a look at what this period means this interval of repetition for your tree function basically let's take a look at sine so what we're looking for is where is this repeatable repetition of your output happening well here's our outputs our sign is in blue here so here's zero here's one half root two over two root three over two and one and i want to show you something on how to how to really think of this if you want to memorize your unit circle really quickly here it is sine always counts up and cosine counts down from where you start so so check this out here's root 3 over 2 root 2 over 2 root one over two and root zero over two this is actually root four over two so if you think about that this is the square root of four over two that's one square root of three over two square root of two over two square root of one over two square root of zero over two so you can count down with cosine cosine count on the side counts up square root of 0 over 2 square root of 1 over 2 square root of 2 over 2 square root of 3 over 2 square root of 4 over 2 and then counts back down it's a nice way to remember that but let's let's look at let's just sign out but let's look at the outputs of outputs as it relates to our angles which are our sine outputs so zero one half root two or two we get our output starting to repeat right here you go oh then our our period is a repetition from here to here well i suppose but it's not repeatable because this angular distance from here to here is not the same as from here to here even though those are the same that angle is pi over 4 and 3 pi over 4 or 45 degrees and 135 degrees that's not the same distance or angle movement if you will as it was from an output of one half to one half so we're not going to consider that to be a period what we want is this every single output is repeated on this particular interval of an angle well what that's what's going to happen is we don't get another one half past this one until we get all the way back on one full revolution or two pi the period of sine is two pi well for cosine we have exactly the same thing we get 3 pi over 2 and the next time we see 3 3 pi over 2 is all the way back right here well that's great but the other in the other outputs of x or cosine theta they're not repeated in the same interval as that so this root 2 over 2 that's repeated a lot sooner than that root 3 over 2 was so what we're looking for is this this interval this angular interval on which all of our outputs are repeated that often for x and that also is 2 pi i'm going to explain that here right now so we don't get back to the square root of 2 over 2 and one half until we make one full revolution that's the same exact interval on which we're getting those outputs back so sine and cosine both have the same what we call period this same interval on which we're going to repeat start repeating all of our outputs for both y and x now tangent's weird we might think well tangent is going to be 2 pi also but it's not it's not because what we're looking for are this interval on which all of our outputs are starting to be repeated well for tangent that's sooner and it has to do with the signs this positive divided by negative negative divided by negative is given us a positive so check it out on pi over 4 we get square root of 2 over 2 divided by square root of 2 over 2 that's what tangent would be tangent is y divided by x we can see that right here sine of cosine or y divided by x so that's going to give us one but right here we also get one negative square root of two over two divided by negative square root of two over two that gives us positive one so for tangent we can see here pi over three and four pi over three we have the same relationship these are both positive these are both negative but when we divide them they give us the same output and so because we relate tangent as y over x and because positive divided by positive and negative divided by negative are both positive positive divided by negative and negative divided by positive are both negative we're going to get a period or this interval on which all of our outputs for our trig function tangent repeat is pi not 2 pi now what's very nice is that cosecant and secant because they relate to sine and cosine respectively we have the same periods and the same thing for cotangent as it relates to tangent so what this does is this gives us what is called an identity what an identity is is this truth about trigonometry that works all the time and allows you to extrapolate information from it so here's our very first identities well kind of third ones i didn't call them identities but that's one of them tangent equals sine of cosine as far as our angles are concerned so what these do is it says okay here's what we can do we know that because our output sign repeats for every one of our outputs not just some of them some of the times but every one of them all the time on a period of two pi a repetition of an angle two pi that's one full revolution or another full revolution because that happens we have this identity we have this identity that hey if you have sine of some sort of an angle then if you add 2 pi or subtract 2 pi or multiples of that what's that k that k is a whole number like one two three four five if you add multiples of two pi so add two pi or four pi over six pi or eight pi or subtract two pi four pi six by eight pi any any product of that two pi well then you're going to get the same exact output really get this it's going to make the rest of this make sense really get this that sine of this theta this angle is a y value now go a full rotation you're the same y value go another full rotation you're at the same y value doing that a lot of times or negative a lot of times you're just getting the same y value all this says is sine your your y value basically sine of your angle plus or minus full rotations is the same y value as whatever that angle is so ultimately you can add or subtract multiples of 2 pi and get the same output as it relates to sine the same thing happens for cosine because cosine is your x value of whatever angle you have that point on the unit circle so it says hey cosine of whatever angle you're going to get an x value if you go full rotation you get the same x value either way you go positive or negative you're going to get that same thing that's what this is any multiple of full revolutions is going to give you the same exact x value you can see all the time so if you went to let's say pi over 6 your x value your cosine of pi over 6 is 3 pi over 2. go full rotation you're back there go again you're back there go backwards a couple times you have the same x value same output for tangent it's quicker than that so for tangent because of the way that our positive and negative interact positive and positive is the same as a negative divided by negative because of that our period was sooner and we have a slightly different identity it says that if you start adding pi or subtracting pi from your angle that tangent plus or minus some sort of a multiple of pi 1 pi 2 pi 3 pi 4 pi whatever you're going to get the same exact output as tangent of whatever this angle is plus or minus those multiples of pi remember what that k is is just multiplying pi by simple numbers so 1 pi 2 pi 3 pi 4 pi and so forth you add or subtract that we're going to get the same for these it's going to look very similar i'm not going to talk you through it i'm just going to tell you that these are the same identities that we have here we can add and subtract full revolutions for sine cosine cosecant secant and half revolutions pi for tangent and cotangent and get the same exact value out the same output out which gives us identities that we can use so one thing this allows us to do is instead of like counting full revolutions and things like that we can really easily translate things that are outside of our normal interval from 0 to 2 pi into something on there so because we know all our periods we know that sine cosine secant and cosecant repeat all of our outputs repeat every 2 pi tangent cotangent every pi every half revolution and every full revolution counter respectively there that we can just start adding and subtracting those things and so we just get we're going to identify what trig function we have what the period is and then add or subtract mostly subtract here um 2 pi for all of sine cosine cosecant secant and pi tangent and cotangent or multiple zero to get ourselves within that that normal interval that normal domain for us and so let's try it let's try sine so we know that sine has this this period of 2 pi that means i can add or subtract multiples of 2 pi that's what that case says says any number of 2 pi's that you want 2 pi 4 pi 6 pi whatever until you get down into that interval of 0 2 pi so let's take a look at it 19 pi over 2 is that's a lot and i have to count a lot of revolutions if i wanted to figure that out but if i start taking 19 over 2 and just starting or 19 pi over 2 and start subtracting 2 pi you can really do it this way if you understand that we're in terms of pi here just take 19 over 2 that's 19 pi over 2 and subtract 2 or 2 pi and just keep on doing it so subtracting 2 that's 15 halves well what if we subtract it again that's 11 halves what if we subtract it again well that's that's seven halves well if you subtract two again that's three halves so what that means is sine of 19 pi over two is the same thing as sine of three pi over two so we've just got to figure out what sine of 3 pi over 2 is so we're going to go 3 pi over 2 that's that's on that's within this 0 to 2 pi interval that is going to be negative 1. and we're done one thing i'll do i'll let you in a little hint here um one thing i do is i look at my denominator it's like two or two or six or four or four and i look at what my period is so for sine it's two and cosine is 2 pi and tangent's 1 5. and i'll take and i'll multiply my denominator by whatever that is 2 2 or 1 and i'll start subtracting that number until i get down to something that's in my interval so for instance 19 over 2 okay so 19 over 2. i'm going to take that 2 my denominator multiply it by 2 because my period is 2 pi that's 4. that's just our subtracting force so 19 minus 4 well that's uh that's 15 that's still not within my zero two pi if i'm starting to divide by two i would just start subtracting that until i get down to my three and then three divided by two is less than two so less than that full revolution if that helps you great um if not then just start subtracting 2 pi so that's 2 minus those fractions until you get down to something that's within your unit circle we do the same thing with with 9 pi over 2 so 9 pi over 2 we're still dealing with with cosecant that has a period of two pi so i'm gonna start subtracting two pi so i know that nine halves minus two well that's four halves so nine halves minus four halves is five halves minus four halves again is one half this is the same thing as cosecant of pi over two so what's that what's that mean what's nine pi over two mean that means we're going pi over two nine times well every 4 pi over 2's is going to be 2 pi think about that 4 pi over 2 is 2 pi so if we just start subtracting 4 pi over 2 to match our denominator we're going to subtract 4 from that 9 that's 5 pi over 2. well that's still outside of this interval here so subtract again that's one pi over two and that's exactly how we're getting this you can show your work if you want to start subtracting two like we did or two pi like we showed but that's ultimately we're gonna get so cosecant of pi over two here's pi over two cosecant is one over y so we're going to get one over one just one how about tangent so tangent of 19 pi over six tangent's period is every pi and so i'm going to start subtracting honestly just my denominator until i get something within my interval so tangent of 19 pi over 6 i'm going to start subtracting one pi intervals of one pi pro multiples of one pi actually i should say so 19 pi over six let's see 19 pi over six minus six pi over six that's just pi but i'm matching my denominator so notice i'm subtracting 1 there that would be 13 pi over 6. now 13 pi over 6 is still more than one full revolution so i'm going to subtract that again that's 7 pi over 6 now that's something that's on our unit circle but i'm going to do one more step so 7 pi over 6 is right here tangent tangent would be negative one half that's y divided by x that's negative square root of three over three so negative one half divided by negative square root of three over three i'm gonna do it in my head right here you should work it out negative divided by negative is a positive one half divided by square root of three over three those twos are going to cancel you're going to get 1 over the square root of 3 or square root 3 over 3. now i said i was going to do it slightly different well what if we did one more remember that tangent it has a period every pi so we could make it so that we find some angle between here and here every time so if we subtract one more pi just one more time it puts us back right there so if i do that so that's one pi over six notice notice something make it make sense that this period is actually pi here because tangent of one pi over six that's one pi over six should be exactly the same here's pi over six one half divided by three pi square root of three over two is the same thing as negative one half divided by divided by negative square root of three over two you're still going to get one half over square root of three divided by square root of three over two you're going to get those twos cancel one over square root of three is square root of three over three it's exactly the same thing that shows you that the period of pi over period of tangent is this pie repeats every pie because of those signs that we talked about earlier you should try the next couple on your own i'm going to go really quickly through them i'm going to show you sort of my shortcut on how to do this so what i what i always do i take a look at my denominator i look at my period and i multiply by that number in front of my pi 2 2 1 2 2 1. so i'm going to take my sign sign has a period of 2 pi i'm looking at my denominator of 4 that means that i'm going to be subtracting 2 pi from this that would be 2 pi over 1 same thing as 8 pi over 4. so notice i'm taking this multiplying by 2 that's going to give me my multiples of my fractions in the same denominator so i'm going to take my 9 pi over 4 and subtract 8 pi over 4 from it why 8 pi over 4 because that's still two pi so that's why what i was talking about take your denominator multiply by two that's the fraction that you want to start subtracting so nine pi over four minus eight pi over four is pi over four that looks good that's some value that's on our unit circle as far as our angle is concerned that's going to be square root 2 over 2. we know that y is our sine of whatever angle is last one cotangent cotangent has a period of pi so i'm going to be taking 17 pi over 4 and subtracting let's see that's one one times my denominator 4 that's 4 pi over 4 so i take my denominator multiply it by the number that's in front of my period and that's the fraction you start subtracting so 17 pi over 4 minus 4 pi over 4 remember that that right there is still 1 pi that's how we're getting it well that's going to give us 13 pi over 4. remember that we can always get tangent and cotangent down between zero and pi well what that means is that you should have some number on your numerator less than four for sine and cosine cosecant secant you should have some number in your numerator less than whatever two times your denominator is always that so if i keep subtracting that's nine pi over four that doesn't look like one of these angles here five pi over four uh let's see here's five pi over four i could do that but we could go further as well remember if the period of tangent and cotangent is zero to pi then you can always subtract or add these angles until you get somewhere on this particular interval right here for sine cosine secant and cosecant it's the full rotation and so what we're looking for is for tangent and cotangent to have this number less than that number for sine cosine secant cosecant to have this number less than twice that number that's 2 pi somewhere in there so that's going to give us this pi over four so cotangent of pi over four here's pi over 4 takes my x divided by y now it's because they're both the same you're still going to get one i hope that makes sense to you i hope you're seeing the interplay on on how we can use these identities and say hey let's just start adding or subtracting two pi or pi whatever our interval is and multiples of that um you could be a little more fancy and not have to do it several times if you thought a little a little bit harder about it i gave you the most basic thing i could think of there as far as is actually doing it what we're looking for again what we're looking for is to get something that's on our unit circle with the same output it's way easier than counting our revolutions to get back to that so i hope that i've made it make sense i'm going to come back with a couple more but at this point you really should understand that for these values of our trig functions that are more than one revolution even for tangent more than a half revolution we can always get something for tangent and cotangent here for sine cosine secant cosecant on our unit circle by adding or subtracting the appropriate number of periods okay a lot of students think these are easier they probably are because we're not dealing with fractions the same thing holds remember that like cosine and secant have the same period well they're based on the same thing really sine and cosecant have the same period and what that means for that that period of 2 pi is we can also add or subtract 360 degrees so whether you're dealing with tangent or cotangent add or subtract 180 secant cosecant adder subtract 360 and get down to the appropriate kind of uses of our unit circle really for sine and cosine you should be somewhere on this full full unit circle for tangent cotangent somewhere on the half of that unit circle so take a look at cosine 420 well that that's way more than one full rotation so let's subtract 360 degrees and say we see where we land if we subtract 360 degrees that's exactly the same we can do then we're going to get cosine of 60 degrees now cosine 60 degrees is really easy to find that's going to be one-half the same thing works with secant actually secant has a period of 2 pi so if we take 540 degrees which is more than 360. more than on our unit circle right now let's subtract 360. so secant of 180 degrees just subtracting 360 it's gonna be the same output now secant is this one over x it's one over cosine so one over x gives us negative one so we can do this with radian type measurements we can do with degrees degrees are typically a little easier because we can add and subtract 360 or 180 a lot nicer than we can these fractions of radians but that's just about it i hope i made it made sense i hope that you understand the interplay between our period and what we can do with it i probably went a little overboard and did a lot of examples just so you could see the hey you know what you're adding for 2 pi 2 times that denominator pi every single time and for tangent cotangent 1 times your denominator pi every single time i i've made that clear but hopefully you see that i'm trying to end with something that's on our circle to make it easy well i thought i'd give you a little extra here a quicker way to look at how to simplify some of these angles they go more than one revolution around a unit circle or even that don't in tangent and cotangent case so i'm going to show you kind of a special trick i want to give you a basic way and you certainly can do that by subtracting the period over and over and over for the respective trigonometric function but i'm going to show you a quick way to do it i hesitate because students use it like a trick without fully understanding it but i think it's going to benefit you so i'm going to give it to you anyway so here's the deal how we can sum how we can simplify the angle of a trig function that goes more than one period around a unit circle is by by dividing it in a special way and looking at the remainder upon division has to do a little bit with number theory uh modality of number so i want to look at 11 pi over 2 now obviously that goes around the unit the circle a lot more times than just one so here's what i can do what i do is i take my denominator i multiply it by the period for sine in this case which is 2 pi and then i look for the remainder of my numerator divided by that thing so here's what i'm going to do i'm going to take a look at 2 times 2 pi now that's 4 pi i'm going to take 11 pi divided by 4 pi now the pi's are going to cancel so i'm really looking at 11 over 4. not 11 over 2 11 over 4. or 11 divided by 4. so 11 divided by 4 4 goes into 11 two times and if i subtract them i'm going to get 3. this is irrelevant this is how many times you complete the period on the unit circle that's irrelevant what matters is imagine this imagine going around the inner circle one two times where you end after that is the important part that's what that number tells you so the remainder tells you how many or how far you go past the full revolutions here this does not matter this does matter and this will tell you your new numerator of that angle so 11 pi over 2 is going to be the same thing for sine as 3 pi over 2 not over 4 2 because the period is 2 pi so that 4 gets divided again by that 2. so sine of 11 pi over two is the same thing as sine of three pi over two take your denominator multiply your period divide your numerator by that number your pi's are going to cancel and you're looking for the remainder that becomes this new numerator and it will be somewhere on your unit circle let's look at tangent so tangent of 6 pi now let's look at the denominator of that angle that's one the period for tangent and cotangent is just pi so i'm going to take 1 times pi well that's just pi 6 pi divided by pi is just 6. so i'm going to take 6 divided by 1 times pi is 1 so i'm taking 6 divided by 6. if i take 6 and divide it by 1 it goes in 6 times and there's a remainder of zero now what's this mean six pi says what this means is you'll complete the period six full times one two three four five six for pi or sorry for tangent so that period is pi and you complete it six times the remainder says where you go after that so you end at zero so wait a minute that right here is your new numerator zero times pi is zero tangent of six pi is going to be exactly the same as tangent of zero why because if you go six pi's one pi is half a circle two three 4 5 6. you end right back where you started at 0. this just does it for you so take denominator times period for your respective trig function divide it look for your remainder that remainder is your new numerator in this case zero how about cosine cosine eight pi over three cosine has a period of two pi we need to know that so all four of these have two pi all of you all of your sine cosine secant cosecant have a period of two pi tangent cotangent one pi let's take our numerator that's 3 multiply it by your period that's 2 pi that's going to be 6 pi and what i'm going to do is i'm going to take my 8 pi over 3 divided by 6 pi my pi's are going to cancel and i get 8 and i get eight pi over six so eight divided by six six goes into eight one time there's a remainder of two i don't care about this this says you've completed one full period for cosine that's two pi where you're out are past that is two pi over three pi over three past that this is your new numerator so cosine of eight pi over three is the same thing as cosine 2 pi over 3. this says how many periods you complete this is how far past that completion you are it will be starting with the unit circle this is your new numerator for pi so in this case cosine two pi over three and you can figure that's uh is negative one half because that would be the x coordinate of that now do you use your unit circle for that i'm not really not really going that far i'm just showing you how to get something that's on your unit circle you figure out the rest how about sine of 19 pi over four sine has a period of two pi so i'm going to take my denominator multiply it by my period that's 8 pi 19 pi divided by 8 pi pies are going to cancel i'm going to look at 19 divided by 8. 8 goes into 19 two times a remainder of three the remainder is what's important this says you complete two two full circuits around that that period so two rotations and then what you're gonna do is you're gonna have a leftover of three that's your new numerator that's sine of three pie over four not eight because it's based on the fact that there are a period of two pie not just one pie so it's always your same denominator that you keep this is just giving your new numerator that's on the unit circle uh let's see that would be quadrant one two three quadrant two and then you're going to get um square root of 2 over 2. let's do tangent 19 pi over 6. so tangent 19 pi over 6 we're going to take a look at tangent understand the period for tangent is 1 pi take your denominator multiply it by your period so 6 times 1 pi is 6 pi your pi's are going to cancel we're going to look at 19 divided by 6. please recognize that you do tangent different from sine tangent has a period of one pi that's half a circle it repeats every half a circle sine is two pi that it repeats on a predictable repeatable fashion so we're going to divide 6 goes into 19 three times with a remainder of one that's your new numerator so this is equivalent to tangent of one pi over six so you complete three periods not rotations not full rotations that's not the thing here is you've completed three periods your remainder is one past that so pi over six it would be the new angle that you could determine tangent of pi over 6 is going to give you that oh let's see one half over square root of 3 over 2 so square root of 3 over 3. now cotangent has the same period as tangent does so if our period is pi for cotangent 4 times pi gives us 4 pi pi's cancel we're going to look at 17 divided by 4. can you do it in your head yeah of course you can 17 divided by 4 4 goes into 17 four times it will complete four periods the remainder is one so there's a one is your numerator pi over your original denominator and cotangent of pi over 4 is a lot easier than thinking about that cotangent pi over 4 is going to be reciprocal of tangent pi over 4 so that's going to be square root 2 over 2 divided by square root 2 over 2 that's 1 or reciprocal is also 1. so that would be 1. last one cosecant cosecant has the same period as sine they're very related and so we're going to say hey the period of cosecant is 2 pi denominator times your period that's 4 pi and divide that's going to be 9 divided by 4 so take 9 divided by 4 and look for the remainder if your remainder is 0 then you get 0 that's fine but here our remainder is 1. 9 divided by 4 is 2 and one fourth two full periods and one fourth of the next one why do you get pi over 2 and not pi over 4 is i just said it one-fourth of the next period well because the period is 2 pi one-fourth of the next two pi is one-half so pi over two and that's exactly what we have here so nine divided by four four goes in that two times with a remainder of one we get one pi over two so cosecant of pi over two um well we think sine of pi over two that would be one so reciprocal is one so we'd get one here as well i hope that makes sense to practice that if we understand the period of our trig functions we can take denominator times period divide pi's are going to cancel and look for your remainder that's your new numerator with the same denominator because we have periods of 2 pi for sine cosine secant cosecant and 1 pi for tangent cotangent hope that makes sense that's a little bit extra but it'll make things much quicker for you hope that helps now lastly please remember that your signs are very important and so you should be able to determine what quadrant your angle is in just by looking at the sine of whatever your trig function is so for instance let's say that you have this um you have the the relationship that secant of your angle is negative sine of your angle is positive what quadrant would you would you would that angle be in well let's think about this for a second in quadrant one all of your trig functions are positive every single one of them in quadrant two only sine is positive and that means cosecant is positive y in quadrant two your x values are negative and your y values are positive if your x values are negative that means cosine and secant are both negative now we see that cosine's negative but secant would also be negative it's 1 over cosine tangent's also negative y and positive divided by negative is negative and cotangent's negative y a negative divided by a positive is negative so only sine and cosecant are positive here and you can work your way around and kind of see that only tangent and cotangent are positive here only cosine and secant are positive here because the interplay between these signs of our axes there positive x and negative y is going to create for you this hey negative y for these particular angles is going to say that sine and cosecant tangent and cotangent are all negative in that quadrant so going back to my question what if you knew that secant was negative and sine was positive well sine being positive says you're either here or you're here secant being negative says it can't be over here everything's positive here that would put you in quadrant two it's useful think about things like that let's think about what if cosine is negative and tangent is positive if cosine is negative and tangent positive is positive what quadrant would you lie in cosine is negative cosine being negative would be any of these two but sorry uh cosine yeah cosine negative but tangent being positive would say if cosine's negative you're somewhere over here why well cosine's positive here cosine's positive here so these are the only two quadrants or cosines negative but tangent being positive would say i have to be in quadrant three that's the only place where let's see x's are negative cosine's negative but tangent is positive negative divided by negative would give you positive you can think about things like that on what quadrant think about this on your own would uh let's see secant be positive but cosecant be negative secant positive and cosecant negative big positive video think about that secant positive would be either quadrant one or quadrant four because secant relates to cosine cosine's positive here secant is positive here cosine's positive here secant is positive here everywhere else that's negative secant positive would be in these two quadrants cosecant negative well let's see cosecant negative would be cosecant is positive here because sine is positive here cosecant's positive here because sine is positive here cosecant is negative on these two quadrants so if cosine is positive that'd be oh sorry if secant is positive that means one of these two but if cosecant's negative that's in one of these two this is only one that has both secant positive and cosecant negative so i hope that makes sense uh you really should be getting these signs down sine and cosecant have the same signs in the same quadrants so do secant and cosine so tangent and cotangent so take a look at your unit circle and just really get used to that hopefully that makes sense we're going to come back with some more identities talk about the reciprocal identities in the next video have a great day 

Transcript for: Reciprocal Identities in Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 9)
welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the reciprocal identities to some trig functions we'll see how to use them and be pretty brief we'll talk about what happens when a trig function can be assumed to be on a unit circle and when it can't and maybe you can think of it both ways so we'll talk about how to deal with them and find other trig functions given that we know just a couple of them or one and the quadrant that it in which resides so let's get started we've seen this a couple times but i want to make sure that we're really really comfortable with how these functions interplay so if we define sine of theta as y and cosine of theta is x relating to a unit circle and sine of theta gives you that y coordinate of a point on the unit circle and cosine theta gives you the x coordinate and tangent of theta is the comparison of those two the y over the x well remember something though this is for a unit circle what that means is the radius is one so this would really be y over one and x over one we're going to talk about that in just a little bit and how you can consider this um this particular trig function to relate to a unit circle or to relate to something that's bigger than unit circle where your radius is more than one or less than one even so then we also talked about cosecant secant and cotangent and that those are called reciprocal functions of these trig functions so when we have sine of theta equals y well if it's y over one cosecant of theta is one over y but wait a minute if cosecant theta is one over y and y is sine theta then we can also think of this as one over sine theta and the same thing works for secant theta and cotangent theta relating to the respective trig functions so we can see cosine of theta is x well that's x over one secant theta therefore is one over x or secant theta is one over cosine because x is cosine theta on that unit circle tangent of theta is y over x so cotangent is x over y but because y is sine theta and x is cosine theta we can also think of tangent as this relationship of sine over cosine for whatever angle you have and cotangent as cosine over sine the big deal here really isn't to to memorize these like verbatim as far as formulas but to get the idea you can tell that i'm really really trying to repeat myself on cosecant matches up with with uh with sine and secant with cosine cotangent with tangent that's an easy one because it has the same same name but people oftentimes get these two things confused why i think because that starts with a c and this starts with an s so they want to pair them up that's not the way that it works so i'm really trying to get you to remember that cosecant and sine are reciprocals of one another secant and cosine are reciprocals of one another tangent and cotangent are reciprocals of one another which means that yes these formulas are nice but honestly it's just take your fraction and reciprocate it and you will find secant for sine cosecant sorry um secant for cosine cosecant for sine cotangent for tangent and they go back and forth that's really the the drive behind this so we're going to practice this very quickly just to show you uh that this is not all that bad so let's look at let's look at this angle and sine of this angle is four-fifths and cosine of this particular angle phase is negative three-fifths and they're asking you to find the rest of those four basic trig functions you go okay is it that hard to do not really work your way through with the reciprocal identities now we're going to talk a lot about this firstly why do they give you two of them why is there sine of four-fifths and cosine theta of negative three-fifths do you even need to know the angle first off to determine these other trig functions and why are there two of them let's answer the second question first why do they give you two trig functions the reason is is because with those two trig functions like sine of theta and cosine theta we can determine where this angle actually is in what quadrant it is and that helps us find out the other trig functions and the signs of those trig functions which is very important to do especially with tangent because that's not given so so here's a couple things we should know this should be in your head right now we should understand that if sine is positive so is cosecant that's why i'm having you make that relationship between them because they'll always have the same sign if cosine's negative secant's negative again those para those are reciprocals of one another so they have to have the same side taking a reciprocal does not change your sign now tangent and cotangent we really wouldn't be able to say if we covered that up and didn't know it we wouldn't be able to say what the sine of tangent would be why not well because if you look at sine of theta this gets it comes into our second question but if you look at sine of theta sine of theta has four or five now you can think of this two different ways this is answering the second part of this question is this on a unit circle or not it doesn't even matter well you could think of this as a y a four and a radius of five in which case it would not be on the unit circle okay well that's possible we're going to deal with that in just a little bit in the second part of this video or you could think of this as well wait a minute four-fifths is point eight remember that the range of sign goes from negative one to one and every value between them do you remember that sine theta is from negative one all the way to one all these y values all those blue values so somewhere in there you're going to hit point eight now watch very carefully point eight here's let's say y equals 0.8 there are going to be two outputs for sine theta that give you positive four-fifths point eight and we could consider it to be on a unit circle it'd be like having a y of 0.8 and a radius of one that would be here or here let's say somewhere in there but wait a minute cosine and all the other trig functions it would it would matter what quadrant we reside in so that we would know the sign so putting this all together i'm going to kind of repeat a little bit of what i said number one why do you why are you given two so that you can determine the signs of the rest of your trig functions it's very important so we know that sine is positive and cosine is negative or sine theta is positive cosine theta is negative for this particular angle that's going to help us here so that's great second part of this question so it tells you the quadrant and we'll talk about that in a second the second part of this question is is that on a unit circle does it even matter it doesn't really matter for two reasons i'm gonna say them again if you consider this to be on the unit circle this would be like four-fifths over one you'd have a y of four-fifths and a radius of one that'd be y over one or four point eight over one if you will um that would be on a unit circle now why in the world are they the same that's that's another like question that we should ask why are they the same why doesn't it matter it has to do with similar triangles so imagine something imagine a y of 0.8 that's four-fifths and a radius of one now grow it make it a y of four and a radius of 5. nothing changes due to the fact that those particular angles sine of that particular angle has to do with a ratio a comparison of two sides y over the radius in this case would be one or you consider four or five if you multiply point eight over one times five over five you're going to get the same relationship four over five that angle does not change as our triangles get bigger and bigger and bigger it's going to be the same exact relationship so long story short it doesn't really matter what does matter is determining the quadrant that's why we're giving 2 these things and making sure we understand the reciprocal identity so let's determine the quadrant here if sine is positive and we don't have that this is going back to the first question if we don't have that thing there's no way to determine the rest if we had no idea that cosine was negative remember sine on a unit circle would be sine of theta would be 0.8 that's positive 0.8 here or 0.8 here that's two particular that's two different points on um on this unit circle we we needed to be one point to find out the rest of our trig functions so we'd say all right if sine is 0.8 remember sine is positive here we're either here or here if cosine is negative we can't be in the first quadrant but only in the second and that locates the quadrant for us let's take a moment and review this for a second do you remember that in quadrant one all of our trig functions are positive so sine cosine tangent and the reciprocal functions they're all positive here in quadrant two only sine is positive and therefore cosecant is positive the cosine is negative here only tangent is positive and cotangent is positive why i'm making those connections for you in quadrant four only cosine is positive and therefore secant is also positive so if we wanted to find the quadrant where sine is positive that's one or two but cosine is negative well remember you're either in one or two and now cosine's negative says you have to be here that's what this means it says sine is positive cosine's negative that's located in the quadrant for you and that will help you determine the signs specifically in this case of tangent so let's walk our way through it i've talked a lot about it hopefully you understood the point that can you consider this on a unit circle yes yes if you think about this as four-fifths over one then that's point eight that's on the range negative one to one there will be a point on this unit circle with a y value of 0.8 somewhere and this is the angle that's giving you that y value that's exactly what's happening it can happen in two locations either here or here that's why we need this to say it ain't this one it's got to be that one and that puts us in quadrant two so is it on unit circle doesn't really matter but you can consider it to be here if not then it's just a bigger circle and you have a radius of 5 and that's fine too the point is that we can't determine the quadrant given two trig functions or knowing a quadrant that just gives it to you but we have to know that for the signs of the rest of it so let's see if we know that sine and cosecant have this relationship of being reciprocals then sine of theta is four-fifths means that cosecant theta is 5 4. and that's what i want you to remember is that sine and cosecant are reciprocals of one another we shouldn't have to go back to like a formula sheet every time for reciprocal identities how about cosine theta if cosine theta is negative three-fifths then secant theta is the reciprocal reciprocal functions do not change signs so this is negative five-thirds now tangent this in this particular example is why we needed to understand that that was negative you see if we went back here and said oh hey yeah let's imagine that our four fifths sine of theta equals four fifths or point eight or somewhere in the unit circle is right there we imagine that well then tangent would be positive if we imagine this one then tangent would be negative how do we know which one this was the whole problem this is why for sine of four-fifths and you've got hey your y-value here is four-fifths or 0.8 either somewhere over here remember 0.8 is about here somewhere over here or somewhere over here somewhere in there well it matters for tangent so we had to know the cosine was negative to say it's not this y value of 0.8 it's this y value of 0.8 so go up the y until 0.8 you're going to hit 2 you're going to have two outputs there it's this one that we want because it said cosine's negative therefore quadrant two what that means is that tangent has to be negative well we're going to see that bear out because when we take a comparison of positive divided by negative you're going to get a negative so it does work for you but without this one you'd have no way to tell you could not do this if you did not understand that that cosine was also negative somehow i hope that makes sense to you so tangent theta says all right let's go ahead and take sine over cosine we know that's y over x sine of theta is y that is your y value 0.8 this is your x negative 0.6 we're just comparing them or just dividing them so sine divided by cosine if we multiply by the reciprocal there so four-fifths times five-thirds we get negative four-thirds if we maintain that sign the way that i always do this is i always figure out if i have to find all the trig functions i find tangent first and i don't redo cotangent i understand that cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent i don't need to go back to my formulas if i understand the relationship amongst my trig functions so with reciprocal identities i think that hey tangent theta is negative four-thirds cotangent theta has to be negative three-fourths that's how we can find all of these trig functions given just a couple of them or given one of them and then a quadrant to determine the size of the rest now i'm going to lead you i'm going to preface what we're going to do after this next example which you should do on your own what i'm going to do is i'm going to tell you well what if we only know one trig function and a quadrant could you find out some of some more of this stuff yes but requires knowledge of what the formula of a circle is and using it's a it's really a pythagorean identity using that to find a missing side really of this triangle on this on a unit circle so we'll do that in just a bit at this point i would hope that you could figure out what these trig functions are um the first thing i want us to do is really look at this and think sine theta is positive cosine theta is positive think about the quadrant there what quadrant do you have to be in if both sine and cosine are positive not that one sine's negative not that one they're both negative not that one cosine is negative this one both of them are positive and so we understand that if sine is positive cosine's positive that angle that we don't even know lies somewhere in this quadrant we're in quadrant one what's that tell us well that tells us that tangent is also going to be positive all of our trig functions should therefore be positive remember that cosecant has the same sign as sine secant same sine as cosine tangent and cotangent also have to have the same sign because reciprocals do not change signs i hope you're sticking with me so let's think about cosecant theta because these are reciprocals i know that cosecant theta for whatever angle we have here is going to be the reciprocal 2 over square root of 3. which when you rationalize the denominator multiplied by square root of 3 over square root of 3 that's 2 square root of 3 over 3. now secant theta secant theta is the reciprocal of cosine so for whatever angle that is we're going to have two over one tangent tangent takes sine or y and divides by cosine or x for whatever angle you have so that's square root of three over two over one half if we understand that we're going to multiply by the reciprocal we're going to get the square root of 3. now because we figured that out for tangent it's just a matter of reciprocating for cotangent so that's one over the square root of three or again if you do rationalize that that's square root of three over square root of three so one times square root of three is square root of three square root of three times square root of three is one so it's just a sorry out of three so square root of three over three and we have all of our trig functions so the last thing that i wanted to talk about here is kind of prefacing where we're going to go next when we talk about inverse functions so this one you couldn't really do it very easily but i want you to check it check this one out could you find the angle if sine of square root of three over two sorry sine of theta is square root of three over two and cosine theta is one half could you find the angle that gives you that point you go would it be what do you mean the point well the point is cosine theta gives you an x coordinate that is an x coordinate sine of theta gives you a y coordinate that is a y coordinate and now maybe you'll see that you need both of them to determine a unique point on this unit circle that's how inverses work is a unique point here so let's let's see about that if our x is one half let's look at this unit circle if our x is one half that puts us here or it puts us here notice something i could not figure out what quadrant this is in unless i had another trig function or knew it already or we defined it specifically so that we're bound between a couple quadrants that's what we're going to do with inverses just a bit but for right now you can't do the rest of this because you'd have two points that you could pull from you could pull from an x of one half here or an x of one half here and your signs these signs positive negative signs that i'm talking about would change for sine cosine tangent and cotangent and all these other things so the issue is i need another trig function to determine that so let's see if cosine theta is one half that puts us here or here there's not another positive one half obviously that's the case because one half is right here on the x axis so we're either an x of one half or one half sine being positive square root of three over two says oh yes this is the one point you're talking about that's a unique point that says that the angle that would give you that is 60 degrees or pi over three so we're going to start doing that when we get to a lot more videos honestly we're going to start thinking about that like thinking what would this have to be what angle would cause this to happen on a unit circle so let me do a little recap before we go on can you consider these to be on a unit circle yes if this is less than 1 which it has to be that's the range of sine and cosine so you can think of this as some sort of a decimal or fraction on the unit circle that doesn't really match up very well with an angle does it because 0.8 is not on here as like 60 degrees or something so we can think of this as a unit circle do you have to no you don't you can think of this as a similar triangle that you've made bigger and by doing so you still have the same ratio four-fifths over one is the same as four over 5. what's that mean the y of 0.8 compared to a radius of 1 is the same exact triangle just made bigger if you have a y of 4 and a radius of 5. that's why this stuff is so nice and we can change between a unit circle and a right triangle later on i hope that you remember that when we get there the other thing is you need to know two trig functions or at least know one trig function in a quadrant to figure out the signs positive or negative for the rest of your trig functions let's move on i'm going to show you the case where we can think about this as not being on the unit circle so that we can find more information hang on all right let's keep on rolling so i have another example on the board but before we before we talk about it and as we talk about it i really really really want to make sure that i'm clear about what is going on and why we consider this to be either on a unit circle or not and get the same exact result we're talking about similar triangles the way that angles are congruent as we make them larger or smaller in similar proportion which means equal proportion so let's take a look at it now if you remember we talked about this one time and i made the reference to a right triangle and i said hey we can think of sine of theta as just y what on a unit circle why because the radius would be one and if the radius is one we get y over one and cosine of one and y over x that's not different for tangent but what if we enlarged that triangle and said okay let's make this a little bit bigger well can we consider sine cosine different a little bit yeah we can consider that to be the relationship between the opposite side the y side and the hypotenuse whatever r is and that's something that we can we can deal with so here's what that means if you have sine theta equals some sort of a fraction some some ratio you can consider this to be one of two things either you can consider that to be a complete y value somewhere on the unit circle if it's between negative one and one which it has to be or you can consider this to be two sides of a right triangle that can be inscribed on some sort of a circle what do i mean by that well this is the equation of the circle now it should look a lot like the pythagorean theorem for you and it is it's the same thing because you can inscribe a right triangle onto that unit circle or any circle with the radius of whatever the r is and so we're going to talk about that we're going to say that hey if you can identify your r so let's say for sine your y and your r if you had a y value and you had an r value right there could you find an x value yes would you have to find an x value to complete all the trig functions yeah you would because notice cosine of tangent it's therefore secant of cotangent they need an x value and so if you have sine there's no way to figure out cosine and tangent without doing a little bit of extra work i'm going to show you exactly how that works and why we're able to do it so let's take a moment for a second so we understand that sine of theta is this relationship of y y over 1 for a radius of 1 or y over r for radius is not r does it even matter it doesn't matter i'll show you that so let's say that y is 12 why am i getting that well i know that sine theta is y over r okay r would be 13 here now what if you don't like that what if you think well wait a minute i know that sine of theta is a y value right so these are all y values so can i make this 12 over 13 with a radius of 1 yes you can 12 13 is somewhere between negative 1 and 1. 12 13 will be some y value really close to here that is known as positive right positive y is going to hit your unit circle in two places here with a radius of one yes you can consider sine of theta to be a y value with a radius here with a radius of one now let's look at the triangle and see why it doesn't really matter how we consider it so if our y value is 12 thirds sorry 12 13 and our r is one this is not drawn to scale but i want you to notice something let's say that i multiply both of all the sides of my right triangle by here's 12 13 here's one so this is one from here to here and that vertical is 12 13 on a right triangle first question could you use pythagorean theorem to figure out this missing side here's x squared plus y squared would equal r squared or x squared plus 12 13 squared equals 1 squared now you might be thinking using that fraction is not going to be very nice in a pythagorean theorem and you're right that's why i'm giving you a different weight here so check it out now let's say for a second that if this y value this y is 12 13 and this this radius or this hypotenuse is one well we know about similar triangles or we should that i can take all of my sides and multiply them by some some number it's called scalar multiple but some number and grow all those sides in the same proportion and in doing so i'll get a similar shape now what's that mean well similar shapes maintain their angles so the angles on similar shapes corresponding angles are congruent that means equal so let's see about this if i multiply all of these sides by 13. why 13 because it gets rid of my fraction let's multiply it then 12 13 times 13 would just be 12 and that side would grow to 12 if i multiplied everything by 13. 1 times 13 would be 13. obviously not to scale and whatever this x is i'd multiply it and get x times 13 whatever that would be now take a look at it did the angle change when i went from the small triangle to the big triangle no it didn't so if the angle didn't change sine of that angle can't change which means that we can put this in a different relationship or at least consider it differently something on the unit circle remember you could draw a circle here and that would have a radius of one great sine would be considered as twelve thirteenths over one or not on a unit circle radius of 13. sine of that of that angle would be 12 divided by 13. y over r uh this height over the radius either way do you see it you see the same thing 12 over 13 is the same thing as 12 13 over 1. you could see it either way so could i consider this way yeah i sure could but if i do that remember we're about to do pythagorean theorem to find x if i do that then i'm going to deal with a fraction for my y and that's not very nice okay well what if i consider this to be not 12 13 on a unit circle but a height of 12 and a radius of 13 because again because similar shapes maintain angles sine of that angle does not change whether i consider this twelve thirteenths over one or just twelve over thirteen you get twelve thirteenths for sine of whatever the angle is and due to the similar shape that's never going to change for that same ratio amongst your sides now is it nicer yeah it is because finding this is a little bit easier than finding this because you're dealing with whole numbers and not fractions it's honestly not a huge deal but this would be nice to find well could you find x sure if we understand that because you can inscribe this this right triangle on a circle with this particular radius we can always use the pythagorean theorem you can even think of just like a right triangle use it by failure and theorem or the equation of a circle and find out what your missing variable is if you have two of them you should be able to find the third one so let's do it why we're doing this again is because if i'm required to find cosine tangent secant and cotangent this only gives you a y and an r well because we now understand that this can be built on a right triangle either on a unit circle or not doesn't really matter they're similar then we can use that to find the missing variable like x and then find cosine very nicely and so we can do that now this is the part that's very important i really need you to not blow by this slow down the video and really pay attention not to like quarter speed or something but really pay attention do you remember that when you take a square root on your paper it is never okay to just put x equals five here why because when you take a square root well those power twos they they do not maintain sign you plug in a negative you get a positive you plug in a positive you get a positive so due to that fact when we take a square root we have to put a plus and minus in front of it now that appears to give us two different x's why does that happen here's why man i hope you get this if you get this it's going to make sense for a really long time and what we're talking about why does that happen because imagine if i had not had my right triangle oriented this way but had it oriented this way instead of a positive x i'd have a negative x let's draw it this would still be 13 still a positive radius this would still be 12 so a positive y but this would be a negative x so what's the problem the problem is there's some missing information here and i hope that you're seeing it on a circle on a circle you can have a radius and a y value that are the same and have two different x values in fact we talked about that in the last example a little bit about what if your y value is 12 13 like we have here that's right here that is going to have a point here with a y value of 12 15 and a point here with a y value 12 13 but two different x values which one do you use that's why it's necessary to have one of two things you either need two trig functions with any two trig functions uh besides like a reciprocal like a pair like uh sine and cosecant with any two trig functions you can tell what quadrant you're in if you know the signs of those trig functions so we either need two trig functions we don't have that we have just sign we were able to find out x that's fantastic by using some some pythagorean theorem or u uh equation of a circle that's great but without two trig functions or knowing the quadrant in which this angle resides you can't choose the right one you'd have two answers here and that's that's not really okay for us so i hope that you're understanding why we either need two trig functions to determine the quadrant or we need to say something like hey sine of theta is 12 13. okay great but your angle is in quadrant two now what's that do what that does is answers the question on what sign should you pick so one more time all the way through here as far as why we need two trig functions or no quadrant this is fantastic the sine theta says that hey if that's positive you're either in man get this if sine theta is positive you're either in quadrant one or in quadrant two that's great however x is positive for this quadrant and negative for this quadrant which means cosine is positive for this quadrant negative for this quadrant because cosine theta is your x coordinate on you on your circles whatever it is so which one do you pick well if sine is positive and we're in quadrant two that says that i'm going to have to pick the x value that is let's think about it x's are negative here if i'm in quadrant two i'm going to pick my negative x so which one do i pick well cosine's negative x is negative in quadrant two i have to pick the negative i hope i've explained that well enough i hope that you see that by understanding what quadrant you're in you are determining your y value it's well you determine your with the sign of your y and also the sine of your x if we're in quadrant two our y is positive here we already knew that sine theta is y but our x is negative now we understand which one to pick so we've used pythagorean theorem we got down here we go okay if i am in quadrant two my x has to be negative and now we're ready to find the rest of our trig functions so we have a y we have an x we have an r and after this this is pretty easy to do so let's go fairly quickly through it remember that we know that we're going to treat y as 12 and r as 13. why we are doing that is so that we can easily find out what our x is and not have it as a fraction you could have done this with fractions that would have been okay to do but this is a little bit nicer and it doesn't matter because similar triangles maintain angles corresponding angles are congruent for simple shapes and therefore sine cosine tangent they can't change they're just their relationship amongst your sides it's it's one ratio whether the ratio is small well 12 13 over 1 or 12 over 13 it doesn't matter it cannot change and so i have explained it to you very well so now we're going to go through and say let's just let's just assume that our y is actually 12 and a radius is 13. can you find cosecant theta from that well cosecant theta is the reciprocal of sine theta so i can look right back over here and think okay if sine is 12 13 cosecant theta is 13 12. that actually is right here too 13 over 12. cosine theta well this is why we had to have quadrant two so we could pick the correct x but now that we have that we know that cosine theta is x over r adjacent over hypotenuse or the x coordinate over the radius on a certain circle this has a radius of 13. so that would be negative 5 over 13. okay pause right there and let the sink in notice how cosine theta being negative when sine is positive does in fact put us in quadrant two also notice this even though we use this as having a radius of 13 could you think of this as negative 5 13 as an x value negative 5 13 that's less than halfway that's like right here that's like that that point has an x value of somewhere in here has an x value of negative 5 13. if you were to consider it on a unit circle you're just dividing by 13 and shrinking that triangle back down to a unit circle from a radius of 13 to a radius of 1. this is a negative x value this point here would have a negative x value and a positive y value that's what we're saying here whether it's on a really big circle or a unit circle it doesn't matter as far as what the cosine of that angle is that angles don't change how about secant because we have a reciprocal here we can think of this as negative 13 fifths tangent's really nice now you could certainly take sine divided by sorry sine divided by cosine and get negative 12 or 5 or you could think of this as y over x and just think hey here's my y that's 12. here's my x that's negative 5. that's negative 12 fifths that's y over x do you see though that you could do 12 13 over negative 5 13 multiply by the reciprocal there and you get negative 12 fifths also now that we've done that cotangent we can reciprocate tangent and get negative 5 12. here's what i'm really hoping happened in this last example i'm hoping that i'm making connections for you i've seen far too many students treat these like formulas and they never get it it never really clicks that there's interplay here that i don't care whether you're on a unit circle or a really big triangle or a really big circle it doesn't matter because what these trig functions do is take an angle and relate to a pair of sides a pair of sides is a fraction whether that fraction grows or shrinks would like both numerator denominator grow the same proportion or or shrink the same proportion the ratio itself will not change so it doesn't really super matter how you consider it we think of it both ways which is very cool for later on now we are used to a unit circle that's fantastic but i hope that i made that make sense that we're really just growing or shrinking a triangle to fit a radius that we want and we can consider two different ways but it does work on the unit circle and showing you that as well i also hope that you understand the necessity to understand a trig function and another one or a trig function and a quadrant to determine the sign of how you use the pythagorean theorem whether you take a positive or negative after determining what quadrant you are in whether x is positive or negative and therefore cosine and secant are positive negative whether y is positive or negative and therefore sine and cosecant are positive or negative and then tangent and cotangent play along with those two things because we have a positive or positive negative or negative or positive or negative negative or positive four quadrants um two and four respectively so i hope it makes sense it's not all that hard i'm gonna put one more about the board that we're gonna work through and then we're gonna call it good let's go through one more example let's say that you know that secant theta is 2 and you're trying to find out the rest of our trig functions can you do it without this no you really can't but not because you can't find out x and r with this we're going to see that just a second but because you wouldn't be able to figure out the sign of y positive or negative and and not being able to do that you wouldn't be able to figure out sine or or or cosecant tangent or cotangent and so we really need to know on what quadrant this angle is that's that's the reason why they're giving you this so let's let's go ahead and figure that out let's think about where secant is positive secant matches up with cosine and so we're going to look at the quadrants in which cosine is positive because that creates secant positive 4s so cosine is positive here not here not here because why why why is cosine and therefore secant negative here because cosine is the x coordinate on the unit circle or the adjacent side of the triangle here and that would be negative for both of these quadrants that's why cosine is negative here is because the x is negative look here's our x-axis it's all negative for every point on this unit circle all the x's here would be negative therefore all the secant thetas on these two quadrants are also negative well secant is positive where cosine is positive or x is positive that's in quadrants one and four so it matches up with cosine so i know that if i'm not given this information that i am in quadrant one or four i need you thinking of that like every time think what quadrant am i in for my angle so quadrant one or four here i need more information i need what the y is doing so i'm going to have to get like tangent or cotangent or cosecant or sine i'm going to have to have one of those things something with a y in it to determine whether my y is positive that's a pure or negative that's down here and that would determine my quadrant either one or four and so we're going to look at this and say hey sine is negative so where is cosine positive and sine negative cosine is positive where x is positive sine is negative that that's what this means sine theta is less than i've got too excited about thetas sine theta is less than zero or negative where y is negative so if secant is positive therefore cosine's positive you're in these quadrants your x is positive and if sine theta is negative that means your y is negative sine theta is y that means your y that's this quadrant x is positive y is negative that's how you figure it out we can we can go and just look at our signs but i'd rather you understand what's going on i mean that's how i always teach you right is to make sure that you really get what is going on here don't just use the formulas really walk your brain through that it'll help you out so much when we get to graphing uh when we get to calculus as well so i know that what this means is cosine positive sine negative quadrant four now that determines something for us that says that sine and cosecant should be negative secant and cosine should be positive tangent and cotangent should be negative so let's figure it out if we know that secant theta is 2 let's treat this like a fraction let's i know that this could be something on a unit circle it would be one half for for x value because this is well this is 1 over x so let's think about that way if secant theta is 1 over x or r over x r being the radius if i extend this on a similar shape so this would be r over x which means that our x would be one so secant theta is r over x secant theta would have an x of one in r of two now we can easily figure out cosine theta from this naturally because this is just a reciprocal so i could get one half no problem you do not need to do any of this if you were just looking for cosine theta you'd be done but if we are looking for the rest of the four trig functions here sine theta and the rest of them well then we need to know the y value i have an x right there i have an r right there could we use pythagorean theorem to find the y of course so the pythagorean theorem or the equation of a circle same in this case we can write that out and then solve for whatever variable we're missing a trig function should give you two of them if you have this this fraction for whatever angle you're given so let's go ahead and subtract we're going to get ultimately here's four and one y squared equals three let's take the square root of that if we take the square root you have to show the plus and minus that tells you you have two possible outputs and then this is going to tell you which one to pick so y equals positive or negative square root of three because we said that sine is less than zero sine is negative sine is the y here so we have to pick the negative and this lets us find everything else so we can go through and figure out sine theta and then cosecant theta tangent and cotangent theta so sine theta sine theta is going to take your y divided by your r that's how it always works since that's opposite over hypotenuse or the y-coordinate over your radius on some sort of a circle not this is not necessarily thought of as a unit circle you can negative square root three over two quadrant four sine with an x of one half negative square root of three over two cosecant reciprocates that and after rationalizing we get negative 2 root 3 over 3. tangent compares your y and your x if you have an x and a y don't be going and taking sine divided by cosine it's you'd have to simplify that that complex fraction let's just think about it as hey tangents y over x here's your y you know that's negative and not positive because of the quadrant that determines that tangent is also negative because of that quadrant quadrant four tangent's negative if you see that sine is positive cosine's negative sorry sine is negative cosine is positive negative over positive is negative that'd be negative square root of 3 over an x sub 1. y over x cotangent reciprocates and after rationalizing we get negative square root of 3 over 3. i hope i made it make sense man i really hope that i'm making some connections for you then if you've done trigonometry before that maybe you haven't never seen if you have seen them maybe you haven't never understood i hope that you understand them now if this is your first time through i promise you that understanding what i've talked about in this video will help you extremely when we get to right triangle trigonometry pass that then we need to calculus because sometimes we miss the connection between a unit circle and the sine and cosine and right triangle trigonometry sine cosine all the trig functions they're the same we're just making the triangle bigger and we can do that because angles do not change on similar shapes that's why it works so i hope it's making sense i hope in building connections i really need at a minimum for you to understand that cosecant and sine match up a little bit the reciprocals secant and cosine match up if you get that and cotangent tangent match up that that you will have these reciprocal identities down we won't have to always go back to formulas so we're going to come back we're going to talk about whether sine and cosine are even or odd and the pythagorean identities so we're going to take this and we're going to run with it a little bit so i'll see you for that video 

Transcript for: Pythagorean Identities for Trigonometric Functions (Precalculus - Trigonometry 10)
welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the even and odd identities of trigonometric functions and we're going to talk about the pythagorean identities stemming from the pythagorean theorem of a right triangle as it as it is on a unit circle inscribed in a unit circle so let's let's get right into it now if you never thought about even and odd functions before this might be kind of new for you you should have seen them somewhere but you might have never thought about trig functions as even or odd and they are so let's think about what even odd actually mean what even means is if you think graphically even means symmetric about the y-axis that means function wise that opposite inputs should give you equal outputs that would create symmetry about the y-axis and that's exactly what even means opposite inputs give you equal outputs what odd means graphically is that you have this symmetry but it's not about the y it's not about the x it's about the origin which means you can take and rotate your graph 180 degrees if you will or pi and you'd get exactly the same graph out here's what that means function wise opposite inputs give you opposite outputs well we're going to consider that and hopefully you can see that that would create for you this symmetry about the origin we're going to see whether sine and cosine do that we're going to consider several different angles remember how sine and cosine all these tree function works your inputs are angles your outputs are x or y coordinates so it's a slight shift and that's why i've shown you this here even means opposite inputs equal outputs your your inputs though are angles so your inputs here are opposite thetas equal outputs f of theta f of negative theta those are outputs here well the same thing happens with odd but opposite let's give you opposite outputs here's opposite inputs negative theta and positive theta those opposite inputs are giving you opposite outputs that is what odd does this is what even does now let's consider these inputs on a unit circle if i start taking a look at what's going on when my angles are opposite remember that our inputs are angles so let's take a look at what happens with my x coordinates and my y coordinates when my angles are opposite all the way around the unit circle one thing i want your head right now is that x is cosine theta remember that this is well x is mapped to cosine theta sine is y and so when we take a look at this let's look first at our x coordinates our cosine thetas let's look at positive 30 degrees negative 30 degrees or positive pi over 6 negative pi over 6. look at your x coordinates they're in red so that's square root of three over two and square root of three or two wait a minute we have opposite angles one's positive one's negative counter-clockwise and clockwise respectively we have opposite angles opposite inputs and equal outputs does that continue here's pi over four negative pi over four opposite inputs opposite angles are giving us equal outputs let's let's go to pi over 2 and negative pi over 2. here's pi over 2 negative pi over 2. opposite inputs opposite angles are giving us equal outputs that continues we can go all the way to 5 pi over 6 and negative 5 pi over 6. that's opposite inputs opposite angles giving us equal outputs for x for cosine so if we look at our x's these opposite angles are always producing equal outputs opposite inputs are giving us equal outputs for x so therefore for cosine cosine then by definition what even means is an even function and so if we take cosine theta and cosine negative theta opposites they're going to be identical that's exactly what it says cosine pi over six cosine negative pi over six you have identical outputs that's great cosine is an even function and that's what this says opposite inputs are giving you equal outputs that's what that is here's what it means practically if you see cosine of negative 30 degrees it is equal to cosine of positive 30 degrees you can just change the sign why magic no because they're they're even and we just saw that on a unit circle it makes some of our math really convenient to know that cosine is even graphically it's important too we're going to see that cosine does this about the y-axis now what about secant because secant is the reciprocal of cosine it's also an even function so whether you plug in negative theta or positive theta to secant you are going to get the same exact output opposite inputs equal outputs for even functions cosine and secant are your only two even functions that means you basically just change the sign of your angle and be right um this is also only true for of course where secant is defined we have a couple places where it's not uh one over x where x is zero that would be pi over two and three pi over two so those two places are are not defined anyway and so of course this would not hold now what about odd let's look at our y coordinates if i start taking a little quicker here if i start taking opposite inputs opposite angles our outputs for y are also opposite so pi over 6 negative pi over 6 one half negative one half and that follows all the way around the unit circle for opposite inputs i'm getting opposite outputs for y therefore for sine beside is y what that means is that sine is an odd function opposite inputs are going to give me opposite outputs that's going to create on our graph this function that's symmetric about the origin it's going to look like this as we go through no it's not a cool dance move it's exactly what sine does so when we take a look at the definition of what an odd function is by definition sine is odd opposite inputs give us opposite outputs well therefore if opposite inputs give us opposite outputs then we can change the sign of our angle and it changes the sign of our function that's what odd means because of that cosecant is also odd and when we compare them um when we have an odd function and even function in ratio when you have uh sine over cosine of theta in both cases it's it's the oddness that prevails um so an odd function divided by an even function every case i can think of is going to give you an odd function out and that's what happens with tangent as well you can see it if you wanted to here is tangent of pi over four would be one tangent of negative power four is negative one those are opposite inputs giving you an opposite output so tangent's odd same thing for cotangent so it organizes for you the only given functions you have are cosine and secant for odd you have sine cosecant and then tangent cotangent those are odd here's what it means very quickly it means that you can change the sign of your the sine positive or negative of your angles but you have to do it in relation to whether they're even or odd remember cosine and secant are the only even ones the rest of them are odd and you change the sign of your function cosine and secant you don't so if i want to go down here to cosine of negative 30 degrees cosine is even opposite inputs equal outputs that means i could just write this as cosine of positive 30 degrees and that's absolutely true now is it any easier to find on a unit circle sometimes yes sometimes no but when we're dealing with identities and a lot of times in calculus and if we're dealing with inverses you have to have a divide defined specifically where your inputs can only be in a certain interval and so this is very very helpful for us so if i have cosine of negative 30 degrees i say hey opposite inputs didn't have equal outputs i can just change the sign and get the same output opposite it's same output then i know cosine 30 degrees is going to be the x that's square root of 3 over 2. now i could have done cosine of negative 30 degrees still square root of 3 over 2 but i'm showing this for you to practice so that when we get there it's going to make sense so this would be square root 3 over 2. now how about sine well sine is not even sine is odd and so we can change the negative 60 degrees into a positive but to do so we've got to realize that opposite inputs are giving you opposite outputs for sine so change the angle change the sign of your function that's what odds do even say change your angle that's an input don't change the sign of your function so sine of negative 60 we certainly could have done sine of negative 60 degrees and got negative square root of three over two but now maybe it's a little bit nicer to do quadrant one so a negative sign of 60 degrees and here's how this works you go to sine of 60 degrees you say okay sine of 60 degrees is square root of three over two and it says make it negative yes we get the same thing either way but often times it's nice to be able to manipulate that angle to use in other identities we'll see that after we talk about pythagorean identities in just a little bit how about cosecant of how let's see let's get secant secant of negative 30 degrees if we did secant of negative 30 i need you to remember that cosine and secant are even so secant of negative 30 degrees is the same thing as secant of positive 30 degrees so what's that mean let's go to 30 degrees here's positive 30 or pi over 6. secant says i'm going to take 1 over cosine that is cosine so i'm going to take 1 over cosine or reciprocate cosine so cosine of 30 degrees is square root of three over two secant therefore is two over square root of three if we if we rationalize the denominator that's two square root three over three i hope it's making sense to you i know i've thrown some degrees up there just so we can kind of refresh that those actually do happen as well most of the time we're going to use radians in this course but we need to be used to both how about cosecant of negative pi over 6 so we're thinking cosecant the only two even ones that you don't change the function for when you change the sign of your angle are secant and cosine everything else you do so cosecant is odd we're going to change the sign of our angle we're going to change the sign of our function for those of you who have seen this before i hope i hope i make it easier i hope that you're seeing oh that's that's actually not that hard if i just remember the evens everything else is odd i can just change the sign it's fantastic okay so cosecant of pi over 6 let's think about this in terms of its reciprocal function cosecant in your head must be paired with sine so i'm going to go to sine of pi over 6. here's pi over 6. here's sine now i'm thinking cosecant is the reciprocal of that so again i've said my angle i'm going to think of positive pi over 6. i'm going to go to sine because that pairs up with cosecant sine is one-half cosecant is 2 over 1 therefore and then i'm going to say oh i want negative two over one i don't show a lot of work on these um because because i i have in my head this this process of how these things work together and i've built that for you over the last several videos so you can use it that's okay if you need to show more work absolutely do it but in most cases when you get to it it's not going to be that necessary for you how about tangent of negative pi over 4 because tangent is an odd function i could certainly go down to tangent of negative pi over 4 and get negative 1. that's what we're going to get out of this but to practice these odd identities and even identities we're going to say tangent's odd why because it's not cosine secant therefore if i change the sine of my angle i change the sine of my function that's what odds do so tangent of pi over 4 says all right uh here's pi over 4 tangent would be y over x that's 1. but this says okay this part would be 1 now make it negative that's just negative 1. i hope that makes sense that's where i'm going to leave you uh with even and odd as far as sine and cosine is concerned so we understand hopefully that even that's only cosine and secant odd is the rest of them sine and cosecant tangent and cotangent so what we're going to do is come back with what the pythagorean identities are we'll practice in conjunction with even and odd we'll put the two together and see what we can do so let's take a look at the equation of a circle now the equation of circle lines missing something up there is x squared plus y squared equals r squared in general but on a unit circle it's x squared plus y squared equals 1 squared because the radius would be 1 or 1 squared is just 1. now this is quite interesting because we also know on a unit circle that cosine of theta is x and sine of theta is y so here's what we're about to do we're going to say because cosine theta is x and because sine theta is y we can substitute those into that equation of a circle why because we're talking about a unit circle here and we're going to get what is called a pythagorean identity why that is is because it's based on the pythagorean theorem which is the equation of a circle or the equation of how a right triangle described on a circle works or any right triangle really so what we're going to say is if that's the equation of a circle specifically the unit circle because it has a radius of one then we know that on a unit circle that's why we had to have that one on a unit circle sine of theta is y and cosine theta is x we understand that what that means is we can make that substitution so if x is cosine theta and y sine theta x squared plus y squared equals 1 can change into x squared plus y squared equals 1 squared but 1 squared is 1. now we write powers of trig functions a little funny um we don't we can write them in parentheses for sure but we can also write it a different way to get very used to it where we can write that power is well we don't really want to just erase parentheses and do like cosine theta squared because that looks like the angles being squared remember all these trig functions have angles with them that's very important to understand we don't want to write that because we can square angles sometimes but it doesn't this is not what we are intending to do we're trying to say the function itself cosine theta with the angle in the function that value is being squared the x value is being squared how we write that is instead of having the power 2 here we actually put it here that means cosine squared theta or cosine theta squared these two things must become interchangeable in your head sine theta quantity squared is also written as sine squared theta also keep in mind because of the commutativity of addition you can write this differently you can write this as sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta equals one that right there is called the pythagorean identity for trigonometric functions or at least one third of them now there's some corollaries to it correlation means follows directly from this um things like this could you start like hey subtract cosine squared theta from both sides yeah you really could and this would be just like a corollary the pythagorean identities here now what's that mean to us well later on we're going to start using that so if you ever needed to change sine squared into a cosine you can do it or cosine squared into sine you can do it or if you ever have sine squared plus cosine squared of the same angle you can change that to 1. that's fantastic that's what man that's what makes identity so valuable um a lot of students are like i hate identities you really shouldn't i know they're difficult sometimes but with those identities they actually make your math way easier and sometimes even possible especially when we get to calculus we deal with this system all the time so what we're going to do now is i'm going to talk about two other pythagorean identities that we can get i'll show you the the derivation of them and then we're going to go through and practice them a little while all right let's take a look at the other pythagorean identities you can get along with their corollaries which may or may not show up in your textbook i don't know if you even are following one but i want to show them to you here to make sure at least two of them will to make sure that you understand that there's lots of things we can do without actually having to look up angles and simplify some expressions so i know i've written the same thing here no i'm not going crazy i'm going to show you some other trigonometric identities that you can get with the pythagorean identity that we started with so what we should understand from what i showed you just a minute ago is that sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta if your angle is the same is going to equal one and we have some corollaries just by subtracting respectively cosine squared theta or sine squared theta and we get okay a way to convert now let's say that we did something else let's say that we took our original pythagorean identity and divided all three of these terms by sine squared theta first and then cosine squared theta for this one and see what we get out of it so if we divide both sides by sine squared theta we're going to get not zero we're going to get one we're going to get cosine theta over sine theta squared remember we can this really is cosine theta squared and this is sine theta squared so we can we can kind of factor out that that factor out over division here that exponent we would get cosine theta over sine theta squared but cosine theta over sine theta is cotangent theta so this will become cotangent theta squared we'd write that cotangent squared theta now what about one over sine squared theta well one is the same as one squared sine squared theta is sine theta squared so this we can think of it as one over sine theta quantity squared but one over sine theta is cosecant theta this therefore is cosecant theta squared and we write that as cosecant squared theta so by dividing all of our terms or both sides by sine squared theta we get 1 cotangent squared and cosecant squared that gives us another pythagorean identity 1 plus cotangent squared theta equals cosecant squared theta and by doing the same exact thing we did here by adding or sub well by subtracting some some of these terms we can also get let's subtract one cotangent squared theta equals cosecant squared theta minus one that's just subtracting one or if we subtract cotangent squared from both sides we'd get cosecant squared theta minus cotangent squared theta equals 1. so we can see those come up these are mostly what you find but the correlations are very valuable especially later on let's do one more let's divide everything by cosine squared theta well if we do that and for the same reasons here we have sine squared theta over cosine squared theta that's tangent squared theta sine of cosine is tangent and so squaring that says yes you factor out the power 2 by over division and then sine theta over cosine theta is tangent and we have tangent squared here we get 1 and here we get secant hopefully you see the secant 1 over cosine secant and so we'd write that as tangent squared theta one and then one over secant that's one over cosine squared theta is secant squared theta that's our third and final pythagorean identity now let's write out a couple of these corollaries we can get we could subtract 1 from both sides we could subtract tangent squared from both sides and get a couple more namely by subtracting 1 we can get tan squared theta equals secant squared theta minus 1 and by subtracting tangent squared theta we can get secant squared theta minus tangent squared theta equals one and those come up quite often um sometimes if you're not shown these you have to manipulate your original pythagorean identity it's not that hard but the reason why i'm giving these to you is not to memorize them but to understand that you can use them different ways and that's very valuable so let's start taking a look at some of these these examples on simplifying i know i've covered up some of them because i want to use the unit circle for this one but i want to show you that we don't really need to for the rest of them we're going to use our identity to simplify but also i want to mention that i gave you a very basic way to start simplifying some of your your angles that go more than one rotation around your unit circle i'm going to start showing you a more advanced technique using the period of your trig function in which you're dealing and the remainder upon division of your denominator times that period i'm explain that as we go on it's a little more advanced it deals with kind of a mod of numbers a little bit of number theory in there on very much like how i if you're familiar with measuring numbers repeats every so often well the same thing happens here because we have that repetition running in a circle let me show you what i mean by that as we get into it so let's take a look at tangent tangent of negative 37 pi over 4 i don't like negative i don't like dealing with negative angles let's change it because tangent is an odd function we can write this as negative tangent 37 pi over four that's obviously a lot of times around the unit circle how many how many times and then where would you end after you made those revolutions well that almost is a division concept isn't it so i'm going to show you kind of something kind of special um this is the way it's a little bit more advanced of a way but i want to start showing it to you i've given you a basic way i've given you the way if you understand the period of tangent that you can just subtract pi over and over and over and over again until you end up needing a circle you can totally do that so if you subtracted pi you'd say okay that's 4 pi over 4 that's pi the period of tangent is pi remember the period is sine and cosine or 2 pi so if you take this and just start subtracting pi eventually you're going to get something on a unit circle you do it several times by understanding that process here's what i like to do i understand for tangent that the period is pi i'm going to put one pi specifically this is how i determine where this is going to lie i take the period that's 1 pi multiply your denominator by that well it's going to be 4. remember that that's kind of like saying 4 pi over 4. and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to divide this number by that period times that number ultimately you're taking 37 pi divided by four high your pi is going to cancel you're gonna get 37 over four that's how that works 37 divided by 4. now i don't care how many times the 4 goes into that because that's just going to be repetitions of pi around your circle so i don't care how many times it goes into that what i care about is the remainder so 37 divided by 4 4 goes into 37 9 times that would be 36 it has a remainder of 1. so that would be subtracting 9 pi's and you're going to get a remainder of 1 pi over 4 that works every time again take this number 37 pi divide by denominator times period the pi's are going to cancel you're going to need 37 over 4 and look for the remainder the remainder here is one that would be one pi over four remember what you do with remainders with remainders when you divide you take that remainder you divide by what you divided by that'd be one remainder one divided by four that was your what you're dividing by so can we find tangent pi over four easier than we can find tangent of negative 37 pi over 4 yeah way easier here's pi over 4 tangent is 1 so y divided by x and then make it negative this is negative 1. now what would you do for sine or cosine well the period is not 2 pi oh sorry not pi it's 2 pi so you take your numerator like 37 pi divided by 4 times 2 pi that'd be 8 pi pi's cancel 37 divided by 8. figure out how many times 8 goes into 37 without going over that's four times and then whatever your remainder is you put that over uh your your denominator and then what you'd end up getting is something on the unit circle so that does work i hope that makes sense to you what we're going to do now is we're going to talk about why we don't necessarily need to use an unit circle and deal with some of these identities so let's take a look at them how about sine squared 40 degrees plus cosine squared 40 degrees now that looks oddly familiar because that is the pythagorean identity there for sine and cosine sine squared plus cosine squared of the same angle always equals 1. i don't care what the angle is there's no work to do here there's no i've got to look that up on the unit circle they don't no that's why we have identities to make it easier whenever you have sine squared plus cosine squared of the same angle you are going to equal one what about secant squared 18 degrees minus tangent squared 18 degrees well that doesn't look like that no it doesn't but it's also the reason why i made sure to give you some corollaries here so this this could be manipulated back to tan squared plus tan squared plus one equals secant squared theta you could do that but check it out because i wrote down these corollaries here i know that secant squared theta minus tangent squared theta where your angle is the same will also equal one here's secant squared tangent squared minus and the same angle this equals one does it matter that that's 18 degrees now it could be 18 could be whatever could be 19 degrees could be pi over 4 or whatever this is always going to hold true for that now how about things like this when you have tangent pi over 4 sine pi over 4 cosine pi over 4 it might be very tempting to try to look these up like well that's one that's square root two over two that's square root two over two two square root two over two divided by square root two over two is one so one minus one is zero that's true but sometimes it's easier to use some of our identities to get there for instance do we remember that sine of an angle over cosine of the same angle that is how tangent is defined so this is tangent pi over 4 minus that is tangent pi over 4 sine over cosine make tangent with the same angle this is tan now while you certainly could have used the unit circle here what if that wasn't pi over four but pi over five well then we can't do that and so that that that's why we want to get very good at the identities i hope you caught that this is a very special angle but if it wasn't on the unit circle you would mightily struggle with this unless you had the identities now that we do it says i really don't even care what pi over 4 is tangent minus tangent of the same angle you're subtracting the same thing that's zero let's take a look at a couple more so imagine we have secant of negative pi over 18 cosine 37 pi over 18 you that's another unit circle that's true and that's why these identities are very important so what we're going to do is try to make these as simple as possible some key thoughts i'm trying to train you on how to deal with identities now these are what are called basics there's some basic identities we're going to deal with one ones that are much more hard more difficult but when uh when you go through them there's some key thoughts number one can we simplify the angles at all can we put those angles on a unit circle by using some of our basic identities like even odd or if it's more than one revolution around the unit circle can we translate that into an easier type of an angle then after we do that we try to get everything to sort of match up if we have sines and cosines put everything in sines and cosines if we have tangent try to put everything in tangent or try to make a some one of these identities that we're sort of building work even their corollaries like we've seen before so i'm going to start showing you that firstly secant of negative pi over 18 i don't want to deal with the negative angle so let's use the fact that secant is even and changes to secant of positive pi over 18. now i don't really like cosine 37 pi over 18 either so that goes more than one revolution around that unit circle we understand hopefully that the period of cosine is two pi so here's how i like to do this take your denominator multiply it by your period that's 36 pi take and divide them so 37 pi divided by 36 pi pi's cancel 37 divided by 36 37 divided by 36 36 goes into 37 one time and has a remainder of one i don't care about that one i care about that one that remainder divided by that number will be exactly what this changes to after you subtract those revolutions so this is going to be cosine of 1 pi over 18 not 36 not 36 but 18 because the period is 2 pi not 1 pi now that's true well now take a look at this in a different lens we've already simplified our angles as much as we can they look really good and they're the same that's great because then we can use other identities so i don't want to look up pi over 18 on a unit circle it's not there so instead we think okay we have secant we have cosine if r if we have sines and cosines write everything in terms of sines and cosines if you can so here's cosine here's secant i'm going to write that in terms of sines and cosines we know that secant is one over cosine and because we have one over cosine times cosine of the same angle since we simplified our angles that equals one okay last one so i've got sine negative 20 degrees cosine 380 degrees plus tangent of 20 degrees our first thought is simplifier angles so i know that since sine is an odd function sine of negative 20 degrees can be written as negative sine of positive 20 degrees change your angles sine change your functions sign for odd functions so we'll write this as negative sine 20 degrees now have the cosine that's more than one full revolution 380 degrees so let's subtract 360 degrees so that's going to give us 20 degrees well that's very convenient now we take a look at it there's two options here i know i just mentioned to you that you can write everything in terms of sine and cosine you could write this as sine 20 degrees over cosine 20 degrees and you could see that negative plus positive the same thing is going to give you zero with tangents a lot of times we want to see if we have other tangents somewhere in there so in our case we have sine divided by cosine that is tangent of 20 degrees but negative tangent of 20 degrees and of course negative tangent 20 degrees plus tangent 20 degrees how do you care what tangent 20 degrees is that's going to be zero i hope that you've got a feel uh for how these identities start to work we deal with a lot more of them but this is just our jump off point i hope i've made it very clear on how to a slightly more advanced way to change some of our angles into something simpler something that's on a unit circle i hope that you've understood everything we talked about in terms of pythagorean identities so next time we're going to go on to something a little bit different for now we should really should be practicing changing our angles into something on a unit circle and really getting a feel for how to use our even odd and pythagorean identities have a great day you 

Transcript for: The Graphs of Sine and Cosine (Precalculus - Trigonometry 11)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the graphs of sine and cosine we're going to spend quite a bit of time on it and the reason is because there's a little little bit of a problem that some students have going from hey the argument or the inside of your sine and cosine is theta into the arguments now x and they confuse it with x here so we're going to talk about that we'll talk about where the graphs come from why they look the way they do paying special attention to the period of sine and cosine because we're going to be graphing those in the next video with these things called transformations how we adjust the period the amplitude and things like that we'll also talk about what key points are for sine and cosine if you've watched some of my previous videos on college algebra things like that i'm going to show you exactly the same way on how to use that technique of shifting so up down left right stretch compress both horizontally and vertically so with the period and the amplitude for sine and cosine and that's going to make a lot more sense when we get there so that's what we're going to teach in this video what the graphs look like in the next video how to use them so how to use your key points in relation to amplitude and period to get a very solid graph with minimal work so let's get right to it what we're going to talk about in graphing sine and cosine is how would we put a graph of these functions on an x and y axis now this is what i was prefacing just a minute ago with some students have a real big problem translating what the unit circle is into this because of that right there and here's the idea when we talk about a function of x in terms of sine of x i need you to realize that that x relates to either the angle or the arc length on a unit circle and they're one and the same because we're measuring in radians right now we can see that these are all in terms of radians which is why it was so important for us to be able to deal with that the reason again behind that is because sine and cosine can be defined we talked about this a long time ago in terms of their angular movement so sweeping up that angle or the arc length which means we can plug in any real number talk about domain in a second any real number to both sine and cosine and that's what we're going to do so there's there's a bit of a switch right here where we say yeah you know what we can think of this in terms of an angle that's totally fine we can also think of this in terms of a real number so there's a translation i need you to make from the unit circle to our graphs we're going to be getting some of these outputs and putting them on our graph but please keep in mind this x does not have to do with this x that doesn't have to do with it this x is the output of cosine of some sort of an angle or some sort of an arc length and that's how i need you to think of this i need to think of that this is the angle or the arc length they're one and the same when we're talking about radians remember that that one radian is where the angle equals the arc length which equals sorry the radius is the point where the arc length equals the radius and we consider them to be one and the same in that because of the formulas we developed a long time ago so the long story made short is that relates to the angle that x is not this x that would be cosine so we're going to go right now and we're going to try to see what some of these outputs are so if we take a look at this you're going to see some really common numbers um in terms of our unit circle like pi over 6 pi over 2 5 pi over 6 pi 7 pi over 6 3 pi over 2 11 pi over 6 and 2 pi some different ones down here why because what i'm going to do right now is i'm going to take our angles notice how that relates to the angle this is our x axis x is our angle remember our trig functions have to deal with an angle relating an angle to something on our unit circle an x or y sine happens to rep to relate the angle to the y coordinate of a point here or the opposite over the hypotenuse on triangle which we can get the same thing here so we're going to take a look at our angle and write down the sine of that particular angle so let's start right now i'm going to start with well i'm going to start with zero so i want to take a look at what happens if we have an angle of zero our sine of zero is zero so notice what we're doing that x something on this x-axis is a real number that's true but it also relates to an angle on your unit circle so i'm looking up sine of that particular angle sine of zero is zero so i'm looking at my angle and taking my y-coordinate for the angle again x-axis here represents the angle on the unit circle sine of that angle is what we're getting in blue around that so sine of zero is zero what that means is that this sine function passes through the origin now i'm going to jump a bit i'm going to jump to pi let's talk about pi what would pi be well sine of pi here remember this our x-axis pi would be an angle so or a real number here sine of pi says go over here go to an angle of pi sine of pi is the y coordinate so sine of pi is zero so that means that this function is going to be zero at a degree of a rating of zero also at pi now where's it going to hit 0 again this right here is going to start giving us our our period and the look of our graph so remember this do you remember how sine repeats every 2 pi so 0 0 and then back to 0. so if i went sine of 0 i'm getting 0. sine of pi i'm getting 0. sine of 2 pi i'm also going to get 0. think about that 2 pi's right here my angle would be 2 pi my output of that angle for sine is zero so i'm gonna hit zero again now quick question before we go any further could you keep going could you do sine of zero and sine of pi sine of two pi sine of 3 pi 7 4 pi yes how about negative pi yes this doesn't terminate here this is a curve that goes forever and ever and ever in fact you can plug in any real numbers here there is not going to be an issue with sine we recognize that that you can plug in any angle forever as many times you want to go around this and you'll always get one of these outputs or something between them there's never an issue with sine of not being able to plug in an angle or something on our x-axis which represents a real number or we can think of it as an angle what that means is that for our domain our domain for sine is going to be all real numbers we can plug in anything to sign i'm going to abbreviate all real numbers you can also write it negative infinity to infinity on the x-axis that's totally fine now let's jump and do the pi over two so i did zero sine of zero zero sine of pi is zero sine of two pi is zero how about sine of pi over two well let's go back here so sine of pi over two remember x axis is representing a real number but it also represents an angle for our sign on the unit circle so sine of pi over 2 says i'm going to take the y coordinate remember that our inputs here sine of x our x is our angle or arc length on the unit circle and we would get sine of pi over 2 is 1. let's go another pie past that pie pass that what do you mean half a circle past that so sine of 3 pi over two so here our input would be three pi over two sine of three pi over two is negative one sine of three pi over two so i plugged in three pi over two sine of three pi over two is negative one now i also have some awkward ones like pi over 6 why'd i pick that well because sine of pi over 6 is going to be one half and that's really easy to graph sine of pi over 3 would not be that'd be square root of 3 over 2 and that's a little bit harder to graph and so i'm picking some nice values to give us a good shape here so let's take a look at that now we're going to have at pi over 6 and remember x-axis is our inputs sine of our input represents sine of an arc length or an angle on our unit circle so sine of pi over 6 says i'm going to have one half input is the angle sine of that angle is that blue number so one half the same thing happens with sine of five pi over six we also get one half now how about sine of seven pi over six so i've done zero pi over six pi over two five pi over six and pi i've done them in a special order so you see a couple relationships that would really hammer home in a second now we're going to get to 7 pi over 6. remember that these are in quadrants 3 and 4. sine is negative in those quadrants sine was positive make this connection sine was positive everywhere until we got to here the y values are positive so sine is positive until we got to there sine is positive until we get to pi look at the graph it's all positive now it's going to be all negative and in fact sine of 7 pi over 6. that's our x input that sine of 7 pi over 6 represents sine of some angle here that's going to be negative one half and sine of 11 pi over 6 well let's see sine of 11 pi over 6 would be negative one half as well sine is negative in those two quadrants and therefore is negative in the last half of our period we're going to talk about the period in a second let's recap just a minute here's the things that i need you to notice about sign firstly where it comes from and if you get it you're going to be head and shoulders around above most people who are in calculus actually because a lot of people do not understand where this comes from and how it relates to this so if you get that you're doing awesome here's how it relates again remember our x-axis is a real number line it has real numbers on it forever when we start taking sine of those real numbers because that real number can be represented as an arc length on a unit circle not any circle a unit circle because it can be represented on an arc like the unit circle and also represent the angle that the arc length sweeps out due to the fact that we have a unit circle and that we represent arc length as r times theta where r is one arc length equals angle so x-axis gives you some sort of an arc length that also represents an angle on a unit circle because it's a unit circle and so it says hey that's our input so sine of that can be found by sine of whatever angle you are taking a look at in terms of radians only because that's the only way that formula actually worked that was in some previous videos so we're making this connection going yeah i can plug this into a unit circle because of that fact keeping in mind that this x represents our length therefore angle and not an x coordinate on a unit circle x coordinates here are angles here because of the arc length idea on a unit circle and then we went and found all of our our y outputs sine of our angles gave us our y coordinates we put those on there and we're noticing the quadrants about it man i hope that you see it if sine is positive in the first two quadrants then sine is positive in the first half of the period what's a period a period is where our trig functions repeat themselves so this is going to repeat every 2 pi now that needs to make sense because our sign repeated every time we made a full rotation if i go to one half it's going to repeat on a full rotation all of those y values will do that on a full rotation and so our period is going to be 2 pi we got to look for the same there's a few key features i need to notice that we have a 0 at 0 pi and two pi i'm going to make sure that i represent that here by sine crosses the x-axis at the ends and center of your period where's its peak it peaks at the quarters of your period high and low and so we get this very nice smooth curve out of it and it doesn't end it oscillates back and forth it repeats on every two pi interval and so there's a lot of things we can say number one we said our domains all real numbers you can plug in anything on this x-axis forever ultimately you're just going to repeat yourself on this unit circle over and over again what's this range though well if sine represents the y coordinate the highest y you can get is one and the lowest y you can get is negative one and that's exactly what we see here the highest y value output here remember that the y here doesn't necessarily correlate to the y axis here it represents the output of sine well the output of sine can be a maximum of one and a minimum of negative one so our range is between negative one and one and that's inclusive because we do have points of pi over two comma one and three pi over two comma negative one those are points on the graph so we include that now how about even or odd well even functions mean symmetric about the y axis this is not even odd functions being symmetric about the origin so could you rotate this 180 degrees and get the same picture you could yes exactly so this is an odd function we learned about that as far as sine and cosine we got an identity i think a video or two ago when we talked about that now the period i've been man i've been prefacing this a long time we finally see a picture of it here that every time you make a full rotation you start repeating repeating that full rotation is 2 pi radians so our period for sine and also for cosine is going to be 2 pi it's not for tangent so for tangent and cotangent we're going to get just pi we saw that we're going to see it graphically as well every pi it repeats now the important parts for our graphing i need i really need you to get these following things i needed you to understand the period but we talked about it let's talk about x-intercepts we're going to talk about key points and where sine crosses x-axis and where it peaks so our x-intercepts our x-intercepts happen every get this k times pi now i've seen that a couple times that i want to make sure you understand it k pi means every multiple where k is an integer positive or negative times pi you are going to get an x intercept let's check it out at zero zero times pi is zero you're going to get x intercept 1 times pi is pi you can get x intercept 2 times pi is 2 pi you're going to get x intercept and 3 pi and at 4 pi and at negative pi and at negative 2 pi that is where x intercepts happen why because every half of a circle you are going to get zero for your y coordinate that makes sense the y coordinate here here's your y axis the y coordinate here is zero it's also zero here and here and here and here and it's here every time you go half a circle from your zero you're going to get a zero for y an x intercept a zero for your output that's what that says it looks a little awkward but it should make sense that you're just going half a circle on your unit circle and you're going to be repeating that starting from zero hopefully that makes sense to you so we get x intercepts every k times pi one times by 2 times 0 times pi negative 1 times 5 and so forth so where sine crosses the x axis let's look let's look at this in terms of the period where does it cross if our period is 2 pi our sine function crosses the x x-axis at the ends of the period and the center here's why i want you to remember that you see when we start talking about shifting phase shifting transformations up down left right stretch compress all these things especially with the period we're going to have some very awkward points and so i'm going to give you key points but i'm not going to give them to you in terms of remembering these numbers because your period is going to change due to a horizontal stretch of compression it's going to change what i need you to remember this is key is that sign is always no matter what your period  changes to compresses or or stretches you no matter what that hap what this changes to your sign will always cross not bounce across at the ends and center of whatever period you have so here's what's going to happen when we start altering our period in the next video we're going to take a look at what our period is we're going to say oh this is sine our period is this okay how do i change it divide or multiply i have my new period you know what we're going to do we're going to go to the ends of that period and put x-intercepts and the center and put an x-intercept and that's going to be half the battle on how to graph these trig functions stick with this way it's very similar to the other graphing techniques and transformations i gave you and it's why i gave you that technique so right here i need you to really really remember that sine crosses the x-axis at the ends and center of period where's it peak it peaks at let's see this is one two three four it peaks at the quarters so here's half here's a quarter so how do we write our peaks so in the future when we get to graphing sine and cosine you're going to take a look at your period you're going to for put x-intercepts at the end and the center and you're going to use your quarters as your only two key points that matter because your amplitude this number in front if there was a number right there it would affect your key points it's very similar to the graphing i've taught you already that if you affect your key points well you multiply by whatever that number is it has the ability to stretch it to compress it and to reflect it and it's based on where our peaks occur local max local men those happen at the quarters so pi over two and three pi over two for this period but if i adjust that period i need to remember that our peaks happen at the quarters right now this is a lot of a lot of theory behind it i'm showing you all this and we're not doing any examples to get this built in so the next video we can just run with it so this is a big deal i'm going to go through cosine a lot quicker because if you know the idea now what we're learning is that sine and cosine both are going to repeat themselves every two pi that's going to be the period the domain is all real numbers you plug in anything just depends on how many times you want to go around that unit circle or where you want to stop there's going to be an output for that our range is negative 1 to 1. neither of these things get bigger or smaller than negative 1 and negative 1 respectively we have an odd function we're going to get an even function here but the key ideas are that sine for sine has x-intercepts at the center and the ends and peaks at the quarters what that means is that for the five key points we have we're going to have 0 0 or an n and an x intercept a center of the period and an x intercept notice 0 0 and pi 0 and 2 pi 0 another n x x axis crossings at ends and center peaks at the quarters so with pi over two we get one and at three pi over two we get negative one so which ones really matter for us well when we graph sine again we're going to take the period and stretch or compress it we're going to put our x-intercepts at the ends in the center for sine and then we're going to manipulate these two key points if you remember two key points for sine remember the quarters of your period those two quarters i promise you that will help you man i can't can't tell you how many students have just completely obliterated some second cosine functions because they don't realize that um i i've never taught trigonometry to students who have taken calculus from me and so i always have to go back and teach them trigonometry and then they finally get the why the graphs look the way they do i hope that you understand why these graphs look the way they do well why this graph looks the way that it is right now why we are getting the peaks at pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2 for sine now that we've talked about sine let's go ahead and finish up with cosine we're going to get a number of really cool things that happen with cosine as it relates to sine namely that cosine is a phase shift of sine and there's an identity we could make with that but mostly why it looks the way that it does so let's start the same way that we started with sine let's look at the ends of our period well how does that relate if cosine x is taking a real number on the x-axis and using that x as an input then that x again represents the arc length on a unit circle or the central angle on that particular unit circle remember arc length equals angle for unit circle because as our arc length equals r theta a unit circle has an r of one s equals theta arc length equals central angle on the unit circle only and so this has to do with radians because that's the way that radians allow us to make that jump on that formula so cosine of x says cosine of some angle here so this is in particular why students get so messed up with it this x is not this x this x as i just mentioned is a real number that represents a central angle or arc length on a unit circle so when we talk about cosine of zero it says go to an angle of zero cosine of zero says here's the output for this angle for this input here's the cosine of this is zero here's the this is your output for cosine x so i'm saying here's my zero my cosine of zero is one well i have one code oh yes that's right that's my x coordinate on my unit circle stands for my output here i'm not going to go to zero and put a zero that zero we're plugging in represents this angle cosine of that angle is your output that you're going to put here why this is confusing for students is because students associate cosine with x and they should but this x remember is your output we're going to put that on our f of x the output of our function so cosine of 0 is 1. if you can grasp that you are going to be absolutely fine with the rest of this is that this x is an input on a unit circle so central angle and what we're getting is cosine of that input that is the output we're plotting on our graph now what's going to happen at uh what's going to happen at pi over 2. let's go to pi over 2. at pi over 2 cosine of pi over 2 says go to the angle pi over 2. here's my input cosine of pi over 2 says that is my output well that's a zero how about pi at pi we're going to say our input is pi pi cosine of pi cosine of pi says i would get negative one how about three pi over two cosine of three pi over two says hey that number that you're inputting represents an angle or an arc length by unit circle cosine of that particular angle of three pi over two is zero and for two pi we get the same thing as we would get for zero so two pi cosine of 2 pi says take the output for cosine of 2 pi that's 1 and plot it so what happens this is different from sine so sine hat it's actually literally just pi over 2 off so sine had x-intercepts at the ends and center peaks at the quarters this is opposite this is going to have peaks at the ends and center and x-intercepts at the corners of this and we'll see this if we fill this out a little bit more i'm going to go fairly quickly through it but cosine of pi over 3 why to pick pi over 3 because cosine of pi over 3 is one half that's nice to graph two pi over three cosine of two pi over three is negative one half four pi over three if you want to find that cosine of four pi over three is also negative one-half if i want to mess that up here's our 3 pi over 2 i had that wrong in my head but 3 pi over 2 cosine 3 pi over 2 is 0 this should have been 5 pi over 3 so cosine of 5 pi over 3 is positive one-half and then we get cosine of two pi is one again so let's let's see if this makes sense with our quadrants like we did for sine cosine is positive in quadrants 1 and 4 here and here that's where x is positive not x here but x the output of cosine is positive over here on this on these two quadrants what that means is that's the first quarter and the last quarter of our period and sure enough cosine is positive there cosine is negative in quadrants two and three that's the middle of the period and sure enough between pi over two and three pi over two the middle of our period we are negative so cosine looks very very similar to sine but almost like it's shifted over and that's exactly what a phase shift is we can make an identity that says cosine and sine relate to each other by a phase shift again this doesn't end this goes for ever and ever and ever so our domain for cosine is you can plug in anything just depends on how far you want to go on your unit circle backwards or forwards negative or positive angular measurement we can see a lot of interesting things like this is going to repeat every 2 pi that's our period again our range is still negative one to one why because x outputs for our cosine for input angle is negative one two one that's the farthest of this goes if the input is an angle and arc length it just says where how many times you want to go around that circle you plug in anything our outputs however can only give you from negative one to one because that's what cosine can possibly be in terms of our x coordinate here it only gets negative one to one that's our range odd functions are symmetric about the origin that's sine but cosine is even because this is symmetric about the y axis you can fold this over and get exactly the same graph our periods are the same and for the same reason for sine and cosine if you went one full rotation around all of your x coordinates all of your outputs here are going to repeat and likewise with uh with sine the important concept here isn't just that the period is 2 pi it's that when i adjust that period what's going to happen is my x-intercepts and my my where we cross the x and where my peaks happen my peaks happen are going to be affected by that change so what we need to understand is that our x-intercepts happen well not at 0 and a pi and a 2 pi not every k pi but at every pi over 2 plus k pi so we'd say pi over 2 plus pi well pi is 2 pi over 2 1 pi over 2 plus 2 pi over 2 is 3 pi over 2. it's going to happen every half circle after that the way we write that is your let's call it your first your first x intercept is pi over 2. well now is that true yeah your first x equals zero let's say your output is zero your first zero is at pi over two but then every half circle there's another zero zero backwards or forwards how we say that add a half circle idea is k pi remember pi is a half of rotation so if i say hey start here and add half a circle you're going to be there that's another zero add another half circle that's there you can be another zero subtract a half a circle that's there you're going to be at another output of 0 for cosine of that particular angle what we see that is pi over 2 great that's going to be a 0 for cosine we know that here and then every multiple of pi it starts to look awkward and some students have a real hard time with that but here's what it means means your first zero your first x intercept is pi over two and then just start adding pi and you're going to get an x intercept every time pi over two three over two five pi over two seven pi over two that's two pi over two that's um every pi okay the key features again are hey cosine crosses the x-axis not the ends in center but at at the corners so we have x-intercepts at the quarters of your period here's your period here's half your period here's the quarter of a period here's the other quarter and it peaks at the ends and the center two relative maxima at the ends one relative minimum in the center now if we reflect it that changes but that's where we peak and that leads us to our key points so our key points for our cosine are zero one pi over 2 0 pi negative 1 3 pi over 2 0 and 2 pi positive 1. so here's what's going to happen in the next video we're going to take a look at our function now we're going to identify what our period is first so here's why this is important and here's what i need to remember if we identify our period first i'll show you exactly how to do that then if we have a sine function you're going to immediately put x-intercepts at the ends and center if you have a cosine you're going to immediately put intercepts at the corners of whatever period that is so how do we do it we put the period divided into 2 divide each of those halves into put the x-intercepts on there for sine and cosine respectively and then you'll have either two relevant key points or three relevant key points the relevant key points here are are the peaks you see the peaks are what can stretch and compress the peaks are what can reflect x-intercepts don't care they're static they're just going to stay there the the peaks can change so multiply your outputs times any number for zero you're not going to change that but multiply your peaks by some sort of output some sort of amplitude it's going to start to start manipulating it's going to start stretching it compressing reflecting it so we're going to take our period we're going to do what i said we're going to we're going to find out what it is cut it in half cut it in half again that's halves and quarters for sine x intercepts at the ends and center for cosine x intercepts at the corners then we take our relevant key points which i have starred for you and determine how the amplitude affects it it's just a multiplication the one thing i want to say right now so you don't get confused we get there is that depending on what your period is this and this and this might change so if your period is not two pi then obviously we're not going to have an end of your period at two pi this represents the ends of your period that represents the quarter so we're going to talk through that as we get to graphing sine and cosine the next video hopefully what i've done in this case is just make sure you understand why they look the way they do the most important concept is realize that this x axis is not this x output this x axis represents an arc length unit circle and therefore a central angle on the unit circle sine of that angle is the y output here and cosine of the angle is the x output here that represents the output height of your functions so i hope that makes sense i hope that i've explained it if you get this man you you're just you're you're ahead of a lot of people who are who are in calculus right now so this is a very very good thing i'll see you for the next video when we start talking about how to take this and do transformations with it see you for that 

Transcript for: Graphing Transformations with Sine and Cosine (Precalculus - Trigonometry 12)
hey welcome to another video so in this video man we got an important one we we learned how to graph sine and cosine with some transformations in there so we're going to learn what happens and when we adjust the period of sine and cosine we're going to use that in tangent and cotangent secant and cosecant later on but it all starts right here so here's what we're going to learn in this video we're going to learn that when you start multiplying the inside the argument of your trig functions it's going to start adjusting your period how often this repeats either closer or further that's a horizontal stretch or compression we're going to learn what happens when you start multiplying the function right here in front of that function how that affects the output in terms of its amplitude we're going to learn how to shift this and all these things will be very relevant and very much like if you've learned how i've taught you graphing previously with all of your transformations the only thing we're not getting into right now is called a phase shift so a phase shift is the horizontal transformation the horizontal shift left or right it's always opposite what's ever in that parenthesis and the same thing holds here so what i intend to teach is the four steps on how to graph these tree functions there's gonna be five when we talk about a horizontal shift a phase shift um but honestly it's not that bad if you follow these steps you're going to get it right like every single time and i'm going to walk you through exactly how to do it so here's the first thing whenever we look at how to graph sine and cosine the following steps i need to be in your head number one i need you to find that period so i'm going to show you exactly how to deal with that our period we always write t for period is 2 pi y 2 pi well 2 pi because the original period of every sine and cosine function is 2 pi and still until we start manipulating that stretching that or compressing that 2 pi divided by we call it omega it's this number that's right in front of x when we get to phase shifting i'm going to show you how that works a little bit more clearly if you have something added subtracted but for right now it's just this number in front of x so we take our period 2 pi and divide it by that omega now think about this what would it be for tangent so tangent has a period of not 2 pi has a period of pi and so we'd have for tangent pi over omega so please be clear on that that this period is for sine and cosine which is why i have it right here under that we're going to find our period first after that we're going to identify any sort of vertical shift plus up minus down with with what's added or subtracted at the end of our function and we're going to graph it in this order we're going to first put our period down we're going to put the end of our period half our period and quarters of our period why well that's how i introduced graphene to you in the last video then we're going to show our shifting up or down at that point we'd show our our shifts uh left to right as well and then per period back there but we're not there yet for phase shifting then we're going to mark our x-intercepts remember this for sine our x-intercepts happen at the ends and the center of our period for cosine it's at the corners of our period finally we'll take our key points our peaks at the quarters for sine at the ends and center for cosine and we'll use our a to multiply the the outputs of those key points and that'll give us a very very clear graph one thing is that that a that letter a can do two things for you it will cause you to stretch or compress and it'll also cause you to reflect if it's negative the absolute value of that a is caller amplitude and it will give you how high you go above the x-axis and how low you go in terms of absolute value so we can talk about that as well i the way i'm teaching you generally don't need that exactly um some textbooks do use it though so let's get right to it let's talk about three sine x i want to lead you through this as efficiently as possible i'm going to give you the steps to show you exactly how and why we're doing that whenever you graph any sort of a trig function the first thing you need is whatever the period is so we're going to take the period which is for sine 2 pi and we're going to divide that by whatever number is being multiplied by x that's going to be 1 in this case so 2 pi divided by 1 is 2 pi now i'm not doing that just a borax i'm doing that to show you this is the process you take every time you take the period of your trig function you divide it by omega that's the number in front of x and whatever you get is your period stop right there don't do anything else put that period on your x-axis so what i mean by that is at this point since we know that we have two pi as our period we're going to go from zero we're going to mark two pi and you go how do i know where two pi is who cares it's not the scale anyway just put 2 pi on there somewhere now every important feature of sine and cosine happens at quarters ends and half of your period which is why we're dealing with the period first it will determine your key points for you in just a minute so put the two pi on there whatever the end of your period is put that down cut it in half that's pi cut each portion in half so half of pi is pi over two that makes sense that half of it divided by two if you want to find the other half of it add whatever that is to whatever that is so pi over 2 to now i'm saying whatever that is not specifically pi because it changes on your period but find the end of your period find half of it cut this first half in half again that's pi over 2 and then add this to this so pi over 2 plus 2 pi over 2 is 3 pi over 2 pi over 2 plus 1 pi that's 2 pi over 2 is 3 pi over 2. so number one we find our period great we've determined that it's 2 pi we put that down we cut it in half cut it in half again why because important things happen at the ends the center and the quarters cut in half again and then add these two together it will give you whatever that that middle or sorry the second quarter is i guess it's third quarter but whatever this quarter is it you can always find it by adding the quarter plus the half will give you the three quarters that's exactly how fractions work now identify what trig function you're working with so we we've done the period we don't have a vertical shift we look here there's nothing added or subtracted right now if we would have had that we would have said okay here's my period i'd shift this up or down i'd redraw like an x-axis and then redo my period on top of that so i draw that right there and since we don't have that we're gonna move on a little bit and say okay we've done this we don't have a vertical shift mark your x-intercepts this is what was really important i spent probably 10 minutes talking about last video probably more than that is you need to know what your x-intercepts do for sine and for cosine for sine our x-intercepts are at the ends and center of your period no so i'm not saying i'm not saying 0 pi and 2 pi why not because our period can change our period can phase shift and so i'm saying ends in center in your head i need you to know that sine has x-intercepts it ends and centered of period so i'm going to mark that down so ends and center so done the period wrote the period broke it into quarters got that you can also do that mathematically too just divide by two divide by four uh divide by three quarters and you can figure out what uh what those quarters are as well i've done that i've identified i don't have a vertical shift at all i know that we're with sine i'm dealing with n's and center for x-intercepts and now the quarters that you have for sine or the n's and center for cosine whatever you have not put a point on here and here those become your key points so if we have a visual of how sine looks in our head our x-intercepts are ends in center and our peak is at pi over 2 1 and 3 pi over 2 negative 1. that should have been familiar from the last video we know that pi over 2 1 and 3 pi over 2 negative 1 what if you forget that look at your unit circle and think about the quarter of a circle now i'm not really saying quarter of a period here sorry um pi over two same quarter of the circle and three quarters of the circle that's the first quarter and third quarter this is what it will be is pi over 2 1 and pi over 2 negative 1. those key points allow you to multiply but whatever that number is that's going to to stretch this or compress it and possibly reflect it so again period got it we cut it up got it n's and center for sine for x-intercepts we got it what we don't have points for are your quarters for sine so create some key points key points are things that allow us to manipulate the look that's pi over 2 1 and 3 pi over 2 negative 1 that was on our original graph and those are always going to be the cases for sine you'll have your first quarter comma 1 your third quarter comma negative 1 and then multiply it by whatever your amplitude is but not with the absolute value whatever your a is positive or negative it will allow you to reflect it so in our case times three and times three now this should be really familiar if you've had this we've had me before in these videos you should understand that what that three does that three is a factor for the output so think about that when you plug in a number to here you'd have sine of whatever that is sine of this is going to give you some sort of an output this output gets multiplied by three so use a three to multiply the output not the input there's nothing here that's that's being multiplied right now one is being multiplied right now not three this factor multiplies the output of sine this factor multiplies the output of sine and this is how we affect our key points so pi over two your inputs will never ever change your outputs will change one times three is three negative 1 times 3 is negative 3. uh hopefully you're seeing that this is all we're doing is multiplying our output times our a notice something how if that were negative this would become negative 3 and it would reflect it instead of going up it'd go down it's a great way to graph this and we're just going to plot our two key points so for sine you'll only have two because only the peaks and valleys happen at the quarters so pi over two comma three hey we already have that marked down that's great we did that so that we could even get our key points in the first place so pi over two comma three and three pi over two comma negative three now really you know i've squished my scale so here's how our graph looks so our graph is this sine function it goes forever we've just graphed one period what if you had to graph more than one cycle or more than one period well you would just double you double this so if you had to do two cycles of this take your two pi and double it what would you get 4 pi and then add 2 pi to every one of these and you'll get a new period notice you're not doubling everything because pi over 2 times 2 is well that would just be pi so you're not doubling that you're taking doubling your period that's 4 pi then adding 2 pi pi over 2 plus 2 pi will give you the next quarter of the next cycle do that now i'm going to superimpose something let's superimpose what would be the original sine function you're going to see something here that is exactly what a vertical stretch will do it'll take your original dotted line sine function and grow it so it increases what's called the amplitude so the amplitude is this value of three how high it gets above the x-axis and below the x-axis in terms of its absolute value that is what the amplitude relates to so i hope that made it make sense to you i hope you understand that the way that i'm trying to show you here is a way that i've already given you for transformations we just have something new in terms of this repeatedness of your trig function of this every two pi for the period idea so i hope it makes sense i hope that you're really seeing what's going on the reason why i'm having to do these steps in these orders let's practice a couple more of them all right let's talk about y equals negative 4 cosine x i'm going to start moving a little bit quicker here talking about our period pretty quick talking about where our x-intercepts are and our our key points as relating to the uh the quarters or the n and center for whatever trig function we're trying to find so y equals negative four cosine x the very first thing we do with every trig function is identify what our period is and maybe what it changes to if we're multiplying the input by anything so for cosine our period is originally 2 pi remember sine cosine secant cosecant are going to have periods of 2 pi tangent doesn't has a period of pi so identify whatever your period is originally divided by whatever number is being multiplied by your input i say that specifically because for a phase shift you might have to factor something out first here we just divide by 1 and we get that our period is 2 pi draw that first draw your period cut it in half cut it in half again add these two it'll give you your third quarter so we've identified our period we've shown our period we've shown our quarters of our period so first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter that's going to be our entire period after that what we're going to do is identify what sort of a vertical shift we have if we have any that will always be added or subtracted adding or subtracting think about why that would happen if i plug a number in cosine of that number is going to give me an output this would multiply that output but then something added or subtracted would literally add or subtract to or from the output that's a vertical idea that's a vertical shift whenever we have something added or subtracted now we don't have that here but we would show it we'd show it as an adjustment of our x-axis sort of like a new x-axis moving up or moving down a phase shift would also happen here and we would shift to the right or to the left at this point and show that with a y-axis movement so we've shown our period we've got that we don't have a vertical shift what we're going to do now is identify that for cosine our x-intercepts happen not at the ends and center like sine but at the quarters what that means is that if these are x-intercepts our peaks and valleys our key points are going to be at the ends and center of our period notice i'm not saying one zero and pi and two pi i'm saying whatever your periods change to take the ends and the center you've already marked it down it's why we do it first so that you can identify your key points i hope that makes sense to you that if you don't show your period first you might have a very hard time finding the ends in the center if your period is not just a standard two pi so i'm going to show that my key points are zero pi and 2 pi and it relates to our original cosine we're going to we're gonna take these key points we're gonna adjust them by multiplying by negative four but i wanna write them out first remember our key points from our original cosine function we've got in the last video are you'd have zero one pi negative one or first the the versus zero is one and then negative one and then one if you forget that look at your unit circle the original cosine do the original one then change it so if you look at your unit circle and you say hey cosine of zero is zero i'm sorry one that's not right and cosine of pi is negative one and cosine of two pi is back to one those are your originals now what would happen if you didn't have zero pi and two pi you'd get the same numbers here it's just it's just manipulating your how how um how much you're squishing that that period so you go okay the first point would give me one second point that's half a rotation gives me a negative or half a period and then the third one as a full rotation gives me back to whatever this is so we've completed that period so i'm going to take this and say if these are my key points and what i'm going to do is understand that i can multiply those outputs times negative 4. so cosine of some sort of input's going to give us an output that gets multiplied by negative four what's it going to do well it's going to stretch it and it's going to change the sign it's going to reflect it so take that and multiply your outputs not your inputs but your outputs so zero cool pi awesome two pi got it 1 times negative 4 and negative 1 times negative 4 and 1 times negative 4 give us a stretched and reflected output these are the points that you need to graph on top of that period so we're going to show that right now so let's plot it because we've used our appropriate inputs as related to our period we know that these should really be points on that graph so 0 negative 4 says i'm going to be right down here pi comma 4 i'm going to be right up here 2 pi comma negative 4 i'm going to be right down here if you can picture the original cosine function this is reflected and it's stretch i'm going to draw it for you in just a second it's kind of ugly but that's about how that graph should look now what would the original look like remember this scale is a little off because i'm really squishing this graph but the original cosine function looks about like that so here's the original cosine as it relates to a height of one and negative one look just like this nice smooth curve this is reflected and stretched out that's exactly how i would like you to graph these things are there other ways to do it yes but none that i've seen work as cohesively especially when you get to phase shifting phase shifting can really throw students for a loop and so i want to make sure that we're really good at this before we get there because this technique works really well especially with the key points that we have so what i'm going to do is give you a couple four or five more examples of increasing difficulty to the point where when we see sine and cosine at least we're really good at dealing with it then we'll transition to tangent and cotangent and deal with some of this and then finally secant and cosecant they're very awkward graphs then we will get into our phase shifting all right we're ready for another two so let's take a look at sine of three x and let's go through the process of graphing this thing just like those those steps talk about number one thing whenever you whenever you are doing this we are going to find the period of our trig function first no matter what so we might have to manipulate the argument of the trig function a little bit if we have some sort of a phase shift and i have to factor that but we don't hear we have no sort of a phase shift that would be added or subtracted inside the parentheses i'm trying to get you ready for that in many more videos from now let's start prefacing that in your head so we're going to take a look at this and go okay what are we seeing we're seeing sine and we're seeing the inside of our function we have 3x that 3 affects the period so in our heads we need to understand that sine has a period of 2 pi but we have to divide that by whatever that number is that coefficient over x that's going to start cutting or lengthening our period what's that do that's going to create this horizontal compression or horizontal stretch that's what happens here so this is a take your period sinus period of 2 pi cut it in 3. well that's just really shrunk this horizontally that's going to make it very narrow now i can show that as narrow as it should be but that period says you're going to have a period of 2 pi over 3. stop right there don't do anything else plot that on your x-axis so i've plotted two pi over three that's my period go through the same thing cut that in half so wait a minute what happens if you cut 2 pi over 3 in half 2 pi over 3 divided by 2 or cut in half is 2 pi over 6 or 2 pi over 3 times 2 those 2's cancel you're going to get pi over 3. now cut pi over three in half so you found period half your period now find the first quarter so pi over three divided by two cut in half is pi over six how you can always divide fractions by 2 is multiply their denominator so pi over 3 cut in half is pi over 3 times 2 that's pi over 6. now if you didn't catch it in last last example catch it here sometimes it's very difficult to find that for students um i've seen teachers tell them to average these two which you certainly can that's very difficult uh you can say hey power not vary but more difficult that has to be power 3 plus 2 pi over 3 divided by 2 is going to give you whatever that is but it's a little bit easier to think about hey if that's one quarter and that's a half of your period a quarter plus a half is three quarters that's what that is so just add those two it will give you whatever that quarter that third quarter is so pi over six plus pi over three use your calculator one sixth plus one third if you want to it doesn't matter but pi over six plus uh 2 pi over 6 that's pi over 3 is going to be 3 pi over 6 that's going to be pi over 2. so now that we've got our period all lined up we know exactly what the important points are for this graph we know that this is dealing with sine we know how sine looks we know specifically that sine has x-intercepts at the ends and at the center i hope right now you realize why we do the period first because everything revolves around that like literally uh everything revolves around it so if we have our period we know that sine has x-intercepts it ends in center we know exactly where our x-intercepts are that's that's very very nice um we also would have done a vertical shift now had we had it but we we don't so we've said period no vertical shift x sine says x-intercepts ends in center we got it the rest of the points the rest of these values the things that you don't have x-intercepts on become the x-coordinates of your key points so notice with your key points i know in the last video i had specific key points those change the idea was for sine your really important key points happen at the quarters whatever the quarter your periods are that's pi over 6 and pi over 2 right now those are the x-intercepts of your or x-coordinates of your key points now think back to what sine does sine has x-intercepts and ends in center it has peaks at the quarters first quarter is one second quarter is negative i'm sorry third quarter is negative one so i'm going to put that i'm going to put i know that sign has a 1 at its first quarter originally and negative 1 in its third quarter this is what we want to multiply by whatever's out front now we don't have anything right now but we will in just a while so we'd say these are our key points first quarter i'm not saying pi over six on perfect on purpose i'm not saying pi over six on purpose first quarter one third quarter negative one this is what you'd multiply times whatever's there in that case that's just one that's not gonna move it's not gonna stretch it not gonna reflect it so we're gonna plot those pi over six comma one or first quarter comma one third quarter negative one and we have a sine function that's been horizontally compressed if we shorten that period if we cut it up it's going to compress that sine function will happen more regularly i hope that makes sense to you i hope that you're seeing the utility and how i'm graphing these for you um one thing i do want to say before we get here is what would happen if instead of sine of 3x you had sine of negative 3x or you can think of this y equals cosine of negative 2x and you go i don't like that neither do i there is never a time when you should have a period with a negative in it wait wait a minute wouldn't you divide 2 pi by negative 3 well you would if you were kind of doing it wrong here's the deal because sine and cosine are odd and even functions you can always change the argument if it's negative into a positive by using the fact this is odd or even remember what odd functions do odd functions say opposite inputs opposite outputs what that means for sine because it's an odd function is that if you have sine of a negative inside of your your function you could write this as negative sine of 3x odd functions say opposite inputs opposite outputs that's odd and that's what this would do notice what you cannot do you cannot pull a negative three out you're not actually factoring a negative out get this man that's a big misconception for students you're not factoring out a negative here you're not just pulling it out you're using the fact it's an odd function you're using this that's what you're doing it's not magic it's not like well sine has a magic where you can pull out a negative but cosine no magic happens let's say you can't pull out a negative that's not it at all what it is is because sine is odd it follows this it says if you have a negative in the argument you can put a negative in front of your function and change the sign of your input that's what this is saying and that's why it works you're not pulling out a negative you certainly can't pull out a 3. what would it look like well would you still have the same period yes now that you've changed this to be more appropriate you have a period that's the same it looks just like that you have key points that are the same except that with this negative here's what would happen this negative negative one would now multiply your key points notice how that would work you'd have a key point of quarter comma one third quarter common negative one but you'd multiply those outputs and you'd get pi over six negative one and pi over two positive one first quarter output gets multiplied by negative one third quarter output gets multiplied by negative one and it's going to it's going to reflect that and so this graph would look like kind of pretty just a reflection that's what that would do please understand you cannot factor out anything inside of this in order to change this you need some sort of an identity so in order to change your argument you need some identities i haven't taught you yet and identities that they have one of them is that signs an odd function negatives can change the sign of your function along with the sign of your input now what would cosine do well cosine of negative 2x oh wait cosine is an even function don't be taken too high and dividing by negative 2. that's crazy we don't want a period of negative pi that that's awful right that's really hard to think about it's on the wrong side of the y-axis force we don't want to do that so think about how cosine is even well what do even functions do even functions due to a symmetry about the y-axis even functions say opposite inputs equal outputs what that means is that cosine of negative 2x is exactly the same as cosine of positive 2x now for a student who does not understand evenness this looks like magic it's like wait a minute why do you factor out the negative here but you don't there you're not factoring negative signs odd so opposite inputs give you opposite outputs that's what this is saying for cosine cosine's even opposite inputs give you the same output so in other words cosine of a positive angle or or opposite negative angle is giving you the same cosine we studied that a long time ago but this is how we deal with it so at this point we'd say okay now we're dealing with cosine of 2x let's talk about the period first period always takes the period of your trig function divides it by whatever your coefficient of your x is whatever's inside that parentheses in this case it's going to shrink it so our period is pi draw the pi so we put the period on our graph first we cut it in half we cut in half again for the first quarter this is going to make a lot of sense now what i was talking about here for the third quarter but for the third quarter hopefully you understand it's one-fourth two-fourths three-fourths and four-fourths but check it out you can always get this by adding these two one-fourth plus one-half is three-fourths or likewise pi over four plus pi over two is three pi over four that's the way i get the period every single time now understand what's going on here we don't have a vertical shift we show right now if we did there'd be plus or a minus here to shift this up or down we do not have that but what we do have are the fact that we have some some x-intercepts due to the fact that this is cosine cosine always has x-intercepts at the quarters so i'm going to put x-intercepts at the corners that i just found that's why we find that first cosine has key points wherever we don't have x-intercepts so on your period where you don't have an x-intercept at 0 pi over two and pi if you're starting to build something in your head you should be you should be thinking that hey sine is always going to have two key points and cosine's always going to have three that's true sine always has two x intercepts sorry three x intercepts and cosine always has two no the all because we have five key points all the time three of which are x intercepts and sine that gives us two peaks and peaks and then for cosine two which are x intercepts they give us three which are peaks so we're going to draw that so here's what we need to know about cosine you need to have a mental picture and understand that cosine has a peak at the first so so right before we even start has a peak when we start has a peak in the middle and it has a peak at the end and it goes one negative one and one originally so we're gonna write that down so where we start has a peak of one in the center has a peak of negative one maybe a valley at the end has a peak of one so notice i'm not doing i'm not just saying zero pi over two and pi i'm saying at the the first part of the the beginning of the end we have a peak of one and the center of peak of negative one or a value at negative one a local minimum then what we would do is we take a look at that and we'd see if we need to multiply it by anything because we don't have a change in amplitude we do not reflect this there's nothing there besides one we we don't multiply anything here if we had we multiply these outputs so we're going to go to our graph we're going to put these right on our graph the values are already there on our x-axis we should fill out our points so 0 1 pi over 2 negative 1. that's right in the center and then pi one that's at the end and we get a cosine graph this is just shortened this way and so this would repeat with more frequency is what we call that so this would go faster and faster and faster but can you see it's just a cosine function that's shrunk i hope it's making sense i'm going to start building this in difficulty we're going to talk about how to adjust both your period and amplitude in just a second uh we'll talk also about how to to put in a vertical shift there all right let's get after it so we've got a couple more how about y equals negative sine of wait x over eight that's weird that's like that's like 1 8. and you might see it written that way you might see y equals negative 2 sine 1 8 x or something like that that's fine here's what we're going to do we're going to find our period and vertical shift first we're going to graph those two things so here we see a a change in our period but not a vertical shift how we always deal with the period we talk about it first is take the original period whatever trig function you're dealing with in this case sine that's 2 pi divide by whatever is being multiplied by x keep in mind this fraction here is 1 8. you have to divide by 1 8 here so 2 pi divided by 1 8 is going to give you 16 pi remember you can multiply by the reciprocal and you're going to get 16 pi now i'm going to start having you think about something a little bit differently if we would have a vertical shift what we're going to do is is graph these in conjunction with one another so i don't have a vertical shift here but i do here and so here's what we would normally do we'd show our vertical shift and then we treat that like a new x-axis and we put our period on that so since i'm not shifting right now i'm going to put my period on my x-axis 16 pi this would be a really stretched out period so a really stretched out graph of sine let's find half of that that's really convenient let's find half of that in between here remember you can always add these two to find the third quarter that's 12 pi so we've gone ahead we've looked at our period we've looked at our vertical shift you typically deal with those in conjunction with one another i'm going to show you that on this example we've put our period down that's fantastic now we're going to take a look at what trig function we're dealing with we always do this in this order so got it and got it these go together at mark x intercepts so trig function is sine our x-intercepts are at the centers i'm sorry center and at the ends so center and ends for sine whatever is not an x-intercept is going to be a key point for you so i'm going to put 4 and 12 pi we need to have a mental picture of sign in our head we'd understand that for sine at the first quarter we're one and at the third quarter negative one you can see it on the unit circle first chord of the circle sine is one third quarter of the circle sine is negative one that is what this is referring to is just stretching this out a bit so one and negative one so we have found the period and the vertical shift we marked our x-intercepts we have our key points based on our quarters the things that aren't x-intercepts in this case and now we know that we have a norm normally we'd have a peak at 1 and negative 1. however our key points get affected by reflections and by vertical stretches and compressions so we're going to take whatever this is and multiply our outputs our key points outputs by that so two times negative one is negative two negative two times negative one is positive two so what this has done is it says taken and lengthened our period that's a vertical sorry a horizontal stretch this has taken our key points the outputs and made them change sign that's a reflection and grown them by a factor of two that's a stretch so this is a horizontal stretch that's the period it's a vertical reflection and a vertical stretch out of that that's what's happening here so because we know that because we know the first quarter we normally get one and at the third corner we normally get negative one for sine we're now multiplying by negative two and reflecting that and stretching it we just have to plot these now so four pi negative 2 12 pi positive 2 and we get this reflected sine function like we expected that's about how that would look um to get a real clear picture of what's what's actually going on please remember that the normal period for sine is two pi wait a minute that's like that's like right here so normally here's how this graph would look if you want to see it superimpose a little bit that's about how that would look so this has been i moved out a little bit more right there but this has been really stretched out and quite a bit uh vertically stretched as well so that's the original sine function and then this is the reflected stretch horizontally and stretched vertically sine function i hope it's making sense i hope you've seen the interaction of the key points especially in this graph it's it's quite important okay let's move on to y equals 3 times cosine of 4x plus 1. the first thing we do with any trig function is figure out the period yes but we also want to consider any vertical shifts i'm going to show you how that works here so our period says look at your trig function it's cosine cosine has normally a period of two pi but now we're dividing that by four so that's going to be pi over two this also has a vertical shift right there think about what would happen you plug in a number find cosine of the number that's an output three times that that's an output and then you add one where you're adding one not to the input you're adding one to the output so this is going to affect the output here this is a vertical shift up one so there's a slight change in what we're going to do instead of just putting our period on our x-axis here's the thought if we're going to shift this up one let's sort of pretend the x-axis shifts up one so we're going to make a dotted line a horizontal dotted line right here and we're going to put our period on that dotted line you can put it in both places if you'd like but it really helps to put it on your shifted axis now is the x-axis really moving no not really but we're going to use that as a graphic organizer on what on which to put our key points it's how the key points work is on the shifted versions of your axes so i'm going to draw that horizontal line what that represents is our entire function is shifting up one unit every output at every point shifting up one unit what we're going to do is graph our period on that so we're going to do that right now you can also put it on your x-axis i just find it very very helpful to put on this this line especially when it's way above or way below so pi over two is our period half of that's pi over four half of that's pi over eight if i add those two things together let's see pi over eight plus two pi over eight that's three pi over eight now this is key when we talk about cosine having x-intercepts at the quarters keep in mind what we're doing because we shifted this up one this is why we draw this dotted line this is why i'm putting the period on that dotted line i know it's not really there i know that x-axis is right here and that's totally fine but because i've done that i now know that not only does this function shift but the x-axis the x-intercepts also shift and so we can plot our x-intercepts at the quarters but they've got to be in relation to where you just shifted what that means is that our x-intercepts are not really x-intercepts anymore what they are are places where we would now intersect this horizontal line at y equals one so that's at the quarter so remember cosine x intercepts at quarters what that means is cosine where we would have some key points here are as it are at pi over eight one three pi over eight one we're sort of pretending it's an x-axis and we'd get two very important key points here no they're not x-intercepts anymore hopefully that makes sense you don't just magically move your x-axis it's just a graphic organizer for you to create a very good-looking graph with middle work but those points would be pi over eight one and three pi over eight one we're treating them like x intercepts because we're shifting everything else so the ends in the center become your key point so i'm gonna put down zero here's zero and so x equals zero and pi over four and pi over two we also need to understand what cosine does cosine has peaks of one at the ends and negative one in the center those are our key points as it would relate to a cosine that's been sort of squished to a quarter of the normal period now we're going to say hey those things can be multiplied by whatever numbers here that factor out in front multiplies your outputs so allow it to do so so three times all of these outputs so we get 0 3 and we get negative 1 times 3 here we get 1 times 3 here so pi over 4 negative 3 pi over 2 comma 3. those are our new key points we're going to plot them in relation to our shifted x-axis so there's a lot going on here here's what we've done we've taken a look and said hey our period has shrunk that's a horizontal compression we've shifted up one that's a vertical shift of one so that's acts like our x-axis we've recognized that for cosine x-intercepts are at the quarters so they it acts like x-intercepts on that shifted version we said all right our key points will happen at ends and center for cosine we've written them down we know that peaks are at the beginning end and the a positive one and negative one in the center we turn that down we've adjusted with a vertical stretch here so we've had a horizontal compression a vertical shift and a vertical shift stretch of three and then we've shown that now we're going to plot these key points but please get this is the biggest deal because you shifted that these key points relate to this as acting as your x-axis it's not i know it's not really there but it acts like it and so we plot these points in relation to this thing right here what that means is that 0 3 this would act like 0 0. i know it's not there but it acts like it this would be 0 1 2 3. this would be acting like 0 3. if you've seen my previous graphene that makes sense look i know that point's actually 0 4. like everybody realizes that this is just a very good way to get an accurate graph without having to plug in a ton of points it's the best way i've come up to deal with it so that students actually understand what they're doing how about pi over 4 negative 3. here's pi over 4. we're going to treat this like the place from where you are putting your key points so pi over four comma negative three is one two three right here pi over two comma three this acts like your x axis so pi over two comma three is right about there can you see that it's a cosine that's been shifted shrunk this way grown this way for the last time yes everybody realizes that you don't actually have x-intercepts here and here it's just a it's just a graphic organizer to help you graph it um i hope i've made the point that your key point i know i have but that your key points are in relation to where you shift to both up and down and when we get to phase shifting left and right as well that's why we do these in a certain order so period yes but a vertical shift and next i have several minutes now and a horizontal shift they all work together so you put your period after you have done your shifting put them on that new x-axis that you the new x-axis that you have so i hope that makes sense we're going to come back with like two more maybe a special case we'll be done okay kind of some awkward ones they look a little weird like wait a minute what's that doing in there how are we gonna have pies and something that you plug in pies too it's actually gonna be a little bit easier but you have to see it a couple times so i'm gonna walk you through this one i'm gonna go very quickly through this one you need to do this on your phone so let's take a look at our 4 sine pi over 2x minus 2 the first thing i really need to understand is there is an extreme difference whether this parentheses ends here or here if you have something added or subtracted outside of your function that's a vertical shift up or down where minus means down if this had been inside your parentheses where this wasn't here you would have to factor out a pi over 2 and that would become what's called a phase shift left and right oh you should remember that you should remember that anything added or subtracted inside your function is left or right but it has to be in a certain form and it's opposite of what you want it to be do you remember that i hope you remember that i hope that you remember that subtracting is to the right and adding is to the left inside of a function as far as our horizontal shifts and therefore phase shifts are concerned so let's get back to it there's a few things going on we need to really understand the first one is the period the period always says take your the period of your original treat function or the original period of a trig function 2 pi and divide it by whatever coefficient is in front of your x wait a minute 2 pi divided by uh pi over 2 well the pi's are going to cancel and we would get well if we reciprocate and multiply we get 2 pi times two over pi the twos give you four the pi's cancel you're going to get four here wait a minute can you have a period of four yeah it's actually a little bit easier to deal with just put four on your graph now we're not going to do it now though because we also have a vertical shift so that minus 2 says you are going to shift down 2. and so we're going to show that we're going to put these together in general we show our vertical shift and horizontal shift phase shift first and put our period in relationship to the new shifted axis so we've done our vertical shift of down two we know our period is four so let's go ahead and put the period on our i'm gonna put on the x-axis but i'm gonna show all of our marks on my shifted axis if we do this to scale here's two that'd be about four half of that's two a quarter that's one and three quarters is three that's kind of nice 1 2 and 3. so we've gone ahead and we've done our vertical shift we've done our period we now know that we're dealing with sine and so sine has x-intercepts at the end and center what that refers to now because we shifted this is our x-intercepts change to just some key points that interact with that shifted version of our x-axis ends and center that leaves us with two key points based on our quarters one and three remember what sine does sine originally peaks at the first quarter at one end of the third quarter negative one this is why it was so important for you to remember that yes those key points on the original sine function are great but the way they refer to as first quarter and third quarter peak at one peak at negative or valley i suppose at negative one that's what we have here first quarter positive one third quarter negative one then we allow this to infect our outputs so what this has done this has taken and grown our period actually because of sorry shorter period because the period was originally two pi this is smaller than that this is smaller than two times pi this is four so it's horizontally compressed us this has shifted us down to this is going to vertically stretch us so we have our our key points 1 1 yes but now 1 comma 4 times 1 is 4. and likewise three comma negative four plot these in relation to your shifted axis and your quarters that you put down so one comma four starts from here one comma four would be one comma one two three four three comma negative four would be three comma one two three four and we get a sine or sinusoidal function out of this thing what if you had to keep going could you do this for another cycle or another period all we would do is double this so double this period you get eight add whatever this number is to each of these things and you will get the filled in version of that so 1 plus 4 is 5 that's the it's called the next first quarter 2 plus 4 is 6 that's in the center 3 plus 4 is 7 and you would get another ability to put down your x-intercepts at the ends in the center your key points will just shift over so remember this is why we talk about first quarter being one or first quarter being four third quarter being negative four so that you can just move it so now here's your first quarter first score is five so five comma four one two three four third quarter negative four that's one two three four and we get another psychology you keep going forever and ever and ever like that again this is the last time i'm gonna say this probably not but the last time i say this is yes the key points are not actually one one four is not on your graph all right one comma two is on your graph it's just plotted in relation to your shifted axis so that you can do it so that it's easy you're not plugging in points all the time i hope the technique makes sense i hope that you're understanding it i hope that you like it i've seen it work very very well when the student understands it then it's they never make mistakes on it for very rarely okay i told you i was going to go quickly through it i'm going to we have cosine here cosine has a period of 2 pi if we divide by pi over 4 then that's going to give us a period of 8. now we're going to graph that in just a bit that period but we're also identifying that that is up 2. so i'm going to take and i'm going to make a vertical shift up 2. now because we've done that we can put our period of eight notice reciprocate multiply you're gonna get eight put our period of eight on our x-axis and the shifted version now cut it in half cut it in half again that's our first quarter add these two that's your third quarter so remember what cosine does cosine peaks at the first quarter i'm sorry at the beginning and at the end and it right in the middle so at the zero if you will at the halfway point and at the end one's at the beginning end negative one in the center has x-intercept at the corners so x-intercepts now shift what that leaves us with are three key points zero four and eight the centers and the ends we also remember with cosine that originally before we start shifting it before we start manipulating before we start vertically stretching and reflecting it that those ends would have a 1 and the center would have a value of negative 1. those however get get changed they get transformed by that number that number that output that factor affects the outputs of your of your function so it's going to take those outputs it's going to multiply by negative three so we've seen affect the period got it shipped up to got it drawn them together after that we have our key points if it's at the center and at the ends for cosine no problem with x-intercepts at the quarters we got that that's what cosine does you need to remember that because we know that the ends in the center have a peak of 1 and 1 and negative 1 respectively this is a multiplier that factor multiplies the outputs it grows and reflects things and so we've done that as long as we plot these key points from our shifted version on our period we're gonna be fine so this says where you begin and notice i'm not saying just zero just where you begin that's gonna affect be affected on a phase shift where you begin is at zero negative three so here's zero one two three four comma three that's the center and then three here's the center of the period comma three and here's eight negative three that's the end of the period negative three obviously the point on the graph is not eight negative three it's eight negative 1 but that's because we shifted up 2 units the point here is to use it in relationship and you're going to get a very nice graph so what's happened here we have let's see stretched out our period so horizontal stretch we've shifted up two so vertical stretch of two we have reflected this you can see it's not like this it's like this now and we've vertically stretched it that's four transformations and that's one period worth of this particular cosine function man i hope i'm making it make sense i hope that at this point like yes i get this please stop with the examples well i'm not gonna i'm gonna give you one more going in reverse and then we're going to be done with it okay so what if you have to go backwards what if you have to create a function from an amplitude or a period or even from a graph of a function we'll talk about that i'm not going to do one for you they're not as super common but i will talk about how to do that so if you have a period could you write a function from it if you have an amplitude could you give it a number up front now notice those won't give you reflection but you could talk about it as far as the period goes we know that if the period is the period of your original function so you need to know whether you're getting a sine or a cosine out of it this in this case we want a sine we need to know what our original period is and that is divided by whatever your omega is so wait a second if you have a period of four pi then what this translates to is 4 pi hey that's our period equals this is what our period always is so if you have 4 pi equal to 2 pi over omega can you solve for omega yeah we'd multiply both sides by omega and divide by 4 pi ultimately what you do just interchange these two things that's going to give you omega equals 2 pi over 4 pi again you can multiply both sides by omega divided by four pi whatever you want this is going to give you one half in conjunction with what we know our amplitude to be our amplitude is the absolute value of whatever our a is so if we don't know whether we have a reflected graph or not just consider it to be your a and we can get a function from an amplitude and from whatever our period is and that's about it we just put our omega right there in front of your action you're done now a weird question what if your what if your t wasn't 4 pi what if it was just 2 or something well we can do the same thing we just understand that if we take our original our original period for our trig function write the formula period is always pi over 2 divided by omega and that's the number in front of x so if we know that t is 2 then we can solve for omega and omega would be pi so we just change this to pi and we get sine of pi times x now with the same amplitude we would get that exact same function i hope that makes sense to you on at least how to find a whatever the argument of your sign that your trig function is from whatever your period is we can do other things and let this on the board for you just to say hey could you recognize that this is shifted up two units could you recognize that this is a reflected graph can you recognize that if we start and stop from zero to eight that you would have a t of eight you can find your omega this is a little bit more advanced but it is something that you can do now that we understand how to graph from our trig functions this should be doable to go backwards i i want you to do that sort of on your own i've already shown you one example you can get the same information from a graph so i just wanted to mention that i hope that this video has made sense i hope that especially you understand how to relate your trig function and your period with your shifting and then get your x-intercepts appropriate ends and center for sine quarters for cosine use the rest of what's not filled out so rest of it aren't your x-intercepts to get key points and then plot them in relation to your shifted axis hope that makes sense i'll see you for another video when you start talking about what tangent looks like have a great day you 

Transcript for: How to Graph Tangent and Cotangent (Precalculus - Trigonometry 13)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the graphs of tangent and cotangent much like we talked about the graphs of sine and cosine and then another video on how to transform those we're going to do the same thing here so we're going to discuss in this video where tangent and cotangent come from graphically so back to the inner circle we're going to take a look at that and see where these points come from why tangent and cotangent look the way that they do then in the next video we're going to shift them around so this can be kind of a quicker video for us i'm just getting a feel for white why in the world there is a vertical asymptote every so often on tangent cotangent why we have this repeated x-intercept every so often when with tangent cotangent how they're related to one another whether we have even or odd functions out of them so that's what we're getting we're getting some understanding here we also want to pay close attention to some of these key features right here because what's going to happen in the next few videos is i'm going to show you how to transform tangent and cotangent and we're going to see oh if i can identify the period then i know that something happens at the ends something happens in the center and something happens at the corners of the period just like sine and cosine and so that's very important for us to understand so let's take a look at tangent first and there's something i need to point out remember that tangent is that relationship right there on a unit circle so tangent of theta the central angle is given by the y-coordinate over the x-coordinate so when we get down to our graph so we start plotting some points we really want to make sure that we're comparing for every single angle which remember angles can represent the arc length so any real number on a unit circle that's because it's unit circle with radius of one and what we're doing basically is taking a real number allowing it to be an arc length that is also the same thing as a central angle and therefore we can find out a ratio of a y coordinate divided by an x coordinate for any real number that we can plug into tangent and these real numbers that don't give us anything else we call them undefined we're going to get a vertical asymptote so let's get started now we're going to start with tangent on where the x-intercepts are so we're going to take a look at this okay let's see if if tangent theta is y over x then x-intercepts happen where the numerator equals zero and the denominator doesn't that's only way to get zero out of a fraction is where the numerator equals zero and denominator doesn't so if tangent of theta is y over x then tangent of theta or any real number is going to equal 0 if y is 0 when x is not now there's nowhere where both y and x are zero so that's very easy we're just going to take a look and see at what angles y equals zero well the first one is here at zero so tangent of zero is going to give us zero tangent of pi is going to give us zero why well because tangent compares the y coordinate over the x zero over one is zero zero over negative one is zero and those are the only two places on a unit circle where the y is zero and x is not so we'd have tangent of zero is zero over one tangent of pi is zero over negative one those are both zero so what's going to happen is we're going to have zeros at plug in zero this relates to remember this relates to an angle here so tangent of zero says plug in zero okay you got it you're gonna get zero one that's zero there will be therefore an x intercept at the origin now how about pi plug in pi we're going to get tangent of pi is 0 1 that's also 0. and this is true for every multiple of pi we are going to get x intercepts every 0 plus k pi or minus k pi so there's gonna be another zero at negative pi and negative two pi at pi and at two pi and at three pi we keep going and going and going and going and going what we're going to find out with tangent is the period is half of what it is for sine cosine and and secant cosecant it's going to be just pi and we're going to get a 0 every every 0 or an x intercept every 0 and then pi and then 2 pi 3 pi all the way forever so we could write something like that maybe make a little note that x intercepts happen at zero plus k pi now something unique happens with tangent that didn't happen with sine and cosine we're going to come up with some values that they're undefined now sine and cosine they were defined everywhere our domain was all real numbers that was fantastic but tangent doesn't act like that why not well because sine is just the y coordinate and the y coordinate kind of oscillates between negative one and one and and cosine was just the x coordinate and oscillate between negative one and one and between that interval we get all real numbers negative one one to one and this angle goes all the way around from zero to 360 degrees or zero to two pi and there's never an angle that's excluded from that and every single one of those is mapped to an output either x or y there's never a domain issue there's never a range issue but tangent is a ratio so tangent is y over x now we know something about fractions we know that when our denominator is zero we have a significant issue we have something that's undefined so let's take a look at our unit circle and figure out for which angles x is zero you see at the angles where x is zero we're going to get something over zero something over zero is undefined okay so if x is zero we get problems um x is zero here and x is zero here or think about it as a negative angle negative pi over two x is zero at pi over two x is also zero at negative pi over two or at three pi over two well every place that x is zero tangent of that angle is going to be undefined so let's look at that tangent of pi over two is one over zero uh undefined tangent of three pi over two well that's negative one over zero but it's still undefined tangent of negative pi over two is negative one over zero that's still undefined what that means for us remember the angle is what we have on our x-axis right now so we're taking these real numbers thinking of them as an arc length that equals a central angle so any real number and then we're evaluating it with our unit circle and saying okay um our angle represents something on this x-axis that's all pi's and stuff pi over 2 negative pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2 are going to have problems so why again is because we're dividing y by x and if x is zero it gives us something that's undefined that means that pi over two tangent of pi over two is undefined so right here we're going to have what's called a vertical asymptote you found this out like in the college algebra portion of precalculus that any time you divide a fraction by zero you get a vertical asymptote if you can't cancel it out and that's exactly the same watch that we have right here we are going to have a vertical asymptote of pi over two we also learned we'd have one at negative pi over 2 and at 3 pi over 2 and in fact we're going to have it at pi over 2 plus k pi now wait a minute plus k pi was the same thing for x intercepts plus k pi is the same thing for our vertical asymptotes plus k 2 pi was for sine and cosine that stuff it's plus the period so every period this is going to repeat again and again and again and again so at pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2 and negative pi over 2 and 5 pi over 2 and pi over 2 plus k pi we are going to have vertical asymptotes and that's what we have here so we have vertical asymptotes at pi over 2. yeah we got one of those plus every k pi every multiple of pi so 1 pi or negative 1 pi and then you add that so that's pi over 2 plus 1 pi would be 3 pi over 2 plus another pi would be 5 pi over 2 minus pi would be negative pi over 2 or negative 3 pi over 2 and we can get a vertical asymptote on the entire x-axis every pi over 2 plus or minus k pi oh well actually plus k pi k can be positive or negative integers and that's why we write it that way and this also creates a domain issue for us you see with sine and cosine our domain was all real numbers you plug in anything but with tangent it's not how we define our domain is all real numbers except for those values that are undefined and that's what we have here we have some undefinedness if you will at pi over 2 and every k pi so we're going to write that so domain is all real numbers but x cannot equal pi over 2. we saw that why not again because at pi over 2 x is 0 for this particular angle and y over x is going to give you something undefined now please get this we're about to discover that the period of tangent is pi the reason why this k pi is there is saying look if you have something that's undefined at pi over two then if you go another period it's still going to be undefined it's it's a it's a cycle of a function it's going to repeat every single period and so that means that if you add the period to it or a multiple period or subtract a period you're going to get another undefined place and that's what that says so this should be the same thing in your head you should understand that hey due to the fact that i have vertical asymptotes every place on my unit circle the x coordinate is zero well then what that means is that every so often i'm going to get a vertical asymptote at the same interval that also means that vertical asymptotes create domain problems for us so our domain is yeah all real numbers except pi over 2 plus or minus k pi how about a range well now this is this is quite interesting our range for sine and cosine is negative one to one but that's not true for tangent you see for tangent we can start getting comparisons of one divided by very very very small numbers that's going to create something that's more than more than one for by longitude close to positive infinity and all the way down to negative infinity and that's typically what vertical asymptotes do for us they say if as you get closer to it you got to kind of make a choice the function makes a choice here not really but it says you're going to have to go all the way like this or all the way like this and that's exactly what happens with our tangent so before we get there before we get our range is all real numbers we're going to write down in a minute i want to discover how these graphs actually look whether they're climbing or whether they're falling and they're going to be kind of an s curve for us so we're going to take a look at pi over 4 negative pi over 4 3 pi over 4 5 pi over 4 and we're going to see this pattern emerge so let's take a look at it how about pi over 4 tangent of pi over 4 is going to compare the y over the x and they're the same so wait a minute tangent to pi over 4 is going to give us 1. now tangent negative pi over 4 that's the same thing as 3 sorry 7 pi over 4. so tangent of negative pi over 4 and 7 pi over 4 they're the same we're going to get negative root 2 over 2 divided by positive square root 2 over 2. well that's negative 1. now how about three pi over four three pi over four is right here that's also negative one you should see it you should see y divided by x is negative one and five pi over four tangent of five pi over four says a negative divided by negative that's a positive one now what i really want i really want you to see the repetition here do you see that this is repeating negative 1 0 1 negative 1 0 1 vertical asymptote vertical asymptote vertical asymptote now how often are they repeating well they're repeating more often than every 2 pi in fact if you take a look at this from 0 to pi that's only adding pi 0 plus pi is pi or negative pi over 2 plus pi is pi over 2 or negative pi over 4 to 3 pi over 4 is adding pi to that so this period for tangent is more often than 2 pi it's every pi now why i really want you to get why this is not just memorize it it's easy to memorize it but understand why the reason why is because if tangent is a ratio it's comparing a positive and a negative well the reason why tangent occurred has a period sooner than 2 pi it's every pi is because positives divided by positives and negatives divided by negatives gives you gives you the same output also positive over negative or negative or positive give you the same output what i mean by that is we are going to get positives divided by positives here negatives of positives divided by negatives here but then negative divided by negative and positive divide negative divided by a positive gives you the same exact results so these two quadrants and these two quadrants have exactly the same tangent for whatever those angles are so tangent of angles here and here they start repeating well what is a repetition but a period and that's exactly what the period means how often things repeat so tangent repeats after these first two quadrants wait a second these first two quadrants are 0 to pi and then pi to 2 pi that's every pi that is the reason why the period of tangent and therefore cotangent is going to be pi and we can see it vertical asymptotes repeat every pi it says right there x intercepts repeat every pi it says right there we kind of notice that we're just putting some meat on the bones now so how this graph looks it almost looks like a cubic and it's going to repeat every pi interval so the period's pi is going to repeat every pi now is it even or odd well due to the fact that this is symmetric about the origin this is an odd function we can also see that opposite inputs pi pi over 4 and negative pi 4 are giving us opposite outputs that's exactly what what tangent does this is also what will say it's it's odd on its period and so if we start shifting this around we start getting oddness but it moves with that period it would not be odd in relation to the y-axis if we start transforming transforming this from from that original spot so we've learned why x-intercepts are at where they are and we've learned why vertical asymptotes are where they are we've learned why the periods even pi and we've kind of shown that now some important things to remember i need you to remember something you see what's going to happen next video is we're going to take one period of tangent and we're going to start transforming it we're going to shift it up we're going to shift it down or we're going to start stretching it and reflecting it changing the period here's what i need to know when we start changing the period it might change how how far we stretch this horizontally or compress it but it won't change the following it will not change that vertical asymptotes happen at the ends of your period this is one period this is another period the period is still pi and a vertical asymptote is going to happen at the ends of your period that's what i want you to write down so let's take a look at that let's kind of zoom in right here if this is one period this is what tangent looks like on the period from negative pi over two to pi over two that's from here to here well if our if this is one period and vertical asymptotes happen to the end what happens in the center our one and only x-intercept happens at the center of our period so periods here vertical asymptotes of the end-your period we're going to use this next time x-intercept in the center cool so the x-intercept is at the center of the period and then at the corners of our period hopefully you're seeing this hope you're seeing this like we did with sine and cosine we said at the ends something happens at the center something happens at the quarter something happens for tangent at the ends we have vertical asymptotes at the center we have an x-intercept at the quarters we have negative 1 and positive one respectively i'm not going to show the key points now but i certainly will when we get to graphing this and transformations what i want you to remember is that here's what's going to happen we're going to firstly identify our tangent and our our period we're going to mark the period on our x-axis right away after we mark that period we're going to go to the ends vertical asymptotes go to the center put an x-intercept go to the quarters of your period and do your x do your negative one and your positive one or at least write your key points so identify the quarters and write our key points our key points will be first quarter common negative one second quarter comma or i supposed to be third quarter third quarter comma positive one and then our key points from there we'll manipulate this it'll make um it's that it's a little bit not concrete that's a theory behind it so i'll show you that when we get there but at this point i need you to really recognize it yeah it ends the period we got vertical asymptote at the center is an x-intercept and here at the first quarter let's call it second quarter and a third quarter we're going to have negative one and positive 1. those will create key points and we'll manipulate them next time so let's move on and let's talk about cotangent of x so with cotangent of x instead of having tangent theta equals y over x cotangent is x over y it's a reciprocal so we're going to make this really easy when you reciprocate things zeros so zero over one changes to one over zero and one over zero changes to zero over one now why am i saying that well because if we compare this to tangent which is why i left it on the board all of our zeros become undefined and all of our undefined vertical asymptotes become zeros now let's check that on the unit circle make sure that's true so take a look at tangent remember we're talking about tangent here when x was 0 we had things that were undefined so that would be at pi over 2 and negative pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2 we got undefined where x was 0. but if you look at cotangent well that reciprocates it now x is on the numerator y is on the denominator so at pi over 2 we no longer get undefined for cotangent like we did for tangent we get just zero over one well that's zero what that means is that for cotangent at pi over two and negative pi over two three pi over two every place we had a vertical asymptote for tangent we're going to have an x-intercept for cotangent so negative pi over 2 and pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2 and x intercepts are now going to cause vertical asymptotes vertical asymptotes like we're seeing right now are causing x-intercepts so at pi over 2 plus or minus k pi remember these are reciprocals of one another they're very related now how about vertical asymptotes uh well tangent was zero when y was zero like here so we'd have y over x zero one yeah okay that makes sense that's zero but cotangent says reciprocate that well now that's one over zero that's undefined so where tangent had zeros at zero and pi and two pi and negative pi cotangent asymptotes there are vertical asymptotes wherever our tangent had an x-intercept so an x-intercept zero for tangent is a vertical asymptote of zero for cotangent we can see it at zero this should be one over zero for cotangent that's undefined at pi that's negative one over zero for cotangent remember cotangent is x over y that would be undefined and at negative pi that'd be negative one over zero in fact every period here every pi plus or minus so 0 plus or minus pi every k pi is going to give you a vertical asymptote finally this is kind of weird but notice that cotangent and tangent are going to have exactly the same value for pi over 4 and negative pi over 4 and every quarter of the period wait a minute what yeah for sure because tangent of pi over 4 is 1. cotangent just reciprocates that when you reciprocate one or negative one you still get one or negative one and so we're going to get exactly the same outputs but the period is different so it's going to look different and we can we can see it just it looks funny because it's broken up separately but look here's negative pi over four negative one that's the same exact value here's pi over four positive one power positive one nothing not a problem three pi over four negative one that's right these are repeating every pi that's what periods do they repeat things every so often if i take negative pi over four and add pi i'm at three pi over four at pi again i'd be at well whatever it's past that if i take uh negative three pi over four and add pi to pi over four add it again i'm at five pi over four it's repeating every pi every time i add pi it repeats that output just like we did for x intercepts just like we did for vertical asymptotes notice that these things are switched because they're reciprocals x intercepts became vertical asymptotes vertical asymptotes became x intercepts but the period did not change it just sort of moved and now now we're going to take a look at the graphs these graphs look quite similar it's almost like you phase shift and then reflect them kind of what you do and we get something about like that so we're going to fill out the domain and the range and whether it's even or odd um it's still actually going to be odd and we'll fill out the period but it's going to all that's going to happen is that these things change from where our vertical asymptote was on um on tangent to where our vertical asymptote is now for cotangent so the vertical asymptotes happen at zero we got that and at pi and negative pi and every other multiple of of pi so that means that we cannot have x values these inputs that are zero or any multiple of pi how about a range much like tangent it's all real numbers and that's due to the ratio of dividing one by some values of being very small and very small values divided by one both positive and negative we can get some of these all of these outputs from negative a to positive infinity even or odd this is still an odd graph if you think about rotating the entire function 180 degrees if you will or about the origin you're going to get that this is odd our period does not change it's still pi and even this doesn't change so we are going to notice this we are still going to get if the period is pi from zero to pi it's still the same period we're still going to get a vertical asymptote at the ends of our period we're still going to get an x-intercept at the center of our period that's that's absolutely true we're going to get negative 1 and 1 but they are reversed negative 1 is at the first quarter and sorry positive ones at the first quarter negative ones in the third quarter so i'm going to switch these and say this is for cotangent so one thing that makes it a little bit difficult is because tangent and cotangent have the same period but they don't start at the same place notice that tangent's period if you want to starts at negative pi over two and ends at pi over two but cotangent is zero to pi that's typically how we define these four inverses that we're going to talk about a little while i need you to memorize that so even though they have the same period how we're going to manipulate this next video is we're going to take a look at our key points sure we're going to take a look at hey we have a key point of negative pi over 4 or the first quarter negative one third quarter positive one for cotangent it's first quarter positive one third quarter negative one but we are going to start manipulating the period we need to understand that with tangent the original period is negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 and for cotangent it's zero to pi so make sure that we're realizing that as we get to the next video because we need to know where to start we don't start at zero like we did for sine and cosine we start at negative pi over two we kind of split we split zero with that first period for tangent cotangent does start at zero so we'll take a look at that when we get there i hope you're doing well hope you're enjoying the videos you 

Transcript for: Graphing Transformations with Tangent and Cotangent (Precalculus - Trigonometry 14)
hey welcome to another video so in this video what we're going to talk about are how to transform some of the graphs we just learned about how to transform tangent and cotangent in terms of a vertical shift maybe a vertical stretch of compression and then altering the period which is a horizontal stretch or compression depending on how we alter that that period so we're taking a look at that it's very very similar to sine and cosine and how we approach this idea so we're going to approach this with let's discover what causes a vertical shift let's talk about how we would put our period on the graph then we'll talk about how to adjust maybe a vertical stretch with key points where our vertical asymptotes come in for tangent and cotangent and then where our key points are after we start manipulating so that's our idea let's get right into it so with tangent and cotangent the reciprocal function for tangent there's a few things we need to really know the first one is that with the form that's quite similar to the graphs of sine and cosine we have some key features that i really really need you to know number one anything that's added after the function so after tangent and then you get the parentheses or cotangent that's going to be a vertical shift so this b is a vertical shift where plus is up and minus is down and that should make sense we've seen that for a long time that that affects the output so you plug in some stuff it does whole bunch of junk and then you add to it or subtract from whatever the output is it's going to move the entire graph up or down depending whether it's added or subtracted respectively and it's important we're going to discuss that as we go through some of these examples the second thing and probably the most important part here is to get the period right for tangent and cotangent you see tangent and cotangent both have a period of pi not two pi and we talked about why that was we talked about because due to the signs in the first and second quadrant and the third and fourth quadrant we have the sine interplay we have sort of a repeat of tangent every pi and so what's going to happen for us is that tangent and cotangent have a period of pi and so we're not going to put t equals 2 pi over omega we're going to put 2 this just as pi over omega because that's how often tangent and cotangent cycle that's how often they repeat that's what their period is now there is something very important here to understand tan while both tangent and cotangent have a period of pi where it's located on the graph is different it's actually a phase shift over and then a reciprocal of the function so here's what i need you to know with tangent the period centers on zero so you'll have half a period to the right and half a period to the left of zero of the y-axis and so it should always be symmetric if we don't have a phase shift if we aren't shifting left or right we should always have a period for tangent that's symmetric about that y the period not the function just the period is symmetric about that cotangent is different cotangent is very similar to sine and cosine and then it starts at 0 and then goes to pi and then from pi to 2 pi so tangent actually takes a little bit more work to do we're going to see that our very first example so that's really important we didn't know b is this vertical shift idea we need to know that the period is not based on 2 pi but on pi and we're dividing by whatever coefficient of x that is to adjust that tangent happens to have 0 right in the middle of that period cotangent starts at zero with a vertical asymptote or you can think of that way both of them have vertical asymptotes at the end of the period which is really nice we're going to use that and have an x-intercept in the center and then have negative one and one for tangent it's negative 1 and positive 1 at the first and third quarters and for cotangent it's positive 1 negative 1 at the first and third quarter so we're going to use that so here's the whole idea of what we're going to do we're first going to identify any vertical shift that we have if we have one we're then going to take a look at our period based on pi and cut it if we have to by whatever the coefficient of x is we're going to put that period on the graph so either on the x axis or on the shifted version of that or on both if we do have a vertical shift after that we're going to determine where our period is so our period says we're going to start in the middle with tangent with a zero and do half a period left and half a period right that's that's harder to do than most of them with cotangent we're gonna start at zero and just go a period to the right and then we're gonna say okay what happens at the center of that period you'll have an x-intercept for both of these with tangent you'll locate the first quarter and third quarter let's go negative one positive one with cotangent positive one negative one and that's about it we'll use our whatever our amplitude it's not really an amplitude whatever our a is to adjust our key points and that will give us a vertical stretch let's get right into it let's take a look at 3 tangent of x so the first thing we're going to identify is do we have any sort of a vertical shift vertical shifts have to happen at the end of your function so after your function happens if you add or subtract so we don't have one there's nothing being added or subtracted which means that our x-axis is where we're going to put our period the next thing we do is we talk about that period so our period for tangent is based on pi that's how often it cycles but we also know that we can adjust that period or give it a horizontal stretch or compression by dividing by whatever that number is now if that's one then our period is just pi so here's what i'm going to teach you with tangent it's very important to understand that the period of tangent is pi but it's centered around zero or centered around that y axis so if that's the center of the period well then how can we put a period of pi well we don't want to go all the way over to pi now think about that think about why that is if we went all the way to the right pi and all the way to the left pi that would be two periods it'd be two pi from the very far left to the very far right that's a problem so here's how i always approach doing the period of tangent i start at zero if we do not have a phase shift if we're not shifting left or right i start at zero and i take that whatever this is and i divide it by two that's going to give me the the interval to the right and then negative gives me the integral integral interval to the left so i'm going to take a look at that and go okay pi pi divided by 2 is pi over 2. that's going to be our right most end of our period if you will now what's nice about this is wherever we have that zero if we shift it then where we shift it acts like a zero that's fine wherever we have that that is the center of our period for tangent which means you have this sort of a symmetry as far as your period is concerned so if we're pi over 2 to the right and this is the center pi over 2 to the left has to be the left hand side of that particular period we just make it negative now so that we've determined we have no vertical shift we have this period of pi think about it from negative pi over two to positive pi over two you have to be thinking yes so that is a period of pi there's half a pi to here half a pi there we all know one half of pi plus another half pi that full pie it's delicious so that's that's our that's our period for this now what happens next use some of the key features that we understand about tangent understanding that at the ends of your period you're going to have a vertical asymptote so we're going to put that up there we're going to put vertical asymptote at the ends of our periods right here at negative pi over 2 and right here at pi over 2 we're also going to put an x-intercept right at the center in this case right at the origin so we've done that we have our vertical asymptotes at the ends of our period we have the x-intercept at the center of our period that's great but we also have some important features at the quarters of our period so what we're going to do is take this which is nice that it has zero and figure out what this is so typically what happens is you need to go halfway between zero and that if it's zero that's very convenient if it's not zero you might have to do a little math there but figure out in this case it's just pi over four how you can always do it is add these up and divide by two that will average them or find the middle find the mean of that and so that's going to be pi over four and of course the same thing native power four symmetry's great force on the period so some important things are going to happen uh with tangent at the quarters and this is what i what i always do i always do the vertical shift i always find my period second i always write it out there make sure my my asymptotes are the ends my x-intercepts at the center i find my quarters first my first quarter second quarter is the middle and then the third quarter is is right before the end of that period this is what's going to give me my what i call key points so here's how key points work take your first quarter and your third quarter remember that tangent climbs cotangent falls tangent naturally climbs so you're gonna have a negative one and a positive one that's where we get our key points from so you'll notice in the last video i really didn't give you like the negative pi over four power four specifically i just said hey at the first quarter you're going to have negative one at the third quarter you're gonna have positive one now here's why we do that whatever our coefficient of our function is that number right there it's going to affect your key points so the whole thing that we go through with tangent and later cotangent is find your vertical shift put it on your graph find your period put it on your graph find the n's vertical asymptotes center x intercept quarters and create for yourself your original key points first quarter negative one third quarter positive one and then if you have anything being multiplied right here that is going to multiply those two key points it's going to do a vertical stretch or compression depending on whether that number is larger than one or smaller than one it can also reflect it if it's negative and so we check it check that out so for us because that's three we're going to multiply this by three not the input you can't change that period that would have happened here inside of some parentheses that's not the idea this is affecting the output look at why that would happen you plug in a number tangent does something and it says hey take the output output and multiply it by three output multiplied by three is going to stretch that out i had to adjust my graph a little bit but here we go so if we're going to put these now adjusted or stretched out key points negative pi over 4 comma negative 3 that's here and positive 4 positive pi over 4 comma positive 3. and so this is going to be a very skinny looking graph so this goes all the way from negative infinity to positive infinity on that y-axis but it's going to be stretched out so it's going to appear more horizontally narrow and that's a decent picture of what tangent looks like and what we'd say is the first period so negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. this has just been stretched out a little bit vertically and i hope that makes sense to you i hope you're seeing the idea hope i really hope you're seeing this similar similarity with sine and cosine that we've gone through the same steps now oftentimes you'll have to give yourself another cycle so take this and expand it now how we do that just take and add your period whatever you have here add it to the end or subtract it from the end of your period so pi over 2 plus pi well pi over 2 plus 2 pi over 2 that'd be 1 pi is 3 pi over 2. that's going to give us another end of a different period so another period of this is this plus pi is pi over 2 pi over 2 plus pi is 3 pi over 2. in the center of that is just pi now that should make sense the center here is zero zero plus pi is pi and gives me another center of a different period and so we can again draw another vertical asymptote we can find our quarters we can put an x-intercept at the center of that period so i've gone ahead and i've done that i've put my vertical asymptote i've put my x-intercept at the center of that different period i've also taken and found my quarters three pi over four and five pi over four how do you how do you do that there's a couple ways you can number one you could average one pi and three pi over two you could do that if you want to you could also take your first period and just add pi so pi over four plus pi is five pi over four and negative power four plus pi is three pi over four um i do it with fractions i just take a listen and then i think about this like one-fourth so one-fourth plus one whole pie that'd be four fourths well that's five fourths or five pi over four same thing with this and now because we understand not just this key point idea but what this really represents yeah that says negative pi over four but what it really stands for is the first quarter of your period comma negative three okay so here's the first quarter of my period comma negative three and this stands for the set the third quarter of my period so first second third the third quarter of my period comma positive three so we just go ahead and put that again and we get hopefully i drew a little bit funny but we get the same exact look it's just going to repeat just like sine does just like cosine does it's just that here we have some vertical asymptotes that make us obey them so we have to be the same looking graph every single cycle and i hope that makes sense i hope that you understand the technique of graphing that i've given you i've built this off of the college algebra and even the intermediate algebra i teach it all the same exact way how you graph because it really doesn't have to change so that's what i would like you to do hopefully it makes sense on what we're talking about for the key points like hey that's first quarter i don't really care if it's negative pi over four it's the first quarter of whatever period it is if we understand that tangent's period centers on zero or where we shift that to or from that that's going to help us out a lot it's pi for tangent and then we adjust that and center it on 0. cotangent's a bit different we'll see that in a couple more examples right now let's go ahead and let's look at at this one it's going to have a vertical shift to it so now that we have y equals negative two tangent three x plus one maybe you can start identifying what's going to happen here we should we should be at that point we should understand that that plus one that's going to be a vertical shift up one we should understand that that three is going to start cutting the period what's it mean that means it's going to make it horizontally compressed that 3 takes that number and divides it that's what's going to happen it's going to be pi over 3. centered at 0 means pi over 6 and negative pi over 6 we'll get to that in a second but that's going to shorten this period what that means is going to vertically compress oh sorry horizontally compress this graph what's that negative 2 do that negative 2 is going to reflect this and vertically stretch it so there's four transformations here up one horizontally compressed vertically stretched and then reflected i hope you're seeing that let's go ahead and let's do it now so the first thing that we deal with with pretty much any sort of our transformations is a vertical shift since that says plus one this is a vertical shift up one we're going to do that the other thing that we're going to do is take a look at our period tangent and cotangent are the only two trig functions that have a period of just pi and not 2 pi and so we're going to take a look at that and go okay if our period is just pi we're going to take and divide whatever that pi is whatever the period is by whatever that number is that's 3. so what this does is take your period and make it smaller that squishes your graph that's called a horizontal compression so here's what this means our period is now pi over 3. what's pi over 3 do pi over 3 is is the period of tangent in this this particular function but it's centered at zero so this goes back to exactly what i was talking about here we are about to put our period on the graph but remember tangent centers at zero so what do we do we said if this period centers a zero there's gonna be pi over two half of this to the right and negative pi over two half of this to the left let's do the same thing let's say this is pi over three half of it's going to be to the right of zero let's see pi over 3 divided by 2 is pi over 6. how do we do that if you want to ever divide a number by 2 you can multiply the denominator by 2 and do the same thing so pi over 3 divided by 2 is the same thing as pi over 3 times 2 that's pi over 6. so this period is going to go from negative pi over 6 to 0 to positive pi over 6 that's going to be that interval that's going to make sense it's going to make sense that pi over 3 being split right down the middle right at 0 is going to be negative pi over 3 being split down the middle is going to be negative pi over 6 to positive pi over 6. let's put that i'm going to put it in two places and you can you can actually do it right now you can always find distance between two numbers by by subtracting them so pi over six minus negative pi over six let's see minus negative is adding that's two pi over six or pi over three this has a period of pi over three just like we want it's centered at zero just like we said it does tangent has zero at the center of that period and that's exactly what we have we have not shifted this left to right this is not does not have a phase shift is what that's called so that's great you'll also notice that i put the period on my x-axis and where i shifted this so this is going to act like our x-axis as far as our key points are our as far as our key points are regarded this is going to act like that we're going to do everything from there even though it's not really there it ships the whole graph up it's a nice graphic organizer to say this is where all of our stuff is really so we've done that and now we've got to find the quarter of our period so i've done find the shipped up we got it find the period we have it center it at zero for tangent no problem half to the right half to the left we got that pi over three divided by two is five over six and now we find the quarters so the quarters of the period say find out what this distance is and divide it by two you can always do that by averaging that if you want to so pi over six plus zero is pi over six divided by two is pi over 12. now we're going to take care of the key features that tangent has at the ends of the period because you've already identified i've talked about that we're going to put a vertical asymptote at the center of the period we're going to put an x-intercept but please keep in mind that x-intercept is based on where this is shifted to so that's why we put that that horizontal dot line is say hey this thing's acting like our x-intercept we're gonna put our x-intercept there yeah i know it's not on the x-axis but because we shifted it that x-intercept even though it's not one really gets shifted with it so now we've got our vertical asymptotes at the ends of our period we know that tangent has an x-intercept at the center but because we shifted it this acts like our x-intercept we think x-axis right here even though i know it's not really there but it helps us out a great graphic organizer now that we've done that now that we've identified the period we put it on this vertically shifted graph up one unit we have our asymptotes at the ends we have our x-intercept of the center we now deal with our key points so remember tangent has first quarter negative one third quarter positive one all we have to do is know the quarters we've already done that that's exactly what that tells you so because our first quarter of our period is negative pi over 12 and our third quarter is positive pi over 12 these are our let's call them original key points okay what happens to them they get manipulated they can change because we have that negative 2. that negative 2 is a factor factors multiply stuff what do they multiply they multiply the outputs and so if we have our first quarter and third quarter we know that tangent normally does first quarter one and third sorry first quarter negative one and third quarter positive one now we're going to stretch these and reflect it that negative two does both of those jobs for us so we multiply the output by that and that gives us our new key points i know there's a lot going on here i'm not really taking it easy on some of these graphs and making sure that we really understand all about it and trig functions can be a bit more difficult because we're not as familiar with them but i really hope that you're seeing this is the same exact process i've been teaching for a long time it's deal with your vertical shift show it recognize what type of a function it is and show some key features of it like hey vertical asymptotes happen at the ends of period x-intercept in the center understand the key points about it first quarter negative one third quarter positive one and understand what this does that factor multiplies outputs so now we have hey this is going to be at the first quarter i don't care if it's negative pi over 12 i care that that's the first quarter mark of my period it's gonna be first quarter positive two all right it's it's based on where we shifted to though isn't it because we shifted that up it's based on that this is kind of like our baseline our benchmark right here that's where we're at our key points are in relation to that so we treat this like a new axis it's not really there we get it we understand the idea behind it so first quarter comma positive two third quarter common negative two and if we do that we have first quarter positive two third quarter negative two so when we show these shifts up and down or left and right with the phase shift we base our key points on on that new sort of x and y axis yeah it's not really there it's just a really convenient way to deal with it and so that's what we're going to do so the true points are negative pi over 2 comma 3 and positive pi over 2 pi over 12 sorry comma negative 1. those are the real points we're just using this to get a good graph and it's very effective so now we're going to graph it and that behaves exactly how we thought it would shift it up shortened this way and then reflected and stretched and that's exactly the graph that we get if you had to do another cycle then we're going to add whatever this period is to it remember we're not adding pi right now we're adding whatever this period is this is the period of this particular function it was based on pi but we divided it by 3. so we take pi over 6 and we would add pi over 3. let's see pi over 6 plus pi over 3 pi over 6 plus pi over 3 that's like 2 pi over 6 that'd be 3 pi over 6 that's me pi over 2. i hope that makes sense i hope that you're seeing that and that you also understand that zero plus whatever that is is gonna be pi over three so zero plus pi over three that should give you another center of your period and that's exactly what that does so we draw a vertical asymptote we add pi to all of these quarters and we get exactly the same look i'm going to show you right now but i'm going to not go through it very slowly i'm going to just kind of show you the graph honestly hardest part for students is usually dealing with these fractions how i do it i just start adding whatever that is so negative pi over 12 plus pi over 3 that's that's 3 pi over 12 or pi over 4 and then 1 pi over 12 plus pi over 3 that's going to be 5 pi over 12 use your calculator use your fraction on your calculator usually works pretty well now what's important about it well it's important to understand that stands for now your first quarter and third quarter we already know that we know that this is first quarter two so first quarter from here from where we shifted this first quarter positive two third quarter negative two from here that's one two and we should get just a repeat of that same graph i hope it's making sense i'm hoping i'm explaining it to you in a way that you understand i'm really hoping that you understand that these key points come from your quarters for tangent and for cotangent they're first quarter and your third chord and we manipulate them by multiplying that number for your output also base it on where you shifted to that's important that's why we do this in certain order we do our vertical first then we put our period then we find the center and the quarters those quarters give you key points that's at least for tangent cotangent the final thing is to reiterate that tangent is centered around zero unless you have a phase shift if you do you set it around where you shift it to but it does center at zero so take whatever this is divide by two and go positive and negative um what we're going to do now is come back and look at cotangent just a couple examples there and then we're going to be done all right let's get after it so we have cotangent three cotangent one half x minus two we're going to go very quickly through these the only differences between this and tangent is that it's going to be it looks looks like a reflective graph it's a reciprocal but it's going to be downward rather than upward climbing so it's going to be a completely decreasing graph the period is still pi but it starts at zero it's not centered at zero that makes it actually a little bit easier on a lot of a lot of things you're going to do other than that the because we have this downward this decreasing graph our key points are a little different our key points are not first quarter negative one it's first quarter positive one and third quarter negative one and so that's going to give it its decreasing look let's get right into it the first thing we do with our graphs is we find out whether we have a vertical shift or not that's exactly what that says we have a vertical shift of down two after we deal with that we talk about the period cotangent and tangent both have a period of pi how we adjust that how we stretch that or compress that is based on whatever that number is so we take that period we divide by whatever the coefficient of x is in this case we divide by one-half wait a minute dividing by one-half is effectively multiplying by two that's going to give us a period of 2 pi what that's done is stretch this graph out horizontally this is a horizontal stretch not a horizontal compression this is going to make this a little bit wider twice as wide and we're going to go ahead and put that on our graph so we're going to go from 0 to 2 pi remember while tangent centered at 0 cotangent does not tangent we would have done that so we said okay pi to the right pi to the left cotangent starts at zero and just goes whatever that period is very much like sine and cosine it's a little bit easier so we've gone ahead and said hey if cotangent has a period of in this case two pi for this particular function then that has to start at zero so zero plus two pi is two pi this is the start and the end of the first period if we had to do another cycle which i'm not going to show you you'd go now to four pi you'd add another two pi very similar sine and cosine so we found the ends of our period zero and two pi cotangent starts at zero the center is pi and now we'll find the quarters so we have now our ends of our periods of zero and two pi we got the center at pi and we have our quarters at pi over two and three pi over two and we're going to put the important features on there our vertical asymptotes which i've shown you happen at the end so 0 and a 2 pi if we had gone another cycle it'd be at 4 pi our x-intercepts happen at the centers just like for tangent the only difference is is that well cotangent is the reciprocal cotangent starts at zero is not centered at zero and we do a negative one positive one reverse for our key points so our x-intercept is still the center of the period remember the center of the period is now at pi and we're going to put it where we shifted this now that we have our first and our third quarters that's what's going to give us our key points so it was really important for us to realize that with with our key points tangent is negative one and one cotangent is one and negative one at the quarters at the first quarter and the third quarter respectively so for us our first quarter is pi over two cotangent is going to put pi over 2 comma 1. that would be the original point on a graph with this particular period with cotangent now we are going to manipulate that we're going to affect that with a 3 it's going to be a multiplier for us but that's how we start so we have went down one we found our period of two pi it's not centered at zero it starts at zero we found the center and our first and third quarters we know that our x-intercepts are the center but it's where we shifted this to this acts like your x-axis our key points are the first quarter but this is our first quarter and our third quarter this is our third quarter and it's going to be negative one and positive one reversed from tangent so basically first quarter positive one and third quarter negative one that's what we have here now what happens is that that number right there that factor affects your outputs we're going to allow that to happen so there's no reflection here really there's only three transformations there was a down two there is a taking your horizontal taking your function horizontally stretching it taking your period and growing it and then vertically stretching this so we have our key points at first quarter one third quarter negative one that's exactly what cotangent says for us and we're going to stretch that by a factor of three literally a factor of three and since we've shown those those um those key points here are first and third quarter if we base it on where we shifted this acts like our x-axis this would be first quarter comma three so one two three and third quarter comma negative three right about there and you can see you can see that this is stretched out horizontally that's what that period is twice as big as a normal period for cotangent it's not centered at zero starts at zero and now we have our key points laid out first quarter comma positive 3 because we stretched it and third quarter comma negative 3 because we stretched it there's not a reflection there's only three transformations now we're going to graph it if you had to do another cycle then you would take and add another period to that so add 2 pi to it you get 4 pi in the center would be 3 pi and you find your quarters very easily on that and you get exactly the same look yeah i hope it's making sense i hope that you really seen the idea of basing everything on where you shifted it and the just the essential nature of finding your period first we really really really have to get that because if you have that and you understand where it starts all of them start at zero except for tangent which is centered at zero if you understand where it starts and where it stops you can find your center and your quarters and everything happens with those our key points are very valuable we just have to manipulate them if you have a coefficient out front so i hope it's making sense let's do one more all right if you want to try it on your own you really should we're going to get right into it we're going to take a look at this and first thing we're going to identify is what function we have and what's happening to it so let's see cotangent cotangent has a certain set of rules that we have to follow like a period of pi not centered at zero but starts at zero we're going to have vertical asymptotes at the end of the period x intercept of the center first quarter positive second quarter negative unless we reflect it or stretch it or something so we identify what function we have maybe have a picture of your head then we talk take a look at if we have a vertical shift this has a vertical shift of up one we're going to write that down and then we're going to show it then we take our period pi and divide by whatever that coefficient is now if it's a little awkward like pi over four it actually becomes a little easier um this is this is going to cancel your pies out so pi divided by pi over four how many times is pi over four fit into pi four times the pi's cancel you basically get one divided by one fourth which is four your period here is four so that's a little bit larger not a lot larger but a little bit larger than the normal period of pi so this is a horizontal stretch just a little bit remember pi is 3.14 and ish and so if this is is a little bit bigger than that so 4 is bigger than 3.14 it's a it's a slight horizontal stretch it's important to know that it's not a compression it's a horizontal stretch it'll make the graph a little wider so we said up one we got it we took our period tangent and and cotangent have the same period it's pi it's just centered differently and we divide by that number we get four we're going to put that on our graph right now so with a period of four remember cotangent starts at zero it's not centered cotangent's period starts at zero zero plus four is four the center is 2 the quarters are 1 and 3. that's kind of nice kind of nice when you have a pi in there it makes it easier then what we're going to do is we're going to put our key features vertical asymptotes at the end x-intercept in the center of course the x-intercept goes where we shifted this to this acts like your x-axis for all of our key points for all of our x-intercepts so vertical asymptotes great at the at the at the start and the stop of our period we're going to put our x-intercept at the center but we shifted that so that acts like your x-intercept because it acts like your x-axis yes the point is not two comma zero it's two comma one because you shifted up one that's okay it's just to get the graph now that we have that we deal with our key points our key points are always given by the quarters for tangent and cotangent which is why we want to do our period first because it's nice to fill that out you do the ends do the center do your quarters then those quarters act as your key points so for cotangent we have first quarter positive one and third quarter negative one that's exactly what we have here first quarter is one common positive one third quarter is three comma negative one we're just going to affect it by whatever this number is in this case negative one that factor multiplies your outputs just your outputs though so 1 comma negative 1 sure three comma negative one so this has taken the first quarter comma positive one and reflected it so first quarter positive one would have been here we reflect it now we're down here remember it's all based on where you shifted to this acts like your x axis so first quarter negative one third quarter positive one and these are the three transformations that we have we had a vertical shift up one no problem we have this slight horizontal stretch it's going to make it a little wider and we have this reflection so it's going to end up looking a lot like tangent but the period is not centered at zero it starts at zero if you had to draw another cycle what would you do well you'd take that and add it again you'd have eight in the middle would be six you'd have five and seven as your quarters you'd have the same exact key points for your first and third quarters and you graph the same thing again and again and again and that would repeat every 4 as a matter of fact because that here for this particular function is your period i hope it's making sense i hope that you're really seeing that the necessity of identifying the function and getting the key features so all we're going to do with this stuff is identify any vertical shift no problem take care of the period for sine and cosine secant and cosecant the periods two pi for tangent and cotangent periods pi be very careful with tangent the period centers at zero all the rest of them start at zero tangents kind of the oddball there so take your period and go to the right and left of zero by half for tangent cotangent's easier just add it to zero and then then we find out the center then we find out the quarters for tangent and cotangent make sure you have the vertical asymptotes of n x-intercept at the center based on where we shift to acting like your new x-axis our key points happen at the quarters we adjust them by maybe having to multiply but if we base it all on treating this like an x axis here that shifted version we get very nice graphs for very little work for the last time i hope that you understand that yes the point is not really three comma one it's three comma two because of that shift this just acts like your x-intercept to give you a great picture i really hope it's making sense i hope you enjoyed the technique actually um i've seen it work very well for a lot of students because it it tends to click and they go oh yeah that makes sense i'm just following my process it's not magic it's just finding out my period my center my quarters and using the features of these graphs that you understand hope makes sense we're going to come back with the graphs of secant and cosecant next time have a great day you 

Transcript for: How to Graph Cosecant and Secant (Precalculus - Trigonometry 15)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the graphs of secant and cosecant and it's going to be pretty fast because we're going to relate them back to sine and cosine so that they're just reciprocals we're going to use the fact that they're reciprocals and the graphs are based on sine and cosine for cosecant and secant respectively so we're going to take a look at that and it should be pretty straightforward so let's take a look first at cosecant if cosecant is the reciprocal of sine so cosecant x is the reciprocal of sine of x we can base the graph of cosecant on the graph of sine in fact there's a lot of very interesting things that happen and when we start graphing with transformations what i typically do is i'll graph the sine version of that function and then just draw cosecant right on top of it or for secant i'll graph cosine and then i'll graph secant right on top of that so because they're so strongly related because they're reciprocal functions we can use sine and cosine as very nice tools to graph cosecant and secant so let's take a look at sine if sine of x is this nice curve that repeats every two pi so we have two periods of sine right here shown in a dotted line so we don't get confused what we're actually doing here's what's going to happen with cosecant because cosecant is the reciprocal let's take a look at some of the reciprocals of the values that are on the sine of x function firstly let's look at all the local maxima and minimum well what we remember is that sine has peaks at positive one and sort of valleys at negative one well if we take a look at the point pi over two comma one which is on the graph of sine well the reciprocal of 1 is still 1. because cosecant is the reciprocal of sine since sine of pi over 2 is 1 cosecant of pi over 2 is also 1. and so we have a point there the same thing is going to happen at negative 3 pi over 2 so sine of negative 3 pi over 2 that's positive 1. so cosecant of negative 3 pi over 2 is also positive 1 the the reciprocal of positive 1 is positive 1. the reciprocal of negative 1 is also negative 1. and so we're going to have those points so at negative pi over 2 sine of negative pi over 2 is negative 1. cosecant of negative pi over two is also negative one the reciprocal of negative one is negative one and that happens here and here now the interesting things happen at the zeros so where sine of x equals zero what's the reciprocal of zero well this would be zero over some sort of a constant usually it's zero over one if i reciprocate that that's one over zero and so here's what this means this is one of our key features we're going to write down in a minute is that we're going to have vertical asymptotes everywhere we had an x-intercept for sine so if we have an x-intercept at zero hey sine of zero was zero over one cosecant of zero is one over zero and we're gonna have a vertical asymptote here and at pi and at two pi and at negative pi and at negative two pi every place where we have an x-intercept for sine we're gonna have something that's undefined a vertical asymptote for cosecant so if we're going to base this cosecant x off of sine of x well then we have sine of x we said yep reciprocate and we still have 1 negative 1 negative 1 1. reciprocate our x-intercepts of 0 over 1 we get 1 over zero that's undefined that's vertical asymptotes and there's only one other real value that we we kind of need um that would be this if you have sine of pi over six sine of pi over six is one half remember cosecant is the reciprocal so sine of pi over six is one half cosecant of pi over six is two over one well what that means is that where sine does this cosecant does this the reciprocal is the the in the um the flipping of that fraction so we're going to get everything that's above one and below negative one there's not going to be anything between negative one and one on the graph of cosecant x so sine of pi over six is one half therefore cosecant of pi over six is two and due to the nice symmetry that we get we can kind of extrapolate from this so i didn't put a lot of the pi over 6 and 5 pi over 6 and things like that just because well we kind of know what sine looks like and if we have that one point use some symmetry here on all of our our quarters of our half of our periods um then we can get a really nice graph so this is really what we do for sine and cosine changing into cosecant secant we graph sine we change it into cosecant by just reciprocating points we graph cosine we reciprocate our points we get seeking out of it that's how i'm going to do all of our transformations too is just through this process so let's finish up our graph they're not quite parabolas but they almost look like it it's a really weird graph right i mean sine has is this nice smooth curve has no discontinuity so domain is all real numbers you plug in anything you only get out values between negative one and one because cosecant is the reciprocal we actually can't get out anything between negative one and one negative one is the let's call it um smallest negative value we get and positive one is the smallest positive value that we get in terms of absolute value one is the smallest value that we get so we get all the way down to negative infinity all the way up to positive infinity it's a really look it looks like a disjointed graph i hope it makes sense where it comes from it looks kind of funny because we have to obey our vertical asymptotes our reciprocals told us that we climb if these numbers on sine are between zero and one for this particular portion of our x-axis well then when i reciprocate that i get values larger than one if i reciprocate something very close to zero i'm going to get something very close to infinity and that's what's happening so this is the look the purple is the look for cosecant x it's based on sine of x now let's write a couple things about it firstly the domain because our x-intercepts of sine cause vertical asymptotes for cosecant we're going to have domain problems a vertical asymptote every place we had an x-intercept for sine well that was at 0 and pi and 2 pi and 0 plus k pi i hope you remember that that's what we had for x intercepts well now that's going to cause vertical asymptotes for us and so our domain says we can't have 0 or any multiple of pi from zero that's what that says we can't have zero that's a vertical asymptote it used to be an x-intercept for sine now we reciprocate we get a vertical asymptote zero or plus one pi or plus two pi or minus one pi or minus two pi all of those are vertical asymptotes because they came from x-intercepts that should make sense now our range we actually cannot get anything between negative one and one we get above one and we get below negative one and how we write that for our range is negative infinity to negative one we actually do get negative one there is a point there and then one to infinity we actually do get one and everything above that and so that's our that's our range now the period the period is the same as sine so the period is 2 pi you can see that it repeats here's two pi another two pi and it repeats every single two pi so if we had to draw several cycles we would just go four pi and then six pi and then eight pi and we draw the same exact thing very similar to sine in fact i always draw sine first before i draw cosecant and finally the key features of this graph just remember that we get vertical asymptotes every place that we had x-intercepts on sine the reason why i'm saying it that way is because i'm going to encourage you to draw the sine function first for all of our transformations that we're going to do for cosecant draw the sine function first like a dotted line like i've done done draw your vertical asymptotes on x-intercepts and then draw cosecant it's much easier than trying to memorize uh what that that looks like if you have it great but this is a tool to get you to memorize it so that's the idea and that's really it cosecant is the reciprocal of sine we let's go on to secant x so because secant x is the reciprocal of cosine x we're going to base it on cosine that's what i've done for you right here i have this nice dotted line that shows two periods of cosine here's negative two pi zero zero two pi that's two periods we're gonna do exactly the same thing that we did for for cosecant now i hope you remember this i hope that you remember that cosine is like a shifted version of sine it's a phase shift well what that means is that secant should be a phase shift or a shifted version of cosecant and so it that bears out and so we're going to do something very very quick very very similar to what we've done firstly remember that secant is the reciprocal of cosine so if i have 1 and negative 1 negative 1 1 1 well the reciprocal of 1 is still 1 so i'm still going to have points there the reciprocal of negative 1 is still negative i'm going to have points there as well remember cosine of pi over two was zero over one that gave us zero well that means secant is going to be the reciprocal so the secant of pi over 2 is 1 over 0. that's now undefined so we run in the same situation we ran into here that x-intercepts on sine cause vertical asymptotes on cosecant x-intercepts on cosine do the same thing for secant so we're going to have a vertical asymptote at every x intercept for cosine now it still looked really familiar because we just did it but we're going to do something very similar with pi over 3 that we did with pi over 6 cosine of pi over 3 is one-half it's right there so that means secant of pi over three is the reciprocal of one-half or two and due to some symmetry hey it is an even function and using that fact we can get a very similar graph to cosecant that's about how secant x looks it's just the reciprocal of cosine i hope it makes sense i hope that you're seeing where these are coming from this is how i go ahead and graph pretty much all my transformations with cosecant and secant i just grab sine or cosine and then reciprocate it so show these almost parabola like look at things um from the fact that we're reciprocating we know that it's above one or below negative one here the same thing our range is either below negative one or above positive one we get the same exact range here our domain is it's shifted it is shifted notice that this is a shifted over version of this it's a phase shift that's all it is but what our our domain is going to be is every place where we had an x intercept on cosine we now got a vertical asymptote for secant that happens at pi over 2 plus k pi so plus pi over 2 plus pi would be here pi over 2 minus pi minus another pi we're going to get a vertical asymptote at all those things so let's write that out our domain says yeah because it's based on cosine and because x intercepts happened at pi over 2 and every multi plus every multiple of pi we say that x cannot equal pi over 2 plus any multiple of pi that's going to give us some problems it's going to give us x intercepts for c for cosine and therefore vertical asymptotes for secant our range is the same thing that we got for cosecant x and so is our period because this is based on cosine a period of 2 pi is the same for both uh cosec cosecant sine secant and and cosine so they all have the same period there now it looks a little funny because the period here cuts our graph right in half so that's a little bit awkward a lot of times we're going to kind of think of this as one part one period especially when we have actually for inverses we think about a little bit differently we have to cut it so it's one to one but we can sort of alter where we think of that starting or stopping so anyhow our period is two pi and the key the key idea here is that this is based on cosine what that means because it's a reciprocal function is that where we had x-intercepts on cosine we're now going to have vertical asymptotes and that's really about it so what i'm going to show you now is just two examples of how we can do some transformations with cosecant x and with secant x and i'm going to base them on sine and cosine all right let's do an example about a transformation we'll have one more after this one let's take a look at four secant one half x here's the first thing that i do because i'm so very comfortable with cosine and sine what i do is i graph this if i pretend i pretend that that is the result whatever the reciprocal function is i pretend that that is cosine for just a second i graph a dotted line version of cosine and then i reciprocate it for me that's a lot easier than actually trying to remember what secant looks like and where that period is in my head that's quite hard to do or at least it used to be and so this is the way that i practice doing that and so what i'm going to do right now i'm going to pretend that that's for cosine one-half x now it doesn't help if you can't remember that secant is the reciprocal of cosine and not sine so that is a problem um i've seen a lot of students forget and do cosecant is the reciprocal of cosine because they both have co in it it's not it's opposite so the reciprocal of secant is cosine the reciprocal of cosine is secant and so i'm going to draw i'm going to draw four cosine one half x because secant is the reciprocal it's going to work just fine for us we're going to graph a dotted line version between negative 4 and 4 in this particular case we'll see that with the transformation and so what i've done is really made this like several videos ago i'm just going to do this as far as transformations are concerned i'm going to do all the transformations on that particular function and then just reciprocate it's going to be very easy so let's take a look at it if i'm just going to graph 4 cosine 1 half x i'm going to first look for a vertical shift now we don't have any but that's what we would do first hopefully you remember that that we would shift up or down based on whatever's being added subtracted then i'd find my period and put it on my graph it's super convenient because the period for both secant and cosine or 2 pi remember that the period that we have to find for this particular function is 2 pi because that's both cosine and secant divided by whatever that is so dividing by one half is really multiplying by two this is going to give us four pi i stop right there and i start putting this on my graph you're also going to notice that i go a little bit too i go at least a full period to the right and i go at least a half a period to the left and the reason is is because especially with secant this is going to cut part of that graph it's going to look a little funny so i always do half a period to the left as well try that hopefully it'll benefit you as well so i'm going to do 4 pi so four pi half of that's two pi then we have our first quarter pi and our third quarter three pi and i've done negative pi and negative two pi this is half a period to the left and that's what i want i want to show that so i get a complete graph out of this i don't want to start cutting it so try that on your own too make sure you do at least a full period to the right and half a period to the left over the over the y axis now we're going to have to deal with our key points so remember that our key points for cosine are we have x-intercepts at the quarters so first quarter and third quarter give x-intercepts remember that with cosine we have the start of the period comma one at the middle we have negative one at the end we have positive one so those give us our three key points for cosine i really hope you remember that i hope that you remember with cosine because i'm i mean i really do need you to know that um because if we're going to basis on cosine that we really need to understand that's why we did the video that first so cosine says yeah if you have one period then you're going to put that into four four quarters so the the start and the end the midpoint and then the two quarters first and third so with cosine you start with a period at one and then you go first quarter zero second quarter that's right in the middle negative one third quarter zero fourth quarter at positive one that's what we have we have start at zero one then the first quarter we have an x intercept great at the second quarter or right in the middle we have negative one we're going to be down here at the third quarter we have an x-intercept and the fourth quarter the very end of it we're going to have positive one again now because we have this this factor because that four yeah we're going to affect our key points but i hope that you're seeing what's based on all cosine says is yeah take your your start your middle and your end those are your key points now multiply 1 and negative 1 by that 4. and what this is done is this is going to vertically stretch this graph of cosine it's also going to because we're going to reciprocate it vertically stretch the graph of secant this also is taking and horizontally stretching out our period into four pi it's twice as long as normal and so it's going to make it really wide so a stretched out and stretched out graph so we're gonna we're gonna plot that right now again with cosine you really need to know that the x-intercepts happen the quarters and the peaks and the valleys happen at this at the center and at the ends and that's how what our key points do because we're basing this on a key point idea because we have that just multiply whatever your output factor is that that factor times your outputs and we have that so let's do 0 4 2 pi comma negative 4 and 4 pi comma positive four we'll also get negative 2 pi comma negative 4 because of that idea that would be the center of a period we're going to get the same exact key point out of that and now we graph it now i'm going to use the dotted line because i don't want to confuse this with the graph we're trying to get she's going to do this now that we have that graph of cosine it's really easy to do the graph of secant all we need to understand is that because this is a reciprocal vertical asymptotes are going to occur at our x-intercepts just like that now all we have to do is remember that secant is the reciprocal so we still have these points on secant let's just graph above and below as the case may be and we get a very nice graph of 4 secant one-half x it has the same period it's going to have the vertical asymptotes where x-intercepts were on cosine of the same type of function we just we just base it on that cosine this is what i've found is the easiest i hope it works for you i hope you're seeing the interplay and it's a really good tool it's really good for remembering that secant is based on cosine it'll help you to remember that and it'll help you to graph with a lot of transformations especially like phase shifts and things like that so hopefully technique works for you i'm going to come back with one more okay last one we're going to take a look at negative 2 cosecant 2 pi over 3 x minus 2. that's a lot going on the first thing i'm going to do is think about the reciprocal function the reciprocal function is sine and so i'm going to think of this as sine now with that shift with that that shift in my head of okay i'm dealing with sign now i'm going to go through the entire process with sine and just draw cosecant above and below it not a big deal so this has a vertical shift of down 2. i'm going to write that i'm going to show that then i'm going to find the period the period for sine and cosecant is both 2 pi so we're going to take 2 pi and divide by 2 pi over 3. so two pi divided by two pi over three the two pi's are gonna cancel you get one divided by one third that's three so i'm going to show that and just for fun i did two periods here so i did two cycles of this so remember our period is three this would be one cycle two cycles three cycles so i did i have three periods of this sine function right now then what i do is i find my key points remember that with sine our x-intercepts happen at the beginning middle and end of each period so we have x-intercept here and here and here that's our beginning middle and end of that first period remember the period is three not six and then we're going to have key points at our quarters so positive one and negative one at the quarters so we'd have originally what we would do here is we would have the first quarter positive one third quarter negative one and so we've shown that we figured out our period first that we would know our quarters we have that down and now we're going to modify that that negative 2 is going to multiply the outputs so that's going to stretch this and reflect it so there are actually four transformations there's a shift down two there's a very slight horizontal sorry uh actually considerable horizontal compression from two pi into three and now we have a vertical stretch and a reflection so we're going to take that multiply the outputs of our key points let's go ahead and plot that now please remember with this key point technique it works from where you shifted to so rx intercepts yeah they're really not x-intercepts they're they're on this shifted version that's what we do it's just a nice graphic organizer i know it's not really there but it's a very good place to graph from you can see especially when we graph that cosecant function and now we're going to go ahead and say hey the first quarter was originally first quarter one it's been stretched and reflected now it's first quarter negative two but from here so first quarter negative two third quarter positive two we're going to graph that and we can mimic that in the next period and the previous period and get a very similar type of graph in both those those intervals so that is the graph of negative two sine two pi over three x minus two shifted down compressed horizontally stretched vertically and reflected i am just really hoping that you understand the interplay between the key points what that does and how it is done from where you shifted to this acts like your x-axis for this technique i've been teaching in a long time now that we've done that all we have to do is understand that where our x-intercepts are we're now going to have vertical asymptotes and i hope you see why i'm teaching you this technique with the key points interacting with that that sort of new xy x-axis is because the vertical asymptotes interact with that too so where our x-intercepts are here on this is where you're going to get those vertical asymptotes that's why this technique works so well so all we have to do now is understand that well cosecant is cosecant is the reciprocal of sine and so we graph from these local maxima and minimum and we get a fairly decent look for relatively little work if we really needed to we could erase the sine function here and get a nice cosecant function that that is the solid graph is this negative 2 cosecant 2 pi over 3x minus 2. i hope you like the technique um it's what i've come up with is the best way to graph it without really having to put in a lot of time because we're so good at sine and cosine just think about sine and cosine with your key points remember that you have to shift and treat that like your x-axis and then everything falls into place use your first quarter and your third quarter for sine as far as your key points and your ends and center for cosine and then reciprocate to get cosecant and secant for sine and cosine respectively one more thing please remember that because the range of cosecant and secant is negative v to negative one and one to infinity you will not get x intercepts on those graphs there aren't any x-intercepts on cosecant or secant until you start shifting them around like we've done here so i hope that makes sense to you as well they don't exist unless you start shifting it we have some here but that's just because we shifted down so far all right i hope that makes sense have a great day i'll see you for another video you 

Transcript for: How to Graph Phase Shifts of Trigonometric Functions (Precalculus - Trigonometry 16)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about how to phase shift some trigonometric functions and all that really means is a horizontal shift we've talked about it before and a lot of the college algebra graphing even the intermediate algebra graphing how to shift left and right and so that's what we're talking about with the phase shift i'm going to show you exactly how to work with it i'm going to refer back to how we graph some trig functions without that phase shift vertical shift and some key points that's about it so let's talk about what phase shifting does this is a horizontal shift along the x-axis and we're going to see right away that that shift is going to be located right next to the x variable which is really convenient so x-axis stuff is right next to the x variable which is nice now if you remember anything about the horizontal shifting the biggest thing that gets you to know these two pieces of information is number one it's opposite of the sign that you kind of want it to be so we oftentimes want to see plus as right and it's not adding next to your your uh your input adding next to your whatever your your input is like x is going to shift to the left on that input axis so adding next to x shifts to the left on x subtracting next to x shifts to the right on x so adding is left and subtracting is to the right so we got to make sure that we have that down the second thing it's right here but it's a big deal is that if you're going to identify a phase shift a horizontal shift the coefficient of your x has to be one so almost always we're going to be dividing first like forcing this sort of factor and i'm going to show you that in our very first example and so we have some steps um this kind of culminates all of our graphing and trig functions number one thing is we're going to look for whatever vertical shift we have after that we're going to identify a phase shift well a phase shift you're going to have to make sure the coefficient of x is 1 that's typically what i do first then we're going to take a look at our periods so that's another reason why we want to divide before we do that and lastly we'll use our key points and graph this so we're going to go right into an example right now remember the only thing that is new right now is dealing with a horizontal shift plus means left minus means right it's called a phase shift for a trigonometric function so let's take a look at that if we have 3 sine of 2x minus pi because because we need that coefficient of x to be 1 to identify not only our period but our phase shift this is the first thing i'm going to do i'm going to put in the proper form if you remember that with graphing the proper form is very important for us so we like these things in certain order any constants being added subtracted last it's a vertical shift likewise anything inside of our parentheses needs to have a coefficient of 1 next to our x we're going to force this to divide 2. so how do we factor out a 2 where do we put it number one thing don't factor out a 2 and put it there that is not at all what's happening so sine of this thing that's an angle and so we've got to leave that junk in those parentheses we're going to factor out 2 but it's going to remain inside that function we're basically just going to divide both terms by 2. and if we do that 2x divided by 2 is just x or 1x and that's what we want now we're not factoring a negative so our sine isn't going to change but notice that when you factor you have to divide all the terms upon what you're factoring so 2x divided by 2 is x but pi divided by 2 is pi over 2. and this helps us identify whatever that phase shift is this is the right form this is what we do first now we're going to do these steps when we graph it but we want to make sure it's of the right form this doesn't break our pattern here we always make sure our functions are the right form before you graph them and that's what we've done this is what we want we want a factor if you have one then a trig function then an x with a a coefficient of one if you factor you factor and lastly anything added subtracted which you don't have now we're ready to start identifying all of these transformations so we look for a vertical transformation first we don't have one a vertical shift would happen back there there's nothing added or subtracted to our outputs so we're not shifting up or down then we go ahead and look for a horizontal transformation so whether we're phase shifting left or right and this is where it's going to happen is right here with a coefficient of 1. that minus pi over 2 is a phase shift a horizontal shift to the get it to the right pi over 2. if you have to write it out you can write out that this is a phase shift right pi over two i typically just circle it and say right pi over two then what we do after we've identified any vertical shift any sort of a phase shift is we draw those on our graph and so we're going to take a moment to do that right now now we don't have this this sort of a vertical shift so i'm not going to be drawing this sort of new x y x axis but we do have phase shift so i'm going to redraw a version of a y axis upon which we're going to base all of our stuff our period and our key points now that we've shown where that phase shift is so this right pi over 2 and say okay this is where this is what we're going to treat our y-axis as our key points are going to relate to that remember that our key points are based on whatever trig function you have and for sine that means that we have x-intercepts at the ends and center of the period and key points at the quarters well that's now going to be based on this is the start of your period we've just phase shifted to the right you treat this like the origin right now and so we're going to deal with that so we said hey no vertical shift yes this horizontal phase shift to the right of pi over two now we're going to look at our period and base it on where our period starts now the shifted version of it so our period is always take a look at your trig function find the period sine says your period is 2 pi and divide by the coefficient of x well in this case we divided that out so you're going to divide by whatever that number is that 2 and this is going to have a period of pi now here's what to do with that because this period is pi but it no longer starts here it starts here this requires a little bit more work for us so we knew that everything but tangent had this period that we can consider starting from from zero and that was really really nice but now we've started to shift that so here's what you do with that when you find your period for whatever function you're trying to graph and you've already phase shifted which is why we do it in this order take this phase shift add your period to it and it will give you the end of your first period that's what this means so vertical shift we didn't have one phase shift we put in the right form we saw that we show it first so we shifted that over we found our period awesome now because we've already shown this phase shift you know that your period is take your phase shift whether you move right or left just add your period to it so i went to the right pi over 2 great oh that's not a problem now add your period of pi well that's going to be 3 pi over 2. so i've done that in general this is how you figure out your first period so you kind of these things are going to cycle of course so you figure out your first cycle here find your phase shift add your period now because we know how sine operates it doesn't change the fact this is a sign we need to find the middle and the quarters so we found the the beginning and the end here's the middle so the middle of this is going to be pi and now we have our quarters so i've shown that here i've shown that hey we'd start at pi over 2 we'd end at 3 pi over 2 that's one period the center is pi the quarters are 3 pi over 4 and 5 pi over 4. now it is very important to understand that this is based on sine so i am teaching this with this idea that you know what sine looks like this is not a vertical asymptote this doesn't have any vertical asymptotes it's still just a sine function just moved it it's not that bad and so a lot of things that pop in our mind about sine are are going to start happening right now such as with sine the x-intercepts happen at the ends and the center of our period well we have that now our ends are pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2 and the center is pi our quarters are where our peaks and valleys are our local maximum local minimum in fact with sine it's first quarter one and third quarter negative one so we're gonna you're we're gonna use that and then we're gonna alter that if we have a factor there remember what that can do that takes the outputs of our key points and multiplies them by whatever is right there so we can grow this shrink this and reflect this so first quarter comma one third quarter common negative one and then we can multiply that so these key points would be what they what they are after a phase shift in a vertical shift if we didn't have any sort of a vertical stretch here which we do that vertical stretch is going to multiply our outputs we get that right there should be the same number you don't change that and so we're going to plot that first quarter one it changed it grew it it did this vertical stretch into the first quarter comma three notice how i'm not saying three pi over four even though that is where this point is that's fine i'm treating this like just the first quarter of the period that it is this is how i usually graph these trig functions works out really nice as long as you remember what sine does x intercepts at the ends and center quarters of first quarter one third quarter negative one that's our key point then we can start modifying that and now we're ready to graph that's really all there is to it i think the steps kind of speak for themselves is this isn't that bad if you understand everything but the phase shift not a big deal the phase shift just puts one more aspect to it it does make working with your period harder because you are having to add this and then what i typically do is average these two to get my center average these two to get here and that's fine you just add them together divide by two your calculator would do it very nicely just don't use the pi on it do like one half three halves middle of that is one well it's one pie one half and one middle of that is three-fourths well two that's three pi over four uh one and three halves at the middle of that is five-fourths that's five pi over four and that that's how i typically do it now we're in the graph we have our points you've also noticed i've extended this so if we need to go more than one cycle to the left right that's totally fine so that's one cycle and we can continue this if we just added another pie we'd get a complete other cycle on that half of that cycle half of that period would be two pi where the first quarter would now be positive three and this would be a third quarter of a previous cycle and we could continue so i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing that the utility of these steps order is really important we want to make sure that we have that the order means in the proper form that your coefficient of x is one that's the only way to properly identify both your period and your phase shift so we do that first then we start our graphing steps vertical shift happens first we show it in the graph a horizontal shift or a phase shift happens second we show on the graph find your period add it always add it to your phase shift and that will create your first period for you after that identify what trig function will work with i'm only going to show you sine and cosine you can't do this with all the other trig functions but i think i've made it very clear that cosecant and secant are based on sine and cosine so it's not bad and then tangent and cotangent you can also phase shift so we deal with our period add that to it and then deal with your key points as the trig function that they relate to so we're going to come back we're going to do three more examples all right here we go so we have another graph that we're we're going to do right now uh 4 cosine of four x plus but three pi in parenthesis plus one before we do anything about graphing it's really important to get in the proper form so the order is important and the structure of it is important so the two cosine looks fine we want that first we want the plus one last it's great that's our vertical shift but inside the parentheses is very important we need the coefficient of x to be one that identifies both the period for us and any sort of phase shift that we have so we're going to factor out 4 right now 4x divided by 4 is x and three pi divided by four is just three pi over four and now i'm ready to go if we had to identify all of our transformations and write them out which i'm not going to show you that's not the purpose the purpose is to get these things graphed but if you had to write them out you would have a vertical shift of up one you'd have a phase shift of left three pi over four probably should put that in there why left well adding next your input is left on your graph so left on the input axis so adding 3 pi over 4 that's right next to the x coefficient x is 1 that's fantastic this is going to be left through pi over four we have a let's see taking our two pi and dividing by four that's going to horizontally compress us and vertically stretch us there are one two three four different transformations here you can have up to five you can have a vertical a horizontal horizontal stretch of compression vertical stretch compression and a reflection if you have a negative out there so you can have up to five of these transformations we'll see that one of our examples let's go ahead and start identifying what's going on here starting from step one a vertical shift is at the end of your function it affects the output output is this vertical axis so that's going to be the shift up 1. next to your input your x is going to be the shift along the input axis the x-axis and it's opposite of what you want to think of it as so this plus 3 pi over 4 is left 3 pi over 4. we're going to pause right there and we're going to graph this right now the reason why we do is we're about to do the period and the period needs to be related to where this is shifted so i'm going to graph this up one that's going to treat this like a new x axis and left 3 pi over 4 it's going to treat where we move to this new y y-axis so hopefully it's natural to you that up one should be this vertical movement and left so plus three pi over four left three pi over four should give us this negative three pi over four now why well remember where cosine starts cosines period along with all of them a tangent start at 0 so this left 3 pi over 4 is going to move us left to or negative 3 pi over 4. this is where we're going to start this graph it's going to act like the beginning of our first period now what we're going to do is find our period because the period of cosine is 2 pi and we're going to divide by this coefficient this is going to give us a period of pi over 2. now notice what i was saying i prefaced this so that it would make sense right now the normal period is 2 pi we have shortened it we've horizontally compressed this now here's what we're going to do take whatever your phase shift was this horizontal shift you're left with 3 pi over 4 this negative 3 pi over 4. take this add that it will show you where the end of your first period is so we're going to do that right now so we took this negative 3 pi over 4 we added pi over 2 we got negative pi over 4. this is the beginning and end of what we're treating as our first period this distance is pi over 2 that is your period now we're going to find the center and the quarters of that because a lot of important things happen all the important things happen at the ends center and quarters of our period so we have the ends now now we're gonna do the center and quarters much like sine this doesn't have any vertical asymptotes this is cosine it's not a bad function we know that x-intercepts happen to the quarter so those are important to find and then we have peaks at the beginning and a valley at the center or local maximum at the beginning to end and then at the center we have this local minimum eventually we're going to start altering that but that's how we start so let's find the center and the quarters so we've gone ahead and done that if you needed to use your calculator find the center by taking and averaging your start and your end of your period so negative three fourths and negative one fourth average that you're going to get negative one-half negative three-fourths and negative one-half average out you 5 8. same thing here negative 3 8. and then just do it without the pie and put the pie back it's probably the easiest way to work the fractions and then realize what we're doing because this is based on where we shifted it to so this left and this up shift i've also rewritten these numbers on here this is going to act like where your key points and how these key features of this graph relate so when we talk about hey with cosine your x-intercepts are at the quarters of your period well that period's moved hasn't it's moved left and it's moved up and so we're going to relate our x-intercepts to the quarters of this particular period not down here up here now of course we're all smart enough to realize that yes those are no longer actually x-intercepts yeah we get that but what it does is helps us graph this so they're acting like x-intercepts on where we've shifted this to i hope that makes sense to you so we said vertov shift we got it horizontal shift or phase shift we've got it we've now identified our period we found the ends the center and the quarters those are the most important points for us now we're going to take a look at our key points remember with cosine there are three key points that are not x-intercepts there are the ends which are positive one and the center which is negative one so we have that here we have our two ends of our period negative 3 pi over 4 or negative pi over 4 comma positive 1. we have the center at comma negative 1. i'm just getting those numbers from here here and here and i'm basing this on cosine originally has positive 1 at the ends and negative one at the center that's what we've done now any factor here can modify that it can stretch it it can compress it and it can reflect it and we're gonna let that happen right now let's multiply by two wow i really hope you see the utility and showing this and this it makes your graphing so much nicer because while these key points are not the actual points on our graph we've shifted this around what it's going to do is going to allow you to graph this very nicely and then you can see what those points are it's not that bad but they have been shifted it's just a really nice graphing tool so let's go ahead and do that because these relate to these actual values this is pretty nice here's negative 3 pi over 4. this acts like you're zero so negative 3 pi over 4 comma 2 is up 2. so i have negative 3 pi over 4 two and negative pi over four two that's the ends and positive two in this case because we multiplied and now our center is negative pi over two comma negative two but it's from here not here from here not over there but here down two so this would be negative pi over two comma negative two put us right there and so we're ready to graph our first period now you can continue this and you've seen this if right now if i continue my my period here the next quarter would be negative pi over eight and the next center would be this zero that's where that would be and to the left the next third quarter would be whatever this is and then the next half would be whatever this is which would be negative pi and we can graph this so our our first period really shifted to right here i've just extended it on here and here and you keep going by doing this if you wanted another cycle just keep on adding your period every time so we do a vertical and a horizontal shift we show that find your period add it to your phase shift you keep on adding and subtracting as many times as you want in order to find out as many cycles as you like then find ends center quarters repeat those every period and your key points will be based on that and will also repeat which makes it very convenient once you get the idea down the last time i mention it is please remember even though the the x-intercepts of the original cosine function are at the corners these are not actual x-intercepts are they because they've been shifted our x-intercepts are somewhere here i don't know what they are this is certainly not it they're somewhere between here and so i wanted to make that that just really clear for you that when we start shifting things we also shift x-intercepts which is the whole basis of my technique that i'm showing you so i hope it's making sense let's come back and let's do two more let's get going on another example so we've got y equals negative 3 sine of negative 2 negative interesting negative 2x plus pi over 2 nothing added or subtracted afterwards form is incredibly important for trigonometric functions so put in the proper form now before we go jump into any conclusions going oh my gosh that negative does something that negative does something that's crazy watch what happens and why i'm telling you about form first because we have to have the coefficient of x positive and one in order to identify both the period and the phase shift we do that first and you're going to see something happen in this when we start factoring out that negative two so when we do and this is the real important reason why we don't just memorize formulas why we understand about the form and then look at what's actually happening because when we divide out negative 2 it's going to change signs that's not a shift to the left it's going to end up being a shift to the right so negative 2x divided by negative 2 is positive x this is what we want to identify both the period and to identify any sort of phase shift let's see positive pi over two divided by negative two is negative pi over four this is the proper form we can verify that that's true negative 2x plus pi over 2 that's fine but this is the proper form to identify at least the phase shift now what about the period this is not the proper form yet for the period why well because really what you should be doing is dividing your period by a positive number you go wait a minute that's a negative i thought you could just pull out negatives you can't listen carefully this is the biggest deal right now is that that negative while you can't put in front of the sign because you cannot move that negative outside of the argument of the sine function you can use the fact this is a significant difference that sine is an odd function what's that mean odd functions mean this you can change the sign of your input if you change the sign of your output in other words if you change the sign of your argument of your input of your function in this case sine then just make the sign in front of it negative or change the sign in front of it in this case so odd functions sign being odd says if you remember this we did stuff like this remember how sine of negative pi over 4 we said hey that's an odd function this would be the same as negative sine of positive pi over 4. doing to the fact that this is an odd function please listen carefully again this last someone said is that you are not simply moving the negative out front in fact with cosine cosine's an even function you just make it positive because with odds opposite inputs give you opposite outputs evens opposite inputs give you the same equal outputs even as equal outputs so the long story made short is man this is great sine is an odd function all we have to do to change that sign is change that sign and that's what we're going to do right now because it's an odd function you could do a little bit of more work here if it looks like magic to you we could say that this would be negative negative 3 sine but the idea is an opposite input which is exactly what this is will yield an opposite output which is exactly what we show this is due to the fact that sign's an odd function now this is much nicer to identify everything that we want to about this so we're going to go through and follow our four steps the first one is do we have a vertical shift we don't there's nothing added or subtracted do we have a phase shift yeah we do it's right there and notice that that is a right pi over four so we've shown this phase shift a horizontal shift of right high four uh we're not moving up or down so that's fine just right there so this acts like our x-axis and it is our x-axis this acts like our y-axis it's been shifted now we find our period because sine has an original period of 2 pi we divide by our coefficient notice it's so nice divide by positive numbers you don't have to think about adding a negative here that's why we use the oddness for sine and evenness for cosine to alter whatever that is if it's negative it's not that bad and it saves us a lot of headache this is going to give us just pi now what we do with that take that pi add it to your phase shift now if we haven't phase shifted well that would have been zero we would get whatever that is pi um with tangent we would have started not at zero but at negative pi over two with this because we shifted this to the right pi over four where you take pi over four your phase shift add your period that's how we always do this isn't it you take your start of your period and you add your period to it tangent does that cotangent all of them do that so pi over four plus pi is five pi over four that really is a period of pi now we're going to find the center and the quarters so we got phase shift we added the period we found the center and the quarters hopefully make sense of how we do that if you want to you can average them if it doesn't make sense in your head but one-fourth plus five-fourths divided by two is three-fourths so three pi over four then do the same thing here and here you got the appropriate ends center and quarters now look back at the functions we're dealing with we're dealing with sine think about what sine does sine has x-intercepts at the ends and center of your period that is shifted but it still relates so x intercepts at the ends and center the key points of first quarter one and third quarter negative one might be changed but we want to make sure we write them down so first quarter is pi over two comma one originally now we might change that but originally it's pi over two column one or first quarter comma one may be a better way to think of that and third quarter common negative one that's what sine does now aren't you glad that we did this form before we started doing our key points this is why this order is incredibly important it's going to lead you down the right road right road to success so now that we have our key points as they are and our our form correct this is not a reflection this was sort of a using oddness to change that sign and it's not going to reflect this and so we have this positive three as our factor that's going to be a vertical stretch there's only let's see one two there's three transformations here there's a shift to the right phase shift right power four there is a horizontal compression two pi into pi and as a vertical stretch one times three so one into three now we're ready to graph so we're gonna do that we're going to go up down and up i haven't gone any further that way i'm going to show you that zero would act like a third quarter of the previous period kind of miss that one just make the point bigger looks okay which looks like junk hopefully you get the idea that that that point is a little bit off um but that's that's about what this function would look like this would be at least your key points you'd have the shape of it the period of it you could do several cycles from it i hope that's making sense we're going to come back and show you what would happen if that was a cosine and deal with a very awkward period so hang on for that okay last one and we're going to go through it very quickly i'm actually going to shortcut some of the keys key points because i'm going to show you how to do that just from the period probably i've already figured that out if not it'll be pretty clear for you so let's take a look at 2 cosine negative 2 pi x minus 4 plus 3 that's crazy um form is incredibly important let's put it in the right form here's what we're going to do we're going to make this so that this looks pretty good but that our coefficient of x is positive 1. we're going to have to divide out negative 2 pi now when we do that negative 2 pi x divided by negative 2 pi is positive x that's great negative 4 divided by negative 2 pi is not great that's positive okay 4 divided by 2 pi is 2 over pi now we're ready to take a look at our shifting but that is really nasty 2 over pi is going to be a shift to the left of 2 divided by pi well that's not exactly negative 1. it's not exactly easy to it's not exactly anything that we can represent as a decimal in fact but you might have your calculator out handy to see where that actually is so let's go through this let's identify what our shifts are but before we do that if you remember the last example that negative on sine created a negative or a change or sign for our function cosine is an even function that means opposite inputs give you the same output what it means is that cosine of any negative angle is the same as cosine of the positive version of that angle in other words evenness means these are the same well that means i can change that sign and get the same thing i don't know if it makes any better but at least you have to deal with that negative now we can identify what our shifts are this has a vertical shift of up three and i've actually shown that one two three a vertical shift of up three this has a horizontal shift of left two over pi and we're going to show that now so my vertical shift is up 3 and then left 2 over pi so i've estimated that about where it is on the x-axis and related some points according to that you can see that in a second now we figure out what our period is so the period says take your two pi your original period for cosine divide by your coefficient which is also 2 pi and you're going to get 1. now add that to whatever your phase shift is wait a second negative 2 pi plus 1 is 1 minus 2 pi figure out where that is in relation to this is it positive is it negative it turns out that if i add negative 2 over pi plus 1 i get 1 minus 2 over pi that's about 0.36 then we figure out the center and the quarters which isn't really all that bad because if my period is one check it out this is a period of one one minus two pi minus negative two pi is one this is a period of one well what's half of one one half what's a quarter of one quarter what's three quarters of one three quarters and then just subtract two over pi from each of those that's the easy way to find out your n's your center and your quarters from here we just need to identify what cosine does cosine has the x-intercepts at the quarters at the ends and center you have 1 1 and negative 1. just multiply it because you have them right on the board here's your n's here's your center you can literally just say from here multiply 1 by that that number right there so 1 times 2 is 2 1 times this would be negative 1 times 2 is negative 2 and at your end your end is normally 1 multiply it by that number so at your end 1 times 2 gives you positive 2. i just wanted to show you a quick way to graph these exceptionally fast uh with remembering that cosine you're ends with your quarters and that they're sorry your intercepts are at your quarters and that your key points are n's comma one well multiply that if it had been negative two you'd reflect it and your center is uh negative one multiply that and you get wherever your key points end up being that that's without showing you these awkward key points comma one a negative one and then multiplying so i hope it makes sense i hope i'm showing you face shifting to your satisfaction remember there are some things where you can go backwards if i give you a phase shift and an amplitude we should be able to go backwards on that but it doesn't happen very often so i'll see you for another video we start talking about inverses have a great day you 

Transcript for: Introduction to Inverse Trigonometric Functions (Precalculus - Trigonometry 17)
welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about what in the world inverse trig functions are you know what why would we do that because it's fun not really um it is kind of fun but because you want to solve them eventually maybe you don't but you're going to have to so we're going to learn how functions solve other functions by using inverses that's really the basis of why we we talked about this is because inverse functions are needed to solve certain types of functions in fact all functions for instance if you wanted to solve an equation with addition you're going to need to use subtraction and inverse operation something quite similar happens when we want to solve an equation that has sine in it or cosine or tangent well we can't just divide why well because sine is a function not an operation and so we need an inverse function rather than just an inverse operation in order to solve these equations that deal with these trigonometric functions that we've been dealt with so we're going to talk about inverse functions what they look like why they are the way they are being sort of a cutting off of a one to one to make a function one to one and then as we progress through several more videos we'll learn how to use inverse functions to solve their root functions so how to use sine inverse to solve sine functions or cosine inverse to solve cosine functions things like that so that's why we're getting into it so the the long story made very short is you need inverse functions to solve equations that contain a specific function inverse sine for sine and the inverse of cosine for cosine and etc so let's talk about what they are now if you remember anything about inverse functions you should remember that a function has an inverse if and only if it's one to one now that if and only if an iff stands for if and only if that's that's by conditional means uh one is necessary and sufficient for the other well what that means is this like put all together is a function has an inverse if it's one to one and if a function is one to one it has an inverse okay well what in the world does one to one mean one to one is this idea of being forward and backwards mappable the the specific definition is one input gives you one unique output now a function itself says plug in one number you get out one number uh one to one says plug in one number you get out one number but that number never happens again why is that important well if you want to be able to reverse something map it forwards and backwards one input needs to be mapped to one output but that output needs to be backwards mapped to one input think about this for a second parabolas do not do this if i say plug in positive 2 to x squared you're going to get 4 but i would say okay now take an output of 4 what was your input you could have 2 or negative 2. the backwards mapping does not work because that those two inputs gave you the same output therefore that output could possibly give you two different inputs it's forward mappable but not backward mappable it's a function but not a one to one function we need one to one functions that are mapped forwards and backwards so that inverses make sense why well because in inverses we switch the x and y the input becomes the output the output becomes the input the domain becomes the range and the range becomes the domain if that's true then if we have one input giving us one output and we reverse that that new input which was an output is still going to give us that output it's still a function if we had one input uh certain sorry two different inputs it gave us the same output when we reversed that we'd have one input giving us two different outputs and that is a non-function so the whole thing wrapped up together is one to one functions are one input one unique output so that we can map it forwards and backwards so that we can reverse inputs and outputs and we still have functions and in that way we can undo functions with inverses that's a really probably three video explanation one to one in case you didn't remember it so we're going to get right into it and talk about how sine is not one to one and so we're gonna have to restrict it and in doing so we create a portion of a function that is one to one and this is the portion we have to look at so that inverses make sense so all that you really need to know right now is that inverses are only possible if a function is one to one one easy way to tell the functions one-to-one is something called the horizontal line test so imagine a horizontal line if it hits your function at more than one spot you don't have a one-to-one function you have a function but not one-to-one we have problems here if we imagine a horizontal line we hit outputs here and here and here here and every so often um twice a period that we get the same exact outputs that that's an issue that would be a very very big issue because we do not have a one-to-one function inside now why is that important if sine is not a one-to-one function sine of x is what i'm referring to well then if it's not to one it can't have an inverse so here's the thought process if we want inverses so that we're able to solve equations with sine in them well then we're going to have to restrict this function so that becomes one to one so that we can map forwards and backwards and functions still work between a function and inverse we can still have that so if we take a look and we go uh yeah that's not one to one so it does not have an inverse let's start cutting this and the common common way to do it is to take a part of this function that is to one to one now notice something we couldn't do something like from zero to pi why well from zero to pi it's still not one-to-one this has inputs giving us outputs that are repeated you cannot have repeated outputs in a function that has an inverse and so that's on the table where would we cut this well from here to here and along the x-axis that's negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 that is a one-to-one function so we're going to ignore all of this and all of this and just focus on this little sliver now i've kind of zoomed in here a lot this is the part of the sine function that we typically say this is what we're building our inverse on so this is huge it's a big deal it's why a lot of students struggle with inverses is because they really don't recognize what we're looking at what we're looking at when we talk about sine inverse or some people call it arc sine if you've heard of that before sine inverses sine of little negative 1 looks like an exponent it's not but we pronounce it sine inverse the inverse of the sine function this is what we're looking at we're looking at a zoomed in part of sine now in order to get an inverse out of it again you have to be one to this is one-to-one every input is giving you a unique not repeated output it passes the horizontal line test this is a one-to-one part of a function but in order to do it we had to cut it in cutting it restricting the domain we're only looking at a little piece here's the payoff for us is that when we start talking about inverse functions if you have something outside of this interval you can't do it if you have something outside of this range you can't do it you can't talk about inverses that creates a very specific domain and range for both the sine function that has an inverse and the sine inverse function later and it's a big deal we'll talk a lot about this so what is our domain of the part of the sine function that lets us find an inverse well the domain is from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. that is including those endpoints because we don't run into any problems with those outputs being repeated so we can go from negative pi over two to pi over two and have a one-to-one function i hope i'm explaining that well enough i hope that you're seeing that one-to-one functions past horizontal line tests outputs are not repeated it's because we need a one a mapping forwards and backwards that we have to have that happen sine doesn't do it so we cut side where we cut sine from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 that's where we're going to cut it now our range says well you still do have the same range don't you from negative one to one this portion this little little part of the graph on this interval x axis still has a range from negative one to one including those and our key points two of our most important key points are on there are quarters the high and the low the local max and local men now technically we don't really have a local max anymore because we're not changing from increasing or decreasing we have an absolute max an absolute min that's true but those key points that negative pi over 2 negative 1 and the pi over 2 negative 1 they're still here negative pi over 2 negative 1 pi over 2 positive 1. here's the deal we need to remember a few things about how inverse functions work so the first thing was when they're possible they're possible when we have one-to-one functions and a one-to-one function will have an inverse that means this has an inverse there's a few things about inverses though everything switches from inputs to outputs and outputs to inputs what that means is several things i want to point out right now number one if you're going to find an inverse function from some sort of a root function your x's and your y's switch your inputs and your outputs switch your domain and your range switch and your graph reflects about the y equals x you might remember that we talked a lot about inverses in some videos ago the same things hold true even though it's trigonometry inverse searches inverses they take one-to-one functions and they switch stuff up they see your x's and your y's change what that means is that if i want to find an inverse function if negative pi over 2 comma negative 1 is on my original function then negative 1 comma negative pi over 2 is going to be on the inverse likewise 1 comma pi over 2 is going to be on my inverse i'm switching my x and my y my domain is going to become my range my range is going to become my domain my graph is going to reflect across y equals x and we're going to get something just like this so instead of negative pi over 2 negative 1 i have negative 1 negative pi over 2. 0 0 now wait a minute 0 0 is still 0 0 so it goes to the origin pi over two comma one we reflect that we get one comma pi over two those are the key points for my inverse function my domain is going to become my range you can see it right now this is still one to one that's important if we have a one-to-one function and find an inverse the inverse is also one to one they're inverses of one another now that's important for later on that means that sine inverse is going to solve sine stuff and sine stuff is going to solve sine inverse equations they work together it's like this if you have an equation with addition you need subtraction if you have an equation with subtraction you need addition they work hand in hand to solve equations because they're inverse operations likewise we have inverse functions here that are going to solve one another because they're made for one another and from one another based on this inverse function idea so it's still one to one it's still actually a function it's just that everything changes so let's write out a couple things about it we can see it graphically that our domain is negative one to one notice i'm not drawing arrows here why because if i was well then we would start getting this this non-one-to-one function same thing happens here we're going to get this non-one-to-one function so our domain is negative one to one that's what the range here was remember input's an output switch so domain and range switch between functions and their their inverses so domain is negative one to one range is negative pi over two to pi over two that's our old domain becomes our range for inverse our old range becomes our domain for our inverse our key points are now different negative 1 negative pi over 2 0 0 for sure still and then 1 comma pi over 2. and i hope that makes sense to you the one thing that you've noticed we haven't done yet we don't even know what what it looks like we don't even know what the name of it looks like for sine inverse here's where we would get this from so we have a picture of it and we know why it's sort of truncated we cut it so that this would still be one to one and so is the inverse we know our domain we know our range we know our key points this is it this is all that sine inverse can do so here's what this means if you have something on the inside of sine inverse that's not negative one to one you have a problem it's outside the domain and you cannot deal with it interesting if you have something inside or equal to side numbers equal to something that's outside negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 you can't deal with it it must satisfy what we have here and what we have here if we're going to solve it with inverses that's interesting that's that should be valuable to them to us what we don't have is the name yet so let's go ahead and let's remember how we solve equations for inverses this is going to lead us in the next two videos from now how to find inverse functions so if you remember how to solve for inverses the first thing we did is we changed y into x and x into y and then we solved for y and you go yeah but how am i supposed to do that do i divide by sine no we can't do that why well if we divided by sine sine is not really an operator right sine is not a number sine is a function and so we have some have to have something to undo that function we call it sine inverse so we're going to apply sine inverse to the left-hand side of both sides of this equation what that looks like is looks kind of awkward the first time you see it you go okay sine negative 1x it's pronounced sine inverse it stands for the inverse of the sine function you can also hear it said or here seen it red as arc sine a r c sine arc sine and sine numbers are the same thing it looks a little weird over here like okay sine inverse of sine of y what in the world does that do here here's like the plain english way to look at this this says thing that undoes sine of sine wait a minute the thing that undoes sine is going to undo the sign what are you left with well if this undoes this you're left with that that's exactly what an inverse function does an inverse function undoes the original function the function itself would undo the inverse and so thing that under sine of sine leaves you with whatever that sign was that's just why this is the inverse of the sine function so we say y equals sine inverse of x here's the domain and the range and the key points of it here's the graph of it even but that's how you pronounce it so if you want to do this say sine inverse of x you just pronounce this correctly you can also say arc sine x and you pronounce this well technically you'd say sine inverse but you can see this red as arc sine same exact thing a couple comments about this is this is a big deal please remember this this is a huge that in our original function sine of x was an angle that's exactly what this is now it can be viewed as a real number yes but on a unit circle this was an angle or an arc length and this was well let's see that was a coordinate that was a point on the inner circle sine inverse is now backwards so look at this your angle is now your your y well this is your angle this is your point it has switched remember that inputs become outputs outputs become inputs on the unit circle our input was an angle our output was a point on the circle inverses say your input's a point on the circle and your output's going to be the angle that gives you that point that's a big deal it's reversed of what this originally was and that's how inverse functions really do work they reverse the x and the y they solve for the y what that does is that makes inputs outputs and outputs inputs on the unit circle if the original input was an angle and output was a point now for inverses the input's the point the output is the angle that we that gives us that point and that's really how we think about it so i hope it makes sense if it makes sense on why we had to cut this to get a one-to-one function that this is the picture of it and now that we've solved this down we're going to move quickly through the cosine and cosine inverse relationship i'm not going to show you this because it's exactly the same what we're going to focus on is the domain the range what the picture looks like and then what what the key points are same thing for tangent let's talk about cosine and cosine inverse we're going to go much quicker than the sine because we've already talked about what one-to-one means the necessity of having a one-to-one function for an inverse we just have to look at cosine determine yeah there's no way that's one to one that's not a one to one function it does not pass the horizontal line test so we're going to cut it we're going to find out what our domain is on which we have a one to one portion of cosine what our range is as a consequence of that and then we'll take a look at what the key points are what the graph of that would look like if we reflect it across y equals x so if we take a look at cosine of x it's a little different it's actually a phase shift of sine but cosine of x is definitely not one to one unless we start cutting it now there are several options like we have a sign there's several options where we cut it but probably the most obvious one is if we cut it at zero and at pi we'll have a portion of the x-axis on which cosine is one-to-one decreasing where sine was increasing that's interesting sine was an increasing function on which we took an inverse and cosine is decreasing on that portion of the x-axis that domain so we're going to cut it here and here we're going to ignore all of this stuff why well because we can't find a one-to-one function for that not the whole thing so we're going to cut this from zero to pi i've done that here so from zero to pi we have this portion on our graph it passes the one to one the horizontal line test it is one to one every input is given one unique output on this interval well that therefore is the domain on which we can find an inverse for cosine x so our domain is from zero to pi now consequently zero has an output of one and pi has an output of negative one so that is a range and we put it in order and the end points are also there yes this has endpoints it has to otherwise when this continues it becomes not one to one and we can't find an inverse any longer and then there's some key points we have 0 1 pi over 2 0 and then pi comma negative 1. when we start reversing those here's what has to happen our x's and our y's are going to switch so if we had zero one a key point on the inverse should be one zero if we had pi over two comma zero on the inverse we get zero pi over two and if we had pi comma negative one then on the inverse we have negative one comma pi also this is kind of awkward because the uh the y equals x line goes through our function remember we're reflecting about that and so this is going to look a little bit weird because any graph that crosses the line of reflection you reflect it looks a little a little strange it was diagonal and so how this really looks is this looks quite similar to that side doesn't it but it's almost it's not going uh it's not increasing it's decreasing like the original function was this is the graph of what we would call arc cosine x or cosine inverse of x now the domain and the range are what we would expect the domain of cosine inverse well that was the range of cosine so our domain is negative one to one the range is the old domain so the range was zero to pi sorry the domain was zero to pi here the range is zero to pi on our cosine inverse another thing to remember just remember that with the original cosine function the input was an angle the output was part of a point that's also reverse inputs become outputs outputs become inputs so on cosine inverse the input is a point and the output is the angle that gives you that point if i want to be a bit more specific it's the x coordinate of a point and before with sine inverse it was the y coordinate of the point that was your input the output is the angle that's giving you that it's reversed at this so now we should have a pretty good feel for hey inverses are going to solve one another that's the idea i want your head they only work on one to one function so we had to cut it and give us something very important that these one-to-one functions do not work everywhere you have to have a very specific input very specific range of outputs and inputs that work in this relationship we're going to come back with tangent take a look at what that that is as well all right let's talk about one more we're going to talk about the inverse of tangent so we're going to find tan inverse same exact idea is what we've been dealing with actually really really similar to side even kind of looks a little bit similar to that and so we'll take a look at it right now so let's take a look at tangent of x all right here's the graph of tangent of x and very very conveniently we already see that this is a one-to-one function now it does have some other cycles to it which i haven't shown but a really sort of obvious domain restriction would be if we cut this thing at negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 it's already one to one we don't have to modify this any other way we're just going to kind of ignore all the other cycles the repetitions of the periods that we have the period being pi and distance of pi on the x-axis that this is already one-to-one so tangent of x on this particular domain is a one-to-one function and therefore has to have an inverse and that's exactly what we find out and that is the domain restriction that makes the inverse of tangent possible do remember this though in its natural state without restricting the domain this thing does continue forever with that same repetition so it's not one-to-one in general until we make a domain restriction and so that's what we're going to do right now kind of a natural one though i mean we see it's one to one it's really nice to say yeah just from here to here we have this nice function that is one to one we can find an inverse now one thing to keep in mind with a vertical asymptote you can't ever include that it's undefined right there's no way to find this if you try to plug in tangent of pi over two you're going to get something over zero one over zero specifically that would be y over x on the unit circle you say that's undefined yeah that's why there's a vertical asymptote there which means that we can't have a bracket we're going to have a parenthesis there is no point on tangent of pi over 2 or negative pi over 2. so we're going to show that now the range also is from negative infinity all the way to infinity and we see a few key points on this we have this key point of negative pi over four negative one we've got zero zero and we have pi over four positive one everything about this one to one function on the restricted domain of tangent is going to be reversed as far as inputs and outputs are concerned so all of our key points are going to change if negative pi over 4 negative 1 is on tangent then negative 1 negative pi over 4 is on the inverse 0 0 gives us 0 0 pi over 4 1 gives us 1 pi over 4. so we're going to get three points that are key points for the inverse function and so we've shown that we have a few points right there negative one negative power four got it zero zero and one comma pi over four inputs and output switch x's and y's switch between a function and inverse domain range also switched so the domain of tangent was negative pi over two to pi over two that's going to be the range of tan inverse our range was negative infinity to positive infinity that's going to be the domain for tan inverse in fact even asymptotes change a vertical asymptote said you can't have this on the x axis you can't have that input well we're going to have now a horizontal asymptote you can't get that out on the y axis and so asymptotes at negative pi over 2 and pi over 2 are still there but they change from vertical to horizontal the last thing we have to do is graph it so we know that the function we're building is an inverse function for tangent we have tan inverse or arctan we can say that too our domain and range have switched we have the graph we know it's going to be reflection across the y equals x line so our graph is going to look something like this that's about what tan inverse of x looks like we can see that our domain is all real numbers you can plug in anything to tan inverse why because you could get out anything from tangent you can only get out negative pi over two to pi over two for four tan inverse why because you can only plug in that that interval for tangent and so this is the last important point the last name i make please make sure you understand that the input for tangent is an angle the output was a comparison of a coordinates of points y over x so the reverse is true for tan inverse our input is going to be a ratio of y over x the output is going to be an angle here so we would have this as a point and that is the angle that gives the point that's reverse of that's reverse of the comparison of y over x being the output of some angle for tangent uh please keep this in mind that i i know that we have x's and y's going on in the context of what we're dealing with yes x can be real numbers it's what we are uh talking about but on the unit circle where i'm kind of making this an uncomfortable circle to connect a little bit for you is that when you look up tangent on a unit circle you look up an angle x stands for that angle um or arc length on a unit circle it's fine it can be any real number that's okay as long as between here for an inverse that's fine it's appropriate the input would be the angle the output what that is would be the comparison of coordinates of the points on a unit circle for sine it was just angle gave me y coordinate for cosine angle gave me x coordinate for tangent angle gives me y divided by x coordinates that's what's going on the inverses reverse that inverses say okay give me a y coordinate sine inverse of that y coordinate gives me the angle that makes it give me an x coordinate cosine inverse of that coordinate gives me the angle that makes it give me a y compared to x coordinate tan inverse of that y compared to x is going to give me the angle that makes that ratio i hope that makes sense this is where these graphs come from what they look like and why most importantly why we have to restrict them to make one-to-one functions so that we can even get inverses next video we're going to do is talk about how to use it so we're going to we're going to show what the domain has to be what the range has to be when you can actually simplify some of these these expressions involving sine and sine inverse or cosine cosine inverse so we'll get a little more complicated than that then after that i'll show you how to find inverse functions of something like 3 sine of 2x plus 7. can we find an inverse with that so that's where we're going with it right now just an introduction into how inverse functions are possible with some trigonometric ideas hope i've made it make sense for you i'll see you for another video 

Transcript for: How to Use Inverse Trigonometric Functions (Precalculus - Trigonometry 18)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to start talking about how to use some of the inverse trig functions that we need to be really really familiar with so namely sine cosine tangent and their inverses and one of the most important things to understand about them is their domains so on what domain sine has an inverse cosine has an inverse and tangent has an inverse and what the domains of those inverse functions actually are so i've done a couple things here real quick to make sure that we understand that so when we are when we started talking about those inverses of sine cosine and tangent we said that we had to restrict the x-axis that's the domain so we had to we had to cut it basically and say you know what this is only going to have an inverse if x is between negative pi over 2 and pi over 2 for sine and tangent including negative pi over 2 and pi over 2 for sine but not tangent because of those vertical asymptotes and between 0 and pi inclusive for cosine on those portions of the x-axis that's where an inverse function can be found well what that means is that if we're outside of that interval outside that domain we do not have the ability to use an inverse function and it's very very important that sine cosine tangent are restricted on those domains so that the inverses actually apply but likewise when we found our inverses the range for these functions became the domain for the inverse functions so basically the long story made short is if you're going to use sine inverse that x had better be between negative one and one and that x for cosine inverse it better be between negative one and one and that x for tangent inverse can be anything all real numbers because that was the range of tangent if you're going to find an inverse with these functions well your x is better and it better be defined on where that function actually had an inverse that was a big deal the other thing i wanted to point out is that with our trig functions the input is actually an angle and the output is a i say point here but i mean a coordinate of a point or ratio of coordinates on a unit circle that's reversed for inverse functions our input is a coordinate on a point of a point on a unit circle or a ratio of those those points and the output is the angle that gives us those coordinates or that ratio of some point that's what we mean here the other thing before we get really into it is do you remember i hope that you do do you remember that when we take a composition of a function with its inverse or an inverse with its function they cancel and that is the whole point about why these inverse functions are so relevant so necessary is because in order to solve equations with with a function you need the inverse of that function and if i can compose them i can cancel them and that's the point so in either case when you compose a function it's inverse or inverse of its function they're going to cancel you're going to get x and so what we're going to do now is we're going to take a look at what happens when you compose them but we're going to make very sure that this is solid in our minds about what has to happen so so here's the deal the inside function's domain must be met so here's here's what happens does sine inverse of sine of x cancel yes it does absolutely as long as this x is in the domain of that function that's the most important thing to check so this is going to cancel you're going to get x but that's only true if sine of x is go is somewhere between negative sorry if that x is somewhere between negative pi over two and pi over two so i've written that in such a way that you can see intervention you can also see a little bit inequality notation of that but basically what it says is yeah you know what if sine inverse of sine is actually the inverse of that if they're inverse functions this has to be on that part of the x-axis where we set it in receiving existed we said we had to cut it right well you better make sure you cut it correctly and that's what that's saying you have to be on that part that has an inverse same thing for cosine this is going to work it's going to simplify as long as that x is between the interval of 0 and pi that was the part of the x-axis where we said that the inverse even existed so think about that if we're outside of the part where we said inverse exists then inverse has no no relevance to it so we'd have to be on that section of the x-axis that we said this is where inverse happens because of that one-to-one portion of that function according to that interval that domain for tangent same thing happens an inverse will cancel the function that always happens whenever you compose an inverse of this function but it has to meet the domain so this domain where we cut that was negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. and that's saying the same thing that this does it says yes we have an inverse function for these things on that domain notice how they're all angles this is an angle on a unit circle angle angle and the outputs would be the coordinates the y coordinate the x coordinate or the ratio of y over x and that's what this is saying it's saying your angle must be on the part of that unit circle or the graph where we had a one-to-one function here here there that has to that has to be the case now when we reverse that when we find a different composition notice either way you go you're going to cancel it's true but you must meet the domain of the inside function so sine of sine inverse of x it is going to simplify you're going to get x but only where the domain of that inverse function is now remember with with inverse functions well the input is now a point the input is a point on the unit circle or a point on a graph and the output is the angle that gives you that or the x value on the x-axis that's true but here we go okay so our point is from negative one to one the output would be an angle that that makes sense here this is somewhere on your unit circle the y-coordinate can only be between negative one and one the x-coordinate cosine can only be between negative one and one the ratio of those two things could be anything and so what our domain is has to be met for us to use a composition we have to have inside functions domain met for inverse functions those are points that's between negative one and one the output of which would be an angle sine of an angle that's what that means it means that this is going to give us an angle and and this is only going to work if we're on the appropriate domain for cosine x and cosine oh sorry cosine of cosine inverse of x we get x and meaning the domain of inside function means you go from negative one to one you have to have that met in order for the inverse relationship to take place and lastly for tangent we can have any number so anything would work there why the domain and range switch angles became coordinates of points coordinates points became angles for their respective places in these functions the other thing that i wanted to talk about is that when you compose these and they do simplify and we've already checked our domain appropriately when we have those inverse functions inverses can be kind of tricky to deal with because we don't we sometimes want to misconstrue what they are an inverse trig function is going to give you out an angle that's the output so when you see sine inverse of something it is talking about an angle and so this should make absolute sense sine of something that gives you out an angle sine of an angle is actually appropriate that makes sense or likewise sine inverse is talking about in an input that is a a value sorry a y coordinate for a sine of a point so remember sine of x is going to give you a y coordinate sine inverse of a y coordinate actually makes sense so they have to match up in order for our the appropriate input to give us out the appropriate output what i mean by that is your sine of x has to give you an uh it has to take in an angle give you out a y coordinate sine number so that y coordinate therefore would be in the appropriate domain so they kind of work together long story made really short is make sure that you're inside function of your composition make sure that that domain is appropriate make sure that that value is in your domain so i'm going to pull up the unit circle here really quick and we're going to talk about how to use it in order to figure out some of these inverse relationships so let's practice a few let's just make sure that we get the hang of what an inverse function is talking about before we start doing a few compositions here now we talked about compositions but we'll get to some examples in a minute but just to get a feel of what this is doing so when you're asked sine inverse of zero i don't want you just memorize what to do i want you to understand what's going on so sine inverse of zero basically asks this question remember that sine inverse of zero is supposed to give you out an angle the input is a coordinate of a point what point the y coordinate is dealing with sine here so sine inverse says i want you to find me the angle that has a y coordinate of z of zero when that angle gives you that point so find a angle that has a y coordinate of zero for the point of the unit circle that's an opposite idea right so sine said here's your angle finding the y coordinate side number says here's a like coordinated find me the angle that's all it's really talking about now you can confirm that zero is on that interval so the input is is is on the appropriate domain that's great we're just looking for the angle so here's what we do go to unit circle and find out where the y coordinate is zero why why coordinate well that's sine and we're undoing sideway and we're inversion side so where's the y coordinate zero um here oh but also here this is the main problem man don't miss this this is the main problem on why we had to restrict the domain because we wouldn't have a one-to-one function and inverses would fail you'd say zero or pi that's a problem we can't do that we have to have one input and one output otherwise we don't have a function one input would give us two different outputs that's a real big problem this is exactly why we had to restrict our domain so here's the here's the whole point of this it says yes you're gonna you're gonna do this find me the angle that has a y coordinate of zero but you must be on the restricted domain so for sine and sine inverse you're looking from negative pi over two to pi over two just quadrants four and one or one and four however you want to think about that it must be here negative pi over two to pi over two so the question says find me the angle that gives me a y coordinate of zero but only on that portion of your x-axis or that portion of if you're talking about a graph or that portion of your unit circle so negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 says there's only one value that has a y coordinate of zero it's right there why only one because it's one to one on this portion it's one to one there's no repeated y values notice if i go past this i start repeating y values that's a problem that's why we had to restrict it that's exactly why we have that domain the way it is so when we look at this okay find sine inverse of zero says you're going to have have to find me an angle that has a y coordinate of zero that is on the restricted domain that we found that's going to be an angle of zero zero radians that's another thing so all of these are going to be in terms of radians keep that in mind all of the inverse functions are going to work on radians how about let's do cosine inverse of one cosine inverse of one says all right um well what's cosine deal with cosine deals with the x coordinate so what cosine inverse of 1 says is here is an x coordinate of 1. find me an angle remember this is asking for an angle is an output find me an angle that gives me an x coordinate of 1. well an x-coordinate 1 would be let's see right there that's an x-coordinate of 1. well it also has to be on 0 to pi so from zero to pi we're not talking about two pi we're talking about zero to pi so our exponent of one happens at an angle of again zero why does this have to take place on zero to pi and not two pi well that's how we restricted our vein our domain is restricted from zero to pi that's from here to here the x coordinate only is one at that exact point let's talk about tan inverse of negative one remember what these inverse functions say they're opposite of our original trig functions trig functions say give me in an angle i'll give you out a coordinate inverses say i'm going to give you a coordinate or a ratio coordinates i want you to give me the angle that makes that so this says i want you to give me an x a y compared to an x that is negative one i want tan inverse of negative one says the ratio of y range remember tangent is y over x is negative one give me an angle that makes the the y over x equal to negative one but also remember that we restricted this so our domain for tangent is negative pi over two to pi over two again we're looking just on this part of our unit circle just on this part of an x-axis means this part of your unit circle it's got to be from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 that's it just 1 and 4 or 4 and 1. so where would tangent be negative 1 well tangent of an angle gives me negative 1 when the y and x are the same but opposite signs well that would be root 2 over 2 divided by root 2 over 2 but that's positive or negative root 2 over 2 over root 2 over 2. oh that's negative so where tangent what angle would give me a tangent of negative one what angle would give me a y over x that equals negative one it would have to be negative pi over four now look not seven pi over four that would be all the way around that's not the idea tangent has to be from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. so for inverses your inputs must be coordinates or ratio of coordinates and your outputs must be angles but they have to be on the domain that you restricted hope that makes sense otherwise otherwise we're outside of that one-to-one nature of how we cut our domain we have to get one-to-one that's why we said exclude everything outside of this but if you exclude everything outside of this you are taking away most well at least half of your unit circle and that's what we've done here so tan inverse of negative one says i want my i want to find the angle where tangent of that angle gives me negative one that's negative pi over four let's keep on going so cosine inverse of negative 1 remember what inverses do inverses say i'm going to give you whatever an x coordinate is for this case this is cosine i want you to tell me the angle that gives me this x coordinate so cosine deals with x coordinate on a unit circle cosine inverse of negative 1 says find me the angle that has an x coordinate of negative one but keep in mind that you have to be on that you have to be on on that part of your your unit circle or x axis or this is your range basically isn't it so for for inverses domains this but range is that it's the inverse of our trig functions so the the easy way to do is go find me your x coordinate just make sure you're between the appropriate domain so x coordinate is negative one on zero to pi that would be pi so on that particular part of your your unit circle this would be pi cosine of pi equals negative one yeah so cosine inverse of negative 1 equals pi that's the way this works sine of 0 gives me 0 sine inverse of 0 is 0. okay cosine of 0 gives me 1 cosine of the angle 0 and radians always in radians is going to give you 1. so cosine inverse of 1 gives me 0. um it's an easier one to kind of think about tangent of negative pi over 4 is negative 1. so tangent inverse of negative 1 has to be negative pi over 4. they have to relate that way there can't be two options that's why we restricted the domain how a tangent inverse of zero so what this is asking is give me the angle where tangent of that angle gives me zero so tangent of what angle gives me zero so tan tan inverse of zero says your your your ratio of y to x has to be zero but you also have to be on that part of the unit circle from here to here where is tangent zero uh tangent of zero would be zero so tan inverse of zero is also zero what this is saying is that the ratio of y to x is only zero if your angle is zero that would be zero over one nowhere else on this interval would that be take place now if you did the whole unit circle that would take place here too so it'd be at zero and it'd be at pi that's why we had to cut it and say no no we can't have that we need it only on what to happen one time that's one to one so inverses make sense and you have these non-functions if you don't do that from here you probably could try a couple we're gonna do several more but i i really need to make sense so sine inverse of square root of 2 over 2 what that asks is give me the angle that creates this y coordinate of root 2 over 2. so for sine for for cosine for tangent think of the appropriate coordinate so sine relates to a y coordinate so sine number says your y coordinate is root two over two find that all right but keep in mind that we're only from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. that's what this that's why it was so darn important so from here to here finding the y coordinate the square root of 2 over 2. well that's here so this must be pi over 4. says what angle gives me a y coordinate y y and sine what angle gives me a y coordinate of square root of 2 over 2 that's pi over 4. what angle gives me a ratio of zero over whatever who cares that would be zero what angle gives me an x coordinate of negative one that's pi what angle gives me a y coordinate of zero that's zero what angle gives me an x coordinate of one that's zero what angle gives me a ratio of negative one over one that would be that angle that negative pi over four and that's that's how we're really thinking about this how about this one what angle gives me a x coordinate y x coordinate we need to know that cosine means x coordinate on your unit circle what angle that's what we're finding is going to give me an x coordinate of negative square root of 3 over 2. let's find that but keep in mind where we are we have to be between 0 and pi for cosine inverse so from zero to pi on this part coordinates one and two where is our x coordinate negative square root of three over two well here's a negative square root of three over two that's five pi over six i really hope that that is making sense to you i hope that you're seeing that the reason why we cut this the reason why and you saw it first with with a graph saying yeah you had to be one to one for inverses to happen but now you're seeing the practicality of that if we do not make those restricted as far as the domains then we would get two outputs for every input on an inverse that would be a problem we couldn't do that you see you can't it can't be okay to say hey what angle gives you an x coordinate that's negative square root of three over two and you go oh this angle and this angle because they both have negative square root of three over two that's not okay because this would be a non-function one input would give us two different angles two different outputs that's a big problem that's why we restricted it but that also means that sine and sine inverse only work on quadrants four and one and tangent and tangent inverse only relate on four and one and cosine cosine inverse only work together on quadrants one and two that's how these inverses have to work so the things to remember as you move forward is that with a trig function you plug in angle you get out a point with inverses you plug in a point and you find the angle that gives you that point that's important and you must always follow that domain so let's practice a couple more and we're going to start working on these inverse relationships all right let's do a few more so how about sine inverse of negative square root of three over two what it's saying is that i want you to find the angle that has a y coordinate sine relates to y sine inverse relates to y it's saying this is your y coordinate now if i mean the angle that gives me that but keep in mind where sine behaves as far as its inverse is concerned where it creates an inverse from negative pi over two pi over two so but then your heads are thinking yeah sine and sine inverse will only work really on the fourth and first quadrants so negative square root 3 over 2 so that we don't avoid this non-function idea where one input gives me two outputs because if i do not restrict this right now then you could do this you could say hey it's uh well let's see it would be here and here that word and cannot work when we're finding outputs that's why we restricted we said okay we need to make a choice right we need to cut this domain somewhere where it's one to one and so what we chose to do was negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. we could have chosen other other domains but we didn't we chose negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 because it tends to be the easiest one for us to work with so it says finding the y coordinate i got it here and here but only one of those will work on that particular domain where we cut this to find our inverse so yeah i'm just going to ignore this one i'm just going to work on this formula so our y coordinates this the angle that creates that is be careful it's not five pi over three that goes all the way around here it's negative pi over three from negative pi over two to pi over two you cannot break that rule so what that says is the angle that causes us to get a y coordinate of negative square root 3 over 2 but on that interval is negative pi over 3. that's the truth now how about sine inverse of negative square root of two over two the same thing applies this says i want you to find me the angle that causes me to get a y coordinate of negative square root of two over two negative square root two over two is here this is on our unit part of the unit circle for which our inverse is defined that's going to be negative pi over 4 not 7 pi over 4 negative pi over 4. now tangent's a bit harder why well because tangent's a ratio one of the things to uh that helps us out a little bit with our with our signs is understanding that that tangent is positive on our first quadrant only so if you have a tan inverse of something positive you're looking right here just like if we had a sine that's negative you're looking right here no nowhere else uh if we never use this quadrant for any of our inverses so it's just four and one for sine of tangent one and two for cosine cosine inverse how about tan inverse of the square root of three i don't see that anywhere well that's because tangent relates to a ratio so we really have to think about this this says find me the angle that creates for me a ratio of y to x of square root of three here's the the way that i do this um if it has a square root of 3 in it and it's not square root of 3 over 3 what i would typically do is see what ratio causes me to cancel out something that's not a square root i know that sounds a little weird but i'm looking for square root of 3 on the numerator because i know i don't get a fraction and we're dividing by one half so how i'm thinking about it is and you can guess and check your way through it i'm thinking about it tangent is positive here my my coordinates are positive both positive here i know tangent is defined only here so i'm looking at quadrant number one and i'm thinking what ratio of y to x is going to give me square root of three it's not this one one half divided by square root of three over two is going to give me one over the square root of three but square root of three over two divided by one half that one half is going to cancel you're gonna get the square root of three might take a little bit of time and work but the angle that's needed is pi over three tangent of pi over three is going to give you the square root of three therefore tan inverse of square root of three is pi over 3. this is often times where one of those tables comes in handy you get a table of just your value common values it puts this on like a a chart and that is very nice to have so if you have that that's great you can also use that as well now how about tan inverse of square root of three over three you know that's that's even harder yeah that's right that's because it's been rationalized so we maybe guess our check gets to check our way through it but please keep this in mind tan inverse of square root of three over three says the ratio of your y to x has to be square root of 3 over 3. find me the angle that gives you that more than that this is positive so you must be in quadrant 1 right now satisfying that but in quadrant one because that's giving you positives so we'd say all right uh let's see square root of three over three one half divided by square root of three over two the twos are going to cancel you're gonna get one over the square root of three if you rationalize it it will end up giving you square root 3 over 3 and so our appropriate angle is pi over 6 here those might take you a bit of time but i'm hoping you understand the idea this is asking the reverse question of our original trig functions original trig said here's your angle find me a coordinate or a ratio of coordinates inverses say here's a ratio of coordinates find me the angle that makes that but you have to restrict your domain again sine is here and sine inverse works here cosine works 0 to pi and tangent inverse negative pi over 2 pi over 2 but not including those endpoints so hopefully this makes sense i hope that i've explained this a little bit to you right here what about the ones that don't work on the inner circle like sine inverse of 1 8 you go what in the world what's what's that mean now think about it sine inverse of 1 8 says your y coordinate would be 1 8. now is it on a unit circle yes it is yes it's somewhere but it's not in one of these common values so 1 8 a y coordinate 1 8 would be like right there so it's maybe right there not very high this would be a positive angle but not a very big one according to zero use your calculator for this but oh my goodness please make sure that you are in radians you have to be in radians so sine inverse of 1 8 you're going to get like 0.125 notice they're approximate these are not exact very few of them are actually exact unless you plug in something that's a very common angle like that uh cosine inverse of the square root of two over three now that's that's tempting you want to make you want to say oh it's this one it's not it's not that one it's square root of two over three not square root of three over two so don't jump to conclusions here what this would say is what where would your x coordinate be square root of two divided by three that's like oh man like 0.5 or something it's somewhere over here it is positive though right this is a positive x coordinate it's somewhere here it'll be somewhere between zero and pi over two is termed in terms of your radians it's 1.08 roughly lastly we can do the same thing with tangent inverse you'll also notice that we have met our domain this is somewhere between i'll look at it our domain had to be negative 1 to 1 negative 1 to 1 and anything for tan inverse so 1 8 is between there square root of 2 over 3 that's between negative 1 and 1 negative 3 that's between negative infinity infinity and if we use our calculator in terms of radians and say tan inverse of negative 3 we're going to get about negative 1.25 so i hope we've made it clear i hope it made clear that the inputs for inverse functions are coordinates or ratios coordinates their outputs are angles asking what angle gives me that coordinate so we're going to come back and then look at the composition so we talked about that a little bit but now we're going to focus on that so when can you do it what happens if you're outside of this domain what do you do then so we'll be back in just a second all right let's try a few compositions they're actually not that bad there's a couple cases where some weird things happen we have to change a couple things about it not a big deal but here's the main thing to understand when you compose a function and its inverse they will cancel provided you've met the appropriate domain so here's the only thing you have to check make sure you have an actual composition that works so sine inverse of sine or sine of sine inverse and and likewise for cosine and tangent and make sure the domain of the inside piece fits with what you're trying to cancel so let's let's take a look at it again this always works so function with an inverse composed or inverse of the function compose always cancel what's that mean is that take a look at cosine inverse of cosine this is going to cancel provided that is in the domain that we want for inside function or we can change it to something which is kind of prefaces or foreshadows where we're going with it so here's what we're going to do cos cosine inverse of cosine says as long as this is on the domain of cosine where we restricted this to find an inverse function we can cancel this right now so look at your inside function cosine okay check out the domain of cosine zero to pi so remember we restricted cosine so the inverses work but only on that domain well 4 pi over 5 it's between 0 and pi it's positive it's less than pi and how do we know that it's not on my unit circle it doesn't have to be this works all the time so i said that this works all the time doesn't even matter where that's at but if you think about four pi over five four pi over five five pi over five would be pi well it's positive and not yet pi so it's somewhere in here somewhere in quadrant two who cares does it really matter what matters is that cosine inverse of cosine you for your inside function of cosine this is on the domain that we restricted to find inverse function what that means is this is gonna cancel and give you exactly four fifths pi four fifths higher or four pi over five if you want and that's that's all we really are doing we're checking to make sure the domain fits of our inside function and then these inverses will cancel our functions if they match up so sine inverse of sine of negative three pi over seven check your inside function sine is restricted to negative pi over two to pi over 2. as long as this fits as long as this is somewhere on there you're going to cancel this that's what we really want to do so where is negative 3 pi over 7 well negative 3 pi over 7 is negative so it's this way three pi over seven well that's um that's three well three pi cut into seven parts or maybe think about it this way 3.5 of out of 7 would be this so we're somewhere in here 3.5 pi over seven if you if you kind of think about it weird like that would be somewhere right here it would be exactly there so negative three pi over seven is it's in that interval if you want to do some calculated work and estimate this here's the point is that this only works if that is on that check your inside function make sure your argument meets your domain it is negative 3 pi over 7 is somewhere between negative pi over two and pi over two if that's the case then the inverse works and you can cancel it so do compositions of functions the inverses always cancel out yes they do as long as the domain of the inside function is is legit basically um so this was on that that's the function that's the the restricted domain that we needed for cosine therefore you cancel this was on that that's a restricted domain we have for sign so you cancel them what happens when it's not for instance negative pi over 3 is clearly not on zero to pi hey cosine was restricted to zero pi so on your inside function you're trying to cancel out this has to be on the domain that you restricted to be able to find the inverse do you see why that why that has to be that way if you're not on that domain where you said an inverse exists the inverse doesn't exist for that so you have to change it somehow so what in the world do we do well we can do a couple fancy things with it number one thing we can do is use even an oddness so if we have cosine of negative pi over three cosine's an even function what that means is that cosine of negative pi over three and cosine of pi over three are exactly the same so here's what this is doing we're not doing magic what we're saying is cosine inverse of cosine of negative pi over 3 is going to be the same thing as cosine inverse of cosine of pi over 3. because these are equivalent you're making that change um here here's what we're going to do i know it seems almost like we're cheating like why should people do that if inverses didn't exist the inverse doesn't exist because if you if you don't have a restricted domain because you start doubling up outputs and therefore when you when you reverse this to an inverse an input gives you two outputs it's not even a function so what we're doing here is we're saying okay let's take a look at maybe taking the same output and saying it would fit here on this restricted domain remember they all repeat every so often the period and so that's basically what we're doing here is saying yeah you know what we're just took a look at the the excluded values and seeing what they would be on our interval that we restricted there's another way to do it here's another way to do it if you find out what your x coordinate is for something that's outside of your domain just find something on your domain with the same x coordinate for cosine i'm going to show you right now so the first thing i did was cosine is even you can basically change signs use that evenness and you're okay what about negative pi over 3 we did a different way negative pi over 3 is right here it has an x value or x coordinate of one half find another angle on the domain for what you restricted to get your inverse function that has that same value for the chord you're looking at so for cosine remember cosine's x so find the x coordinate for cosine of negative pi over 3 one half find me something on that interval with the same x coordinate so that interval is somewhere over here finding this x coordinate somewhere here well that's uh that's right here that's right wait a minute that's pi over 3. that's true cosine of negative pi over 3 and cosine of pi over 3 have the same x coordinate that's why they're equivalent cosine only relates to the x coordinate who cares what angle it is as long as it's on the interval and has the same x coordinate it will work out and so as long as we've made this somehow into that interval they're going to simplify and this will give you pi over 3. you just have to make it on the interval first that's the biggest deal how about cosine inverse of cosine of negative five pi over three but where's negative five pi over three oh my gosh well negative five pi over three is one two three that would be negative three pi over three four five wait a minute five so look at this negative five pi over three has an x coordinate of one half pi over three has an x coordinate of one half what does that mean well if negative five pi over 3 is a negative rotation well wait a minute our interval is from 0 pi you can't even have negative angles but that coterminates with pi over 3 find an angle with the same coordinate of what your what you have here that's outside of your domain and get what this does what this does is takes your oscillating function that we we looked at it goes back and forth and says if you have something outside of that domain that you restricted it's going to relate to something on that domain that you did restrict it's going to say yeah that that um that pi over three gives us an output of one half and a negative five pi over three is the output of one half you're just looking at where it fits on the interval that you restricted it's kind of like a phase shift uh really you're kind of moving it to that point and so we go negative five pi over three is this that has an x coordinate one half let's just take something on 0 to pi that has the same coordinate that's pi over 3. so this is identical to that we just need to make sure we fit the domain of the inside function as soon as that happens inverses are going to cancel your function and this is pi over 3 also i hope you see why it's important some students who don't get this just go oh they always cancel i'm going to get negative 5 pi over 3. how how can you do that when that's outside the domain that doesn't even make sense really so we need to make sure that we're fitting the domain of the inside function all right let's take a look at a couple more these ones really are tricky we're not going to be meeting our our domain over inside function we're going to have to change some things and one of the ways to do it is again just look at look at where your y coordinate would be for sine or your x for cosine or the ratio for tangent so let's take a look at sine inverse of sine sine of nine pi over eight oh my gosh that is not on the domain of negative pi over two pi over two hopefully you understand that's outside of it so let's see where this is 9 pi over 8 do you see that that's 1 pi over 8 past pi so what what pi is from here to here so this is pi 9 pi over 8 would divide pi of eight spots and go nine of them so it's one more than that so nine pi over eight is like one and one eighth pi one two three four five six and eight and then one more nine pi over eight would be somewhere in quadrant three let's say right there i'm not being exact but let's just say that hopefully that makes sense to you you cut this pie into eight eight pieces and you count nine of them so one two three four five six seven eight that would be nine pi over eight that's this angle right there nine five right now here's the deal whenever we did this with the actual unit circle like five minutes ago what we did is we found an angle with the same y value we found an angle with the same y value so what would that y value be that y value would be now again y y well that sign gives you the y so the y coordinate of 9 pi over 8 is going to be right here this height well if sine relates to the y let's find something on the domain of sine for where we found the inverse that negative pi over 2 pi over 2 that has the same y coordinate so here's what we're thinking if this is the y coordinate let's let's say that height i want something over here that has the same y value it's not going to be up here that would be positive y would be like that well what angle would that be on this interval of the unit circle well let's see if this is nine pi over eight that would be negative pi over eight remember that this was eight pi over 8 and this was 1 pi over 8 past pi that was 1 2 3 5 7 8 and then 1 1 pi over 8 after that these would have the same y value i hope you see that i hope you see that the height of this would be whatever this y coordinate is that would have the same thing if this angle is 9 pi over 8 then this would be negative pi rate and have the same exact y coordinate this is one way that we can not cheat but you use our our understanding of the this um kind of uh symmetric nature of the y-axis on that so sine inverse of sine of nine pi over 8 would be the same as sine inverse sine of negative pi over 8. why we had to do it was this is not on the domain this is on the domain that we restricted as soon as it happens as soon as you make it on your domain they will cancel and that would give you negative pi over 8. let's talk about tangent tan inverse of tangent of 4 pi over 5 firstly locate wherever this angle is so look at your look at your inside function locate where that is on the domain if it's in your domain you're good to go if it's not like we did just here this was outside the domain this was our domain that we needed for the inside function we were all the way over here uh what do you do about that well you have to figure out the same y coordinate on on your domain and this would be negative pi right that's why we did that for tangent tangent also says you need to be in here somewhere 4 pi over 5 is well let's see if we cut pi into 5 pieces remember we're not counting that one one two three four cuts makes one two three this is one piece four five four pi over five would be here 4 pi over 5 would be there that would be that that angle so what we need to do is figure out a ratio that's the same for the y according to the x well now our y value according to our x value would be well what would it be positive or negative think hard about that where is this point right now this angle is 4 pi over 3 but that point has a positive y and a negative x so if i wanted to find something that's on our domain this is outside of it i need to be from here to here that i'm going to have to pick something with a negative ratio positive y negative x this is positive y and a negative x for that point i'm going to need a positive x and negative y if i want to get the same sign but be on my domain that would be negative pi over 5. so negative pi over 5 is going to have the same exact ratio as 4 pi over 5 does when you're talking about tangent only this time negative pi over 5 is actually on that domain for the inside function that we need and because of that now we can allow that inverse to cancel the function so the whole long story condensing it a little bit is that your inverses only work if you meet the domain that's required of them for tangent sine and cosine you have a very specific domain for sine you must have negative pi over 2 pi over 2 you have to be somewhere on that part of your unit circle for cosine of 0 to pi you have to be somewhere on that unit circle we'll be able to change there tangent same thing negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 or be able to change a an equivalent relationship on that part of the unit circle so if your angle is outside of that you got to change to it somehow and it doesn't have to be easy this i don't think this is easy this takes a lot of thought to say nine power rates here the same y value would be reflected would be there that would be negative pi rate this ratio would be whatever this angle is the ratio would be reflect that you're going to have that exact same ratio it's negative pi over 5. you're going to like these so when we go backwards it's actually a lot easier why because if it does not fit the domain you just can't do it so when we're going to take a look at sine of sine inverse cosine cosine inverse so you'll see that switch the the switches now we're finding if they're both inverses of each other when you take that relationship but sine of sine inverse you must fit the domain of the inside function when we reversed it did sine inverse of sine if that was outside of the domain when we restricted we can move it because of the way that it oscillates because the way it cycles we can we can sort of adjust it and say what would a point be with the saint or what would an angle be with the same y uh coordinate or x coordinate or ratio but here we can't do that and you'll see why when we get to some that are not possible in this case all we have to do is check whether or not we fit the domain of the inside function if we do you can do it it will simplify remember either way you go a function simplifies with its inverse inverse simplifies with its root function so sine of sine numbers that's going to cancel as long as that is on the domain of what that needs to make it happen so side inverse says you got to be between negative 1 and 1 all right is 1 4 between negative 1 and 1. yeah so it fits these cancel and you get one four cosine of cosine inverse of negative two thirds the inside functions cosine inverse is this on the domain cosine number says you need to be between negative one and one is negative two thirds between negative one and one yeah so it fits the domain of the inside function cosine of cosine inverse therefore can cancel as long as you fit the domain it will simplify remember that whenever you do simplify you get whatever's on the inside so function of its inverse is you're going to get that x this is your inside step that is your argument so when a function cancels its inverse your inverse cancels a function you're going to get the argument whatever was in there how about tangent of tan inverse of negative two let's take a look at that domain for tan inverse so domain of inside function says you've got to be between negative infinity and infinity we're probably good to go yeah negative 2 is between there that means that this satisfies the domain that means the function and its inverse can relate to another on that domain and you're going to get negative 2. when they cancel they cancel for good this is also how we're going to solve some equations later involve trig functions or inverse trig functions now what happens when it doesn't work sine of sine inverse of negative 2 remember you must fit your domain of your inside function sine inverse says you have to be between negative one and one what if you're not then this is not defined you know why not because the the premise fails and here's the premise think about this for a second really think about it sine inverse of negative two says give me an angle that has a y coordinate of negative 2 on the unit circle and you go there is no coordinate of negative 2 on the unit circle i know that's why this fails if you pull out your inner circle right now and you look to say give me a white chord a negative two there's not one you can't get one and so this says there's no way to find this it's completely outside not not just the domain it's outside the range of sign you can't give me an angle that gives me an output of negative 2. it's impossible to do and therefore this fails and we say that's not defined i'm just going to do that but you can write undefined not defined whatever you want to do same thing would happen with cosine of cosine inverse of negative of 1.3 cosine inverse needs negative 1 to 1. 1.3 is outside of that so this says find me an angle that gives me an x coordinate on a unit circle of 1.3 you go wait the biggest x coordinates are one i know and so there's no angle that does that cosine needs an angle if there is no angle then you can't do it just like sine needed an angle this angle was impossible so it can't answer that question this is why it was so important to make sure that you meet your domain of your inside function whether we have an inverse for inside function or whether we had a normal trig function for the inside of that function the thing about what we did before is that with your unit circle because of the period of a normal trig function it oscillates and it repeats and so oftentimes we can manipulate that sort of massage that to work but you cannot do that for your inverse trig function so if it's in the domain great cancel out you're good if it's not then you're done it's undefined you can't go any further so i hope that made that make sense to you we don't do this very often what we do more often is um is use this to find inverses what you're going to do in the next video and then solve things with this and so i'm going to show you exactly how that happens but the biggest idea that i get across is whenever you have inverses being composed they cancel we're going to use that to our advantage to take inverses of both sides of an equation and they're going to cancel for us but you have to have the domain of your inside function match up with this if your inside function is one of your normal trig functions or this if it's an inverse function if this doesn't work it's not possible if it's outside of this you can change it using a period or using kevin the last two things that we did is find an appropriate y value on the part of the unit circle so if it's outside of your domain that you needed to restrict to make this inverse thing even possible you have to find the appropriate coordinate or ratio coordinates on the portion of the unit circle that is defined for your inverse that's a big deal hope that makes sense and i'll see you for another video when we start talking about how to find inverses of trig functions 

Transcript for: How to Find Inverse Trigonometric Functions (Precalculus - Trigonometry 19)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video what we're going to do is we're going to try to find some inverse trig functions so based on something like that can we find an inverse function i want to first remember just a little bit about what we need in order for this to happen for sine cosine and tangent we had to restrict the domain in order to create a one-to-one piece of this function about which we could find an inverse and so what i want you to remember is that for sine in order for us to find an inverse your domain has to be negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 inclusive where cosine is 0 to pi inclusive and for tangent it's negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 without those endpoints in it we have to make sure that whatever is here falls in whatever's there so there's a few things that i really need you to get number one when you find an inverse the first thing that we're going to do is find the domain and the range why well because for inverse function inputs numbers change domain becomes range and range becomes domain so if we can find our domain and our range of our original function we automatically have the domain and the range of our inverse they're just reversed and that's that makes it so much nicer than trying to find domain twice and trying to find range twice so we're gonna do that first secondly i need you to think of this x in the broadest possible sense what i need to think of it is as whatever's here must be somewhere between negative pi over 2 and pi over 2. i have interval notation and inequality notation but in all these cases we'll mostly use this one i'm going to show you why that is i'm just making the transition because i know i've used this and i want you to be familiar with this as well so in the broadest sense of it whatever's inside my function must be somewhere between these values and we're going to use that to find domain the last thing we're going to talk about is range remember what range is the biggest possible value sine can ever get is one and same for cosine and the smallest possible value sine can never get is negative one same for cosine tangent goes from negative infinity to positive infinity or positive to negative you reflect it and we're going to use that to find our range as well so i'm going to lead you through a series of steps they're obviously not all that hard if you remember how to find the inverse of any function then the inverse of this is exactly the same we're just going to use the appropriate inverse like sine inverse for sine cosine versus cosine and so forth so let's get started before we go anywhere when finding an inverse function we want to find the domain and we want to find the range and so here's what we do for the domain we look inside this we identify what tree function we have 5 sine x plus 2 in that parenthesis is very important saying that plus 2 is outside of the function it's not inside that it's not it's not a left or right phase shift if you will this is a vertical shift so it's affecting the outputs it's not affecting the domain that's important it's not nice and input it's not affecting the domain and so we're identifying firstly well what function we have if we have sine as we do here we know that the domain has to be this in order for us to be able to find an inverse function that's that's got to really make sense it's got to make sense that we had to cut the domain so that we had a one-to-one function so that we could find an inverse well what that means is that we still have to obey this and here's the way i'm always going to lead you to find domain with our trig functions at least for the inverses we're going to take whatever's here and put it in between whatever's here for the appropriate function in this case it's just x so we're going to say all right for our domain because we're dealing with sine and we can only find the inverse of sine on a very certain portion of the x-axis so where we have a one-to-one function that's negative pi over two to pi over two whatever's here if it's not just x like x plus five x minus one uh three x plus two whatever that is goes here for the appropriate function that you have that's the easiest way to find domain and it's also why i'm leading you to inequality notation rather than interval because you can actually do math on this and it's easiest way to go so we say what function okay find the domain where we can find inverse we got it put whatever's there right there and then you would solve it now this is why we learned about compound inequalities such a long long time ago so that you can solve things like this now this has nothing to do you're solved you're done you have just found your domain done and that's very very nice so we know that in order to find the inverse of sine we must be between these two values for input of x hopefully that makes sense the next thing we do is find the range now there's a variety of ways you can do this sometimes you'll hear people say hey just plug this in plug this in i'll give you a range that's not quite true because it doesn't have to give you the peak and the valley right at those points so here's maybe a better way to go about it think about the smallest possible value that this function can be don't even worry about this just what's the highest and lowest values that sine can be well the lowest value sign can be is negative one well imagine that somewhere in this continuous part of this function on this domain you're gonna get a negative one so let's imagine that so imagine hey sine of x can in its minimum be negative one negative one times five plus negative five plus 2 is negative 3. so it seems right that the very lowest value you could possibly get here's is negative 3. that's this oh man the the smallest thing you get here is negative 1 times 5 plus 2 is negative 3. and you could actually get it out you would use a bracket there now what's the largest value well sine of x whatever the the largest sign could ever get right here this little piece is 1. 5 times 1 is 5 plus 2 is 7. so the largest value this function could be is 7. so we're just really taking what the the range of our original sine function is made one to one and using those smallest and largest values and imagining somewhere in that interval you're going to get them and then times five plus two or the four either negative one or one is going to give you the smallest and largest values and everything between because we have a continuous part of that function now you can also see it this way it's more common to see interval notation but you can't see it both ways so we find domain no problem we can use domain to find the range we can plug it in you could do this sine of negative pi over 2 is negative 1. 5 times negative 1 plus 2 is negative 3 sine of pi over 2 is 1 5 times 1 plus 2 is 7. that's that's also okay to do now that we've determined our domain and range it's going to be so useful because we're going to go ahead and go through the process of finding the inverse function and once we do we'll already have the domain and the range for it range will become domain domain will become range but it's way easier to do it here than after you're done so how many oh i hope you remember how to actually find inverse functions it's a several step process the first step is instead of using function notation replace your f of x or g of x or whatever your function name is with y no problem that's pretty easy after that we change our y into an x and our x's into y's and then we solve for the y why because in doing that it's actually operation for operation function for function undoing whatever you have here so when we replace y with x and x with y and i tell you hey solve for y you're gonna have to undo the plus two you're gonna undo the times five you're gonna have to undo the function sign with an inverse that's completely undoing this that's what inverses do inverses undo functions term for term operation preparation function for function so we're going to go ahead and solve for y right now when you have to solve an inverse or solve for a variable like this you have to isolate whatever function you're dealing with so we're going to isolate that sign you also have to undo everything around the function so no no addition no subtraction no multiplication nothing so we'll divide both sides by five and lastly how in the world you solve for y now this is why we introduced inverse functions inverse functions undo the the root function of the parent function so if we have sine of y what are the sign inverse that's how we introduce it we know that they undo each other we are going to purposely introduce a composition of an inverse and its root function a composition of an inverse and function or a function and inverse always cancel that was the whole last video that's why we did that but you had to meet the domain that's exactly why we do the domain first to say hey this is only going to be valid if we meet this where'd this come from where our cut up x-axis caused us to have a one-to-one function so that we could even have an inverse so this says this is when it's one-to-one this is when it's one-to-one so that you'll be able to find an inverse let's go ahead and do it we're right here and it says because you've met your domain now you can actually find or use the inverse because it will be one-to-one on this portion of the x-axis that's the whole thing all wrapped up it's pretty cool so when we do a sine inverse once you do to one side you have to do it on the other and you have to put it in order so we're going to have sine inverse of the left side universal right and here's here it is again sine inverse of sine of y we know that inverse functions kill off functions if you compose a function's inverse they're done you're just going to get y and the reason why this works is because this domain fits this it's because we we cut it we said on this part it's one to one it satisfies the inverse and that right there is our inverse function we just have to call it that so we're going to say instead of y we're going to name it back as the function that we had with an inverse notation so f with that little negative one thing that we say f inverse don't say after the negative one or f little minus one thing for that before two um this is pronounced f inverse so this is f inverse it's the inverse of f these are inverse functions we've named that that says f inverse is sine inverse of x minus two plus five now if you were to compose these these should actually cancel out and you can probably see it check this out if you compose this here where that is sine of sine inverse would immediately cancel because you met that domain you'd have x minus 2 over 5 5 over 5 cancels x minus 2 plus 2 gives you x and that's exactly what should happen when you compose a function inverse everything should cancel and you should get x at the very end and that would actually happen either way we compose those provided around that domain now the last thing we're going to do because we already figured out the domain and the range remember that with inverse functions they switch so the range is now our domain and what we see is that our input has to be between negative 3 and 7 inclusive and our output f of f inverse of x that is the output for this function will be between negative pi over 2 and pi over 2. so we just take these we switch them because inputs become outputs outputs become inputs that happen right here so our domain and range also have to change notice something remember that the the inputs for sine inverse are from negative one to one check out what happens if you plug in negative three negative three minus two is negative five negative five over negative five sorry negative five over five is negative one seven seven minus two is five five over five is one this is the boundary of the smallest and largest values we could even put into sine inverse that's why we did it first here so it makes sense there so find domains find range and switch them for your inverse that's really all there is we're going to do maybe two more examples talking about cosine and tangent just so we can be complete but this is the whole idea the hardest part is finite domain then finding range from it that's actually not as hard this should make sense we've done inverses a lot so what we're going to do is come back and do a couple more examples let's get right to it so we have g of x equals negative tangent of x plus 1 minus 3. find your domain first so we're going to recognize what function we're dealing with tangent on what portion of the x-axis can we actually find an inverse on what portion is it one to one well that was negative pi over two to pi over two but not inclusive so not using that uh less than or equal to but just a strictly less than so here's what we're going to do we're going to say this we can find it an inverse on that interval let's write the boundaries there remember we're using x in the most general terms so this can be whatever is there let's start by showing our our left and right portions of our inequality notation for our domain so we know we know that whatever's here has to be between negative pi over two and pi over two since we're dealing with tangent whatever's here has to be between negative pi over two and pi over two so we're going to show that and say okay this part has to end up being between these two things let's just put this here and solve for x if you solve for x it will find your domain for you which is really nice that just means we have to subtract one if you remember compound inequalities what you do to the middle you do to both sides as well so x plus one minus one gives us x pi over two minus one is pi over two minus one and negative pi over two minus one is negative pi over 2 minus 1. now that's a pretty awkward domain but that is your domain that gives you the smallest and largest values not inclusively that you could plug into this and actually get something out i thought that's interesting to you what if you were to plug in this value in this value just like the regular tangent function if you were to plug in pi over 2 and negative pi over 2 you would get undefined they were vertical asymptotes if you remember that that's why there's no equals there that's why there's no equals here and here i hope you like that technique i hope it actually makes sense to you sometimes it looks like magic where did that come from it's not hard identify the function identify the domain and put whatever's there in between them and then solve it you just found your domain now as far as your range is concerned we need to understand where tangent goes tangence ranges from negative infinity to infinity well if this goes eventually from negative infinity to negative to positive infinity major infinity times a negative that's positive infinity plus three it's still positive infinity what about positive infinity times negative one be negative infinity plus three is still negative infinity so our range is still going to be all real numbers here so we've taken the time we said tangent must be between negative pi over two and pi over two oh sorry the um the domain of tangent is between negative pi over two and pi over two this is what we put between there we see this has to fit there and then we solve it range is not too bad and now we're going to solve for the inverse function so we're going to replace our function name g of x with y we're going to switch our y to x and our x's to y and then we're going to solve for y so let's uh let's go ahead and let's add three we're going to try to isolate that tangent and then use a tan inverse you cannot use a tan inverse you can't use any inverse function without the function right by itself like that so we're going to add 3 and then divide by negative 1 actually so adding 3 we'll divide by negative 1. if we divide by negative one this whole thing is over negative one and we get negative x minus three now we're ready to take tan inverse so we're i'm going to write that i'm going to write tan inverse on both sides don't ignore that don't don't be fancy about it just like well i know what's going to happen it's it's fairly important to show what's going on here so i'm going to write tan of y plus 1 and then tan inverse of the left-hand side of that it's important to get the side correct also and then negative x minus three and tan inverse on the left-hand side of that do these cancel if you will do they simplify when we get y plus one yes because we're identifying the domain on which that is possible if we don't identify the domain it makes it seem like you do it all the time well you can't because tangent is not a one to one function we had to restrict this so that this would be one-to-one when we're dealing with it that's why that's why we had to deal with domain when you're first going through domain you know why is this important it's important because it lets what we want to do be possible without doing that and restricting it we can't do that which we want to do right now so we're going to get just y plus one when we compose inverses with functions or they're basically their base function they they simplify we just get y plus one on the left hand side we get tan inverse of negative x minus three we simply need to subtract one and we'll have solve for the inverse function then we'll name it as g inverse notice it's not f inverse is a super common mistake it's not a huge deal but it is an important one that if your function is g of x you don't want to be going and writing f inverse because that it doesn't make sense this is the inverse of the function g so subtracting one we get tan inverse of negative x minus three and then minus one we're going to call this g inverse of x if you were to compose it this whole thing would fit in that variable what's the first thing you do you take this whole thing and then you would add one with negative one plus one is zero tangent of the tan inverse would give you negative x minus three that negative would say let's see positive x plus three so x plus three minus three give you x it actually works if you compose these that's a great way to check your work you don't have to but if you're curious like hey does it does actually work out yeah it does but it only does it if this is the input for that function and likewise if we find the domain and range for inverse whatever this is so our domain is our range from our original function so our domain says you can actually do this with anything in your inverse function all real numbers would work there why because the the the domain of your inverse tangent is all real numbers plug in anything it's going to work just fine the range however the range is the domain that we had here that says that your inverse function will at at minimum give you negative pi over 2 minus 1 but not including that that will be a oh my gosh it'll be a horizontal asymptote do you remember that about tan inverse how it has this horizontal asymptote we're between it just like the tangent itself had vertical asymptote and we're between it so we went like that this will have a minimum of this but not ever reach its horizontal asymptote and then it will uh it will get a maximum of negative pi over two plus one and that's exactly what this this says for us so i hope that makes sense um kind of nice finding domain and range first right because you just reverse them just make sure that when you do that you understand that your range becomes your domain for your input variable that your g inverse of x should not go here this is your input we're talking about and likewise for your range you should not have an x there it should have your inverse function the function will be between whatever your domain was whatever your x was between here for your domain that's the point so we'll come back we'll do one more we'll talk about cosine okay just about down so we have h of x equals 2 cosine 3x plus 2 and then minus 1. find your domain first means look at the part of the cosine function that you need to restrict so that you have a one-to-one function and we have that right here cosine has to be between cosine has to have a domain between zero and pi or in the broad sense of a term whatever's here must give you something between zero and pi whatever's here must fit between zero and pi period including 0 to pi so let's go ahead and do that if we take our domain we have identified this as cosine so we're looking from 0 to pi write it out first cosine's domain must fit there the whatever's inside cosine must give you something between there well if this is our domain and this is what's got to fit let's put this between there so identify cosine 0 pi take this and put it between those two values and then we solve them how we solve for x remember for those for double inequalities or compound inequalities here we we solve for x but we're very careful if you ever have to divide by a negative remember you've got to switch your inequalities we're not going to see that a whole lot but you can get it be very careful with that if your domain's getting messed up and you have it out of order make sure that you've actually switched your inequalities so here we're going to subtract 2 from all of this and then we'll divide by three on all three portions of this it looks kind of nasty but those are numbers that is the smallest and largest value that you can plug into this and get a one to one portion of that function that's why we did it cosine is one to one on on zero to pi in general if you start altering what you're plugging in altering that argument you start altering whatever is giving you one to one part this is now what's giving you a one-to-one piece of that function therefore this is the only piece that's relevant for us to find an inverse because we only find inverses of one to one functions this causes that to happen so this is our necessary domain for us to do the rest of our work is cosine defined everywhere yes it is it is defined everywhere but it's not one to one everywhere and so we've got to cut it to make it one to one so that we can find an inverse then we find our range as far as the range is concerned we don't really have to do a whole lot of work like this just imagine cosine i don't care about this the largest that cosine can well i sort of care about it um there are some times that um that you're going to get out some weird things normal it's it's very rare but it can affect it most of the time what happens is you say hey cosine the largest value you can get is one and the smallest way you get out is negative one so cosine of whatever is going to give you biggest one smallest negative one let's let's talk about negative one the smallest value is gonna give negative one so two times negative one is negative two minus one is negative three the largest value is positive one cosine can only get you out between negative one and one i don't care what you plug in that's the smallest amount of value you can get so positive one times two is two minus one is one we show two different ways this is going to become the domain of our new function and the range of our new function our inverse function so let's find the inverse we're going to start by replacing h of x with y we're going to change the y to an x all of our x's into y's then we're going to solve for that y thereby undoing this function and that's what inverses come from is undoing a function so we've got to isolate this cosine so that we can use cosine inverse you have to get rid of your constants first so we're going to add 1 and divide by 2 that's our coefficient or our common our constant factor if you want to so add one divide by two now that we've done that add 1 divided by 2 we've isolated the function that we want to find the inverse 4. the only thing that's going to get rid of cosine is cosine inverse we have to do the same thing on both sides and the same position on both sides so we're going to do cosine inverse because we've identified this correctly this is giving us a one to one part of this particular function on which we can find an inverse this says now it's possible let's go ahead and do that we're going to get 3y plus 2 equals cosine inverse of x plus 1 over 2. almost done we're now going to subtract 2 and then after that divide by 3. just remember where you subtract 2 is important you're going to subtract it not from the argument of cosine so not from that actually it's a it's a x coordinate point but outside of that so subtract two like right there and then when you divide by three you can do it a couple ways you can divide the whole thing by three um most you can do both terms divided by three you can do that as well most times you'll see a one-third though so if you divide by three it's got to be all three terms or you need to put this whole thing in parentheses have a one-third in front that right there is the inverse function we're going to call it that we're going to say this is h inverse stemming from the original name of h of x and this decidedly has a domain and a range that are important have you already found them so the domain is the range of your original function domain of an inverse is the range of your original one so negative 3 to 1 but now this is our input so another reason i like to show inequality notation for inverses so that you really see what's going on this isn't this isn't the y value this is this is the new input value for the inverse same thing for range our range is this is smallest and largest value but we'll have h inverse instead of x because this is our output our outputs for that inverse function i really hope that makes sense to you i hope that you understand the necessity to use this domain so that we have a one-to-one piece of whatever function we're dealing with so that an inverse is actually possible we can only find inverses of one to one functions that's we cut it make it one-to-one and then to find your domain and range first is very nice i hope you're seeing that i hope that i've made it very clear on how you do it identify your function your smallest and largest values put whatever's here between them and solve it remember if you divide by a negative your inequalities switch you pick the whole thing up off the board and reverse it it does not happen very often but it can can't happen and then your domain becomes your range of your inverse function range becomes domain that's about it all i really want to show you on that i hope it's made sense next time what we're going to do is solve some very basic equations with inverse functions have a great day 

Transcript for: How to Solve Basic Inverse Trigonometric Functions (Precalculus - Trigonometry 20)
welcome to another video this video is going to be pretty quick i'm going to talk about how to solve some very basic inverse trig functions um the reason why is just get your brains ready for how to solve these things and understand that while an inverse undoes a function a function will also undo an inverse so here's the idea very basic very straightforward just getting us ready to solve some of these equations coming up in just a while if ever you want to solve an equation isolate the variable in order to isolate the variable sometimes we can factor to do that and create these factors but with functions like this we want to isolate the thing that contains the variables so if you have an inverse trig function somewhere in your equation you need to isolate it so what we're going to do is say if we can isolate the inverse trig function then we'll take the appropriate function undo it so for sine inverse we'll use sine for cosine inverse use cosine for tangent inverse we use tangent on both sides there's not a whole lot of domain work to deal with because this x will naturally fit in whatever domain you need it to so we don't have to deal with a lot of that it's going to work out just fine for us you're going to see that as we go through so let's get started if we have 4 sine inverse of x equals pi the first thing we want to do is of course isolate sine inverse of x so that we can undo it with the sine function that means we'll divide by 4. now we've isolated sine inverse of x the only way that we can get x by itself is use sine on both sides of this equation and that's exactly what we're going to do sine is going to undo sine inverse just like sine inverse undid sine they're inverses of one another so we have to show that on the left hand side of both of these sides of this equation so sine of sine inverse of x that's just going to be x on the right hand side wait a minute sine of pi over 4 that's something we can actually do so sine of pi over 4 is square root of 2 over 2. use your circle if you remembered it already that's great and we're done we just solved that in fact if you plug that in this would actually work sine inverse of square root of 2 over 2 is pi over 4. four times pi over four well four should cancel you get pi pi equals pi it is true it does work so isolate the inverse function then take the appropriate function on both sides same thing is going to happen here 3 times tan inverse of x equals pi let's divide both sides by 3 isolating that tan inverse it's inverses the undo functions so for the inverse of tangent sorry for tangent inverse tangent is that appropriate inverse let's take tangent on both sides on the left hand side tangent of tangent inverse of x is just going to give us x on the right hand side tangent of pi over 3 well tangent of pi over 3 is going to take square root of 3 over 2 divided by 1 half that's simply the square root of 3. now i'm going faster that because we spent a lot of time doing things like that using the unit circle so we should know that tan of pi over 3 takes the y coordinate over the x coordinate square root of three over two divided by one half is square root of three let's move on so three cosine inverse of two x equals 2 pi looks a little bit more difficult but remember the idea isolate the function that contains your variable then use an inverse function so we're simply going to divide by 3 here once we've done that cosine inverse of 2x equals 2 pi over 3. well we've got to get at that 2x but we get it we have to undo that function hanging around it we can't divide and multiply we've got to use cosine on both sides on the left hand side cosine of cosine inverse of 2x is just 2x on the right hand side cosine of 2 pi over 3 well that's going to be negative one-half so it's in quadrant two x is negative cosine therefore is negative negative one half dividing both sides by two now now we've isolated that 2x that's great cosine inverse is gone we just get x equals negative one fourth last one looks a little bit tricky because because y we have we have two terms that have cosine inverse of x in them just like every other time that you have like terms on different sides of your equation you can bring them on one side and combine them and you can actually combine this if this is four cosine inverse of x and 2 cosine inverse of x let's subtract 2 cosine inverse of x on both sides and add 2 pi this should look familiar getting all of our x terms on one side and everything else on the other side this is isolating that variable so we've subtracted 2 cosine inverse of x on both sides we've added 2 pi to both sides these are actually combinable so if we have 4 of something minus 2 of something altogether you have 2 cosine inverse of x then we're going to divide both sides by two so two pi divided by two is just pi lastly now that we've i isolated that inverse function we need to use cosine the appropriate function is going to get rid of cosine inverse on both sides of our equation because cosine of cosine inverse simplify that's literally one of our identities there for inverse functions we're going to get x on the right hand side cosine of pi is negative one so cosine of 180 degrees or pi that's going to be negative one comma zero the x coordinate is negative one we know that's negative one and we're done so i hope that that makes sense it's honestly really really quick isolate your inverse function and take the appropriate honestly parent function that root function on both sides your functions undo inverses just like inverses under functions not a whole lot with domain that we have to mess with here which is very very nice i hope it makes sense and i'll see you for another video 

Transcript for: An Indepth Look at Using Inverse Trig Functions (Precalculus - Trigonometry 21)
hi welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk a bit more a lot more about how to use some of these inverse functions that we just learned about namely sine inverse cosine inverse tangent inverse and a little bit about cosecant secant and cotangent inverse so let's let's just refresh a little bit about what what these things mean maybe a slightly different look at it remember that when we're talking about a unit circle sine of theta equals y or the y coordinate of some point on the unit circle for whatever angle theta is and cosine of theta equals x and tangent of theta equals y over x now what that means is that they're inverses basically undo that so sine inverse of y equals theta says this if your input is now the y coordinate of some point on the unit circle sine inverse of that y coordinate is going to give you the angle that creates that point with the y coordinate of whatever it is this was also exactly why we had to define whatever our domain of sine was to create a one-to-one function because obviously we know that we can have a y coordinate that's the same at both a an angle that's smaller and larger if we go from the from the x axis uh a smaller angle and a larger angle one in quadrant one and one quadrant two if that y coordinate's positive that would create a problem and so we've defined these on very very specific domains so that the inverses actually work so we have a one-to-one function that lets us map forwards and backwards so what this says is that we can use the unit circle as long as we remember that sine cosine tangent take in angles and give you out the y coordinate for sine the x coordinate for cosine or the y over the x coordinates for tangent for whatever angle you plug in the inverses reverse that the inverses say as long as we remember that the y coordinate for sine inverse the x coordinate for cosine inverse or the y divided by the x coordinate for tangent inverses as the inputs will give you out the angle that creates those points but only on two out of the four quadrants so for sine and sine inverse the quadrants are four and one negative pi over two to pi over two for cosine cosine inverse those quadrants are one and two zero to pi for tangent it's four and one again but it does not include negative pi over two does not include pi over 2 that's why i have parentheses or these inequality notation without equal sign now in a little while we're going to do some stuff with cosecant inverse and secant inverse and cotangent inverse and they match up pretty good where they're defined so the the domain or actually the the range for this our range for cosecant inverse is only valid for the same thing that sine inverse is so from negative pi over two to pi over two wherever that's defined don't wherever that's defined there is a vertical asymptote in there so we have to be very careful and thankfully secant inverse is defined on the same exact interval as as as cosine inverse is provided it's defined now cotangent is a problem cotangent inverse has a different range for our theta than tangent inverse does and so that that is an issue so whenever we're working with tangent inverse we oftentimes will use well what do you think cotangent inverse is paired up really nicely with cosine inverse and so those those actually work very well we're going to see that in a couple examples a lot of examples when we get there that sometimes we can have a little work around if we're struggling to find an angle for something so we're going to get into it we're going to learn all about how these inverse functions really give you out an angle and that's that's the whole point so let's take a look at sine inverse of the square root of 2 over 2. right there i really need in your head that what this gives you out what this says is hey the y coordinate is square root 2 over 2 give me the angle that creates that that's what sine inverse is doing sound number says plug in to be a y coordinate and i will give you the angle that creates the point on the unit circle with that y coordinate i will give it to you from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. why because that's the one to one part of that part of the function that we defined are inverses on so we're going to say this gives you out an angle now we can really do something with that we could actually go right from here and say hey if we really understand how to use our unit circle we really understand that sine inverse is only defined from negative pi over two to pi over two then really what i'm looking for is the angle that gives me a y coordinate of the square root of two over two so i'm going to look at that notice how there is no repeat of y coordinates on this part of my unit circle that's why we defined it there would be if i included this that's why we didn't include that so square root of 2 over 2 happens only right here at pi over four so that angle is pi over four theta is pi over four for sure now there's something else that we can do to show a little bit more math some students really like doing this some don't so take it as as you will it doesn't really matter to me but here's one thing that we can do if we understand that sine inverse of y coordinate gives me angle matches up with sine of angle gives me y coordinates sometimes seeing that makes it easier for students either way you go it doesn't really matter this is just putting it in something that a lot of students are are more readily able to see okay i'm looking for an angle that's giving me a y coordinate square root of two or two are you really doing anything different no you really aren't you're not doing anything different there so however you go whether you understand that's the y coordinate find me the angle okay pi over 4 or sine of what angle gives me square root 2 over 2. again that'd be pi over 4. we have to stick to the correct range for our inverse functions domain for our our trig functions so no matter what we get pi over 4. now here's the next question what i'm getting you to understand is that sometimes we get some weird stuff like this and i'm walking you through that right now i'm walking you through like how you would do this is understand that that is man that's a that's a y coordinate of a point this is creating for me the angle or finding for me the angle then cosine can ask about that angle so could we find cosine of the angle you just found well yeah sure cosine of pi over 4 is also square root 2 over 2. and that's precisely what this asks you so what this part says is find cos cosine okay what do you plug into cosine you plug in angles to cosine and angles of sine and angles to all of our original trig functions so cosine needs an angle does this give you an angle yeah it does this says find me the angle that has a y coordinate square root of two over two we've already done this so this is exactly what this is talking about and it's it's exactly the process of going through it so whenever you get these kind of weird things or what in the world are they asking you they're there to do they're saying find the angle from this inverse trig function then find cosine or whatever that trig function is of that angle it's honestly not that hard to do as long as you remember what in the world inverse tree functions are doing they're saying find me the angle that gives me this particular y coordinate for sum x coordinate for cosine and y y over x for tangent inverse that's what it's doing for you so this says hey you could find cosine of this is the angle that's why we defined it that way it was really nice to do that so this gives you an angle if i wanted to find cosine of this remember these two things are equal sine inverse of square root 2 over 2 is the theta that we were talking about this is cosine of pi over 4. and that is square root 2 over 2. and that's really all there is to it so we're going to practice several of these i'm not going to walk you through it this way anymore i'm going to just give you this and say here's the thought process i'm going through it's exactly this structure this is talking about an angle find the trig function of the angle just make sure you are on the right domain for your trig function or range for your university functions we'll see that in just a second let's move on so we're taking a look at tangent of cosine inverse of negative square root three over two what the heck what does that mean remember what these things do tangent needs an angle think about what cosine inverse does cosine inverse is going to give you out an angle this was the big deal here saying regular trig functions give you in angles give you out coordinates of points inverses say plug in coordinates of points i give you out angles so this is going to give us out an angle so the first thing we're going to do here is take the inside if it's an inverse trig function understand this is going to give me an angle call it an angle call it theta or something and then find theta there's two ways to go about doing it for some of you it's going to be really easy to look at this and go okay i understand that cosine talks about x-coordinate stuff on a unit circle so cosine inverse is saying this is an x-coordinate on some point on this unit circle restricted to zero to pi so can we look at this can we look and say hey from zero to pi find me something with an x coordinate this is x an x coordinate of negative square root of three over 2. all of our x's are positive here this is quadrants 1 and 2. so an x coordinate right there that's an x coordinate of negative square root 3 over 2. the angle that causes that is the output of our inverse trig function so this says find this angle this is talking about an angle here this is saying here's the x coordinate find an angle that gives me that x coordinate on zero to pi that's how we define it to get a one to one part of this i hope it's making sense to you this is 150 degrees or we probably put 5 pi over 6. we always use our radians for our inverses so our angle is 5 pi over 6. what that means is this thing in here is 5 pi over 6. you see we set this equal to the angle we just saw the angle we can make a substitution now this is this thing so what this all boils down to is you've now found the angle that causes the x-coordinate now find tangent of that angle well that makes sense because tangent needs an angle to give me some sort of an output we can do more work if you need to um you can do a couple other things here that would be of benefit to some people sometimes we can say all right if this is true then cosine theta equals negative square root 3 over 2 you can find theta it'd be exactly the same but maybe it's a little easier to look at you go find cosine of what angle gives me that x coordinate restricted to that domain well that would be negative square root of three over two i'm sorry five pi over six but either way we get that also some some teachers like you to show that because you called that theta that you can write tan of cosine inverse of negative square root of three over two as tangent of theta but we now know theta personally that's a little bit of overkill for me but some people like to show all that work the way that i would normally do this is identify this as an angle use your unit circle right from here find the angle and then because this is equal to this thing you can substitute that that's a direct substitution to get right down to here and then we'll perform that trigonometric function tangent of 5 pi over 6 is asking you well here's 5 pi over 6 can you find tangent of that angle tangent relates to the y over the x coordinate so one half over negative square root 3 over 2. if we get that we're going to get negative 1 over square root 3. or negative square root of 3 which is exactly what this is equal to so it's kind of a long process if you do show the work um hopefully it's not a hard process hopefully you you're making the connections that inverse trig functions give me out angles trig functions need angles as inputs so this output becomes the input for our trig functions it becomes an angle for trig functions i hope that works for you i hope i hope you're really seeing that so we're going to do three more examples uh two or three more examples i'll show you what to do when they're not on a unit circle and then we'll switch it around we'll say what if we have an inverse of a normal trig function all right here we go so we have secant of sine inverse of negative one half right in your head right now think secant requires an angle as an input we look inside okay is this an angle sine inverse inverse trig functions give you out angles so if we evaluate that we are going to have an angle out that's what this says sine inverse says i'm going to give you out an angle well now let's think about that for a second if this gives us out of an angle then this has to be some sort of coordinate on somewhere on the unit circle hopefully but what coordinate well sine inverse says instead of plugging in an angle and be giving you out a y coordinate like sine does that inverse says give me the y coordinate i'll give you the angle so sine inverse matches up a y coordinate to the angle that creates that so sine number says this is a y coordinate find me the angle that makes that y coordinate that's what that's going to give you out so how do we do that remember that sine inverse is only valid from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. so we're in quadrants 4 or 1 but using negative angles here and so what we're going to do is understand that hey a y coordinate of negative one half let's see y coordinates are positive here and negative down here negative one half is right there do not use 11 pi over six don't do that because that's not in there you have to use negative angles here so sine inverse of negative one half says find me the angle that gives me a y coordinate of negative one half on this part of your unit circle from negative pi over two to pi over two but they are using negative angles so that would be negative pi over 6 not 11 pi over 6. well that's pretty good news because now we understand what that part is this said here's my y coordinate finding the angle and we just did this angle is equal to whatever's inside that function right now whatever's in secant this thing is the angle we just found so we can rewrite it and now that's something that we can do also notice that even though secant inverse is only defined from zero to pi it is okay for us to find a regular trig function of negative pi over six we're not finding it inverse of secant right now we're just performing a trig function secant is defined well on the entire domain except where we have these vertical asymptotes and it's not at negative pi over 6. so we can go ahead and find this just fine so secant of negative pi over 6 well this is going to give you 1 over cosine or 1 over x and so you can do it that way so here's negative pi over 6 secant is the in the reciprocal of cosine so that would be 1 over square root 3 over 2 or 2 over square root 3. that's totally fine to do that as well if you needed to show this and get 1 over square root of 3 over 2 that's 1 over x you can get that that's fine but you'll immediately reciprocate and multiply you'll get 2 over square root 3. yes we're going to rationalize this we're going to get 2 square root 3 over 3. that's about all there is to it we're using inverses to find an angle and then evaluating a trig function of that angle the outputs of our inverses are angles the inputs of our trig functions are angles it works perfectly hope it's making sense i hope you're understanding that even though our inverses are restricted to certain domains as long as we don't get anything undefined our trig functions are just fine with whatever angle we get out of that it's perfectly okay to do and so here we just like yeah negative pi over six and then secant is one over x or the reciprocal of cosine so i'm thinking cosine square root of three over two the reciprocal is secant and that would be two over square root of three let's move on to another one so we're taking a look at cosecant of tangent inverse the square root of three all right well let's start out let's start with the inside of that parentheses and say and figure out what tan inverse square root of three actually means what tangent inverse is going to give you just like every inverse trig function it's going to take something to do with our coordinates and give you out an angle that creates that so just remember what tangent deals with tangent deals with y over x so tangent inverse is going to say you give me that you give me that y over x and i'll give you out the angle that makes it that's my output to you it's an angle and so we would think all right tangent inverse of square root of three equals angle what angle gives me a y over x is square root of three sometimes as i was saying it's easier for people to think of this tangent of what angle gives you square root of three that's especially useful if you have a table so i i do this all by unit circle but sometimes you can get a table that says tangent and cosine and sine of all and the cosecant secant and cotangent of all these very normal uh angles and and this will be on there and so you look through and go okay tangent of what gives me square root of 3. if you like this way do it that way if you like this is a tan inverse of what angle gives me this y over x or the same thing tangent of what angle gives me y over x either way you go with the same question i hope that you're seeing that these are no different but this is easier to use with the table because this is on there directly so we think and go all right that's got to be it's got to be pi over 3 because pi over 3 is number one it's on the correct interval for our inverses to work tangent inverse only works from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 not including those two n values but the only place where on that interval we're going to get a positive relationship with square root of 3 is when we compare this y square root of 3 over 2 divided by one half because the twos cancel and we would get that out so that angle is pi over three either way you go your angle is pi over three and it worked well tan inverse of square root of three give me out an angle now we're going to evaluate cosecant of that angle because this angle equaled this inside of your function we can substitute and say now we're going to find cosecant of whatever angle we found so cosecant takes 1 over y or reciprocates the y coordinate how does it do that cosecant is related strongly to sine so sine is the y coordinate cosecant is 1 over the y or the reciprocal of the y coordinate so we take a look at that right now cosecant pi over 3 says here's pi over 3. remember it can be anywhere unit circle for the trig function it does not matter you do not have to restrict it but cosecant of pi over 3 says find your y coordinate take 1 over that or reciprocate it so here's my y coordinate i'm going to take 2 over square root of 3 again if i rationalize we get 2 square root 3 or 3. all right let's take a look at this one cotangent of cosine inverse of negative one-half we're going to go fairly quickly through it understand that inverses give you out angles so let's write this as that relationship right now understanding that cosine inverse of negative one half is going to give me out an angle but it's only going to do so where cosine inverse is defined uh well sorry where cosine is defined to give me a range for cosine inverse of zero to pi so only on quadrants one and two so let's take a look at this let's understand that cosine is relating an x coordinate and an angle together cosine of the angle gives me x coordinate cosine inverse of the x coordinate gives me the angle so let's find that that x coordinate but only on this part of my unit circle so my x coordinate has to be that one right there that's negative one half that's on this zero to pi where we restricted that to get a one-to-one function so negative one-half for x y x it's dealing with cosine what angle creates that well it's going to be 2 pi over 3. if we want to show it this way sometimes that's a bit easier cosine of what angle gives me an x coordinate of negative one-half now this is really clear because we know cosine is equal to the x-coordinate for whatever angle it is cosine of what angle gives me that still you get 2 pi over 3. by the way sometimes you'll have students who really really want to use a calculator here because your calculator will perform it but they're probably not going to give you that it's going to give you a decimal out some do and that's really nice but it's very very beneficial to make sure you can use the unit circle so refrain from using your calculator unless you absolutely have to so we're thinking hey cosine inverse x coordinates deal with x and angle our angle that makes that x coordinate on the appropriate domain is 2 pi over 3. now we're going to find cotangent of 2 pi over 3. that's what this thing is it's the angle we just found the angle so now evaluated so cotangent of 2 pi over 3 let's see tangent is y over x cotangent is x over y so we're going to go right back to that angle we just found 2 pi over 3 we're going to evaluate cotangent the x over the y so negative one half over square root 3 over 2. if we reciprocate and we multiply we get negative one over the square root of three if we rationalize that's negative square root three over three so i hope i've made it very clear what we're doing here depending on what inverse trig function we are we set up what interval on the unit circle we're in sine numbers and tangent inverse deal with negative pi over two to pi over 2 sine includes those n values cosine is the odd one because the inverse from 0 to pi actually cotangent is 2 we'll get that later but we restrict that we find out the appropriate angle that's giving us the y coordinate percent inverse the x coordinate for cosine inverse or the y over x for tangent numbers that gives us an angle that we evaluate the trig function of that angle i hope that's really clear i hope i've explained it to you in such a way that that makes sense i'm going to come back and i'm going to show you what happens when these things are not on a used circle we're gonna have to draw some triangles not that hard and it's super it's super valuable for calculus 2. all right so let's take a look at something like sine of tangent inverse of one-half we think all right we got this right sine needs an angle tangent inverse it gives us an angle that's great that's exactly what we want inverse trig functions give out angles that's their output so let's set it up that way okay well here's what this is asking i want you to take tan think of tangent tangent is y over x now tangent inverse says take that y over x relationship and give me the angle that creates that and you go but wait a minute tangent of one half is i don't i don't see that one half for a comparison of y over x on the circle and that's true that's that's not there and so what happens is this is one of the reasons i was prefacing that if tangent inverse of one-half equals theta this is only if tangent then equals one-half now before when we were on a circle this was really easy but when we're not this is really helpful so if you are not finding this out very easily you're like i don't know where that is uh we'll write this as a normal trig function so we're thinking that gives me an angle that's true this is not on a unit circle it's also true so let's write this as hey if tan inverse of one half gives me theta tangent of theta gives me one half so what's that mean well tangent takes a relationship of an angle to the y over x coordinates so wait a minute on a triangle this would be y over x okay let's draw a triangle like that you see that's what a unit circle did anyway it was basically uh super subscripting these triangles onto this circle so let's let's make a triangle out of this where a y is one and an x is two so we can do that provided that we're in the right quadrants so remember what tan inverse does tan number says i only work in quadrants four and one from negative pi over two to pi over two so you have to obey that otherwise you'd be able to draw two triangles here for instance a y of one and an x of 2 would put a point right there that would be a relationship on a right triangle with a y of 1 and an x2 but you could get the same exact relationship if you did negative one and negative two do you really do you see that do you realize that negative one divided by negative two is also positive one half so why wouldn't we use that triangle right there that's the entire reason maybe the first time you really is really clicking is that we had to eliminate like half of the unit circle or half of our xy plane if you will so that we don't have this situation where we could possibly get out two different angles that's why we restricted it so when we're dealing with inverse trig functions you're in only one of two quadrants you're either in four one negative pi over two to pi over two or you're in zero to pi one of those sets of two quadrants so for tangent inverse tangent inverse only works in these two quadrants that's exactly what this says negative pi over 2 pi over 2. so that means this is not okay so our relationship says yes tangent inverse is 4 or 1 the only place where both x and y are positive for tangent inverse to work is quadrant one that's why we draw it there now can we go a little further can we take and wait a minute that's a right triangle i hope you're seeing that tangent of theta equals one half says your y is one your x is two that gives me a right triangle could we find the hypotenuse well wait a minute it's a right triangle that's awesome so right triangles say yeah if you can take x squared plus y squared it's going to equal r squared for whatever hypotenuse you have that's pythagorean theorem well now let's plug in some values please for goodness sakes don't forget to take square root super common people oh it's 5. take the square root we get the square root of 5. so by the pythagorean theorem leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared we know that that hypotenuse is square root of 5 or that this would be like on a circle with a radius of square root of 5 not a unit circle a square root of 5 circle not a thing now why in the world would we do that well to answer that question you see if we're not on a unit circle we have to basically reinvent the wheel so to speak um for every different radius it's not one the unit circle is great because with the radius of one we got a lot of very common angles and their respective points that's great well do you have a circle like written out with a radius of square root of five no i hope not and it doesn't take forever to do all the possible radii that that's impossible for us to do that and so what we do is we go okay let's invent just the one angle that we need that has this relationship so bear with me here's a like a 20 second recap we take our inverse trig function we write out equal to an angle if this is on a unit circle this is pretty easy because we go okay uh tangent inverse of what's the y over x find me the angle it gives me that even if you write it this way tangent of what angle gives me y compared to x on a unit circle pretty nice if it's not then we're going to create the one triangle to find the one angle that we need that has a certain radius with a certain y and a certain x so we can draw it as long as we remember what tangent does tangent relates y to x draw a picture in the appropriate quadrant in this it's quadrant one our y is one our x is two we can complete that triangle with pythagorean theorem every time and now here's the magic part tan inverse of one half equaled an angle this is that angle so if you find sine with late relating to that angle you're going to solve this so let's go over here let's understand what sine is sine if you remember was y but what did what did it really mean it meant y over 1 or y over the radius the opposite over the hypotenuse this is the the main reason why a long time ago when i introduced what sine really was in the unit circle i said remember that sine of theta is y over r cosine theta is x over r tangent theta was y over x if you remember anything about right triangle trigonometry remember that tangent theta is opposite over adjacent sine was opposite over hypotenuse oh there it is there's our r y over r cosine was x or adjacent over hypotenuse for whatever right triangle we have also i want to mention you use the signs here so sine not like that sign but positive and negative you have to have that because we're working on an x y coordinate plane we have to have the ability to have negative x values negative y values so for us now that we've found that now that we've said we've got a picture of this angle we have a picture of what this gave us this angle that we're talking about is that angle and here's the the way the triangle would have to look if we have a comparison of y to x of one-half that is the angle now find sine of the angle relates back to says find sine of whatever angle this is giving you this gave you an angle relationship amongst these sides just like that so find sine of that angle sine of the angle we just created takes well let's see y over the r normally it's just y because our r is one for unit circle but here it's not so that plays part of it so y over r says take your one that's your y over your square root 5. if we rationalize that denominator we're going to get square root of 5 over 5. now i know it's kind of weird that we actually never found the angle but that's not what it's asking it's it's not asking you really for the angle it's asking sine of that angle equals what and that's what we found so that's kind of neat that without even knowing what that angle is specifically we can relate a triangle that answers the question side of that angle so it's kind of a kind of workaround um this is why we had to draw the triangle so that we could relate these two sides and how sine wants you to do it for whatever angle tangent inverse of one half is going to is going to get you that's the idea here i hope that makes sense we're going to come back and do a few more but the plan is if something's on a unit circle it's easy find the angle and you can actually find it explicitly then find the trig function at angle it's not a problem if it's not on a unit circle you won't find the angle explicitly you'll try a triangle that relates sides in the appropriate way that represents that angle then you find a trig function of that triangle so for sine that was opposite over hypotenuse no problem and that's what we get all right let's try this one tangent of sine inverse of one-third think about what sine inverse wants to give you out it wants to give you out an angle so what we're going to do is say all right the first thing we're going to do every single time is say that that sine inverse of 1 3 wants to give me out an angle if that's on the unit circle you can do it right from right here or if it benefits you a little bit sine inverse of 1 3 equals theta if and only if sine theta equals one-third now for a unit circle you're perfectly okay doing it here if it's not on unit circle you kind of need this one why well because this this is showing you how an angle is related to two sides on a right triangle so this is saying sine's giving you a y over an r or this this vertical part of your right triangle compared to your hypotenuse or the radius on some sort of circle because sine inverse only works from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 we're going to put this on our x y coordinate system appropriately to represent just one point and not two points you see here's the thing we can put this on our unit circle and this will always be the case in two places that's why we had to restrict this to half of a unit circle or half of a x y coordinate plane so if we have a positive y value of one and a radius remember what sine theta does it says y is our vertical and r is our radius we could do one of two places if we had a 1 with a radius of 3 we could be either here or we could be over here you'd have a radius 3 going this way or radius 3 going this way both of those points would be absolute value does both have a positive one one those both have a radius of three they would both represent an appropriate angle so which one's right the one that's in the right quadrant the one that's in the right domain for our sine to be one to one that would be just from negative pi over two to pi over two this is in quadrant two sine inverse is not worked there sine does not work there to give you sine inverse so this is wrong this is not what we want i hope it's making sense to you at this point why in the world we restricted that domain i know it probably did before but now you're really seeing why because otherwise we can't do this you'd have two angles that that's a really big problem and so we think of it this way i think this is going to give me a one angle relate that okay where does it have to relate if y is positive and the radius is positive also the hypotenuse is positive that's got to be quadrant four or one well down here y would be negative so we're we're in quadrant one for sure by the way this is obviously not drawn scaled it's just a graphic representation of what we want to show now that we have that let's find x let's find whatever this this x value would be and that's going to be pythagorean theorem every time so leg squared plus leg squared was hypotenuse squared no problem we can have x squared equals eight and ultimately we get x is this 2 square root 2. now is it valuable well yeah absolutely it's valuable because this gives me a way to look at this angle so sine of theta is one third says here's the triangle that matches up i don't even know what the angle is i don't even care this is the angle we just found it it's right there and then and this is like the one time in math you can go find x and you go there it is find theta there it is it's like right there like this is the triangle that gives you that particular angle so we found the angle now when we ask the question can you find tangent of the angle yes tangent using this angle as what this is giving you because that's what it gave you this gave you an angle relating y over r you found the x this is the one and only one triangle that would have the angle and the one and one only one angle that would have this particular triangle with these particular y values and hypotenuse values and x values so tangent says now let's work with that so tangent is look at the angle that we just got from the triangle we just created from this inverse trig function and give me what tangent does tangent theta is y over x that would be 1 over two square root two if you rationalize that we get square root 2 or 4 and no you can't simplify don't simplify that that'd be bad news but that's it this is what we're looking for you you're looking for what tangent of an angle is going to give you a relationship among sides we just found it you don't even really care about what the angle is now we could do this with um with our calculators but that that's not what the idea is the idea is give me the relationship among sides y over x for an ang tangent of that particular angle that's what we're doing that's what we showed ah that's so close don't you there's a little two if it's a little two we'd be done almost done because that would be on the inner circle but it's not so let's go through the process we know that inverse trig functions give angle start with that this is only true cosine inverse of negative square root 3 over 3 gives you theta if and only if cosine theta equals negative square root 3 over 3. now we look at a unit circle can you find me an angle on a unit circle where the x coordinate is negative square root 3 over 3 you go no i can't do that then draw yourself a triangle with this relationship that this is giving you x over r cosine can be viewed as x over 1 or as x over r well that makes sense because if the radius is 1 we just get x that's that's true so cosine gives you x over r but we also have to play along with where cosine inverse is defined see this where its range is really this only works if that angle is between zero to pi so if this is x and x is negative notice and r is positive here we have a couple of choices we can do a negative x positive r up or positive r down but because this would be in quadrant three i can't do it cosine inverse only works from here to here zero to pi so here would be positive x here would be negative x you'd have to be in this quadrant i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing why we restricted it and how it's so very important to understand that so let's do negative square root 3. we don't have to be really to scale here you just need to know your quadrant so our quadrant is because x is negative i'm on this half of my my y axis or my extra equivalent plane and because of that i know that cosine inverse is only 0 pi it's got to be up here so our x is negative square root 3 this is why we had to allow for these negative values so that it puts us in appropriate quadrant and our r or our radius or our hypotenuse is 3. take the time to go ahead and find out what y is i always write y x and r because it makes the pythagorean theorem work a little bit better for me so leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared is negative square root of 3 squared plus y squared equals 3 squared and we're going to solve that for y negative square root 3 squared is this is 3. so negative squared gives you positive square root of 3 squared is just 3. so y is going to give you the square root of 6. now this is super valuable because what this gave you was an angle and based on the triangle that that angle gave us that this gave us we can find cotangent of that triangle i should say really cotangent of that angle using the triangle we created so inverse function gives me angle out that angle is this angle right there the only way that this triangle is created from the angle or the angle from the triangle in this relationship is if this is the angle we're talking about and now we find cotangent of that angle don't even know the angle i just need to know the triangle that creates it so let's think of cotangent theta cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent so tangent was y over x cotangent is x over y so cotangent of this angle says i want you to put the x over the y and we make sure that we use sines so if we deal with that most of the time what we do is we see if we can simplify these square roots before rationalizing i'd make one square root that's going to be the square root of one over two well the square root of one is one but the square root of two we would rationalize and we would get negative square root 2 over 2. well that's exactly what this is equal to this caused angle angle created a triangle since it's not on the unit circle we did not find the angle specifically like explicitly finding that we're finding the triangle that is made from that angle using this relationship amongst x coordinate or the x side and the r or the hypotenuse side of our triangles then we find a trig function from that triangle and this says this whole thing is equal to negative square root 2 over 2. i have one more i know i'm doing a lot of examples but it's because i want you to really really get good at this and really see it as an appropriate quadrant based on how your trig functions are defined as far as your inverses are concerned so back with one more then we'll start going backwards what happens if you have an inverse of a trig function it's a little bit easier okay last one before we start going backwards so sine of tan inverse of negative three tangent inverse is going to give you out an angle let's start with that this is only true if tangent of the angle is equal to negative three these are both two statements of one another so tan inverse of negative three equals theta if and only a tangent of theta equals negative three now let's think about this can we find an angle that gives me negative three when i compare y over x on a unit circle no there's no negative three i can't find that on the unit circle specifically so we're going to draw a triangle from this now remember there's always two places where this is going to be true on a unit circle however only one place if we use the appropriately defined domain for tangent so this has to take place between quadrants four and one negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. and maybe think about it this way where is tangent negative tangent's negative in quadrants 2 and 4. which of those quadrants works in this well only quadrant 4. this is off limits you can't do it there so if we're going to say hey tangent theta relates y to x then that would be a y of negative 3 and an x of positive one y of negative three x and positive one would be here's a y of negative three and an x of positive one now you might be thinking how in the world would you get something up here well you understand with fractions that negative can go to the numerator or denominator so you could do a y of positive 3 and an x of negative 1 and get the same point but that's in quadrant 2 and tangent is not defined there tangent is only defined for inverses only on four or one that's why we had to choose that that is probably the biggest thing i have to talk about you need to absolutely make sure you're following that where this stuff is going to explode so we're in the appropriate quadrant not that one this one tangent's still negative there that's fantastic we have a y value negative three and x value positive one so let's keep going with our setup we've got a y value of negative three an x value of positive one and we can go ahead and we can find that r so we know that pythagorean theorem says leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared or x squared plus y squared equals r squared no problem so we can do that that would give us a square root of 10. now one thing i've been neglecting i want to show you right now when we take a square root we typically do a plus and minus and that is that actually is really relevant because we want to make sure that we're in the white right quadrant so what would it mean if we had a negative square root 10 this um this negative radius what that would do is flip that about our origin so that would create this other radii going kind of in quadrant two instead of quadrant four so if we want to do that we want to keep this in the correct quadrant so we're going to keep this as positive square root of 10. but please notice something that sometimes when we take a square root if we're in like quadrant let's say 2 for cosine inverse or something and we need to find the x value of that well then when we take a square root we want to keep the negative enough positive you need to make sure that you're in the correct quadrant that's a really big deal so here we're we have this r of positive square root 10 that keeps us in the right quadrant it's quadrant four and now because that angle is giving us that triangle we can find sine of theta using that triangle find it so sine says i want to take my y over my r or my opposite over my hypotenuse or my negative 3 over square root 10. use the science it's really important if we rationalize we get negative 3 square root 10 over 10 that's exactly what this equals so we're done let's go backwards a little bit let's start finding inverse functions of some original trig functions like sine cotangent cosine of these values and then find inverse of those it's a little bit faster and the reason is is because these things are defined everywhere where there's not a vertical asymptote on your unit circle so there's really not an issue these are all going to be very easy to find you have to worry about that and then when you do the inverse just make sure you're on the appropriate portion of that unit circle and you're going to be set so we're going to do that we'll come back and deal with some more cotangent inverse and cosecant inverse and secant inverse which we don't see that a lot but i'm going to show you how to work with that and then that that'll we'll call it a day so in order to deal with these there's not going to be a lot of triangle drawing anything like that all we really have to do is figure out what sine 5 pi over 4 is and find cosine inverse of that so deal with your inside first like before it's just easier because we're more used to these normal trig functions and they'll all be something that are defined you don't have to worry about restricting that right now so sine of five pi over four we know that sine of five pi over four should mean that's the y coordinate of the point where that angle creates on the inner circle so 5 pi over 4 is let's see right there sine is negative square root 2 over two and now we think of cosine inverse of negative square root two over two remember that this is going to give us an angle so cosine inverse of negative square root 2 over 2 asks now is where you restrict your domain on the appropriate portion of your xy chord x y coordinate plane or your unit circle basically from 0 to pi on 0 to pi where is your x coordinate negative square root 2 over 2 right there that would be three pi over four if it helps you to do that that's fine it says cosine of what angle gives me an x coordinate negative square root of two like i was saying this is very very useful for a lot of students because this puts in your head like oh yes i'm looking for the x coordinates sometimes your c the angle would still be x coordinate of negative square root 2 over 2 on the appropriate domain for that to be a one-to-one function for the inverse function to work would have to be just 3 pi over 4. and that's really about it so this is going to give you an angle and then this asks cosine inverse of that sorry this is going to give you a coordinate so angle this gives you a coordinate that asks what angle creates that coordinate for you on the appropriate part of that unit circle how the next one tangent inverse of cotangent of 2 pi over 3 find this part first now cotangent of 2 pi over 3 it's not a vertical asymptote right there this should be pretty easy to find so use your circle and find that cotangent of 2 pi over 3 2 pi over 3 is right here now if you're thinking well wait a minute tan inverse isn't defined there who cares cotangent is and that's all we're talking about right now we're going to deal with the inverse function after we figure that out so it's not to worry right now don't worry about it figure this out first so 2 5 over 3 says cotangent instead of y or x takes x over y negative one half over square root of three over two if we rationalize and we simplify the twos we're going to get negative square root 3 over 3. now what do inverses give you inverses give you out angles and so we can ask that question we pull out a table if we want if you're going to use a table it is often easiest to think of it this way tangent inverse of negative square root 3 or 3 equals theta if and only if tangent theta equals negative square root of three over three now what in the world is that going to give you well that probably comes from one over the square root of three so that's going to be let's see firstly negative where is tangent theta equal to a negative comparison of y to x well that goes back to inverse so this was able to be found no problem on the unit circle but tangent inverse is restricted so when we're talking about the inverse now this angle has to be from here to here okay what what does it mean if it's negative that means that we're in this quadrant from negative pi over two to zero we have to be here that that's gotta click right now it's gotta be like yeah that makes sense because tangent is only negative here and here this one's off limits for tangent inverse it was absolutely just fine to find cotangent no problem but now when we start talking about tangent inverse we use cotangent 2 pi over 3 to create this this number this y over x for us now tangent inverse says okay find me the angle but be on the appropriate part so from here to here well that's got to be let's see y over x that would be 11 pi over so well negative pi over six will have to make a big mistake why couldn't it be 11 pi over 6 that would be this angle i'm not talking about that i'm talking about this angle so negative pi over 6 that would create this negative one-half divided by square root of three over two that would be negative one over square root of three and then we rationalize get negative square root three over three so it's gotta be negative pi over six if you have a table out you can see that pretty clearly as well okay last one sine inverse of cosine of negative seven pi over six find this one first it's not a problem don't even worry about the inverse yet understand that cosine is defined everywhere it on the unit circle everywhere so we're not restricting this yet so cosine of negative seven pi over six uh well let's think about cosine for a second cosine is an even function so we could find cosine of positive seven pi over six man i hope you remember i hope you remember that cosine of e is an even function so cosine of opposite inputs gives you equal outputs says i can just switch my sign just fine with even functions so let's find cosine of 7 pi over 6. that's right here cosine is going to give us the x coordinate negative square root 3 over 2. now is where the domain restrictions come in now is where we go okay sine inverse is talking just about these two so we're going to say sine inverse is going to give us an angle what this is asking is what angle on this interval is going to have a y coordinate of negative square root 3 over 2. if you want to write it like this that's totally fine as well that's the same thing sine of what angle has a y coordinate of negative square root 3 over 2. the only reason why i wanted you to see it this way is so that we don't accidentally go outside of the appropriate domain there so we need to be in quadrants 4 to 1 negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. so this says my y coordinate is negative square root of 2. sine relates angle to y coordinate on this part for an inverse so y is negative square root of three over two that's right there that's going to be negative pi over three remember it's negative here and that's exactly what this equals and this was negative pi over 6 and this was 3 pi over 4. so find your trig function first because it's going to give you a coordinate or a comparison coordinates then your inverse that's when you restrict your domain that's why it was a little more difficult in the last way we did it because you restrict your domain first here you just figure out the trig function restrict your domain last let's come back and deal with uh cotangent and cosecant and secant inverse and then we're gonna be good to go all right we're gonna deal with some of the well lesser used i would say uh intrigue inverse trig functions like cosecant inverse of whatever uh let's talk about what that even though it means but before we do something we're going to be using here really really important is that nicely cosecant inverse and sine inverse they have the same range domain for our root functions there are our normal sine and cosecant they create these inverses for us they have the same range for output now what that means is that we can use a very nice reciprocal to change cosecant into sine that's going to be very very useful for cosecant inverse and secant inverse notice again cosecant inverse has the same exact range as sine numbers and secant inverse has the same exact range as cosine inverse where the problems happen is cotangent inverse this is a different range than tangent inverse i'm going to show you how to deal with that so last example two examples that we do but for the most for most of them for cosine inverse secant inverse no problem set this equal to an angle and then switch it to cosine or sine respectively sine and cosine the reciprocal functions because these domains match up so well it's not bad to do we can't do that with cotangent very often but we will in the first example not the second so here's our thought process inverse functions give you angles that might be hard to do cosecant inverse of that looks like a bunch of junk equals an angle so what angle gives you that relationship of one over y might be difficult to deal with so let's write this as well the normal trig function now here's the magic happens if cosecant inverse of this one over y gives you theta this is only true if cosecant theta gives you negative 2 square root 3 over 3. because cosecant inverse has the same domain overall range but domain for where one-to-one functions came from and sine inverse we're allowed to use well this nice reciprocal because they do and we're not going to be switching outside of the quadrant that we're not supposed to be in cosecant theta equals negative two square root of three over three well then sine theta must be equal to the reciprocal of that and if we rationalize this gives us 3 3 cancels of 3 we get negative square root 3 over 2. wait a minute that's actually pretty easy to find sine of what angle gives me negative square root 3 over 2. now here's why it was so important that i made you recognize that these intervals are the same that the range or the domain of sine is the same as the domain of cos cosecant where we get our inverses from because now you'll know where to look because sine inverse is here to here and cosecant inverse was from here to here where it was defined then this now is found on that same interval are you seen are you seeing the point of why they had to be the same that way we'd say hey this is defined only from here here perfect sine inverse is the same thing let's use a reciprocal and now we know we're on that same interval so where is the y coordinate what angle gives us a y coordinate of negative square root 3 over 2 on the appropriate range for sine inverse well that is going to be let's see negative pi over three so cosecant inverse of this junk is negative pi over three you have to match up those domains so we're going to say yeah all right this is true this is true if then this has to be true cosecant theta equals that let's do a reciprocal and find it on the same exact domain that we're used to let's move on to secant inverse of negative 2 let's do the same thing inverse functions give you angles this is only true if this is true so secant inverse of negative two equals theta if you only have secant theta equals negative two well this is great because secant inverse has the same range as cosine inverse does that means that we can reciprocate it and look at the appropriate interval on our unit circle so secant inverse i'm sorry secant theta equals negative two then cosine theta equals negative one half let's reciprocate that that's negative two over one no problem because they're on the same range we can take a look at the cosine theta from zero to pi secant inverse zero pi cosine over certified and we're looking for an x coordinate remember cosine is talking about x here cosine of the x coordinate gives us this of negative one-half is um two pi over three so taking a look at it thought this is kind of hard this is a lot easier it's on the same interval let's just use that so cosine of theta equals negative one half says what angle on the appropriate domain is going to have an x coordinate of negative one half cosine is the x coordinate and that's two pi over three and that's exactly what that's going to be for you let's try a couple more and we're going to learn well what happens if if these these aren't a new circle use your calculator but not the way that you think so secant inverse of negative three inverses give you angles let's write that this is only true if secant theta equals negative three we go right hey secant inverse and cosine inverse are are defined in the same same domain there so let's let's reciprocate it if secant theta equals negative three cosine theta equals negative one third which go wait a minute i don't see an x coordinate of negative one third on the appropriate domain that that's a problem so what do you do well you see there most calculators some do most calculators don't have secant inverse on there so when you go to plug in ui i have cosine inverse well this will allow you to do that and so if we want to find theta remember that cosine theta equals negative one-third if and only if cosine inverse of negative one-third equals theta put your calculator in radians and press cosine inverse of negative 1 3 and that will give you a decimal approximation for this angle that's about 1.91 but it is radians make sure your calculator is in radians is going to give you out radians now how about cosecant inverse of negative 4 well we can start the same way that's going to be some sort of an angle so cosecant of that angle has to be negative 4. because cosecant inverse and sine inverse are defined in the same range and domain for sine and cosecant respectively let's find the reciprocal and say hey that's that's sine theta equals negative 1 4. no problem just reciprocate it but the problem is that between negative pi over 2 and pi over 2 i do not see a y coordinate of negative 1 4. well then we can do the same thing we did here so theta would equal sine inverse of negative 1 4. so this is a way that we can sort of get around the fact that some of our calculators won't do cosecant inverse to allow you to actually do it so sine inverse of negative 1 4 is going to give you about negative 0.25 this is exactly negative 0.25 but that's not what's talking about the angle is negative around negative 0.25 radians if you want a super shortcut look here and look there just reciprocate it and use the the appropriate reciprocal inverse function the only one that will not work with is with cotangent so i'm going to show you that one just a second all right let's do the last two examples cotangent is a bit tricky and the reason why it is is because cotangent does not really match up very well with the interval for tangent as far as our inverses are concerned now is there part of this that matches 0 to pi and negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 here's 0 to pi negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 yes in quadrant one if you are in quadrant one if this is going to give you some sort of an angle in quadrant one then you're fine and you can use tangent for this so for cotangent inverse of the square root of three call that the angle that it is this is only true [Music] if cotangent of theta equals square root 3. so we think okay that's positive where is cotangent positive well the same place tangent is positive in quadrants one and four that's the only place uh sorry one and three the only place tangent is positive and cotangent's positive well that's in quadrant number one so we're not going to use three we can't use three because cotangent inverse is not defined there tangent inverse is defined there it's just in quadrant number one and so we're thinking what angle is going to give me a x over y square root of three now if that's it's as difficult again i really don't can't think of that that way if you have this in quadrant one then you can do something like tangent of theta would be one over the square root of three and we could write tangent theta equals square root of three over three if we rationalize so if that's true and we're in quadrant one here that was quadrant one this is quadrant one they have the same interval as far as quadrant one is concerned you can do this if not then you can't so then we'd look at where would you get uh why compared to an x of square root of three or three well that's actually this might be even easier either way you go one over the square root of three would be taking one half divided by square root of three over two that's at pi over six this has to be pi over six so the only way that this actually works is if this is giving you an angle that's in quadrant one then use tangent so what if it's not what if this is not in quadrant one well then we have to find a trig function that's in the same interval as this is that's going to be cosine so let's take a look at cotangent inverse of negative 2 it's probably the most difficult problem we'll do here if we did this we said hey look inverse functions give you angles all right we're good with that this is true of cotangent theta equals negative 2. let's put this negative 2 over 1. now if that's true then this is going to give me an x over a y remember that cotangent is x over y why am i not dealing with this in terms of of tangent why can't i just do tangent into reciprocal here's the reason why where this gave you an angle in quadrant 1 this is going to give you an angle in quadrant 2. why quadrant 2 cotangent is only defined from 0 to pi so from this top half of your x y axis right there well if you have a negative 2 and a positive 1 that's here that as opposed to a positive 2 and negative 1 that's down there that's not the right quadrant we have to be from 0 to pi so negative 2 positive 1. remember that cotangent inverse is only defined from here to here you have to be somewhere on there because that's in quadrant 2 tangent does not work tangent inverse does not work you can't deal with it would have been fine if we were in quadrant one because it overlaps if it doesn't overlap you see that here it overlaps here and here that's not true we've got to use something else so our x is negative two our y is one we know that cotangent is x over y if we find our radius there or our hypotenuse that's one squared plus negative two squared that's going to be the square root of five remember to keep the positive there because i want to be in the same quadrant positive square root 5. now how in the world are we going to find an angle from that if we have to actually find this angle i i don't maybe have a cotangent inverse on my calculator if i did i'd be done right here i would just do it that'd be great uh this is not on our unit circle anywhere so cotangent inverse cotangent theta equals negative two there's nothing that's giving me a y an x over y of negative two that doesn't work i can't use tangent because it's not the right domain so what is what's the only trig function inverse that is in quadrant 2. it's got to be cosine so that's quadrant four to one that's quadrant four to one uh so is cosecant inverse and secant inverse cotangent inverse needs something that will work from zero to pi cosine inverse does that so we're gonna go for cosine inverse so cosine theta let's find cosine theta cosine would take x over r well if we um we don't need to rationalize if we take the inverse of both sides now that we'll let your they'll let you do it on your calculator you find cosine inverse of negative 2 over square root 5. it's about 2 2.68 radians and sure enough that is going to put it right where we want it to be so anyhow um but why do i say right where we want to be this is three point one four radians zero to pi positive about 3.14 radians so 2.68 is somewhere in that quadrant two where we thought it was and that's exactly the angle that we're dealing with i know that this is probably challenging um when you have cotangent in quadrant one use tangent that's fine when you have cotangent inverse that's not in quadrant one that's that's outside of that draw a triangle if it's not an unit circle and then you have to use cosine to deal with it because cotangent and cosine have the same exact domain for where we've got our one-to-one functions that also means that when you define this and find your angle you can use cosine inverse that's what we wanted to get to and that's a appropriate angle i know it's a long video i hope it made sense i've done a ton of examples so that i would actually teach you the ins and outs of this i don't want to give you just three or four because there's a there's a lot of differences in how we deal with some of these things you're seeing that right now that's about as much as i could possibly give you i think i've gone above and beyond and given you everything i possibly think of on how these functions and inverses interplay with one another i hope it's made sense next time what we're going to do is we're going to start talking about equations so i hope you're ready for it have a great day you 

Transcript for: How to Solve Trigonometric Equations (Precalculus - Trigonometry 22)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about how to solve some equations with trigonometric functions in them they're honestly not that bad there's just really two things we need to understand about them number one three things number one is that in order to solve equations you need to isolate something and so we're going to use techniques to isolate our trig functions number two once you've done that try to use your unit circle the third thing because we are not using inverse trig functions do not restrict your unit circle so we're isolating using your circle if at all possible if it's a weird sort of thing that your your function is equal to then no we can't but if it's anywhere on the unit circle man we're in good shape and number three is that do not restrict this like we did with inverses you don't need to do that because we are not using those inverse functions to do this we're using unit circle and we get more available uh solutions that way for this on that unit circle the last one kind of hidden thing is that most of the time we're finding all the solutions between zero and two pi so on one revolution of that unit circle we can find a general solution i'll show you how to do that in the first example but normally we find all the solutions within a certain interval because these things are cyclical they go forever and ever and ever we really don't find all solutions all the time just on a certain interval and that also leads to one more thing that's like five things sorry about that is that if ever the argument of your trig function is different from just theta we're going to have to manipulate our period a little bit i'm gonna show you exactly how to do that too so let's get right into it so number one thing whenever we're solving any equation normally we're just isolating a variable well in this case in order to get to that variable in order to get to theta we have to isolate our trig function so think isolate your trig function first we're going to do things like in the first example like subtracting 3 and dividing by 2. so if we subtract 3 we get negative 1 divide by 2 we get negative 1 half now once we've isolated our trig function use your unit circle now you can you can go ahead and think of this like an inverse but do not restrict your domain so i know that sine inverse is only from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 that's true but normally we're looking on 0 to pi for our trig function we're going to answer this question like what angles cause us to have a y-coordinate of negative one-half on the entire unit circle on one revolution and so there's going to be two solutions here so we're thinking sine of theta equals a y coordinate on the unit circle let's find that y coordinate of negative one half and how many angles give me that so if sine has a y sorry sine theta equals our y coordinate and we're looking for negative one half that's there and there so our y coordinate is negative one half here and here so sine of seven pi over six would give us negative one half and sine of eleven pi over six will give it negative one half notice what i'm not doing i'm not using negative pi over six this is almost always from zero to two pi that's typically what we like to do so we're not using it like sine inverse that's probably the biggest thing that students get confused because we just talked about inverses for a really long time and now we're going back to yeah let's use the whole unit circle and that's exactly what we're doing so we're going to say hey in order for sine of theta to equal negative one half theta would have to be 7 pi over 6 or 11 pi over 6. those are all the solutions on this interval of zero to two pi all that means is that those are the two angles on that one rotation that one period of sine for which we're going to get this y coordinate negative one half and it's pretty clear sine of seven pi over six is zero in half sine of eleven pi over six is negative one half those are the two solutions now if you need to show all solutions we know that every time we make a full rotation all of our y coordinates repeat all of our sine thetas repeat for every period that we we traverse and so if we wanted to show that for all general solutions all we really have to do is take these two values both of them i just want to take those two values and add 2 k pi to them what that means is that you're going to hit 7 pi over 6 and if you add 2 pi you're going to hit it again just after one full revolution and then again and again and again and same thing 11 pi over 6. you'd be here add 2 pie you're going to go around again at the same place around again be the same place and we can show it like this just take your solutions and add 2 pi now we throw a k in there say yeah you could you could go positive revolutions or negative revolutions and still end up at the same exact point on your unit circle so those are the two angles on one revolution in the circle that give me this y coordinate of negative one half then if i add rotations to that or subtract rotations that's what the k does says you can add a certain number of rotations full rotations or subtract them and you're going to end up at the same point this would be our general solution so this is all of the values every one of them forever that would possibly give you a y coordinate of negative one half when they do circle that would solve that equation that's really all there is to it so we're isolating using the unit circle typically what we do is we normally just stop here because that's usually what they ask for is finding all solutions from zero to two pi and that's pretty much all that we're we're going to be doing here so let's move on to the next one uh let's let's actually do that one so four cosine squared theta minus three isolate your trig function as much as you can so we're going to add three we're going to divide by four so if we do that we add three and divide by four remember we do have to isolate so cosine squared equals three fourths that's our first step but cosine squared means cosine to the second power how in the world do we undo power twos well we take a square root and we take it on both sides and we use a plus and minus so square root of power two those things cancel we're gonna get cosine theta when we take the square root of three we're going to leave that but the square root of four is 2 we also have that plus and that minus and so we're actually going to get four solutions here now this is a little weird most of our trig functions are going to give us two solutions on the unit circle do you remember that power twos typically give you two solutions like usually for polynomials now this is not polynomial but it's it is going to bear out that way because that square root yields a plus and a minus we're going to get two solutions for cosine theta equals positive square root of three over two and two solutions for cosine theta equals negative square root of three over two so we've isolated and now we've we're solving we're in the process of solving so once we've isolated our our cosine we're going to have cosine theta equals positive and negative square root of three over two use your circle so we're going to take a look at cosine theta equals square root 3 over 2. remember that cosine theta is equal to the x coordinate so all we have to do is go to our unit circle do not restrict your domain to 0 to pi that's not the idea here on the entire interval of 0 to 2 pi find out what angles give you a x coordinate of square root of 3 over 2 cosine theta equals x coordinates we're just going to find that so x coordinate of square root 3 over 2 is here and there so not negative remember one's zero to two pi so x coordinate is pi of square root of two gives us pi over six and eleven pi over 6 cosine theta equals square root 3 over 2 on two angles here pi over 6 and 11 pi over 6. we do exactly the same thing for cosine theta equals negative square root of three over two we understand that cosine theta equals the x coordinate let's look for this particular x coordinate it's going to show up two spots here that would be negative square root of three over two cosine that equals x coordinate look just at your x here it's negative square root of three over two and negative square root of three over two so what angle gives us that x coordinate and that's what that that cosine theta is asking cosine of what angle gives you an x coordinate of what's listed that would be 5 pi over 6 and 7 pi over 6. those are all the solutions to that equation on the interval from 0 to 2 pi because we looked at the entire the entire unit circle we didn't restrict it we're not really using cosine inverse here we don't have to create a one-to-one function this is not one-to-one uh what this is is giving us two two inputs that give us that particular output for this and that that's okay these are all the solutions that are going to solve that equation we can't really afford to be one to one here because we've been missing some of the solutions on the interval of zero to two pi so i hope this makes sense i hope that you're understanding isolate your square iso your trig function use your unit circle on the entire 0 2 pi this will give you all the solutions for that interval don't forget to do things like a plus and minus when you're taking square roots because that's going to lead to more solutions we don't want to miss them all right let's take a look at one more for now 3 squared theta equals 1. let's start all of these by isolating our trig function if we can now we are going to run into some where we need to factor or do a substitution or use an identity and we'll get to those in just a bit but the basic ones where you're only seeing one trig function or where you can combine your terms do it in this case since we only have one trig function we're going to isolate it directly we're just going to divide by 3. now we're also going to take a square root every time we do every time we put the square root on the paper we really need to be putting a plus and minus now sometimes it's not relevant but it certainly is here so we're taking the square root of both sides we're going to get tangent theta on the left hand side and positive and negative 1 over the square root of 3 on the right square root of 1 is 1 square root of 3 is square root of 3. you can leave it like that if you can find the angle that way and some people can some people it's really nice to do that if you're using a table typically this will be rationalized as square root 3 over 3. i hope you can see that we're getting four solutions again so we're gonna find the two angles on zero to two pi where tangent theta equals the square root of three over three that's y over x and the same thing for tangent theta equals negative square root of three over three my opinion it's perfectly acceptable to use a table for this if you're going to look at this and go hey tangent of what angle gives me this particular y over x relationship this ratio that's fine if you're really good at unit circle it's not horrible so when we take a look at this so we just need to understand that we're going to really i really want to think about it this way but you might you see that on your table that's why i give you both of them so we want to take a look at what would give us 1 over the square root of 3 or when you rationalize square root of 3 over 3 y over x gives us gives us that well that's going to be for positive two different angles we're going to have here one half divided by square root of three remember y over x one half divided by square root of three over two is going to give us one over square root three so this is going to be pi over six it's also going to be the negatives negative divided by negative gives us a positive so that'll be negative one half divided by negative square root of three over two that would also give us one over the square root of three and rationalize it would accomplish this for you so there's two angles pi over six and seven pi over six i hope that you just saw so i hope you see some right now i hope you see that if you take pi over 6 and you add pi half a rotation you're going to get exactly the same thing y well with a period of tangent is pi and so we should be expecting that and that that's exactly right so these values are all the same on quadrant one and four if you take pi and just add to it you're going to get the same exact tangent every time even the signs are the same positive and positive for tangent same thing would happen here we're going to be in different quadrants we're going to be in two and four so we're thinking of this all right now tangent of what angle is going to give me this y over x that yields negative one over square root of three from here or negative square root of three over three if you rationalize it uh well that's going to be the same thing that one half divided by square root of three but we need opposite signs to get the negative so i'm thinking one half divided by negative square root three over two and then negative one half divided by positive square root of three over two and notice those are also pi away so pi radians away from another so five pi over six is going to give me that as is 11 pi over 6. i think tangent is probably the most difficult because you have to compare y over x it's not just a y coordinate or an x coordinate it's y divided by x for our coordinates so i hope that's making sense i hope you're seeing the isolate use your unit circle do not forget to take plus and minuses when you take a square root uh that's that's gonna that's a real big deal so we're gonna come back i'm gonna start making them progressively a little bit harder we're gonna do a ton of examples um but i'm gonna make them very concise so i'm gonna go quickly through them just to instill the proper techniques for you let's keep on rolling so uh we're going to continue solving some of these trig functions i'm going to show you what to do when the argument of your trig function is not just theta so how do you deal with that we'll talk about exactly what that means and how you fix it we'll use a substitution and then i'll tell you that that three if you remember from our graphing that cuts well your period it cuts your period into three parts it makes it shorter and so it's going to cycle more often on the unit circle we're going to think of this as cutting a unit circle honestly and then we'll we'll add to it or not add to it depending on what that value is the other thing is what we're going to do for the rest of our examples is just find the solutions that are on that interval from 0 to 2 pi that's what we did in the last few examples just before i also think i had a mistake if i'm thinking back to it i think i actually had an equal sign right there if i did that was an error and the reason why it is is because 0 and 2 pi will yield the same exact solutions on that unit circle and so what we don't want to do is have this issue where 0 and 2 pi give us the same exact solution so we're excluding the two pi typically so we go yeah said equals zero include that but not the two pi that that would double up some of our solutions we don't need that so anyhow let's go go on and solve some of these so sine of three theta equals negative one what in the world you do with that use a substitution so what we're going to do is we're going to trick this problem a little bit we're going to say hey let's call that 3 theta let's call it alpha or something so just something different and let's solve it as if it's just a typical angle we'll use the circle won't be that bad then once you solve this on that particular interval what we're going to do is we're going to divide everything by three so we'll substitute back just a basic substitution and it solves it really nicely so step number one make sure that we can substitute for whatever that angle is to give us something easier to work with something we can find on the unit circle so i'm going to call this three theta something different like alpha so we can say sine of alpha equals negative one now let's treat alpha like our angle and do exactly the same thing here so sine of alpha equals negative one what that's asking for is give me the angle so that the y coordinate is negative one sine of what angle gives me a y coordinate of negative one that's going to be just three pi over two so in this case we don't get two solutions here that typically happens with our quadrant angles because we're not in a particular quadrant right in the middle we don't have this um like symmetry going on that we do with cosine our x extra coordinates and sine are our y coordinates so we don't have that there we're just going to get 3 pi over 2 sine of 3 pi over 2 is negative 1 that's exactly what we're talking about now here's the here's the thought process because that 3 is going to cut it's going to cut your two pi it's going to cut this unit circle in thirds it's going to make it shorter this is going to cycle three times on that period and so what we really if you you can picture it you can pick your sign doing this and if we if we shorten it over the same period it would hit negative one more times because it's cycling faster that's precisely what's going on right now hope that makes sense it's going faster it's going to hit this this value more times because of it so here's what to do whatever number this is just add two pi until you get that many cycles so we want three cycles here so this is one of them add 2 pi 2 why because one full rotation would give you back the same y coordinate add another one because one full rotation is going to be back that same y coordinate and this will cycle three times dividing two pi by three three times within that interval of zero to two pi because we want to find all the solutions from zero to two pi we're going to have to do that so whatever number this is add one less 2 pi then to that one less iteration of adding two pi so three pi over two cool i'm going to add two pi i'm also going to add 4 pi to it so this is going to create one cycle 2 cycles 3 cycles on that 0 2 pi we know that's going to happen because you took 2 pi you divide it by 3 it's going to cycle 3 times on that particular interval 0 2 pi because we're looking for all the solutions there just add 2 pi until you get 1 2 3 to match the 3 right there that's the easiest way i can explain it one two three for that number add two pi until you hit whatever that number is three or two or two or don't add at all for that one actually it's going to be something we have to cross out so we're going to show that so if i take 3 pi over 2 and i add 2 pi to it that's like 4 pi over 2 well that's going to be let's see 3 pi over 2 plus 4 pi over 2 is 7 pi over 2. now don't let this confuse you i'm talking about adding 2 pi to this number and 4 pi to that number so you can do it this way you can add 2 pi go back to here add 4 pi or just add 2 pi and then add 2 pi again so another 4 pi over 2 would give us 11 pi over 2. now if you're thinking wait a second that's way outside of that interval that's exactly right and that's because we're not talking about theta what's going to happen in just a moment well we're going to say hey remember like that one time like five minutes ago where we set alpha equal to three theta well this alpha we're going to replace that with three theta and then we're going to divide everything by three and what that's going to do is pull all of these back under zero to two pi it'll also give us all the solutions from 0 to pi if we hadn't have done that if we had not have added those and got these things well then what would happen is that we would be missing some solutions on 0 2 pi we cut we sorted actually we shorten the period we shorten that cycle so it's going to happen more often on zero two pi add up until you get that many cycles and then do your substitution again so replace it replace it back so now that we have that we can say three theta equals all of those values alpha is three theta so three theta equals all three of those if we divide all three of those by three we're going to solve for theta that's that's kind of cool so we we kind of trick the problem we call this an easier angle to work with we solve it understanding that that's shorter than this it's going to happen more often on 0 2 pi how many times more often whatever that number is so once twice three times just add to until you get that now divide everything by three and if we do that remember that dividing by three is like multiplying the denominator so when i divide by three we're going to get 3 pi over 6 7 pi over 6 and 11 pi over 6. yeah we should simplify that so 3 pi over 6 is really like pi over 2. just check your work just check it real quick just make sure you get it if i plug in pi over 2 this would give me 3 times pi over 2. well that's 3 pi over 2. that's right there and that is negative 1. notice how all of these solutions are between 0 and 2 pi so even though these were outside of it when we divide by three it pulls it right back down furthermore these are all the solutions on zero to two pi this is it this is our entire solution set and that's kind of nice that's really all that we do we're gonna do the same thing with tangent of two theta so tangent of two theta equals negative one we're going to go through the same exact process let's call the angle something different call it alpha so tangent of alpha equals negative one it's still an angle we're still using the same thing we're using the inner circle actually so we're thinking about it tangent of what angle gives me negative one use your table uh use y over x on unit circle i like it that way i'm just used to it you can do whatever you want so i'm thinking what angle tangent what angle gives me negative 1 comparing y over x that's got to be in quadrants 2 and 4. that would be that's negative 1 square root two over two divided by negative square root of two over two is three pi over four and also seven pi over four now we're going to go look back just a moment we're going to look back and say okay what what was this what did that do um that shortened this interval of 0 2 pi by 2. that's what that did now we do understand that the period of tangent is pi i get i get that so it's shortening that 2 but because we have two periods on 2 pi of tangent it's just shortening both of those really and so we're going to add our 2 pi to both of our solutions just make sure that you have that many cycles so add it until you get that so i'm going to go ahead and add 2 pi to both of our answers here so alpha's going to give us three pi over four see three pi over four plus two pi that's three pi over four plus eight pi over four that's eleven pi over four and seven pi over four let's see seven pi over four plus eight pi over four is oh man 15 pi over four now there's a couple of those that are more than zero two pi and they are a little bit out of order it's not such a huge deal but we do want to try to put them in order if we can't it's one of the largest but what's gonna happen well because we used alpha here and not two theta we're gonna substitute back so we said tangent two theta now let's call it alpha let's solve this as if that's our angle okay there's two answers there but because we know we're shortening that zero two pi in half what we're going to do is we're going to take and add up until we hit that many cycles so here's one and two for each solution one and two that's one this is the two for this solution two cycles and two cycles for that solution so there's four total quasi solutions here we're not we're not to theta we're still in alpha now we're going to do our substitution so we're going to say hey alpha really is two theta let's call it that and if we divide everything by two we're basically just multiplying our denominator by two if we divide so it's going to be three pi over eight eleven pi over eight seven pi over eight and fifteen pi over eight now you need to simplify that's fantastic these two are out of order but that is the largest solution that you have it is just less than 2 pi 15 pi over 8 is just less than 16 pi over eight which would be two pi so this is all the solutions from zero to two pi hope you're seeing why it's working i hope you've seen how it's working firstly but then why it's working because that two cuts that zero two pi in half really or both periods of tangent and half we're going to get more solutions that qualify in that interval when we're all said and done it's gonna cycle faster and this is really the best technique i found that'll do it we just have to make sure that whatever solutions you're getting if that number's more than one that you're adding up to that many cycles so for two make sure you have two for three just keep on adding until you hit three here's one two and here's one two and do it for every solution then when we substitute back we're dividing or solving for that theta it's kind of nice all right cosine of two theta equals negative one half and tangent of theta over two equals negative equals square root of 3. i had those on the board before we just ran out of room so i had to erase them so now we're going to solve in the same exact way they're already isolated trig function that that's fantastic and we're going to sort of combine these ideas in just a moment but whenever you have this argument this angle that is not just theta just substitute it solve the equation like normal and then put it back the only caveat here is that that number is going to shorten your period so it's going to happen more often on that interval for which we find all of our solutions on so let's call two theta alpha cosine alpha equals negative one half is asking what angle is going to give you an x coordinate of negative one half well x coordinate of negative one half would be two pi over three and four pi over three so x coordinate negative one half here and here two pi over three and four pi over three now because our our theta or our sorry alpha is equal to two theta that two is shortening this we're going to add until we get that many cycles that many site that many repetitions of this particular the function on zero two pi so that shortens your period therefore it's going to happen more often on zero to two pi and so we're gonna show that so we're gonna add two pi so here's two cycles on that particular solution what that one is is that's right here so that's going to say i have this solution if i go again i'm going to hit back that same thing here here's my my solution if i go again around there i'm going to hit right back at that point so that's two cycles for each solution that you do not two total those are two unique solutions we don't say oh there's two cycles no no this is on the first cycle around you hit the x same x coordinate twice you get negative one half on two different points in the unit circle on one revolution we're going to go an additional cycle to make that 2. so here's 1 2 and 1 2. we're just going to add that to pi so 2 pi over 3 plus 6 pi over 3 that's 8 pi over 3. there's two cycles that we want it matches that make this match that mini and four pi over three let's see four pi over three plus eight pi over sorry six pi over three would be um ten pi over three now that we have that we're going to be very comfortable setting 2 theta equilibriums and just dividing by 2. it's going to take everything that's outside of 0 2 pi and pull it right back in so when we divide you also notice these are really easy to put in order because our denominators are all the same so i put these in order just to make it a little bit nicer you don't really have to it's just nice to see that and then divide everything by two or multiply your denominators by three so two pi over six four pi over six eight pi over six ten pi over six essentially we're just really dividing you could have done that too dividing your numerators same exact thing or simplify those are your four solutions that you get here that now notice all four of the solutions are between zero and two pi there's nothing larger anymore because we divided by two that's how we add these extra cycles because we know we're going to pull them back down so this makes sense to you if you don't do this if you don't add that then you're gonna be missing some and it's really frustrating students oftentimes go i got them then why am i missing some where those come from it's because you have to add those cycles because you're shorting it and it fits more cycles on that particular zero to two pi period you're looking for that's that's why it is let's take a look at that one one thing to notice is that this is this is theta divided by two not times two what's going to happen here don't add any of this in fact this is lengthening this is a length in the period it's going to happen less times on zero to two pi in fact some of the solutions we get here are going to be outside of that are outside the interval we're gonna have to really look at it and say yeah this doesn't fit you can see the spear out for a second same technique works with isolator trig function we're gonna call the inside alpha so tangent of alpha equals square root of 3 says what angle is going to give me this y over x relationship of the square root of 3 well that's going to be a square root 3 over 2 divided by 1 half so the 2's cancel that only happens where y is square root 3 over 2 and x is one half positive both positively or both negatively for for the the positive square root of 3 that we get so it's pi over 3 or 4 pi over 3. so those are the two solutions that we have there from our unit circle typically what i'll do if i'm adding other periods to it is i'll show that these are two different alphas or well i'm sorry two solutions to the same alpha but i'll show that differently so i don't forget to add cycles to it in this case i'm not doing that which is why i wrote the way i did but maybe it's better to do this way so should i add anything to it no not if you really understand what's going on that is making more of them fit shorting remember this is a horizontal compression it's making more of them fit into zero to two pi that is divided by two it's a stretch it's lengthening this there's gonna be less of them that fit and so i'm not gonna be adding anything to this um in fact this is it as far as our solutions for alpha we don't wanna add more because what's gonna happen is we're gonna start multiplying all of these by two even some of the ones that fit in zero to two pi now are not going to later and so we really have to be careful on that one so if you have something divided something less than one don't add any cycles to it if you have something more than one yes adds at least one cycle to it to all your solutions so we're saying less than one don't add any cycles to our solutions now we're ready to set this equal to our our theta over two now we're not dividing by two we're multiplying by two that's going to be two pi over three and eight pi over three oh pay attention to that one how much is 2 pi over 3 well 2 pi over 3 is right there that's fantastic that works just great but 8 pi over three let's see three goes into eight like two times with a remainder of two that's two pi over three plus sorry so that's two pi plus two pi over three that that's a problem because this is outside of that interval so if you're just looking for the solutions between 0 and 2 pi you need to see that that's more than 2 pi 8 pi over 3 is like 2 pi plus 2 pi over 3. this is outside of that range or the well the domain for what we're say signifying that theta is so i hope that makes sense to you hope you're really really getting that if we have a number in front of theta that's more than one you're adding cycles just match up with that number if you have one that's less than one you're not doing that do not do that because you're already probably going to cross some out there once you start multiplying it's going to grow this it's going to make them outside of 0 2 pi so hopefully explain that well enough for you we're going to come back and do some a little bit more complicated getting our a real good handle on this let's keep right on going so we've got secant of three theta over two equals negative two don't be afraid to use reciprocal functions so if secant of three theta over two equals negative two use use cosine uh there's there's no problem we're not dealing with the inverse functions right now we can easily do that cosine is a bit easier to deal with because it directly matches to most unit circles that we have you can use a table too that's fine typically what i'm going to encourage is yeah just just go ahead and use cosine for this so if secant of 3 theta 2 equals negative 2 then cosine of 3 theta over 2 equals the reciprocal of negative two or negative one half now we're set now we're going to call this alpha we're going to solve this just like we normally did so cosine alpha just letting alpha equal that that weird angle in there equals negative one half this asks since cosine is related to the x-coordinate what angle gives me an x-coordinate of negative one half we've done this a couple times already that's going to be let's see two pi over three and four pi over three what the hell would you do with three theta over two evaluate is that more than one or is that less than one in front of that theta so three over two well that's that's one and a half so if you're really smart about it you add one cycle to this but you don't do that now that's confusing what in the world why why not that's the bigger one the next one is going to be outside of 0 2 pi if that's too confusing add it to both of them but understand that you're probably going to get something outside of 0 2 pi so that's not yet 2 it's not shortening enough for 2 cycles to fit into 0 to 2 pi this one's going to that one's not going to i'm gonna show you that right now so anything more than one at a cycle if it's more than two add more than that two and two cycles if it's more than three at three cycles so i'm gonna add 2 pi and 2 pi that's another cycle around that unit circle so 2 pi over 3 and 4 pi over 3 that's fine that's what this angle would be for cosine theta equals negative one-half i'm saying that's more than one i'm going to add one cycle i really don't need to do that one but i'm adding it again anyway so our alpha is going to be 2 pi over 3 let's see 2 pi over 3 plus 2 pi that's 6 pi over three the same thing as two pi that would be eight pi over three and four pi over three that would be ten pi over three if i add that two pi that's that's like six pi over three plus four pi over three is ten pi well not over six ten pi over three now some of those are obviously more than 0 2 pi but we haven't substituted back yet so we're going to say hey because alpha is 3 theta over 2 these are all equal to 3 theta over 2. so i did switch these so but notice something we're going to solve this for theta we're going to multiply everything by 2 divide everything by 3. this one and this one and this first one are all still going to be in 0 2 pi that one's not that's going to be just outside of it and so we're going to cross it off because it's not going to fit the interval for what we're defining our theta as and that's what i was saying for numbers that aren't integers well whole numbers uh like two or three it's like one and a half between one and between one and two well then you have to add one cycle but it's typically just to the smaller of those two solutions that usually works if it's there is obviously some breakover so if it's just barely less than two well then you're probably gonna add it to both so a fail safe is if it's more than one add one cycle if it's more than two add two cycles and that will that will keep it very nice just be careful check your work and cross out anything that's outside of the inner interval for which you're trying to find solutions so here we're going to multiply everything by two and divide everything by three so four pi over nine eight pi over nine sixteen pi over nine twenty pi over nine that's less than two pi that's less than two pi that's just less than two pi that's not that is let's see nine goes into twenty two times with remainder two that is more than two pi and this is what i was talking about this is what we want to cross out i hope that makes sense i hope it's you're seeing that i need to add cycles um like i was saying for stuff like one and a half edges just the first one but if if you're very if it's a weird number and you're not sure just add a cycle to both understanding that you might have to cross them out later just check your work just make sure that all of these are within the interval you're trying to find solutions for let's go ahead and do one more so square root three cotangent theta equals one or plus one equals zero solve it for your trig function isolate that first and then start doing your reciprocals if you have one of these functions you don't really wanna work with all that much so cotangent theta equals negative one over square root of three i'm just isolating that trig function now before you rationalize reciprocate for tangent we don't want to rationalize and reciprocate and then have to rationalize again that'd be kind of silly and so if cotangent theta equals negative 1 over square root 3 then tangent theta equals negative square root of 3. this is kind of nice we don't have any odd angle in there nothing that we have to alter the period for so we're just going to look on our unit circle and say tangent theta equals negative square root of 3. so what angle gives me a y over an x that yields negative square root of three it's got to be oh man i hope you see it it's got it in quadrants two or four tangent is negative in two and four not one and three so in two and four we'd say i want the square root on the numerator i want a one-half of the denominator that's got to be positive square root of three over negative over sorry positive square root of three over two over negative one-half two pi over three or negative square root of three over two divided by one half five pi over three so two pi over three or five pi over three there's no manipulating our angle here these are all the solutions between 0 and 2 pi because we found it we literally looked at the unit circle and found all of them so i hope this making sense to you uh we're going to come back to a few more we'll eventually start getting into something that we have to use identities for all right two really quick ones uh we're going to do this one solo for sine really really quick and then we're going to take a look at what what the world you do with 3 theta plus pi over 18. it's going to end up being the same thing but just be careful on some of your some of the times you run into issues with uh adding too many cycles or too few because of what you're what you're adding there so you have to massage that a little bit so whenever we're solving something no matter what it looks like like awkwardly this is why i'm giving this problem is if there's only one trig function you can isolate it if there's not try to combine it and if you can't then you need another technique so no matter how ugly that looks if there's one trig function isolate that trig function so we're going to subtract 3 square root 3. that'll be negative 2 square root 3. if we divide by 4 we're going to get negative square root 3 over 2. this is kind of nice this says what angle gives me a y coordinate remember sine is y what angle gives you y coordinate of negative square root of 3 over 2. y coordinates are 4 pi over 3. and five pi over three because we haven't altered that at all our angle at all those are all the solutions on the interval for where we're looking for for our solution so that's it we're done one trick one trigonometric expression solve it correctly isolate that trig function now what about some of those angles that look really really weird try the same thing so i was saying just a minute ago that sometimes we run into some issues where we will miss a solution or or we'll get an extra solution with a certain interval if we add three cycles because of that plus pi over 18. most times doesn't happen but if it does then you can always try adding an additional cycle and seeing if that's going to give you another solution in zero to two pi so let's try that here so alpha equals just call that whole thing alpha man that looks a lot better so sine of alpha equals 1 says hey find me the angle that gives me a y coordinate of 1. that's going to be pi over 2. and that's it there's only one solution on 0 two pi that has that particular y coordinate of one so alpha equals pi over two now because that is a three we want three total cycles if that had been a four we'd want four total cycles this is one one solution on that first cycle we need another solution on another and then another cycle so two additional cycles we're going to add 2 pi for that then we're going to add 2 pi again or add 4 pi to our original solution so let's try that now all right so we got pi over 2 if we add 2 pi that's 4 pi so 5 pi over 2 if i add 2 pi again or add 4 pi to pi over 2 either way you want to go it doesn't really matter so 2 pi to this is that one 4 pi to this or 2 pi to that so it'd be an additional 4 pi over 2 that's 9 pi over 2. now that's way outside 0 2 pi but remember we're about to subtract pi over 18 and then multiply it by three so since we solve for alpha we know what alpha is and now we're going to remember order operations we're going to subtract pi over 18 before we divide by 3. so when we subtract pi over 18 so pi over 2 that's that's like 9 pi over 18 so 9 pi over t minus 1 pi over 18 is 8 pi over 18. 5 pi over 2 would be like 45 pi over 18. uh that's 44 pi over 18 if i subtract 1 pi over 18. 81 pi over 18 for nine pi over two so nine pi over two is like 81 pi over 18 minus 1 pi over 18 is 80 pi over 18. now of course all of these are going to simplify so we can do that now we can do it later it doesn't it kind of matters it's a little bit nicer to multiply by the denominator by three once you've simplified so i'm going to do that now and divide everything by two and lastly we're going to divide by 3. so multiply our denominators by 3 that's going to be all over denominator of 27. so 4 pi over 27 27 pi over 27 40 pi over 27 and that's it now one thing can happen i was just talking about this a little while ago is that if you have a large enough angle that's subtracting you could fit another because that's a phase shift right what that is a shift of sign to the left it's to the left uh pi over [Music] 54. so it's it's really it's a really small shift but this is shortening and shifting and so what's going to happen here is you might fit another solution in zero to two pi if that's the case what you would want to do is add an additional cycle to that if that's a large enough shift you might get that you might actually have a negative here too if you shift far enough so just be careful on that one typically this works just fine remember that number is how many cycles you want in general adding a phase shift to it or subtracting any phase shift can alter that just a bit just just mind that just be very careful that you can be outside of zero two pi you might have to add an additional cycle that's that's really all there is about it that's about as hard as i can make an angle uh there for you i hope that that is making sense to you i couldn't resist i had to do it so i added another cycle just to show you that this is pretty close but it's it's it's too much so if we add one more cycle we have 13 pi over 2 if i subtract pi over 18 i get 1 16 pi over 18 and then if i divide both by 258 pi over 9 and then divide everything by 3 we get 58 pi over 27. 27 goes into 58 two times and then sum but just a little bit had i subtracted a bit more than that then i would have been able to fit another cycle in there so i hope you're seeing that so if this is large enough and you're not sure you know i don't know then add an additional cycle so just hey here's one two three you go well i don't know about that one add another one it doesn't really hurt all that bad it just means that you'll get an extra solution there and it doesn't fit inside the interval that you're looking at and that's really all there is to it these two are tricky and i throw them in here because a lot of students mess these up a lot of students really have a problem understand why there's two solutions when cosine inverse only gives you one solution and sine inverse only gives you one solution so if you need to find all the solutions on that interval 0 to 2 pi cosine inverse and sine inverse will not do it completely they'll give you half they'll give you the one-to-one solution it'll give you the solution for cosine from zero to pi for sine it'll give you the negative pi over 2 of pi over 2 it'll give you that remember what inverses do inverse functions are one-to-one functions they will give you one solution here so if you need to find both there's a way around that so i'm going to show you how to find both solutions to cosine theta equals 0.6 even though 0.6 is not on a circle how to actually do that so let's start off with the thought that cosine beta equals 0.6 i would look for a unit circle solution it's not on there for 0.6 so how do we solve for theta if we're not underneath a circle well we'd use cosine inverse so cosine theta equals 0.6 if theta equals cosine inverse of 0.6 or cosine inverse of 0.6 equals theta that's the same thing now your calculator will give this to you but you must remember that inverse functions only give you one solution out they have to so cosine inverse of 0.6 is going to give you around .927 and you go great i'm done not really what this means what this is is this says oh man i hope you remember it it says what is the angle that gives me an x coordinate cosine is always an x coordinate so cosine of what angle gives me an x coordinate what angle gives me x coordinate of 0.6 where is 0.6 where is an x coordinate of 0.6 if that's 1 0.6 is about right there on a unit circle that is the angle they're giving you why is it that angle well because cosine inverse man i hope you're making this making sense this is the biggest thing here is cosine inverse only works from zero to pi that's it it's just going to give you that one angle this is an x value or x coordinate of 0.6 about that's the angle they're giving you what .927 radians this is 0.927 radians that's exactly what that is it's uh it's less than one radian it's less than pi over two radians it's 0.927 radians roughly but look at this there's another point on the unit circle that would have that x value that x coordinate of 0.6 this would be 0.6 comma some y and this would be 0.6 comma some y therefore there's another angle there now how do we find it these angles will have symmetry so this right here would also be theta however we can't have a negative angle on zero to two pi can we because that's 0 is the smallest value i don't want a negative angle that's outside my interval so here's what to do with that if this angle's theta and this angle has symmetry it's also theta take 2 pi minus your angle so imagine you go all the way around and go oh i went too far back up how much would you back up you back up theta so cosine inverse will give you a solution an angle out on the interval that it's defined for for cosine inverse that's 0 to pi so it's going to give you that angle no problem use your calculator you're good to go but then draw a picture of it because cosine is talking about the x coordinate x coordinate will be the same here and here remember it's on the it's the x value here and here so we go here great calculator okay imagine we go all the way around and we've gone too far back it up that symmetrical angle this would be found by two pi minus whatever that angle is well what's that angle you found it 0.927 is the number of radians wait a minute 2 pi is in radians so 2 pi minus 0.927 is going to give you another angle specifically it's going to give you this angle that goes all the way from here to here that's the other angle that we would have it's about 5.36 now 5.36 radians notice that that's just under 2 pi radians 2 pi radians like 6.28 or so radians so that's below that that's exactly this angle less than that so i hope that makes sense it's a little weird i know that it's weird just remember what inverse functions do they're only going to give you one solution and only on the part where it's divided so for cosine inverse that's zero to pi we need to understand that cosine deals with the x coordinate there's always going to be two x coordinates on the unit circle that are the same that's positive quadrant one and negative quadrant quadrant four uh uh me is better we say is above and below the x-axis in quad one and quadrant four and then we say all right let's just subtract that symmetrical angle to find it something very similar happens with sine theta equals zero point four um so when we're thinking sine theta equals zero point four we try to get in a circle and point four is not on there so what angle gives me a y coordinate or point four i have no idea i i don't know but i do know that we can do an inverse so if it's not a new circle use sine inverse now what in the world does that mean well if we're thinking about this a y coordinate of 0.4 a y-coordinate of 0.4 would have to intersect this horizontal line at point four that again is going to give me two angles but check it out sine inverse will only give me oh man i hope you remember sine inverse only gives me answers from negative pi over two to pi over two so it will give me this angle this is from negative pi over two to pi over 2 it'll give me the one solution that's on that interval that has a y coordinate of 0.4 it'll give me that particular angle i hope that makes sense to you sine inverse says the angle that gives me this y coordinate on this particular interval so right there is theta and this would give you this it'll give you this angle of about 0.41 radians so this angle is about .4 0.41 radians but we're smarter than that we understand that hey a y-coordinate will happen twice on a circle if we're not on a quadrant angle so y-coordinate would have been 0.4 here it also happened 0.4 here this would have a y coordinate 0.4 that same height only how do we find that angle well the same a very similar way is this this will have symmetry on that angle so this is also theta so how in the world would we make it to this particular angle going from an initial side to that terminal side that's the angle that we want well imagine going a little too far you go oh i'm going to go all the way to pi oh i went too far what would you do if you went too far you'd subtract some how much would you want to subtract theta so if we said this is not as far as pi it's just theta less than that we went too far go back a little bit so we have one angle of 0.41 radians and another angle of pi minus about 0.41 radians that's approximately 2.73 radians here what's 2.73 radians remember what pi is pi is 3.14 this would be 3.1 approximately 3.14 radians we're not quite there yet or 0.41 radians less than that 2.73 so that's a it's a little weird just remember what sine and cosine do cosine is x coordinate you probably have two of them this way subtract two pi minus that angle sine is y coordinate you have two of them this way take pi minus the angle for the ones that are not on the interval for which sine inverse and cosine inverse are defined for tangent all you really have to do is add pi so that's the period of tangent is pi so if you run into that you're like okay i have one solution where's the other one just add pi to it it's usually pretty good to go so we're going to come back and start using some identities to solve some of these equations it's kind of fun some substitutions and things where you can't isolate the trig function exactly so we're going to deal with a few problems that you can't isolate the a trig function because there's more than one of them or the same one that's raised to a power you just can't isolate it directly if that's the case you need another technique so here's the things to look for number one thing you look for is can you factor it if you can factor it if you can use a substitution or logic factor if it's already factored that's great we can use the zero product property if not we're probably going to have to have an identity so the number one thing you try to do is isolate your trig function or combine terms to isolate it let's check that can you combine those no because one's got a power two and one doesn't that'd be like x squared plus x you go i can't add that you can't add those trig functions either but what you can do you can do a substitution now some of you who are very good at factoring you can factor just like that it's not even a problem but if you're struggling with this a little bit remember that every time you have a power one here and a power 2 there you can make a substitution of the inside thing the inside thing here is cosine remember that this means cosine theta squared so if we let let's say u equal cosine theta that lets us do this substitution so if u equals cosine theta all we're looking for for a substitution is this thing and this thing to be the same where this is 2 times that thing that's all we really need so let's go ahead and let's make that then cosine squared theta would be u squared because cosine theta is now u we'd get cosine theta squared well no we called cosine theta u so u squared plus u equals 1. now when we're factoring we want to get everything on one side we want to get in order first term positive and now that we have u instead of cosine theta it's nice to do that so we'll subtract one this is something that's really nice to factor so we can do this there's a lot of different ways i've seen people factor any way that works is fine with me i don't really care this is going to be let's see if i do it my way i always like to put my middle term here first and last term multiply that's negative two add to the top multiply to the bottom and then take your a and divide and simplify and this will give you your factors this is one u remember this is not x or anything one u plus one two u minus one and we could continue to solve this is what is beautiful about factoring is that it creates a zero product property something's very nice for us so we know zero product property says if you get a couple factors or several factors and they're equal to zero every one of them equaling zero has the opportunities to to be a solution so u equals negative 1 and u equals one-half are you done no you are not this is just in u you don't want u you want you want a cosine theta so because cosine theta is u then cosine theta equals negative one and cosine beta equals one-half we don't have any awkward angles we don't have to manipulate that but if you did at this time is when you'd say if that was like two theta call that alpha then solve for alpha and then you divide by two you give my you get extra cycles in there we don't have to do that this by solving with your unit circle is going to give you all solutions on 0 2 pi so cosine theta equals negative 1 says on what angle is my x coordinate negative 1 that's pi cosine theta equals positive one half says i'm on what angle are my x coordinates uh is my exponent one half well there's two of them it's going to be pi over three all the way around five pi over three those are the two angles where you have an x coordinate of positive one one-half these are all the solutions of that equation on that particular interval and that's really all there is to it so so number one is try to isolate your trig function combine some like terms if you can if you can't look for factoring if you don't you can't actually factor this by subtracting one then going right down to here well you'd have cosine squared and cosine squared you have cosine and cosine here if that's too difficult that's it's okay if it is do a substitution just call the inside part u factor it and then put it back we've done a lot of substitutions in many many videos this is just another one that we can now utilize so get everything on one side factoring then putting back your substitution just remember that if your angle is different you have to manipulate that a little bit just add your cycles if you have to now next one tangent theta minus one secant theta minus one multiplied together equals zero do not distribute this i'm making it please don't distribute that if you have two factors which you do multiplied together which they are equal to zero you win this is fantastic because you can set each of those equal to zero by the zero product property the exact same thing that we did right here don't substitute definitely don't distribute this is easier than that so tan theta minus 1 equals 0 by the zero product property and secant theta minus 1 equals 0 again by the same property and these oh wow now that we've done that these are some basic trig functions you can actually isolate that trig function just like here where factoring lets you isolate the variable easily using zero product property lets you isolate the trig function easily so adding one in both cases where tangent theta equals one asks on what angle is your y over x giving you positive one that's pi over four and that's five pi over four so here pi over four and there five pi over four you can use a table for secant theta so secant theta equals 1 that's fine i will use a reciprocal and say secant theta the reciprocal of that is cosine theta so cosine theta would equal the reciprocal of one that would also be one uh well where is the x-coordinate one that would be on zero so an angle of zero gives you an x-coordinate of one right there there's a little blurb i said that i made a mistake at the very beginning of the video that i accidentally had an equals there notice how i don't want that because 0 and 2 pi would give me an x coordinate of 1. i can i only really want one of those to be on that interval so i'm gonna choose the zero and not the two pi that's why we don't want it equals one then so cosine is zero equals one that's fantastic so i have three solutions pi over four five pi over four and zero hope that's making sense to you factoring is really nice don't distribute if you already have the zero product property all right we're going to do three examples right now that illustrate the important use of identities now in trigonometry when students hear identities go oh my gosh they're horrible they can be they really can they're tough i'm not going to sit here and lie to you and say oh they're a piece of cake if you understand them they're extremely useful and when you get to calculus like calculus 2 especially we use a ton of identities the better you are now the easier that class is going to be i promise also some of the substitutions have already shown you and i will show you later trigonometric substitutions are a big deal for calc 2 you're going to get something called an integral and you're going to have them by trig sub integrals by trig7 a lot of students hate them i'll teach them to you very very well in calculus 2 but it's a lot of your trigonometry things that you do in calculus stem from identities and so i'm going to start illustrating how you use those so next few videos we're dealing with identities just purely identities for a long time it's a huge video but right now we're going to start because we really only know a couple of them we know some even and odd identities we know the pythagorean identity we're going to use that right now we use even and on in the next example and then tangent equals sine over cosine and the one after that so sorry spoiler alert has revealed the whole thing that's what we're going to do but it's important for you to know where we're going so here's how we start with identities number one we try well and this is using identities not exactly proving an identic uh identical relationship we're using them to solve an equation but number one look at the hard side what side looks harder well that that side looks harder start start with that side try to make one fraction if there's fractions try to write everything as sine and cosine if it's not it is there's no fractions try to identify some identities that work with what you have up there so i have sine squared i have cosine squared theta what do i know about sine squared well there's only one identity that i that i know of the last one is this last one is if you have all of one type of trig function see if you can make it into that type of trig functions or the majority is like sine make everything in the sign if the majority is cosine make everything cosine if you have cosine squared plus sine squared that's one and that's fantastic we're not there yet but we do have this sine squared i see a cosine i see a cosine squared see a sine squared this is kind of the odd guy out i want to change this guy see that's a cosine squared and a cosine those work well together that's fine we can maybe factor that but this does not and so what we're going to do right now is we're going to we're going to look at that and think what identity do i know that deals with sine squared theta well there's really only one that we have right now and this would be the pythagorean identity we did have many videos ago but this this is one of them so i'm going to solve for what i want to get rid of that's how identities can be used so i want to get rid of sine squared or at least change it and so i'm going to solve this identity which i know is true for sine squared let's subtract cosine squared theta from both sides so if this is true which is then this is also true which it is which means you can substitute it so i'm going to do that right now i'm going to say hey sine squared theta is 1 minus cosine squared theta so i'm going to change this piece down to that so sine squared theta now changes to whatever this is based on the pythagorean identity that we use to do it so this is now 1 minus cosine squared theta i had already a minus cosine squared theta now it might seem like how in the world did you know how to choose that one experience and it will get better for you as you go you'll start seeing some patterns you'll start seeing oh right okay i have a cosine squared and a cosine it looks like i'm probably going to factor that in order to factor stuff i need to make sure we all have the same type of term so i want to change the one that's not cosine uh how do i do that look for something that has a sine squared so i pull out my identity sheet ah well pythagorean identities that does it that would change that into a cosine squared something or other hey that would match the other cosine squared and cosine that i have so so let's do that and that's sort of the thought process i go through that's what i'm modeling right now so i modeled that that thinking for you on how you you'd make it down there now with that in mind now we start trying to combine whatever we can so if i combine my negative cosine squared theta minus cosine squared theta that's minus two cosine squared theta i can also subtract one from both sides and those ones are gone one track that students fall into is they try to divide um do not divide by things that can equal zero so cosine theta can equal zero right if we divide then we're actually breaking a domain rule we can divide by things to equal zero it's going to eliminate some solutions it's not good math and we're breaking some rules so instead of dividing right here we're going to try factoring so let's add 2 cosine squared theta on both sides just to keep everything positive so cosine beta plus 2 cosine squared theta this is where we can factor so the whole idea was hey this looks like factoring to me so i see a cosine squared and cosine i'm going to try to factor that this would not be great for us so i'm going to try to change that into this thing use the pythagorean identity okay solve the thing i want to replace i got it let's replace it no problem this combines in my terms all right hey my ones cancel cool oh i see some factoring now now we can factor out cosine theta and now it's magic because we have a zero product property we have two factors that are multiplied together equals zero we're going to set both of them equal to zero so cosine theta equals zero and one plus two cosine of theta equals zero we're going to solve both for zero that's done that we're going to subtract one and divide by two and now we use our unit circle there's no funny angles going on we don't have to add a cycle or anything cosine theta equals zero when that when that angle is pi over two uh it also at negative pi over two or three pi over 2. so why not negative pi over 2 because you're trying to keep in mind with that so from 0 to 2 pi so our x coordinate is zero here and there pi over two three pi over two our x coordinate is negative one half at two pi over three and four pi over three and that's it we're completely done provided that we don't have any fractions where these solutions make zero on our denominator you're going to watch for that we're done these four solutions are within our our domain of zero to two pi this is all the four solutions that satisfy that equation i hope this makes sense to you i know that this can be tough the first time you see it you look at it you go oh don't worry you're going to get it you're all very smart if you've made it this far you're doing great so don't worry about it right now this is an introduction into how to use identities okay so just bear with me i'm trying to get your brains wrapped around this concept you will get it and i'll we're gonna crush some identities in my next video but for right now this idea of oh i can change what's here into something else by using identities is extremely powerful so i'm going to show you two more examples on how that works in the next video we're going to talk about some pretty major identities let's talk about this one it looks fairly straightforward but there's there's some interesting things that happen here and so we're going to take a look at it so cosine theta equals negative sine of negative theta now when we're taking a look at solving these things of course we're going to try to isolate our trig function and we have we have two of them so we can't really do that there's no factoring right now it's not apparent it's not really cool that way so we're gonna have to use some identities so if you can't isolate your trig function if you can't straight up factor it or use a substitution you're going to use something to change what's there use identities the only way you can do it is by using identities to change what's there now how do we do that most of the time we start on a more difficult side that's more difficult than this so let's take a look at that negative sine of negative theta can we make it easier that's the first thought to go in my head make it easier well every time we have a negative angle you can change it you see all of these functions are even or odd sine happens to be an odd function what that means is that opposite inputs give you opposite outputs so sine of negative theta is equal to negative sine of theta that was due to the oddness of sine cosine was even we could just basically drop that negative inside there really it's opposite inputs are equal outputs and so cosine of negative theta equals cosine or positive theta that'd be easy but this says you can change this part into negatives sine theta can you see how a lot of students probably make a sign error right there that negative is there sine of negative theta is negative sine theta so what's a negative negative opposite of negative is positive so we have cosine theta equals sine theta when does cosine theta equal sine theta now you could actually look at the unit circle and say pi over four where is the y coordinate equal to x coordinate x pi over 4 5 pi over 4 you could do that but there is a different way to go about it if we go ahead and divide both sides by cosine one idea is if you have sines and cosines sometimes you want to get away from tangent and sometimes you want to get two tangent i'm going to show you an idea right here that if we divide both sides by cosine we can get tangent theta on the right hand side that's another identity for us so dividing both sides cosine theta divided by cosine of eight is one provided that we don't allow that cosine theta to be zero that's the only issue with this so that that issue is where is where's cosine theta zero that would be pi over two and three pi over 2. now fantastically the function that we're about to get if i would have written this right the function that we're about to get is undefined exactly where cosine is 0 why because it comes from that and that's fantastic so sine theta over cosine theta now why in the world did we do that so i was looking at this thing and let's make this easier we did using the identity using the evenness there then i looked at this and said i could probably do this but it's easier if i make a function i'm used to so i'm going to divide both sides by cosine understanding that sine theta over cosine theta is tangent theta that's much easier for a lot of students to look at and say okay hey oh hey look at that i can use my table i use my unit circle tangent theta equals 1. so on what angle do i have y over x being equal do you understand that that's exactly the same thing i asked right here like where what angle is my y coordinate equal to my x that's exactly what this is asking you on what angle is my y over my x the same that would be pi over 4 and it would also be 5 pi over 4 because those both give you positive 1 square root 2 over 2 divided by square root 2 over 2 or negative square root 2 over 2 divided by negative square root 2 over 2. those are all the solutions on zero to pi over two zero to two pi that satisfy that equation so i hope that makes sense um i know that identities can be tough but i'm trying to kind of build that in your head that's possible to change stuff to make our lives a little bit easier so we'll come back with one more and then we're done all right last one so tangent e tangent beta equals two sine theta now when we take a look at solving these things isolates trig function we have two of them try to factor there's nothing to factor um make everything sines and cosines is a good i or make everything the same trig function if you can if you if you think you're going to factor so if i was to do that if i said here's my sign here's my tangent what one can we change easily for sine i don't really have an identity for that but for tangent theta i have an identity we just use it remember that tangent theta is sine theta over cosine theta this is another kind of kind of rule of thumb for identities is if you're getting stuck change everything into sines and cosines and see what you can do after that so i'm thinking this side i'm not doing much without sign there's no identity for just sine theta uh they're the sine squared yeah but i don't have that for tangent we do have an identity so i'm thinking i can't isolate i can't factor right now i have an identity for that one not that one let's change that one and inherently we're going to change it to sines and cosines so tangent theta is sine theta over cosine theta another idea is if you can factor it's nice to do so let's get everything on one side so i thought isolate no factor i can't use identity cool let's use identity on tangent i've done it now i have some signs here when we're solving equations we like to factor things so we get everything on one side that's great and now we're going to try to factor can we factor anything well sure we can we can factor out sine this has sine theta this has sine theta there's only two terms if we factor out sine beta we get one over cosine theta minus 2. and we can verify that by distributing this would give us sine theta cosine theta hence the tangent and minus 2 sine theta and this is beautiful this is why we like to factor because this now created a zero product property for us we have sine theta times this other term that equals zero let's set both of them equal to zero now you can change that one couldn't you you could change that to secant if you really wanted to this would be one over cosine theta oh that's secant theta that's the reciprocal function you could do it but you'll end up changing back to one over cosine or reciprocating that so at some point you'd have to change it back so i'm going to show you both kind of both ways here so sine theta equals zero no problem uh one over cosine theta minus two equals zero let's solve both of them for their trig functions so sine theta equals 0 is done that looks really good this one well we have to solve for cosine let's add 2. if one over cosine equals two then cosine equals one over two just reciprocate both sides now what if you had done a different way what if right here you said this is secant theta remember one over cosine theta is secant theta that's an identity for us what have you done that well then you would get secant theta minus 2 equals 0 by the zero product property then you would add 2. and then you'd say oh secant theta equals 2 if cosine theta equals 1 over 2 the reciprocal of that and that's exactly where we find ourselves whichever one of these looks easier to you do it it doesn't really matter you're doing the same thing so whether you want to solve it directly for cosine cool you're going to get what happens when you use an identity for secant theta and solve it and use a reciprocal of the cosine anyway now we're ready to use our unit circle we're almost done so sine theta equals 0 says give me the angle where the y coordinate is zero that's at zero and that's at pi y coordinate zero y equal to zero at zero and pi cosine theta equals one half says give me the angle where the x coordinate is one half that's here at pi over three that's here at five pi over three x coordinate with positive one half so there's four solutions that's all the solutions that's on that interval there was no interesting angles to work with no extra cycles to add i hope this has made sense i especially hope you're seeing the utility of of these identities they're extremely helpful i know they're challenging um remember that that like when you when you start learning this stuff it's going to be frustrating frustration's okay frustration is our brain trying to cope with new information and you're trying to make it fit that's fine you should expect that a little bit when you start getting angry at it like you break your book in half that's not okay um and you're gonna get that way but at some point i i know i do sometimes when i'm working on something just not making sense that's when it's it's time to take a break so take a break step back from the math um let yourself calm down uh what happens is when our brains get too wrapped up in that it's like when uh you're having a conversation with somebody and and you're you're arguing and then someone starts yelling and you go ah at that point no one's listening you're not really learning uh and that's what's happening here if you get mad at it so once that happens and it will happen it's okay take a break come back a little bit later so frustration is okay anger take a little break so i hope it's making sense to you i hope that that helps you in some way next video we're going to come back and it's going to be very long we're going to talk about how to use identities to prove relationships so i'll see you for that have a great day you 

Transcript for: Introduction to Using Trigonometric Identities (Precalculus - Trigonometry 23)
hi welcome to another video so in this video what we're going to do is we're going to talk about trigonometric identities super useful super challenging sometimes to prove them and so we're going to start in this video with just an introduction so the basic and basic identities that we have that we're going to use later on to not only improve identities but to make our math a lot easier sometimes we get into this like thought process like teachers are just trying to make our lives harder when they give us identities and it might seem that way because they're challenging but it really will make your lives easier when you get to calc one count two count three and you start dealing with trigonometry and some of these things are very difficult if we don't have a good grasp of identities under our belt and so we're going to start that right now so i'm going to refresh what our identities are even odd the pythagorean identities some of the reciprocal identities we'll use them on just a couple examples right now just trying to get your your brains wrapped around how in the world we structure our thinking to prove identities how do we simplify these things with trigonometry because it sometimes is not very obvious um so we're going to start that right now so some identities that you should have if you have like a little note card man put them on a flash card or something that way you associate the name with the identity that way that when you get there to uh actually using them you're not flipping through your notes all the time also i haven't written them on the board because there's too many of them but there are different ways you can write this like the pythagorean identities we'll talk about in a minute so here's the basic identities that you need to at least be aware of and hopefully know how to use so the reciprocal identities are important they do things like tell you that tangent can be represented as a fraction sine over cosine cotangent can be cosine over sine uh cotangent can also be one over tangent those are all very important cosecant theta is one over sine and secant theta is one over cosine those are all of our reciprocal identities we can write sine and cosine as secant and cosecant but that's typically not what we do i'll give you sort of a heads up about how identities work as soon as we make it through this the pythagorean identities are these guys and things with the squares in them so two squares and a constant usually one so sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta equals one that's true it's a pythagorean identity what i'm not writing up here is things like remember that if this is true i could subtract cosine squared theta from both sides and get sine squared theta equals 1 minus cosine squared theta or likewise cosine squared theta equals 1 minus sine squared theta i'm not writing those but that needs to be i would say obvious to you but at least we can access that we understand that that is that's possible the same thing would happen here so we could have tan squared theta plus 1 equals secant squared theta we could also have secant squared theta minus 1 equals tangent squared theta or we could have secant squared theta minus tangent squared theta equals 1. so any way that we can manipulate that still holds true with these identities and that's kind of nice that means we can use them at least in three different ways same thing with our cotangent squared theta plus one equals cosecant squared theta these are all pythagorean identities but remember that we can change them around to suit us if we need to i'll show you when that happens the last thing are even and odd identities there's only two even trig functions it's cosine and secant the rest are odd which means if i have a negative angle it equals negative of that positive version or in other words opposite inputs give you opposite outputs that happens for sine cosecant tangent and cotangent so sine of negative theta equals negative sine of theta that happens for all of these what we call odd trig functions cosine and secant that's different they're even even means opposite inputs same or equal outputs so if i plug in a positive and a negative angle to cosine i'm going to get the absolute value the same i'm going to get exactly the same output for cosine cosine negative theta is the same thing as cosine positive theta same for secant and so what we're going to do now is we're going to get into just two or three problems of how to simplify some of these trig functions it's going to lead us on the idea of identities like what the world identities do so the two that i want to look at right now are up on the board here's the thought process for how identities work and how simplification works so what we're going to be doing a little while is solving trigonometric identities or i shouldn't say really proving them right now we're just simplifying it's like a baby step towards proving identities here's the thought process number one start with a harder side with identities now there's no sides here because there's no equal sign so you just start with what you have the second step is if you have more than one fraction try to write them on the same denominator so try to combine your fractions we'll see that in a second example after that if you're still stuck write everything as sines and cosines and then use only the identities that you know so the ones that you know are to don't try to make up your own identities it usually doesn't work out all that great um now one thing i will admit is that those those steps i gave you which i'm going to write out in the next video they're not hard and fast rules they're ideas this is general a general idea to get you through some identities are very easy to prove some are very challenging to prove but that set of steps that i'm going to try to build in your head right now really has helped me to prove identities and help me to simplify so let's let's go ahead and start with this one now remember we're not proven identities because there's no equal sign it's not saying this is this now prove it all we're doing is simplifying what we have so tangent theta times cosecant theta the ideas are number one if you have more than one fraction try to combine them try to get one fraction on one side but we don't have that the next idea is if if one of these identities isn't just jumping out at you try to change everything into sines and cosines if you get stuck what do i mean by that well tangent can be written as sine theta over cosine theta and so we're going to do that cosecant theta can be written as one over sine theta and so we would we would try that and the idea is basically put it in things that you're more familiar with most of the time we can change every other function into sines and cosines cotangent does it tangent does it cosecant does it secant does it so we can change everything to sides and cosines and usually we'll have something cancel out it hasn't always happened but this is the reason why we do that so we try to make one fraction you know they have that what i mean is this is two different fractions not things multiplied things added or subtracted try to make one fraction then we're going to try to do if an identity is right there and we use it great that's awesome but if not then start changing things into sines and cosines see if something simplifies see if an identity pops out so right here we have sine theta over cosine theta times one over sine theta well wait a minute we have a sine theta and a sine theta numerator denominator they're going to cancel so 1 times 1 is 1 cosine theta times 1 is cosine theta and then we can leave it like that but it's really more appropriate to write this as a more concise trig function so use some identities that you know so we did was already what wasn't like these two fractions we had to find a common denominator we looked at this and said i don't know an identity with that right now i'm going to write this as sines and cosines so we do that using known identities we can simplify awesome that's just a basic algebra and now we're down to here we see 1 over cosine theta that's great but i'm going to use a known identity to write this more concisely so 1 over cosine theta is let's look right there that would be secant theta i hope you're noticing what we're doing the thought process isn't random the thought process is use stuff that's already here try to write things in sines and cosines simplify them and then also notice that these are two-way streets so we used one as cosecant theta is a reciprocal function one over sine theta but then also we went backwards one over cosine theta is secant theta and that needs to be really clear in your head that identities are not one-way streets they're two-way streets if this then this but also this and this this is necessary it's efficient or if and only if this thing it goes both ways in other words so that's great we simplified this now which one would be easier to use that one that's much nicer if we can simplify this is one reason why we have identities is so that we can simplify things that we get in our math to be easier to work with and that's much nicer let's look at the next one so sine theta plus cosine theta over cosine theta plus cosine theta minus sine theta over sine that looks like just a mess where do you start well if you are trying to prove an identity what would happen is you have an equal sign and this would equal a whole other side and you'd start with what you think is the harder side that's most of the time what you do remember i'm giving you ideas here it doesn't work all the time but generally this is the thought process start with the harder side now we only have one side here so we have to start with that secondly if you have a couple fractions or more than one fraction and they're added or subtracted get a common denominator and make one fraction out of it that's a very good idea last time i'm going to say it these steps don't always work in this order for everything that you do but it's a generally good way to go through and try for identities so we're going to look at this and go yeah let's add those here here's what knots do man i'm i'm begging please don't cross those out it's very common i see it all the time if you've done it it's okay just don't do it again don't cross that up don't cross that out this these are not multiplied together then there are factors you cannot simplify that what you can do is you can get a common denominator and add or subtract those fractions so we're going to do that right now our lcd would be cosine theta times sine theta so we'd say hey those need to have a common denominator this is missing a sine theta this is missing the cosine theta so we're going to multiply by that we also need parentheses right on our numerator because some things are going to distribute we're going to have to combine some like terms so we're going to distribute that don't forget that honor denominator hopefully you can see hopefully you can see that we're going to get sine theta cosine theta and then sine theta cosine theta on our numerator when we distribute we'll get sine squared remember sine times sine is power 2. we write that as sine squared theta and then we get sine theta times cosine theta something very similar here cosine squared theta minus sine theta cosine theta we had to do that because you can't add and subtract fractions if you have a different denominator even if you have trig functions you can't just because you want to make that sine plus cosine or something it doesn't work they have to be the same and so we've done that we said we're missing sine theta put the factor there cosine theta likewise we've distributed we've multiplied here and now we have a common denominator that's great we're going to combine this to one fraction but look at what is going to happen we're going to add our numerators so we'll have sine squared theta plus sine theta cosine theta plus cosine squared theta minus sine theta cosine theta that's going to cancel i'm gonna write the whole thing out so that we see it and it's generally a good step especially oh man i hope you listen right now especially if that's a minus then you'd have to distribute that it would change your signs it doesn't here but in general you put a parenthesis around your numerators so that if that was a minus you could see that sign change and hopefully we see a little clearer here sine squared theta this is our numerator plus plus does not change that so if you distribute a plus or you think about adding both terms you add cosine squared you add negative sine theta cosine theta that would be the term is that you treat that like a negative well if we have positive sine theta cosine theta minus sine theta cosine theta that's gone that's going to completely cancel this was nice because everything was in terms of sines and cosines they're the nicest to work with identities and simplification if if one of these identities isn't popping out like if you have this of course you're not going to want to change that to sines and cosines but in general it's make one fraction make everything sides and cosines if you're not seeing an identity already if then simplify what you can you've just done that and then find an identity that works with what you have left so okay so i've done all that i've made one fraction i've made everything signs and cosines if it wasn't already it was i simplified what i can that's great i've written it more concisely that's awesome that's one fraction and now we try to find an identity if one didn't show up before we have to finally know so sine squared theta plus cosine squared there let's look for something that resembles that now remember it doesn't this i just gave it to you just like a nice softball right there but it doesn't have to be that way i could easily have made that 1 minus cosine squared theta and then we'd say oh yes i can manipulate this that would be sine squared theta that's possible we can do things like that be careful with that use these identities in the the many facets that they have so here we look and say oh that's right here perfect let's go ahead and let's simplify sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta is one so one over sine theta cosine theta the last thing is is sometimes we can outsmart ourselves and go too far uh we can start doing things like well now do i have to find identity like this for that there isn't one that's the last step is only use known identities that way you're not making up stuff now you could do this you could think of this as 1 over sine theta times 1 over cosine theta and change both of those into cosecant theta secant theta that's that's possible so one over sine theta times one over cosine theta remember you can split up denominators by multiplication as long as you multiply the numerator as well so we have that that's one over the same denominator and this is cosecant theta that is secant theta these two identities here and here just going backwards so i'm using the known identities things that i already i already have down in order to simplify this one of these would be most appropriate we don't want to be going any further because there's no identity that makes us any simpler that's really about it we're going to do one more example but hopefully the ideas are starting to build in your head they can start looking really confusing when you start getting them like like that but what do i do i don't know follow the steps and see if it doesn't work for you so that's that's generally how i make it through simplifying and how we start working with identities in just a bit all right last one so we've got this cosine squared theta minus 1 over cosine squared theta minus cosine theta don't cross that out i know it looks very tempting to do but these are not multiplied they're subtracted so we cannot do that we gotta if you have any ability to simplify things it's got to be things multiplied together now that's key that's key to this problem actually so i'm going to model my thing and go through the thought process of how i would approach this i look at it and i start thinking about identities do i see any that are just right there right on the surface that i can use or how it's structured do i have one fraction what's going on so i'm looking at saying it's already one fraction that's fantastic i know i'm supposed to simplify this thing and i don't have to get a common denominator or anything so i'm noticing two things about it number one i do notice that that looks really familiar that looks just like this it's got a cosine squared then it's got a one in fact you could do this now don't don't do it i'll tell you want a minute um but you could subtract one from both sides subtract sine squared theta from both sides and you would get this identity cosine squared theta minus 1 equals negative sine squared theta you could do that now why am i not going to do that this is the second thing i'm noticing everything's already cosines in fact i've got two terms over two terms and everything's already in terms of cosine maybe i can factor this so if i'm trying to simplify remember that factoring is a great way to simplify so when we look at it it's already satisfied the one fraction thing it's already satisfied the everything's in sines and cosines so this is all in terms of cosine well that's the second piece is that if i need to simplify with more than one term factoring creates these products that i can cancel you can't cancel this but if i was to factor it i would be able to do that so sometimes even though you might be able to use identity look at the structure of the problem if it's one fraction and you got everything in terms of cosine see if you can factor it we can't forget that factoring still works on everything that's algebraic and this is a type of algebra it's just that your terms are based on cosine theta treat that it's not a variable and treat that like the variable you would factor so even though it's a function we can do things like look at cosine squared theta minus 1 and think oh yeah that's a difference of squares that's very similar to x squared minus 1. that's the same thing practically as in terms of the structure x squared minus one you'd write this as x minus one and x plus one is two factors this we're gonna write as cosine theta minus one and cosine theta plus one as our two factors on our denominator we've got this cosine theta squared theta minus cosine theta this is very similar to like x squared minus x think gcf think race common factor we can factor that out just because it has cosines in it doesn't mean that your algebra fails it just means you have to really see past it so i'm going to factor out cosine theta if i factor that out remember this is cosine squared theta so factoring cosine theta out we get cosine theta and then cosine theta divided by cosine theta is 1. if you distribute it you can see that cosine squared theta minus cosine theta but this is completely factored and factors great because it multiplies everything together creates these factors that are well that are of course connected by multiplication things that we can simplify if we have common factors on the numerator and denominator so though the whole idea here for like a 20 second recap was it was already one fraction that's great it was already written in terms of sines and cosines in fact it was all cosines and that was the biggest clue to me was that if everything's in terms of cosine i probably don't want to start changing things around if i can factor it now if i couldn't factor it then yeah maybe i'd start using some identities this is one thing i said in the last example was sometimes we can outsmart ourselves so sometimes we look at that and think oh man i've gotta subtract one subtract sine squared theta and use the identity i use the same thing here and then it starts to explode starts getting really really really really big or really really nasty if that's happening there's a chance you could be right and the chance you do it the right way but if it's just exploding and exploding and nothing's cancelling it's getting worse and worse stop stop and go back and see if there was maybe a different way to do it um our better way here would be factoring so if you can factor it try it that's going to create this simplification force you can see right here it does simplify um we can leave it there but there is a couple other things that we can do with this if we write this as two different fractions to simplify this we see a cosine over cosine no you can't just cross them out but you could write this as cosine theta over cosine theta and one over cosine theta that's possible to do this idea of using the common denominator in reverse so this this naturally would give you cosine theta plus one over cosine theta that means you can split this up basically dividing this and that both by cosine theta well cosine theta over cosine theta is one one over cosine theta that's secant theta that's as most as much as we can simplify that that's the most concise that we can write it that's how we simplify things so hopefully it makes sense hopefully you understand this idea of look use the harder side for identity for simplification you only have one side so see if you can write it as one fraction if you have to if there's no identity present then write things as sines and cosines simplify what you can that sometimes means factoring that was already sines and cosines see if you can factor use known identities like we did right here and simplify as much as you possibly can so hopefully it makes sense um thanks for sticking with me next time we'll talk about much more advanced identities we'll start proving them i'll go through these steps again step by step and do lots of examples for you so i'll see you for that 

Transcript for: How to Prove Trigonometric Identities (Precalculus - Trigonometry 24)
welcome to another video so in this video we're going to tackle how to prove trigonometric identities they can be challenging so i'm going to give you some steps that is a general way to think about it does it work every single time exactly how i'm going to write this out like this no no it doesn't but most of the time this will give you a good first step on how to how to solve or how to prove some of these trig identities so i'm going to walk you through that we're going to do 11 examples right now a lot it's going gonna be a long video i know it um but it's important and so i'm gonna model my thinking that's mostly what i'm gonna be doing here is is trying to teach you how to think about them the identities themselves i've written the ones that we use most often on the board besides like the even and the odd and the reciprocal ones that are probably getting in your head right now so i've written the pythagorean identities i'm going to go through the steps if you watch the last video which i hope that you did on how to simplify some of the trig trigonometric functions um this is right along the same lines so here's the thought process and i'm going to model my thinking on 11 examples the first thing that we really want to look at in our trig identities is what looks like the harder side now does is always the harder side um no but it's typically the stuff the thing with more stuff on it we work on that side and we work on that side only if we can so try to work on just one side so we're going to take a look at the harder side whatever says ah tackle that first then what we do is here's some ideas then what we do is try to write it as one fraction if you have more than one fraction simplify it as you go if you can if you can't find an identity that's apparent so like it's just popping right at you if you can't do that then write everything as signs and cosigns that's a key thing if you have some identities right there then don't do this if you have an identity just kind of that's already there don't do that it'll often times simplify for you then use only identities that you actually know so the ones that we've written here don't try to make them up as you go or things you can manipulate so i've done that so we're going to we're going to do this in just a little bit but notice that this is all the same identity i've kind of known it's a service so we don't have to go on every example and kind of redo this but the pythagorean identities are on the top and then the the manipulations of them like subtracting cosine squared theta or sine squared theta or subtracting one or subtracting tangent squared theta we get two identities basically for free so these are all stemming from these top three identities so let's go right into it i'm gonna model my thinking i'll tell you exactly what i'm doing uh we'll talk about why i'm doing this like i always do and i'll refer back to these steps so let's take a look at this identities are one thing equals another thing in trigonometry that's what an identity is we're just trying to prove it when you prove it basically start with one side and show that eventually it equals the other side now it'd be great if we just looked at it when yeah that'd be nice but we can't it'd be great if we could just plug in a couple values for theta and show that it works but we can't we have to prove this for every valid theta on the domain of these trig functions so we have to show it for all of them that would take us forever and so we start with the let's say hard side and make it equal to the easy side if you will so we're going to take a look at this what side looks harder to me that looks farther than that that's just one term this is a product so i'm going to start with secant theta times sine theta and i'm going to start thinking in terms of this so this is my hard side i'm working only on this side does it have fractions i don't see any fractions uh okay so is there an identity that's right there for me no i really don't see an identity right there so i checked hard side no fractions no identities right there i'm going to write everything in terms of sine and cosine not that remember work only on one side so secant theta i can write that as 1 over cosine now i'm not going to write equals tangent i'm going to work this down until it actually equals tangent and then we'll have shown that one side equals the other and proven our identity for everything that's on the domain now let's go back all right uh i'm still on the hard side we're going to stick with that side so that doesn't really change but let's make this a single fraction so i'm going to make this 1 times sine sine theta over cosine theta i've made this one fraction now i've already rewritten in terms of sine and cosine but the point here is that as soon as you do something look for an identity that you know so i'm looking here going wait a minute sine theta over cosine theta is tangent theta as soon as you get down to what you wanted to show show it and that satisfies the proof so we started on one side we used some identities we wrote everything in signs and cosines one fraction we used a known identity and that's satisfied what you're what you're trying to show show that this side eventually equal tangent theta which is exactly what we stated in the beginning that's how a proof works this is a very good section a very good video for you to get introduced to how to prove things you don't just go plug in a couple numbers you have to actually show with known mathematics that this equals that that actually works and this is one way to go through and do that again it doesn't work in this order every single time the exact same way but it's a good series of steps and that's why we're doing a lot of examples to build that let's let's start the next one so secant theta minus 1 secant theta plus 1 equals tangent squared theta i'm going to first look at this and identify what i think is a harder side looks like the left hand side is harder there's more stuff over there next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to look if we have more than one fraction i don't have any fractions so that's satisfied i don't have anything going on there then i'm going to look for any identities that i have so i i don't see an identity here or here i do see a tangent squared though so i'm thinking uh i'm i'm tangent squared and then secant i have an identity here with that so i might not want to change that into sines and cosines just yet maybe i want to distribute this so i have these this couple couple factors being multiplied let's distribute this and see where it goes because this is very close to an identity right here so i'm going to choose to distribute so secant theta times c to theta secant squared theta we get plus secant theta and minus secant theta that's going to cancel and then we get 1 times negative 1 is minus 1. so i've started hard side i've looked at there's no fractions i didn't see an identity but i saw that we were kind of close to one so i chose to distribute rather than write things in terms of sines and cosines now what if you did write in terms of sines and cosines would you get the same thing well you would get 1 over cosine squared theta now if you saw that you go oh yeah 1 over cosine squared that is secant squared theta and now we're down to here so we're going to evaluate that there's no fractions um the next thing we should do is look to see if there's an identity right here so look hey look there's one right there secant squared theta minus one secant squared theta minus one is tangent squared theta and that's exactly what we were trying to prove it's kind of identities are kind of nice because it shows you what you want to get to so you know your goal it's kind of like uh looking at the textbook in the back and going oh that's what i'm trying to get to and then you figure out how to get there i know i'll do that um so that's that's what this is really about start on hardside figure out that it makes it equal to the other side um using the these ideas that i'm giving you so tangent squared theta does in fact equal tangent squared theta and that satisfies our proof man that connection these are getting a little bit more complicated cosine theta times tangent theta plus cotangent theta equals cosecant of theta and there's no argument that's the hard side so let's start there we're going to only work on that side let's see how this this works out for us we start by seeing if there's more than one fraction trying to combine them now i don't have more than one fraction i'm going to look for any identities or things that are close to identities this was very close to an identity i saw it because i was trying to get tangent squared that's what led me down this thought process of distribute rather than go to sines and cosines here i'm not real man i'm not seeing any identities they're coming up here i don't see any squares i'm not seeing anything that looks similar to this stuff over here so i'm probably going to write this in sines and cosines there's no fractions there's no squares there's no other identities let's go sines and cosines on this so that cosine looks good but this should be sine theta over cosine theta this should be cosine theta over sine theta and i'm only working on one side so i've i've done that now we have a choice here could you get one denominator and and make that one fraction you could but i do notice that i can simplify this so that's why i said these don't have to go in a hard and fast order we're always looking to see if we can simplify things as we go we're always looking at do i have an identity that's closed do i have a simplification that's close instead of making this one fraction right now i'm going to choose to multiply and simplify as we go so i'm going to distribute this so cosine theta times sine theta over cosine theta that cosine is going to cancel we're going to get sine theta but here i'm going to get cosine squared theta over sine theta what if you would have got one fraction here multiplied by sine over sine cosine over cosine and then distributed would be the same thing yes you absolutely would it's not it's actually not that big of a difference you'd get a common denominator of sine theta cosine theta your cosine would still cancel and you'd get exactly what we're going to end up with here in just a minute you see at this point i have two fractions this is over one this is cosine squared theta over sine of theta i need to make this one fraction so i've looked at and said that's the hard side i didn't see an identity i didn't see a simplification so i distributed it sorry so i changed it into sines and cosines i didn't see a clear identity here so i distributed i saw a cancellation there that's why we did that now i have two fractions i'm going to try to make that one fraction because i don't really see a great identity that's leading me on to to that well sorry that what we're trying to get to so i'm gonna make this into one fraction because this is over one my common denominator is sine theta i'm going to multiply that on the hand side over here so when we do it we get this sine squared theta over sine theta plus cosine squared theta over sine theta oh look we got a common number we can now make one fraction and you're gonna see exactly why we do that why this is here get a single fraction is because a lot of times when we do that things cancel and also we get some identities just pop right out of this so we're going to get sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta over sine theta another thing that i hope that you're seeing at me model is this idea of i'm always checking is there something i can simplify is there an identity that's popping out of me what that means is it's very apparent that's readily available that's on the board right now so i i did that from here i looked is there identity no not really um is there are we close to an identity yes for here i'm going to distribute that it's very close here not so much change signs and cosigns um i see a simplification so i notice that i'm going to distribute and simplify could you have made one fraction yes it would work out just as well after that i'm looking for an identity i don't really see one very well so i'm going to make one fraction okay we've made one fraction uh let's let's look for identity i see one right here sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta is one so instead of doing anything else like it's like simplifying this some other way we're going to use identities right when they come up so sine squared theta plus plus cosine squared beta is 1 that's going to give us 1 over sine theta now remember we're trying to get here so let's think about 1 over sine theta 1 over sine theta is cosecant theta so we did all this work and got down to cosecant theta cosecant theta does equal cosecant theta we've now proven this identity i hope that's making sense i hope that you're seeing the thought process we have a lot more to do but right now the the ideas should be sort of building your head on how to at least approach these identities let's keep right on going so we've got the sine theta cosecant theta minus cosine squared theta equals sine squared theta start with the harder side this is obviously the harder side that's just one term over there so we're going to take a look at this under the lines of do we have more have more than one fractions do we have identities are popping right out of us or do we need to write everything in sines and cosines so i don't have any fractions at all i'm looking at this that looks really close to an identity so it looks it has something to do with this this over here probably um but this doesn't and so i'm going to try to write everything in terms of sines and cosines and see what happens so sine theta cosecant but cosecant theta is one over sine theta so we're using that reciprocal identity so i'm working on just one side now let's make one fraction or just realize that sine theta times one over sine theta that's gonna cancel you're going to get 1. so i've simplified an obvious simplification there and now i'm going to re-evaluate this has no fractions everything's in terms of sines and cosines do i have an obvious identity well one minus cosine squared theta that's one of the the ways that we can represent the pythagorean identity right here so one minus cosine squared theta that is sine squared theta and we've got we've got down to exactly what we wanted to prove so we've shown that this side is sine squared theta since we're theta equals sine squared theta on this domain and we're done that's exactly proven identities let's do the next one so the next one is man this is a really good example for why we don't always just write things in terms of sines and cosines right off the bat so we look at it and go one minus cosine squared theta times one plus cotan cotangent squared theta equals one remember the ideas the ideas are if you have one fraction yeah you're probably going to be if you have more one fraction yeah you're probably gonna make this in terms of one fraction but we're always looking for can i simplify it what's gonna let me simplify it easily and do i have any identities that are right there already because if i do i don't want to be writing things in terms of sines and cosines if they're already in an identity that i can use so when we take a look at 1 minus cosine squared theta we just did that 1 minus cosine sine squared theta is an obvious identity it's well maybe it's not obviously you used to it's maybe a bad thing to say sorry um but it's an identity that that is known so 1 minus cosine squared theta is sine squared theta that's great why change that if it's already an identity we want to use let's make that into sine squared theta 1 plus cotangent squared theta again we're not going to be writing things in terms of sines and cosines if we have an identity already there one plus cotangent squared theta or cotangent squared theta plus one is cosecant squared theta so we started with the hard side we we looked for the one fraction thing we didn't have any fractions we thought about maybe doing sines and cosines but we want to check for simplification and for identities that are already known in there before we do that and there's two identities here and here that we're just right on the board for us that's great now we re-evaluate can i simplify that not that it looks like is there a known identity that works with this not that i can tell now is when we write everything in terms of sines and cosines so sine squared theta times cosecant theta is one over sine theta so cosecant squared theta is one over sine squared theta and now we reevaluate we have more than one fraction could you write this as one fraction yeah you would get sine squared theta over sine squared theta that's going to simplify and give you one one does equal one we worked on one side got it down to exactly what it said that it should equal that's proven that identity for us okay so secant to the fourth theta minus secant squared theta equals tangent to the fourth theta plus tangent squared theta don't you wish you could just go sure nailed it i believe you they're all worked anyway so why do i need to prove it first because it's good for you and doesn't feel good for you sometimes um but but secondly because it's important to understand how these proofs work important to be able to work with them and to give ourselves more identities so understand that every time we prove something you could now use that so if you ever see this again anywhere in your math you know that that is true so you'd say oh yeah okay you're not even getting that you know that that's going to equal one if you have this list of identities and you can do that you can develop your own identities like we're doing right here so let's start with the hard side what's the hard side they look probably equally difficult um secants look a little more difficult than tangents to me so i'm going to start there so i'm going to work on my left hand side i'm looking at that thinking is there an identity that's that's right up there there's one that's close i like that secant squared theta i don't like the secant to the fourth theta so instead of writing everything in terms of sines and cosines because i'm thinking this is probably close to some identity i'm going to factor i don't like the fourth power anyway i'm going to factor out a secant squared theta that would be a little more simple so let's simplify that by factoring so factoring out secant squared theta we get secant squared theta times secant squared theta minus one you can see by distribution that's true it's just basically like having x to the fourth minus x squared you factor in a gcf now let's reevaluate do we see an identity that's right up there something we can simplify secant squared theta minus 1 is right there that is equal to tangent squared theta so let's use that right when we see it don't do sines and cosines if you have an identity that's right there for you now we have the secant squared theta times tangent squared theta and this is one of those times that you want to keep in mind what you're going towards you're trying to get to tangent to the fourth theta times tangent squared theta this is one of the times we're writing things in terms of like sines and cosines probably wouldn't be that beneficial because i already have a piece of that i have a tangent squared theta what's the thing that i don't have in terms of tangent that one so maybe we use this and write this in terms of tangent so let's use the identity to change this thing so [Music] let's see secant squared theta is tangent squared theta plus one so i've kept on one side i've seen that something was close to an identity so i factored i used the identity i thought i got that and now i'm checking this is pretty close to this i don't want to do sines and cosines because i i already have a piece of that this is not close to that let's change that one with a known identity so we've done that now we're oh man we're so close but keep in mind we're trying to get to we're almost there let's distribute this and that satisfies the identity that we just proved so um is it always exactly like this every time no it's a good set of steps but we're also we're going to be critical thinkers you're going to be thinking about it the ideas are this works most of the time the ideas are well simplify if you can if you have a known identity that's going to help you use it right when you see it also keep in mind what our goal is your goal is to try to get this thing over here so sometimes writing things in terms of sines and cosines not such a great idea if you're completely stuck then yes that's a good way to go so i hope it's making sense i hope that i'm making it very clear for you we're going to step it up and do five whatever consider really difficult uh proofs let's go on to this example uh we're gonna we're gonna prove this identity and it's gonna use something that looks like a trick and frankly it is kind of a trick but it's thinking really smartly about what we want and what we have so uh 3 sine squared theta plus 4 cosine squared theta equals 3 plus cosine squared theta i want you to look at this side what i would consider the harder side and take a look how this looks a whole lot like this one looks very very similar but there's a 3 here and a 4 there if this was a 3 couldn't you factor the three out from both terms yeah and then that would be one but that's not a three that's a four well can i write it a little bit differently instead of having four cosine squared theta we can do things that are meant it's a really kind of a smart move here but we can do things that let us write this as like three cosine theta is cosine squared theta plus one cosine squared theta so check this out if this is really close to an identity that we want try to make it fit it's already in terms of sines and cosines that wouldn't help us i don't see an identity that's just right out there and i can't factor the way it is write it as something we can factor this is still 3 sine squared theta plus 3 cosine squared theta cosine squared theta that's still 4 cosine squared theta but it's made it so that this piece you can factor if you look at just that piece and factor out the 3 well then now that's a good identity so sine squared theta plus cosine squared that's one of our pythagorean identities that's one so this is three times one and that's exactly what we're trying to prove so i hope that makes sense that that's i mean it looks like a trick it kind of is a trick but it's also understanding that if you're very close to an identity this is what we saw in a previous couple few previous examples is make that identity work somehow don't change the identity that it's it's there it's right there just just make it work structure it so that you can factor structure this so that identity can pop out at you that looks a little crazy so sine squared of negative theta minus cosine squared of negative theta over sine negative theta minus cosine negative equals cosine theta minus sine theta when you see those negative angles those negative whatever the the argument of your your trig function are and that's negative use an identity use the even and odd identities remember the signs of odd function and cosines of even function it means they're changeable you can change that and so we're going to do it we're going to structure a little bit differently this is obviously the hard side it's always one fraction but we're going to structure a little bit differently so we recognize what's going on so sine squared means sine of whatever that angle is all to the second power this really means this this is sine of negative theta quantity squared same thing as that means sine squared negative theta means this thing right here all over let's start using the even and odd identities so sine of negative theta is the same thing as negative sine theta opposite inputs opposite outputs for odd functions no we're not just pulling the negative out front that that doesn't happen with trig functions you need identities you can't just make it up as you go we'd love to but we can't um sign's odd it's an odd function so that means that if i plug in a negative and a positive with the same absolute value angle you're going to get opposite results and that's exactly what we're showing here cosine's even so cosine says opposite angles equal outputs which means cosine of negative theta is same thing as cosine positive theta and we're going to use that here too so sine of negative theta is equal to negative sine theta that's an odd function cosine of negative theta is equal to cosine positive theta even function i also might factor out my negative i don't like that negative there so let's let's do that so i've taken and said that's an odd function okay that's going to be a negative that's an even function it's going to be a positive i have the power 2's i have the minus i factor this out because we really don't like seeing both those those biases down there and now we're going to go ahead and evaluate this negative sine theta squared what would happen with that well that would be let's see negative 1 squared that's what that is negative 1 squared would be positive 1 sine squared would be sine squared theta minus cosine squared theta all over negative side theta plus cosine theta man that's really close to identity but it's not one it's not an identity maybe what we can do is run this negative through there see what happens so i have everything on one fraction i have sines and cosines but i'm not seeing a clear identity i also don't like that negative so i'm going to make this negative sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta now it looks like we're kind of in the same position i don't see an identity popping out of me i've taken care of that negative it looks about as simplified as i can make it i don't see an identity that's like do this right now so maybe we try something else try something like can you factor it well if everything's in terms of sines and cosines and i have this all in one fraction and i don't see an identity you need some other algebra try to factor it i can't factor the denominator but the numerator that's a difference of squares that can be written if you had like x squared minus y squared you'd write x minus y x plus y well we have the same sort of situation let's write cosine theta minus sin theta cosine theta plus sine theta being a difference of squares it's nice that'll work for us we also might have noticed a little bit that that's what our denominator suggests so sometimes we can sort of cheat a little bit and look at what we're trying to get well we have currently and what would it take to simplify that so if i'm trying to get this and i have that thing and i have this i don't know what to do with try to factor it maybe it's going to cancel to give you exactly what you want and that's exactly what happens so when we factor this as a difference of squares we simplify the denominator that we have that's why we chose to factor that negative so that would be more apparent what happened so we're putting this in correct form so it's easier later so from the from the top use your even and odds make it simpler simplify as much as you can get down to something that's nice to work with negatives and denominators are not really good things moving structure this so that it's it's easier to look at positives first minus others and then try to evaluate everything signs and cosines one fraction but i'm looking at what i need what i have and letting that determine because there's no identities right out here for us then man i can factor that by any difference of squares simplify what i don't want and this gives me exactly what i did so this is cosine theta minus sine theta and we proved that the left side actually equals the right side that proves our identity let's go ahead and tackle another one so one minus cotangent squared theta over one plus cotangent squared theta plus two cosecant cosine squared theta equals one that's a lot that's obviously the harder side let's start with that now before we get going look for any identities that are apparent but don't get tripped up don't try to make them up on your own this is a great one so one plus or one sorry uh cotangent squared theta plus 1 or 1 plus cotangent squared theta that does equal cosecant squared theta but this is nowhere on our list in fact that's going to cause us a lot of problems on this particular problem because that's not an identity even though it really looks close it's not one it's not one of those things so what we're going to do is we're going to use the identities that are right there on the board for us right now we're going to change that into cosecant squared theta now we're working just on the left hand side so we're taking a look at it going now i don't see any other identities i don't see anything that's very nice to simplify nothing that's at least popping out to me so maybe now is the time where i make one fraction out of this that's one of the ideas here is to get everything on one fraction see what happens so let's do that because i'd have to multiply by cosecant squared theta we're going to get 2 cosine squared theta times cosecant squared theta all over cosecant squared theta let's put that on one fraction that's what we did that for is to get a common denominator so that we could combine this well that doesn't look very appealing at all in fact i don't even see an identity yet this is still isn't one this isn't one uh but what i do see is this this one's somewhat close you saw that from the beginning it's pretty close this is not in fact this has a cosine and something over sine so so this right here maybe work on this piece just this piece and try to get this written in terms of size and cosines if cosecant of theta is 1 over sine theta then cosecant squared theta is 1 over sine squared theta and we're going to make that little piece one fraction wait a minute cosine theta over sine theta is cotangent theta so that would be cotangent squared theta so this whole thing becomes two cotangent squared theta that's something we can simplify so don't change the signs and cosines now not when you have a combining like terms idea let's go ahead and do that so we saw this is an identity this is really close so we're going to use identity we saw two fractions making one fraction okay simplify whatever we can well you notice that this is pretty close to an identity i'm going to leave that one that looks really close over here this looks like garbage fix this one first so sines and cosines let us do that that's co cotangent squared so i did two cotangent squared theta now let's combine some like terms this is negative cotangent squared theta plus two cotangent squared that's plus one cotangent squared theta so this would be one combined like terms plus cotangent squared theta oh this is great news because now instead of making everything sines and cosines our first step before we do that is use identities that are already there so one plus cotangent squared theta that is exactly what we want to see that's cosecant squared theta and cosecant squared theta over cosecant squared theta is one so we worked on the left-hand side all the way down to here we got one that's exactly what we're trying to show one does equal one and so this satisfies and proves our identity i really hope this is making sense for you i hope that you've seen the the logic um the our ability to change uh with with these problems um that it's not just a hard and fast this is what you do every single time we really have to think about it they're multi-faceted there's a lot of things going on here and that's what makes them very challenging i hope i've given you a good outline that you're able to use for this we only have like two more examples that are in my opinion probably the most difficult glass or the most difficult one that we can go through it's going to be a lot to it but i hope you're seeing this structure i'm really trying to explain my thinking so that you can you can pattern yours on that all right let's get right to it so we've got a nasty problem it's an identity and it is going to be true so we're going to show that this equals 4 tangent theta secant theta keep that in mind we're trying to get tangents and secants out of this we are given everything in terms of sine we're also given things on two fractions so when we take a look at it i'm going to work on the harder side i'm going to look at this thinking i don't see any identities that are just popping right out of me but i do have two fractions let's start with that everything's already signs and cosigns let's make this into one fraction one fraction means you need a common denominator so i'm going to multiply this by one plus sine theta and this by one minus sine theta it's going to give us one plus sine theta quantity squared minus one minus sine theta quantity squared so let's do that 1 plus sine theta times one plus sine theta is one plus sine theta squared likewise over here but on the denominator on the denominator we get one plus sine theta times one minus sine theta and we're going to go ahead and distribute that so 1 minus sine theta plus sine theta that's cancelled and then minus sine squared theta so we're going to end up with 1 minus sine squared theta now that's a really good thing because this is an identity that says that we're going to have cosine squared theta on our denominator the problem is our numerator that looks really crazy man what to do well we can't just cancel these things out but maybe if we distribute this some of the things will actually simplify so let's go ahead and do it we have 1 minus 2 sine theta sorry 1 plus 2 sine theta and then plus sine squared theta over here we'll get one minus two sine theta plus sine squared theta so we're distributing this as one plus sine theta times one plus sine theta you do it off to the side if you want to but ultimately what we get is one plus 2 sine theta plus sine squared that is that's this so this came from our first first distribution minus oh my gosh it's really important to make sure that you have parentheses around what you're going to distribute here because you have that mind is going to change all of your signs so this would be 1 minus sine theta times another 1 minus on theta that's going to be 1 minus 2 sine theta and then plus sine squared theta you're going to see right now why it's so important to have this parenthesis hopefully you're with me hopefully you understand the distribution here distribution here i did see an identity we're going to use that right now that is going to be cosine squared theta but i didn't see an identity here here i had to distribute that there's nothing else we could do they're already signs and cosines now that we have distributed that our signs are all good we have parentheses here let's go ahead and run this through and change all of our signs i'm also going to make this cosine squared theta so i'm using identities that i know that are already popping up denominator looks really good it's as simple as we can make it it's the numerator that's sort of messing with this so let's go ahead and write this out none of the signs here are going to change all of the signs here yeah can we combine anything can we simplify we're always thinking that we're thinking do i have any identities that are right there can i simplify what's going to take to simplify for us what it took was we need a one fraction common denominator then we simplify what we get there okay then we have an identity that's known use it uh we can't simplify any of this stuff distribute that combine some like terms now simplify to to to make our numerator look a little bit better so we're going to say 1 minus 1 or gone we have a 2 sine theta and a 2 sine theta that's 4 sine theta my sine squared and my other sine squared once plus one's minus those are gone we're going to get 4 sine theta not sine squared we're not multiplying we're adding 4 sine theta over cosine squared theta this is as simple as you can make it so there's there's no other simplifying besides what we've done but it's not what we want this is why i said that you got to really focus on where you're trying to get to sometimes on this we're trying to get to a tangent and a secant now how the world's going to do that well if we have everything in terms of sines and cosines let's try to make this a tangent and a secant we have sine over cosine squared maybe if we split that cosine squared and think about it as sine over cosine times cosine or more specifically sine times one over cosine times cosine because this is tangent and this is secant the only reason i knew how why to do that was because of what we're trying to get so i knew we were trying to get a tangent let's make that at sine of cosine we also need to secant that's one over cosine and now that we can structure that this proves our identity and that's exactly what we wanted so hopefully hopefully that's making sense um sometimes we have to have an eye on what we're trying to get to in order to structure what we're going to do next a lot of this was make one fraction simplify use identities to show up simplify some more and then when you get stuck if you're already in terms of sines and cosines if you're not moving the signs moving to sines and cosines if you're already there look at what you need to get to and sometimes that'll help you so we have one more and then we're done all right this is going to take a lot of work and i'm going to go pretty quickly through it i'm going to show you a i hate using the word trick a manipulation uh to make this nicer and why i'm using it where in the world i would see it there's gonna be a lot of combined like terms a lot of little identities that we see in here um let's get right to it so let's start on the harder side i'm just going to model my thinking kind of show you it's kind of a fun problem and then it's very challenging like a puzzle but it can be extremely difficult if you don't see a couple things about this number one when you have stuff that looks really similar that's off by a sign like this one is try try this try factoring so that you make a couple pieces look the same why because what we're going to do here is multiply in such a way to create a difference of squares look on the denominator so that stuff cancels out so right now this looks very very close you go well what would i what i want i would want this idea of two terms why two terms so that we can do a difference of squares over multiplication so this three terms is nonsense i mean you can't do much with this but if i structure this as secant theta minus 1 and secant theta minus 1 and treat that like one term then i have stuff that's very similar in fact if i were to take one of these and multiply it by the other i would get this difference of squares look so what we're going to choose to do is take the numerator and multiply something over itself so that i get a difference of squares in the denominator the denominators are typically harder to work with so i'm going to multiply by that so we're going to take this thing and multiply here and here notice you can multiply whatever you want as long as you multiply it to the numerator and the denominator so we're going to do it just a little side note it doesn't have to be the numerator that you multiply now it can be don't do that it can be whatever you want so if even if the numerator wasn't there you could say i want to multiply by this thing except with that a plus it looks a lot like a conjugate do you remember that you could multiply by a conjugate of things that's practically what we're doing here so that we create a difference of squares idea now the numerator is just this quantity squared i'm going to choose to distribute right now but it's just factor it's just multiplying through what we really did was look at your denominator try to create this idea of a difference of squares multiplication that you have you can multiply whatever you want but it took the idea of having two terms to do that so we said three terms no no let's structure it so that we have two terms your denominator stinks let's multiply to get rid of rid of this idea of um something that you can't factor we want some squares in there that are factorable something nicer so we're going to do that numerator just sort of plays along here just so happens that it's going to be squared because it is that idea of a conjugate if you look at this in terms of two terms so let's go ahead and multiply through we're going to get tangent squared plus let's see tangent times secant theta minus one tangent times secant theta minus one so it's two and then plus secant theta minus 1 squared on the denominator we chose to do this idea of a conjugate one term two terms one term two terms with a different side of the middle is a conjugate idea so that we get our middle terms canceling that gives us tangent squared theta minus secant theta minus 1 squared we're gonna have a whole lot of distributing to do here so we've taken and just distributed this here and distributed this here but noticing that i'm subtracting that my signs are going to change i'm also taking a look at this looking for any identities anything i can combine i see tangent squared theta plus one tangent squared theta plus one is secant squared theta so i'm going to take this and that and i'm going to call it secant squared theta here i'm going to change signs so i've combined this is secant squared theta i've got it i have the same thing here same thing here same thing here i've gone ahead and changed my signs by subtracting term by term now i'm going to combine some like terms i see a secant squared and a secant squared that's two secant squared theta so i'm also noticing this is really really really close to this it's super close but it's backwards so if i thought about this tangent squared theta minus secant squared theta divided tangent squared theta minus secant squared theta i'd get negative one so we can use that combine like terms i get two secant theta minus 2 i'm going to restructure this so i can factor and so we're going to factor this we're going to factor a 2 here we're going to factor 2 secant theta from the numerator and we see that we could do one of two things we have one two huge terms both of which have secant theta minus one you could factor that out but this also has that so use some math here and simplify all of them so divide denominator and numerator all by secant theta minus one do the same thing again we had we can divide everything by two and that satisfies our identity and proves it i hope it makes sense we did a ton of factoring and a ton of simplification not a whole lot of identities i hope i've given you a set of steps that you can use to stretch your thinking for identities thanks for watching have a great day you 

Transcript for: Introduction to Sum and Difference Formulas in Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 25)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about sum and difference formulas and man they look crazy but they're really useful so a lot of times when we get angles that that we want to find an exact solution for and it's not our unit circle this can help us also it helps with some identities dealing some stuff in calculus where we might have a couple different angles that we want to put together or separate so we get some different expressions so we're going to take a look at what these formulas are most importantly how we use them so when we take a look at sum and difference formulas basically what that means is if you have a trig function with two angles that are added or subtracted we can typically break those up if they are sine cosine or tangent of whatever two angles we're adding or subtracting now where they come from where these come from is basically a distance formula on part of the unit circle and tangent comes from comparing these so tangent of alpha plus beta is how we call those two angles alpha and beta would say do you remember that tangent can be represented as sine over cosine so it really would take sine of alpha plus beta divided by cosine alpha plus beta and really just simplify that so where these come from our distance formula and comparing sine to cosine i'm not going to go through and prove where they're from what i am going to do is take some of the the ideas that we have for um phase shift of sine compared to cosine and prove it with some of the these identities mostly i'm going to show you how to deal with stuff like this so if we have like sine of 105 degrees and they want an exact solution how in the world do you do that because that's not on your unit circle you 105 degrees isn't there so here's something we can do if we look here if we can represent that angle as either a sum or a difference of two angles that are on your unit circle well then we can break it up instead of looking at the sum we can look at sine of the first part of the angle times cosine of the second part so alpha and beta is what we call those so this would be alpha that would be beta plus cosine of alpha times sine of beta and if we can do that then we can find an exact representation kind of as a work around instead of looking right at 105 degrees so let's think of 105 degrees can you think of two angles that add up or subtract to 105 degrees both of which are on your unit circle you might have a couple solutions but the easiest one in my mind is 60 degrees and 45 degrees that would add to 105 degrees but both 60 and 45 are on your unit circle why is it valuable as soon as we represent 105 degrees in terms of 60 degrees plus 45 we can now use this formula that's what the sum and difference formulas can be used for so sine of alpha plus beta now is sine of 60 degrees plus 45 degrees just take a look at how the formula works for just a second it says take a look at your first angle you're going to take sine of your first angle cosine of your second angle you're going to multiply those let's do that now that would be sine of 60 degrees times cosine of 45 degrees we're just using this is alpha and that is beta so first one second one sine of the first one cosine of the second one let's write that there's a little bit more to it isn't there it says if we have a sine of alpha plus beta we have sine alpha cosine beta plus cosine alpha sine beta so that would be cosine of 60 degrees or the first angle times sine of 45 degrees or the second angle now let's double check it but that's going to be really nice so we looked at this and said 105 degrees no it's not our unit circle if you want exact solution you have to break it up in some way well we notice that 60 degrees and 45 are both on our unit circle and they add to 105 so we can represent 105 as 60 plus 45. so when we do that then we take a look at what one of those sum or difference formulas works we have sine we're looking at sine we have alpha plus beta or 60 plus 45 degrees that's this one sine of the first cosine second plus cosine first sine second sine of the first cosine second plus cosine first sine second when you take a look at sine and cosine sine always has the same sign so plus plus minus minus cosine always has opposite plus minus minus plus cosines are this are both cosine in the first term both sine and the second sine has sines and cosines in the first and the second for both of those so it's a it's a little bit it's nice to memorize that a little bit that your signs are the same for sine opposite for cosine i always think about it sine sines are the same cosine oh that's doesn't have the word sine in it for my brain that makes sense you have different signs up there we'll get to tangent in just a minute now that all those are in a circle we can spend some time to just look that up so sine of 60 degrees if you remember sine of 60 degrees that's the same thing as pi over 3. we're going to get square root 3 over 2. really helps to have your unit circle handy in this it's a good thing i do cosine 45 degrees says here's 45 degrees same thing as pi over 4 cosine square root 2 over 2. cosine 60 degrees well that's pi over three so you're going to be looking at the same angles in a couple places aren't you so we have sine of 60 cosine 60 we have cosine of 45 we're going to have sine of 45. so you're just taking the y and x coordinates depending on whether you're talking about sine or cosine you're going to be using both of them so we've said sine of 60 pi over 3 that's root 3 over 2. cosine 45 we go okay that's square root 2 over 2 the x coordinate cosine 60 here's 60 pi over 3 again that's going to be one half and then sine of 45 is square root 2 over 2 again right there if we spend the time to simplify that that's going to be the square root of 6 over 4 that's the square root 2 over 4. so we get square root 6 plus square root 2 all over 4 because of that common denominator that's it that is the exact representation of what that is so the y-coordinate that's weird but the y-coordinate of the point where 105 degrees is on your unit circle would be square root 2 plus or square root of 6 plus square root 2 all over 4. that's what they're talking about when they're asking for an exact solution that's how to find it use some sum or difference to represent the angle that you cannot find our unit circle just make sure what you're using those two angles that are added or subtracted that those are both on your unit circle didn't really help if you go 105 degrees is 100 degrees plus 5 degrees what sine of 100 degrees i don't know that didn't really help a lot right because we want to be able to look those up to find an exact representation like we just did well with sine of pi over 12 pi over 12 is not on our unit circle we're going to have to come up with something either a sum that adds to pi over 12 or a difference that gives you pi over 12. now i'm not thinking of two angles that add up to pi over 12 really nicely under unit circle because well that that denominator is already pretty large and my numerator is pretty small and so i'm not thinking of two fractions that add up to that very nicely what i can think of is a couple fractions subtract to give us pi over 12 like 4 pi over 12 minus 3 pi over 12. why those ones well if we think about 4 pi over 12 minus 3 pi over 12 4 pi over 12 will simplify to pi over 3 and 3 pi over 12 is simplified to pi over 4. both of those are on our unit circle now that might take some thought you might be like i can't do that right away no maybe not but with some practice and with understanding that what we're looking for are angles on the unit circle that you you want to you want to represent this as it'll come if you if your angle is already fairly small you're probably looking for a difference if your angle is fairly large like 105 degrees you're probably looking for some that's that's always the case but that's a good place to start so i'm thinking hey that's pretty small pi over 12 is really a fairly small angle i'm probably looking for subtraction let's think i want to keep my denominator the same to make it easy 4 pi over 12 that would simplify 3 pi over 12 to simplify okay 4 pi over 12 minus 3 pi over 12 would give us pi over 12. we're going to do that so notice that is still 4 that is still pi over 12. 4 pi over 12 minus 3 by 2 so pi over 12 but when we simplify that that's going to give us pi over 3. that's going to give us pi over 4. occasionally i'll have students who ask why don't you just subtract those and get something simpler you could but it would be that and then you'd be stuck again so we're purposely unsimplifying so that we can find a couple angles that are on our unit circle now that we have look for the appropriate formula so we couldn't find that one we said let's think about separating this as a sum or a difference a difference works really nicely and still has some angles on our unit circle so we're looking at sine we're not a sum right now we're a difference so this is the difference of two angles alpha and beta first and second inside of the sine function so we're going to use that that says sine of the first minus the second well okay that's going to give us sine of the first times cosine of the second for sine of alpha cosine beta minus cosine of the first sine of the second i always think first and second that way it's a little bit easier for me to put this in perspective because that's not really an alpha it's pi over three that's not really a beta that's pi over four so just thinking that through helps me a little bit so i'm going to write that out so sine of the first angle pi over 3 all of our sum and difference formulas for sine have both sine and cosine in both terms cosine is cosines first sines second sine of our our sum and difference has sine cosine sine and cosine in both of them so i'm going to do sine of first cosine second sine also has the same signs so plus plus and we're going to have minus minus so sine of the first cosine second now we're going to do cosine of the first sine of the second we also really want to check our work we're going to double check this on the formula every single time so i want to make sure that i'm doing it right we'd have sine of the first angle i've got that cosine of the second angle i've got that minus i've got a minus sign it matches signs there cosine of the first angle i've got that pi over 3 sine of the second angle i've got that pi over 4. now i'm going to take my unit circle and find those so when we find sine of pi over 3 it's actually the same thing as 60 degrees so that's going to be square root 3 over 2. cosine pi over 4 is the same thing as 45 degrees that's square root 2 over 2 minus cosine of pi over three that's the same thing as 60 degrees so that's going to be one half and sine of pi over four is square root two over two we should be getting pretty good at either memorizing or having the unit circle really handy so we can find those on there most of them when we're using this are simple angles because that's how we're intending to be if you can't find that one make it easy so that you can this is going to give us square root 6 minus square root 2 over 4. and as much as we want to simplify that we can't we don't have like radicals you can't simplify the numerator or denominator you're done that's as as good as you can get on that so we're going to move on just a little bit and we're going to talk about cosine of 165 degrees 165 degrees that's a pretty big angle how in the world could we represent 165 degrees has two angles what we'll think about that that's that's a large angle can you think about some angles that are on the unit circle that add up to 165 degrees a lot of times we're looking for angles like 45 or 135 if we have numbers ending five so automatically i'm i'm thinking either 135 or i'm thinking 45 so 165 and 40 if i've taken away 45 that would give me like 120 120 is also when i get a circle so if i write this as 120 plus 45 that would be two angles on my unit circle that add up to that one that's going to be much better than trying to mess around 165 degrees i would write this as a sum of two angles oftentimes it will be asked it doesn't matter doesn't matter the order in which you have that could you do 45 plus 120. it really doesn't matter um because of the way the formulas work it doesn't doesn't really matter what order you have that in i like the bigger angle first i don't know why just how it works in my head what you don't want to do you don't want to say well 135 is on my unit circle 135 degrees on my inner circle so why can't i deal 135 degrees plus like 30 degrees you can you can do both of them it's just fine to do that if they're all on your unit circle so now that we have this represented as a sum we're going to take a look at the appropriate summer difference formula this is cosine we're looking at cosine we're saying hey i have a sum here 120 plus 45 is just like that alpha plus beta how cosines work cosine sum of difference formulas has all cosines in the first term all signs in the second basically cosine first cosine second switch your signs sine first sine second so that's what we're looking at cosine of the first cosine of the second cosines always pair your cosines and pair your signs sine and sum and difference formulas also have a different sign so if that's plus there's going to be minus there and then we pair our signs up so our s-i-n-e functions the sine functions 120 and 45. thankfully those are all on our unit circle so we're going to take a look and go okay cosine of 120 degrees well that is past 90 degrees that's that's in your that's your second quadrant so cosine's going to end up being negative and that's going to be negative one-half cosine 45 degrees is square root 2 over 2. minus if you take a look at sine of 120 remember you're going to be looking at the same angle twice you should be taking the x coordinate or the y coordinate so for sine of 120 we're going to take not negative one half but square root three over two times sine of 45 is square root 2 over 2. and yeah i'm kind of expecting that at this point we're pretty good at using our own unit circle i know i pulled mine up the first time just to make sure you understand where i'm looking especially for our degrees because we hadn't really done that very often but at this point i'm expecting you can look at this and go cosine 120 yeah i'm able to find negative one half and for sine of four cosine 45 degrees i'm able to find square root 2 over 2. for sine of 120 degrees i know it's positive square root of 3 over 2 and for sine of 45 i know it's positive square root 2 over 2. so when we simplify this we'll get negative square root 2 or 4 minus square root 6 over 4. i promise they're not all square roots 6's and square root 2's and 4's it just happens what i gave you here that's about as good as we can get that would be the exact representation of what that is this is weird but here's an angle cosine of that angle is an x coordinate on your unit circle for that angle this is the x-coordinate on the unit circle for that angle the exact x-coordinate not a representation of it not an approximation of it the exact x-coordinate for that and that's really what this stuff means so i hope i've made it made sense so far we're going to come back with a few more examples okay i just couldn't leave alone i wanted to show this to you so latin in this example just a minute ago we had 165 degrees and i said you know what pops in my head is 120 and 45. maybe you didn't think that maybe you thought 135 and 30 it's just fine it'll work out just fine there's not one particular way to do this as long as you're using two angles that are on your unit circle that add up or subtract two whatever that is it'll work out just fine take a look at it here's 135 plus 30. that is 165 using the same exact formula cosine first cosine second minus sine first sine second that's exactly what we're doing here cosine of 135 degrees that's in the second quadrant that right there is going to be negative square root 2 over 2. the x coordinate is negative in the second quadrant you're going to get square negative square root 2 over 2. cosine 30 degrees well that's square root 3 over 2 minus sine 135 degrees in quadrant 2 sine is positive still that's where 135 degrees is the y coordinate is positive that's square root 2 over 2 but positive times sine 30 degrees that is one half can you see that you're going to get exactly the same thing that's negative square root 6 over 4 that's minus square root 2 over 4. here's the minus here's a negative they're just switched around it's going to give you exactly the same solution so i hope that makes sense it doesn't really matter what you pick as long as it's on the unit circle and adds or subtracts to your value then use the appropriate formula and it'll work out just fine we're going to come back with a couple more examples let's take a look at tangent now so we have tangent of 19 pi over 12 has obviously not our unit circle uh 19 pi over 12 is pretty well it's it's larger than then we really are used to seeing right we we have at least more than more than pi radians there it's not not more than two pi radians but it's a fairly large angle most of the time not all the time most time that happens try to make this a sum of two angles so when we have 19 pi over 12 i'm thinking that's pretty big it's not less than or like our smallest exact angle like pi over six so i'm probably gonna be trying to add to that so i obviously want a denominator of 12 but i want two numbers that simplify that that's the key right because we want to get stuff that's on our unit circle if we have a denominator of 12 pick things like fours and nines and things like that so that you can actually simplify with that that 12. i'm thinking man let's see what would be a good one well or three so 12 is a lot of different different factors to it so maybe 3 and 16 sounds like it would work because that would give me something over over 12 that would simplify there could be several choices we saw in the last example so i'm thinking 16 pi over 12 plus 3 pi over 12. both of those will simplify to something on my unit circle you might have to play around with a couple of them so we have 16 pi over 12 plus 3 pi over 12 it's still 19 pi over 12 but it's written as a sum of two different angles let's simplify those angles i chose them in such a way that it would simplify so that would give us something on the unit circle so 4 goes into both 16 and 12 goes in four times over three times it's 4 pi over 3. and three pi over twelve simplifies to pi over four if you saw something different it's not a problem honestly it's not a problem you could have done let's see 10 pi over 12 and got 5 pi over 6 and 9 pi over 12 and got 3 pi over 4. that's perfectly acceptable you can totally do that this is just the first one that came in my head i don't know why that one it just did so 4 pi over 3 and pi over 4. now we're going to take a look at the appropriate sum or difference so tangent of two angles being added that's where we're at right now let's take a look at how it works it says we want to take tangent of the first plus tangent of the second over one minus tangent of both of them notice the signs here same sign on the top on the numerator different sign on the denominator same sign on the top of the numerator different sign on the denominator for tangents keep that in mind so we'll have tangent first plus tangent second over one minus tangent of both of them that's how i think about it tangent first plus tangent second over one minus tangent of them both all that's left to do now is take out the unit circle take out your table whatever you want to do and figure out the exact representations of those because those are all on our unit circle we haven't done tangent in a while so when we take a look at tangent of four pi over three four pi over three is right there tangent takes y over x negative divided by negative is going to give you a positive we know the tangent is positive in quadrant three square root three over two divided by one half negatives cancel there we end up getting square root of three that is square root of three tangent of pi over four that's quadrant one y over x is going to give us one 1 minus now we multiply both of them so we already have it though notice that we've already got it we know what that is that's the square root of 3 because we already looked it up so that's kind of nice about this that's the same and that's the same that's just the square root of three times one that's honestly as good as we can get we can write this as one plus square root of three over one minus square root of three if you want to do that it doesn't really super matter sometimes you'll see teachers or a few textbooks rationalize the denominator here that is appropriate you can do that how to do that if you don't remember it how to do that is to multiply by the conjugate of the denominator it takes a little bit of work here what the conjugate is is two terms with a different sign in the middle so one plus square root of three the conjugate is one minus square root of three and vice versa this is one of those times when you get that answer and you look in the back of your textbook and it's different and completely different you go got it wrong you might not have got it wrong it's just that they don't like to see square roots on the bottom of your fraction and how to get rid of that is rationalizing so multiply by the conjugate you have to distribute the numerator so what we would get is square root three square root of three times square root three is just three one times one is one plus square root 3. we just distribute the numerator square root of 3 square root of 3 times square root of 3 is 3. 1 times 1 is 1 1 times square root 3 is 1 square root of 3. the denominator is it works just like a difference of squares so the way that that is nice for us is when you distribute one times one is one sure but you're going to get square root three minus square root of three that always cancels with conjugates your middle terms will not annihilate one another so one minus just three square root three times square root of three is three negative square root of three times uh positive square root of three is negative three when we simplify all that we'll have four two square root of three over negative 2. lastly most of the time we don't like to see negatives on the denominator so we'll take the negative and distribute it through the numerator lastly lastly hopefully you see it you can actually simplify this you could do it here you could do it here you can factor out two or understand that you can divide every term in a fraction by the same number and end up getting negative two minus square root three now naturally that looks absolutely nothing like that does it's because we rationalized it but that would be a whole lot easier to work with so hopefully that makes sense to you we took a look at this and said that's a larger fraction let's make sure it's addition we use a sum formula for tangent and then simplify what we get out of that make sure you rationalize if you get a square root on the denominator we're going to get something very similar with tangent of 15 degrees but i really want you to think about this think about 15 degrees 15 degrees is smaller than the smallest angle that's on our unit circle that would be 30 degrees so we're probably not going to add a ticket to 15 degrees we're probably going to take two larger angles and subtract them to get to 15 degrees namely i'm thinking 60 and 45 because if i think 60 minus 45 it will give me 15 degrees so i'm going to write that out i'm going to think of tangent 15 degrees as 60 minus 45 to give us two angles on the unit circle that we already know and can work with and that match up with our formula of tangent of two angles being subtracted now let's see if we can do this by understanding the sine manipulations of tangent here's what tangent does tangent takes your two angles being subtracted takes both of them on the top being subtracted tangent of the first minus tangent second remember same sign for tangent on the numerator different sign on the denominator one plus both of them being multiplied that's precisely what this says right here so when we take a look at that we're going to get tangent first minus second so alpha minus beta tangent of the first minus tangent second one plus tangent of both of them notice the signs same side numerator different sign denominators same sign numerator different sign denominator both of them tangent first tangent second both of them tangent first tangent second we just subtract on the top we add on the bottom if we have two angles being subtracted or tangent so i'm going to take tangent of the first angle at 60 degrees i know that for tangent on the numerator my sign is the same and i need tangent of both of those angles on my denominator i have a different sign so plus on the bottom for this subtraction and then we just again we take tangent of both of those angles but now we're multiplying them so we take our unit circle back out and i suppose i should have enough because we don't really deal with degrees very often so tangent of 60 degrees that's gonna give us y over x or the square root of three square root three over two over one-half two's are going to cancel you're gonna get the square root of three tangent of forty-five degrees so that's pi over four that's one on our denominator we have one plus but then we're gonna have the same thing it's really nice the way this formula works because you already have those written down tangent of 60 degrees is square root of three over two tangent of 45 degrees is one sorry i meant just square root of three just love saying square root of three over two scrolls off the top so that's square root of three that's one we just end up multiplying so we're going to double check that's square root of 3 great minus that's 1. cool 1 plus we already have that that was the square root of 3 times we already have that that was 1. you'd also have to rationalize this notice something your conjugate is based on your denominator so over there the conjugate is 1 plus the square root of 3 because that's the opposite sign of your denominator pair of terms here you would use 1 minus square root 3. that's going to be the conjugate of your denominator and we do exactly the same thing you do need to multiply both the numerator and denominator by exactly the same thing to multiply by this fancy one so as to not change the value of that but when you distribute you get 1 minus 3 minus 1 plus square root 3. square root of three times one square root of three minus three minus one and then plus negative times negative positive plus square root three on our denominator we're going to get one minus square root of three plus square root of three that's zero and then minus three something really similar happens it's just that we have a negative four plus two square root of 3 over negative 2. you can simplify right now if you want to divide everything by negative 2 you totally can you can factor out 2 or negative 2 and simplify whatever you really want to do if i take both of these terms and divide by negative 2 we'll get positive 2 minus positive over negative is negative negative positive 2 minus square root 3. now think about what that means what that is is the ratio of the y-coordinate to the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle at that degree measurement so if you go to 15 degrees right there the y compared to the x will be exactly that value that's what this is doing it's just that you can't find it on a unit circle and get an exact value most calculators won't do it either so we need some sort of a workaround that's where those formulas come in really handy so what we're going to do now i'm going to give you one more example like this then we'll start working backwards i'll give you some stuff like that and say hey does that fit one of these 7 difference formulas that we can simplify kind of in reverse right last one before we go backwards and then make it a little bit more difficult do some some more challenging math so secant of negative pi over 12 a lot of students get stumped on this for two reasons number one well there's a negative angle and number two secant is not up there so there's two things that we need to to realize in order to get this right number one is that while you can figure out two angles that add or subtract to give you a negative often times if you have an even or odd function it might be easier to deal with that first so because secant is an even even function if i plug in opposite angles i get out equal results so that that exists that secant of negative pi over 12 and secant of positive pi over 12 give me the same thing because it's even i can just treat the inside of that that function that argument as positive pi over 12. even functions let you do that so because secant is even i can say just change the sign of your angle and you will not get a different result opposite inputs give you equal outputs for even functions and secant is an even function now i'm taking a look at that and going okay secant of pi over 12 pi over 12 we dealt with already pi over 12 is a fairly small angle it's smaller than our lowest thing which is pi over 6 on the unit circle that has an exact representation exact answer on it so if it's smaller than that i'm probably going to be subtracting angles to get it so i'm not looking at two angles that add to pi over 12 those would both be smaller than pi over 12 and also not on the unit circle pi over 12 is below pi over 6. that's smaller than the smallest angle there so if that's if it's true i'm thinking i'm going to subtract here what can i subtract 4 pi over 12 minus 3 pi over 12. that would give us at pi over 12 and we've seen that already so we've taken a look said uh negative angles use evenness or oddness for your trig function that's even you can change the sign you're just fine it even rhymes now that's a smaller angle that's less than pi over six the smallest angle that for which we have an exact representation i'm going to be subtracting so i represent that this is still pi over 12 but it's simplifiable this would give us pi over three that would give us pi over four now this is where some students get stuck they go great but that's not up there so what in the world do i do instead of inventing a whole new formula for a sum or a difference of secant realize that secant and cosine are strongly related in fact they're reciprocals so here's what we're going to do if we find cosine of pi over 3 minus pi over 4 we work it all the way down then secant of that will be the reciprocal so we're going to take a look at cosine instead yeah i know that's not the same but they're reciprocals of one another so i'm going to find this one work it all the way down reciprocate and it'll be the answer that why you need to remember that secant and cosine are reciprocals of one another secant is a reciprocal function for cosine so cosine of an angle gives you something secant of that same angle gives you the reciprocal of that something so if cosine of theta equal one-half secant of that angle gives you 2 and that's exactly how cosine's even related so when we find this we just reciprocate we get secant for free now let's take a look at what that does for us since we've already worked this down to two angles being subtracted inside a cosine that's going to be that function so cosine works this way it has cosines of both angles opposite of your sine and then sine of both angles that's how i remember it so i'm going to take cosine of both angles it does not matter the order because multiplication is commutative it does matter the order uh when you get to subtracting like you can't sometimes you can't reverse these and get the same thing so be careful with that um order of like this like you can't reverse the one and the tangent is being multiplied but these two angles you you can doesn't really matter so cosine i know cosines are paired up i'm going to have a different sign so minus yields a plus for my formula and then sines are together sine of both angles and we're going to double check always double check that so i've got cosine pi over 3 minus pi over 4 so cosine of first cosine second got that different side so for a minus i'm gonna get a plus in my formula got that then sine first sine second sine first sine second it looks really good now we take our unit circle out wherever you may have that and we figured this out so cosine of pi over three that's going to be one half times cosine pi over four is square root two over two plus sine of pi over 3 is square root 3 over 2 and sine of pi over 4 is square root 2 over 2. when we simplify all that we get the square root of two plus the square root of six all over four because we have square root two over four we can square six over four comma denominator let's just put that on one fraction now that is precisely what the x coordinate of this angle that pi over 12 would be on the unit circle so if you went to pi over 12 your x coordinate would be square root two plus square root of six all over four that's not what we're looking for we're looking for secant so here's what secant would do if cosine pi over 3 minus pi over 4 is this thing then secant of pi over 3 minus pi over 4 is the reciprocal of this don't reciprocate these reciprocate this cosine gives you one thing secant will be the reciprocal of that now it would be great if we were just done but do you see what has to happen you got four over since jungle square roots in it and they don't like jungle square roots in it so you're probably going to rationalize this is correct right this is numerically just fine but you're probably not going to see that and so rationalizing takes your denominator and multiplies by the conjugate of that which means that you're gonna multiply by two square root two minus square root of six and if we do that it's just a matter of distributing and simplifying so 4 square root 2 minus 4 square root 6. which you cannot combine by the way those do not have like radicals your denominator should remove all square roots completely that's going to be square root 2 times square root 2 is 2. square root of 6 times square root 6 is 6. the middle terms are going to cancel so we have 2 minus group 12 plus root 12 that's that's done and then minus 6 so 2 minus 6. we are almost done hopefully you see this as well you can factor out a 4 or a negative 4 or just divide every term by negative 4 which is what i'm going to do so 4 divided by negative 4 is negative 1 square root 2 negative 4 divided by 84 is positive 1 square root of six and of course you can make it a little bit nicer by putting square root six minus square root two it doesn't really matter what does matter is that you get down that far because that is actually a lot easier to work with than that with some square roots on the denominator i hope i've made it very clear on how you can take some angles that are not on unit circle and manipulate them to the point where you can use these formulas to figure out exact representations of those angles when you can't even look up the angles themselves so that's pretty nice that's one use of this we're going to do now is we're going to come back and we're going to take a look at what would happen going in reverse we're going to take a look at just a few more examples on how you can use these formulas directly so namely how to go backwards really because it gets you used to some identities how to use these things in reverse it's really important because they are identities that means they're not just one-way streets they go both ways here so we should be able to say hey if it fits this you can make it even simpler and that's what this does so here's the point if these fit this side perfectly you can go the other way so how we do this we really take a look at the structure of it if you have sine and cosine together minus another cosine sine together you're talking about either a sum or a difference for sine somewhere or difference for your sum of difference formulas for for your sign that's that's right here so when we take a look at that we go all right well which one does it fit does it fit any of them so i'm taking a look at the sine of 20 degrees cosine 80 degrees minus cosine 20 degrees sine of 80 degrees i'm noticing that the two different functions in both terms sine cosine cosine sine i'm noticing the minus that's pointing me right here so there's a minus there's sine cosine there's cosine sine what's that tell us if we have the same angle here and the same angle here sine and cosine cosine sine and we switch the angle between them and we have a subtraction here's what we can do we can take whatever this angle is and subtract it into sine we can go that way so this would be the same thing as sine of 20 degrees minus 80 degrees but it has to be in that order that's really important what i mean by that is you can't take this and do sine of 80 degrees minus 20 degrees the subtraction is not commutative so the order that this is where you have 20 80 20 80 that is your first angle and that is your second angle it has to start here that is your first angle that is your second angle it has to be subtracted in that order so 20 minus 80 not 80 minus 20. sine of negative 60 degrees you know you really could do that you could take out your unit circle go negative 60 degrees and find the y coordinate you'd be just fine but you know me i'm going to make you use identities so what about sine of negative 60 degrees if sine is an odd function that means that opposite inputs have opposite outputs that's what odd means for functions so sine of negative 60 is the same thing as negative sine of positive 60. remember with odds if we change the inside side we change the function's sign and sometimes that's very very valuable so negative sine of 60 degrees well let's see sine of 60 degrees that's like pi over 3. that's going to be a y coordinate in quadrant one of square root three over two we just have a negative out front giving us negative square root of three over two so the negative here is that negative this piece is square root of three over two and that's it that's exactly what this would be representing is that negative square root of three over two let's move on to tangent so tangent of forty degrees minus tangent to ten degrees all over one plus tangent forty tangent 10. that looks really like one of these two tangent formulas why because it has a whole bunch of tangents in it let's just figure out which one all we've got to do is look for the signs so our signs say we're dealing with a minus and a plus here's a minus and a plus we're going to be using the the difference formula for tangent so minus plus here's our first angle here's our second we have to subtract them in that order so tangent of your first angle tangent of 40 degrees 40 degrees has to be the first thing that you you do when you have tangent of that argument it's going to be 40 minus the second so 40 minus 10 not 10 minus 40. so tangent of first minus tangent of second that is the first minus the second so we know the signs are the same for tangent minus and minus minus and minus now tangent of 30 degrees that's not too bad you can use your table use your your unit circle memorize it however you can tangent of 30 degrees 30 degrees is pi over 6 so we would take the y coordinate one half divided by the x coordinate square root 3 over 2. the twos are going to cancel we get 1 over the square root of 3 or if you rationalize the square root 3 over 3. that's pretty much as good as we can do i hope to explain it well enough for you to be able to see that we can go both ways on these formulas it's really important and useful to be able to do that okay last one i'm hoping that you can look at this and look at this and figure out which one of these formulas is represented we've actually just used in that example but you should be pretty familiar with it at this point being a look at it and go well wait a minute all the cosine stuff all the cosine stuff has cosines and sines paired up all the sine stuff has sine and cosine mixed up all the tangent stuff only has tangents in it so when we take a look and see sines and cosines cosines and sines we're dealing with a sum or a difference for sine in this case we go well that's a minus signs have the same sign so minus says i'm going to be dealing with a difference of two angles this is the way that i organize in my head it works for me maybe it'll work for you is that i always categorize these as what what is what do they act like in general signs always have both sine and cosine and both terms and they have the same signs for the sum and for the difference so for us that's going to create a difference also we have the order it's really important that we have sine of the first cosine of the second that must be your first angle that must be your second angle what that means for us is that we would take these these things tell us we're dealing with sign this says it's a difference putting it all together says this can all be represented going backwards at sine of the first angle minus the second that's pi over 12 minus 7 pi over 12. that's negative pi over 6 pi over 12. now you can be thinking odd function right now that's great you could totally change your sign there we can also simplify so 6 pi over 12 is the same thing as pi over 2. so i'm going to do two things right now 6 pi over 12 is pi over 2 and then because sine is an odd function i can say opposite inputs are opposite outputs i can change my sign of my argument and get a sign change for my function itself so that's pi over 2 negative angle gives us negative function for odd functions there pi over two is pretty nice for sine so that's going to be one so this whole thing works down to just negative one that's really all there is to it i hope that this has made sense so far i hope that you really see in the utility and using this it's kind of nice it works really well to be able to deal with some very awkward things so that's really our introduction to how these sum and difference formulas work what's going to happen in the next videos i'm going to come back with some more advanced stuff we're going to talk about uh what would happen dealing with with sum and difference when we have to find our find some angles that aren't even representable on a unit circle and so we're going to do that we'll talk about some proofs some some kind of cool proofs about a um about phase shifting for sines and cosines and lastly we'll talk about inverses so inverses as it as it really works with some of these summon difference formulas that's about it so i hope you've enjoyed the video i hope you've learned something we're going to break this up and come back with some more advanced concepts in just a little while have a great day you 

Transcript for: Using Sum and Difference Formulas in Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 26)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk a bit more about how to use the sum and difference formulas for our common trig functions so i'm going to lead you through a few examples that are really common they get asked like all the time so i'm going to teach you how to go through those we'll talk about some much more difficult examples that involve some inverses and i'm going to prove something for you that now we can with these formulas that have been stating for a while that sine and cosine are phase shifts of one another we've seen it graphically we just haven't ever proved it so i'm going to go ahead and lead you through that so let's get started let's talk about a very common situation where you're given sine of some angle that you don't know and cosine of another angle that you don't know that equals something but then they ask you for a whole bunch of stuff like hey find sine of alpha plus beta when you have no idea what alpha and beta are or cosine alpha plus beta tangent of alpha minus beta or any kind of manipulation of that sine of alpha minus beta so i'm just going to lead you through three of them so here's how to get started on this problem if you don't know all of your trig functions for alpha or for beta the first thing that you have to do is find them you see when we're going through and asking for some of these things like sine of alpha plus beta well we're going to need to know sine of alpha and cosine of alpha sine of beta and cosine of theta tangent of alpha and tangent of beta and that's not given to you so the first thing we're going to do is take some time to actually solve for what cosine of alpha and tangent of alpha are given what we know about alpha itself also before we get going i want you to take a look at what i've done to the formulas i've condensed them this is fairly common but it leads to a lot of confusions because the students don't know and they shouldn't really be expected to what is going on with the signs so sometimes you'll see formulas condensed like this where this says sine of alpha plus and minus beta here's how to read this if you read the top sign sine of alpha plus beta then follow the top side here that would be sine alpha cosine beta plus cosine alpha sine beta follow the bottom signs to get the other formula so sine of alpha minus beta would be sine of alpha cosine beta minus cosine alpha sine beta same thing for like cosine alpha plus or minus beta cosine alpha plus beta you'd go cosine alpha cosine theta minus sine alpha sine beta so you can see that the sines are reversed because that's how the formulas actually work cosine alpha minus beta would be cosine alpha cosine beta but then plus so you're following the bottom sign and a bottom sign and that condenses your formula same thing for tangent plus would give you a plus and a minus minus would give you a minus and a plus so just watch out for that sometimes you see those and they're they're rarely explained very well what's actually going on so let's get back to our example the very first thing we want to do is find the other trig functions given what we know so sine alpha equals three-fifths and they're telling you something about alpha it's important to know this it's important to know the quadrant that your angle's in why well because we have a few situations that if we didn't know that we could get different trig functions we could get either a positive or a negative cosine a positive or negative tangent and we need to be able to figure that out so sine alpha is three-fifths and our alpha resides in zero to pi over two think about this part first so think about what quadrant that's in if alpha is from zero to pi over two we know that we're in quadrant number one we also know something about sine sine of alpha equals three fifths says that sine relates a y to an r this this idea of opposite over hypotenuse or a y-coordinate value to a radius well if we know that if we know that y is three and r is five and we're in quadrant number one then we can we can go ahead and draw something in fact we can draw the angle alpha so we know that our y value is three and our r value is 5 for this particular alpha that is in quadrant 1. so that's a really good representation of that angle we know yeah sine of alpha whatever that is in quadrant one because this will tell us gives us a height of three and r of five or y of three would be more specific and a radius of five there remember that three-fifths could be a y-coordinate on a unit circle itself but we can also think of this as y or we've talked about that pretty much at length now given that we've got to go ahead and find cosine of alpha and tangent of alpha to be able to find the rest of this stuff so how do we do that well the only thing that we really need is the x that's really convenient because by pythagorean theorem we know that x squared plus y squared equals r squared or leg squared plus like squared equals hypotenuse squared now i mentioned a little while ago like two minutes ago that it's really important to know the quadrant here's why when you work through the pythagorean theorem oftentimes you're taking a square root of the end so if we take a square root of both sides we're going to get x equals oh don't forget this plus or minus the square root of 16. you see that x coordinate if we hadn't have had quadrant number one you could have put a y value of three and an r of five in this quadrant as well but the x would have been negative here the reason why quadrant one's so important is so that you know which to pick that's why i'm always drawing pictures of these things so we know hey quadrant one means my y is positive my r is always going to be positive for us and my x is going to be positive here because i'm in quadrant one so look at the quadrant that it says your angle is in to determine whether to take the positive or the negative square root in our case because we know we're quadrant one x has to be positive there i'm going to use positive square root of 16 or just positive four now from there we can figure out the rest of the things that we need all the other trig functions we know what sine of alpha is already but now we could figure out cosine of alpha so cosine of alpha is x over r we know that from a long time ago but now we can really see it it's going to be four-fifths likewise tangent is y over x so we know that would be three over four now when we get down to working through sine of alpha plus beta when we use our formula which we can do when we get to sine of alpha we'll know it when we get to cosine alpha well no is four fifths so we get a tangent alpha we'll know it that's three-fourths without actually ever knowing what that angle is in fact which is kind of cool we're going to do the same exact thing for cosine beta so cosine beta says hey you've got 2 square root 5 over 5 but remember beta is between negative pi over 2 and 0. negative pi over two to zero remember this is negative pi over two same thing as three pi over two but going in an opposite uh orientation of your angle so negative or clockwise so negative pi over two to zero is quadrant number four we wanna look at that first so let's write down quadrant four we also need to understand what cosine tells us cosine tells us x over r on a unit circle it's the x coordinate itself why because it's a unit circle and the radius would be one it'd be x over one but in general it's the x distance along the x axis divided by the radius of of your angle not creating that triangle or a point on a circle with a radius of whatever that r is so for us we know that's x over r so if that's true if that's x over r then i know i could draw a picture of that but we're also in quadrant number four now what happens in quadrant four x's are positive and y's are negative well that's possible with that x that's two square root five and with that r we can get a a positive x with an r in quadrant four but think about what sine is going to be sine is going to have to be a negative value because our y values are all negative in quadrant four so we're going to draw this we're going to do it in the appropriate quadrant so x is 2 square root 5 and r is 5. so we've drawn the triangle that represents beta with an x of 2 square root 5 and a radius of 5. this would create some big circle with a radius of 5 and this would be a not a unit circle but a 5 circle or something and that is what cosine of beta represents for us now what do we have to do in order to find sine and tangent you got to know what the y is so we're going to use pythagorean theorem again just be very careful what you're actually solving for remember we're solving for y so that we can find sine of beta and tangent of beta but look at what y is going to be because y is in quadrant number well because the beta is in quadrant 4 our y has to be negative that's what all angles in quadrant 4 are going to do they're going to have negative y values we can see that right here y was important to know quadrant 4. well because if you didn't know that you could have written another angle beta with an x of 2 square root 5 and a radius of 5 and had quadrant 1. so we had to limit where we were so we have a definite sine and tangent of that particular angle so we didn't know the quadrant in order to even do that so let's go ahead and do pythagorean theorem we'll see what our y value is so we have x squared so we know our x we also drew a picture of it so i'm looking here thinking x squared plus y squared equals r squared and we're going to go ahead and solve for y remember that when you square a product you square both both factors in there so we want to make sure that we square the 2 and we square the square root of 5. 2 squared is 4 and the square root of 5 squared is just 5. so 2 squared 4 square root of 5 squared is just 5 that's going to be 20. so our y squared equals 5. now when we take a square root of that you have a choice to make but it's not a hard choice because you already know what it's told you you already know that beta is in quadrant four what are all the y values in quadrant four what is sine in quadrant four well that's negative so if i know that i'm in quadrant four my x is positive and my y's are negative so i'm gonna have to choose not the positive square root of five but the negative square root of five i hope you're seeing why it's really important to know what quadrant your angle resides in because it determines what your x values are positive or negative and what your y values are positive or negative that will dictate whether you're going to have a positive or a negative sign tangent and cosine so our y is going to be negative square root 5 because we are in quadrant 4. just like our our x's and y's were both positive here because we're in quadrant number one so what we're going to do now is we're going to take a take a look at what we need to find if we knew cosine of beta we'll know that already let's find sine of beta and tangent beta because we already gave our y value a sign it will it will determine the signs of sine and tangent as well so sine of beta says hey here's your beta we already have that we now know that y is negative square root 5. sine takes y over r so square root 5 over 5 but negative because we're in quadrant 4. tangent takes y over x well we know that we know that's negative square root five that's our y over two square root five it might be tempting to rationalize but please simplify before you rationalize every time square root of 5 is square root of 5 they cancel you're going to get negative one-half so now that we've done that now that we've found all of our appropriate trig functions sine cosine tangent of alpha sine cosine tangent of beta now we can find the things they're actually asking us for so find sine of alpha plus beta find cosine alpha spin and find tangent of alpha minus beta so here's what we're going to do we're going to write out the formula appropriately using the signs that we appropriate like we know and then we're going to plug in or evaluate for every trig function we have we'll have it somewhere up here which is really nice that means without actually knowing alpha or beta we can use the representation of our coordinates so that that ratio and just substitute that in so let's be really careful with the formulas and write that out right now so sine of alpha plus beta if i remember right i use this formula here it says plus plus i'm going to have sine alpha cosine beta plus cosine alpha sine beta so i want to make sure that i've got that right i'm following my signs plus gives us plus sine alpha cosine beta we got that plus cosine alpha sine beta i've got that too now because we've already done the work ahead of time all we have to do is find these things so sine alpha i know that that's three fifths cosine beta i know that one that's two square root five over five three fifths two square five over five plus i got my plus now cosine alpha and sine theta cosine alpha is four fifths and sine beta is negative square root five over five so i'm just substituting that in there if we do just a bit of simplification we notice that we have a common denominator of 25 so that's going to be 6 square root five minus four square root five all over twenty five and because we have that common radical we can just subtract them so 2 square root 5 over 25 that's about it that's exactly what sine of alpha plus beta will give for you so why why these examples are are fairly important is they really make you practice using formulas correctly but they also make sure you understand the interplay between taking a square root with a positive and negative like a plus and minus and knowing what quadrant you're in it's very important when we get to things like uh trigonometric substitution things like that to know where we are when we're drawing triangles and doing substitutions you'll get there in calculus 2. it's important to understand the trigonometry behind it so let's move on to cosine alpha plus beta we're still going to use the formula you should honestly try right now see if you can get the appropriate signs that come out of that formula see if you can make our substitutions and simplify all the way down of course i'm going to do that right now but cosine alpha plus beta says we're going to take cosine alpha cosine beta our sines are going to be reversed so so cosine alpha cosine beta a plus is going to yield a minus between these two products here so cosine alpha cosine beta minus sine alpha sine beta now we've just got to find those things so i'm double checking i've got my plus and my minus cosine alpha sine alpha sine theta that's fantastic cosine alpha is four-fifths cosine beta is two square root five over five make sure i put my minus there sine alpha well sine alpha is three fifths so notice even without knowing what alpha is we're just doing a substitution we already know what sine of alpha is well that's what that's asking for we know that's equal to three-fifths we can substitute that in that's exactly what we're doing here is just finding what our expression is equal to and substitute it for a formula so sine alpha is three-fifths and sine beta is negative square root five over five with a little bit of simplification hopefully we can see we get 8 square root 5 over 25 plus 3 square root 5 over 25 that common denominator let's make one fraction we end up getting 11 square root 5 over 25 let's do the last one so tangent of alpha minus beta of course i'm leaving out the sine alpha minus beta cosine alpha minus beta but i'm hoping that you can see it's the same idea i just wanted to give you all three trig functions common trig functions with at least one iteration of those these formulas so tangent of alpha minus beta again we're going to look at our formula usually i let students have that because it's difficult to memorize every formula you're going to get in trigonometry and it's kind of crazy so tangent of alpha minus beta we got to follow the sign down so tangent alpha minus beta says minus is on the bottom we're going to use the bottom signs here so tangent alpha minus tangent beta but one plus tangent alpha tangent beta in my opinion it's a lot easier to do all this work right up front so you're not really having to go back and backtrack and find them but that's just my opinion you can really do this any way that you want you can write these all out and find them individually if you'd like but it's just kind of nice to get this all figured out and just go on a roll and finish them all at once that's how i like to do it so let's take a look at these things all we need to know is what tangent of alpha is we've already found that that's three-fourths tangent beta we've already found that it's negative one-half so we're just going to write those down keep in mind it's super easy to make sign errors so like tangent alpha that is three-fourths but you're going to subtract a negative usually we show those things in parentheses because parentheses maintain operation and they maintain sign so we know we're subtracting a negative we're going to end up adding one-half over 1 plus these two fractions get repeated that's tangent alpha and tangent beta no don't cancel i know you want to sometimes you just want to cancel now but if we could do that we would made that formula a lot easier from the beginning we cannot cancel that out so three-fourths plus one-half over one plus three fourths times one half go slowly to not make some mistakes here so three-fourths plus one-half haven't done that yet and then one plus negative three-eighths because we multiply numerators and denominators means one minus three-eighths so let's see this is going to give us three-fourths plus two-fourths is five-fourths eight eighths or one minus three-eighths 5 8. and however you want to simplify that you can you can multiply it by an lcd if you'd like multiply by the reciprocal which is what i'm going to do we end up getting just two so i hope that makes sense i hope especially you're seeing the condensed version of our formulas and be able to understand the signs there also hopefully you get the most part of the most important things is figuring out where your angle is quadrant one two three or four because that determines what you can do with x and with y as far as your signs go your r is almost always positive there are some cases um like in polar coordinates where we have a negative r and we'll be reflecting that about the origin uh but i just want to point that out that most of the time our r is going to be positive so i'm going to do one more very similar to this because it has a very awkward quadrant then we're going to start exploring a couple different ideas let's get started on another one so we've got kind of the same idea but a very awkward quadrant so at least an awkward quadrant representation and a very awkward thing in an okay quadrant so number one we think we want to do if we're asked to find a variety of problems that involve different trig functions we don't know and we're not given an angle we're just given a a a ratio that that trig function of angle equals find the other trig functions first so you're going to be dealing with a lot of the stuff let's find cosine and tangent let's find sine and cosine of those given angles alpha and beta in the appropriate quadrant so first thing find the quadrant so let's take a look at what negative 3 pi over 2 to negative pi actually means negative angles sweep out clockwise so if this is if this quadrant is negative 3 pi over 2 that's negative pi over 2 negative pi negative 3 pi over 2 to negative pi so negative pi over 2 negative pi negative 3 pi over 2 negative 3 pi over two to negative pi is actually quadrant two so we're in quadrant two now think about what quadrant two does quadrant two has positive y values and negative x values so when we get to the pythagorean theorem we're going to be making sure that when we take a square root we're taking the negative for our x so we're going to sign this so we know that sine alpha is y over r and that means that we can find our x values so we're going to draw a picture of this if our y value is 5 positive 5 and our r is 13 remember we could do positive 5 and 13 this way or positive 5 and 13 this way but quadrant two makes us so we do this one and not that one so positive five and 13. let's go ahead and do pythagorean theorem let's figure out what that x is because that's going to yield cosine of alpha and tangent of alpha for us so x squared plus 5 squared equals 13 squared eventually we're going to get down to x equals plus or minus the square root of 144. this is why it was so important to understand the quadrant because in quadrant two our x's are negative yes we have two choices but only one was the right choice only one of them will satisfy being in quadrant two that and that's where our angle alpha resides so we know that we've got to take the negative square root of 144 or just negative 12. x's are negative in quadrant two that that one thought of like what your variable is doing what your x's and what your y's are doing in each quadrant really help you to decide which one is the appropriate choice so quadrant two x's have to be negative i'm going to take negative 12. now that we have that we can really easily find cosine of alpha and tangent of alpha so cosine alpha takes x over r which since we have our triangle drawn that's really nice so x over r we got that tangent of alpha takes y over x oftentimes you'll see people do this also if your x is negative uh 5 divided by negative 12 is the same thing as negative 5 over 12. i should use that right up there but we oftentimes don't like to see negatives on denominators so y over x if your x is negative you can easily move that negative to the front of your fraction or even the numerator so negative 5 12 is perfectly appropriate now we'd be able to fill out a lot of these things right here like for tangent and for cosine of alpha let's go ahead and find sine and cosine of beta so that quadrant's not that bad so that quadrant says that your beta is somewhere between pi over 2 and pi so where is pi over 2 pi pi over 2 is positive first off so counterclockwise pi over 2 to pi it's saying beta is somewhere between pi over 2 and pi well that's in quadrant number two some thoughts start floating through our mind what happens in quadrant two y's are positive x's are negative in quadrant two y is positive x is negative for this piece of the puzzle so when we do this we're going to keep that in mind when we start drawing this this picture of our angle so if tangent beta is negative square root of 3 remember what tangent does tangent takes y over x then wait a minute what's our x well right now if you wrote the fraction you're probably thinking one y would be negative square root of three and x would be 1. but wait this is really important i hope you catch it if you actually do that if you go to y is negative and x is positive you're in quadrant 4. this is the main deal with tangent tangent is negative in both quadrants two and quadrant four well if we're residing in quadrant two it's not okay to have a negative y because in quadrant two y is positive it's not okay to have a positive x because in quadrant two x is negative so when this happens with tangent assign the negative where it needs to go so what i mean by that is if you know you're in quadrant two your y is going to be positive and your x has to be negative fractions don't know the difference for a negative numerator or a negative denominator what that means is that we can think about this as negative square root of three over one or positive square root of three over negative one that's the one that fits quadrant two so you really might have to think about where this angle is and what manipulation of your sign makes it happen for us we know that negative y does not work for quadrant two so i'm going to think about this as positive square root of three over negative x does that still make the same ratio well yeah it's still negative square root of three but it fits our quadrant matter so y is square root of three and x is negative one that puts us squarely into quadrant number two now we can find r and that's going to allow us to find sine and cosine of beta so when we take negative 1 squared we're going to get 1 square root of 3 squared gives us 3 and when we take a square root we're going to get r equals plus or minus the square root of 4. which one do we take we want to keep r positive because it will keep us in the same quadrant so your x's and your y's really put you in the correct quadrant all right so that r we don't really ever take the negative because if we did take negative r what that would do is that would swing us all the way back into quadrant four which is what we're trying to get away from in the first place so in general you you really just keep the positive when you're dealing with with this type of trigonometry so rr is two and that really does bear out for sine and cosine when you look at what it should be for quadrant two in quadrant two sine should be positive and cosine should be negative tangent should also be negative we see that but if we had a different r we would be switching one of those or two of those so sine beta says take your y over your r that's square root 3 over 2. cosine beta says take your x over your r that's negative one half man this one actually from the beginning we probably could have figured out what the angle even is because tangent of tangent beta equals negative square root of three that's actually on our table sine beta equals square root of three over two notice how that's in quadrant two that's positive cosine beta equals negative one half that's in quadrant two that's negative that makes sense uh we could figure out that data maybe do that but for us we don't actually have to we have everything lined out to be able to fill these out really really nicely so if we were trying to find sine of alpha plus beta and we know that sine alpha cosine beta plus cosine alpha sine beta we know sine alpha we know cosine beta we know cosine alpha we know sine beta which can fill that out so sine alpha is 5 13 cosine beta is negative one half cosine alpha that's negative 12 13. sine beta is square root 3 over 2 we're going to simplify a little bit we're noticing that we get a common denominator this happens very frequently that's going to be well let's see 13 times 2 is 26 so negative 5 over 26 minus 12 square root 3 over 26 there's not much we can really do to simplify that it just stays as ugly as that is unless you can factor something and simplify it you're going to leave that let's do the same thing down here so cosine alpha plus beta we already have the formula lined out cosine alpha is negative 12 13. cosine beta is negative one-half minus we've got to get our sign right sine is alpha is 5 13 and sine beta is square root 3 over 2. so i'm getting a positive 12 over 26 minus 5 square root of 3 over 26 it might be tempting to simplify this but then we lose our common denominator and it's nice to see this as one fraction not super necessary but sometimes kind of nice all right tangent last one so we take we took care of tangent tangent alpha is negative 5 12 tangent beta is negative square root 3. alright so we have negative 5 12 plus square root of 3 once we simplify and we have 1 plus negative 5 12 times negative square root 3 that's positive 5 square root of 3 over 12. now what what to do here because it's pretty ugly this is one of those cases where it might be nice just to multiply everything by the lcd so let's multiply both the numerator and distribute and denominator and distribute by that 12. so let's go ahead and do that now so we have 12 hey that cancels that's negative 5. we have 12 that's 12 square root of 3. 12 times 1 is 12 12 cancels here and we get 5 square root of 3. as much as we want to simplify that you might be able to rationalize the denominator but that's about it nothing there actually cancels out so i'm going to leave it there if you want to rationalize you multiply by the conjugate of the denominator and distribute that all right so easier one involving inverses and then tougher one involving inverses so what to do and what not to do when you're dealing with sine of stuff that's added together with inverses firstly could you distribute sine into here no sine is an operator it's it's not a a value so you can't just distribute this and get sine of this plus sign of that it doesn't it doesn't work that way that's why these formulas exist because if you could do that you could do sine of alpha plus beta would be sine of alpha plus sine of beta well that's not true sine of alpha plus beta is all of this crap right here so it's it's not like we can just say i'm going to distribute it it's non-distributable that's why the formulas exist so we have to really work on this before we can even touch that now does it does it makes sense does this actually make sense what do inverses give you sine inverse of one half says sine of what angle gives you a relationship of one over two for y over r so this is talking about an angle so it's that one so inverses give you out angles remember that sine of angles give you out points or relationships of points and inverses sine inverse of points give you angles so sine of stuff that is angles actually does make sense so what do you do firstly if you can figure these out explicitly do it it'll save yourself a lot of time and we can do that here you see sine inverse of one-half must equal some sort of an angle and that only works if sine of that angle equals one half so sine inverse of one half is an angle inverses give you angles but this is true if and only if sine of alpha gives you one half so where does sine of alpha equal one-half what angle gives you at a y-coordinate on a unit circle of one-half remember we're back to a unit circle right now that's only time inverses work is on a unit circle and they only work on the restricted domain for sine inverse oh i hope you remember sine inverse works from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. so when we're asking this question sine inverse of one half equals alpha it's what angle gives you a y coordinate of one half because that's sine but only from negative pi over two to pi over two so sine alpha equals one half what angle gives you out a y coordinate one half but only from negative pi over two to pi over two well let's see got to be pi over 6. now remember what we did we just called sine inverse of one-half alpha we just found alpha alpha is pi over six so what that means is this piece is now alpha that's going to be pi over six let's find cosine inverse of zero remember these don't have to be the same angle so we're going to call it something different like theta conveniently cosine inverse of zero equals beta if and only if cosine of beta equals zero but remember remember about cosine cosine inverse only works on the unit circle and it only works from zero to pi so we're asking what angle gives you an x coordinate of zero on a unit circle but only between zero and pi well that's got to be pi over two pi over two has an x coordinate of zero that's not a tube so we asked hey sine inverse negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 what angle gives you a y coordinate of one half that's pi over six and we said cosine inverse that's zero to pi what angle gives you an x coordinate of zero uh that's going to be an angle of pi over 2. so we have this we already called cosine inverse of 0 beta beta we just found that so cosine inverse of 0 is pi over 2. so we can change your problem now instead of just having sine of something that we don't know we now know those angles now could you add those together you could and sometimes it's worth doing because if it's still on your unit circle that's absolutely just fine so pi over 6 plus pi over 2 let's see that's 3 pi over 6 that's going to be 4 pi over 6 or 2 pi over 3. so you could you can totally do that do you have to no you don't and sometimes it doesn't work very well that you have two different angles that add together and still need a circle sometimes that doesn't happen and so often times we'll just use the formula right from here i'm going to because i want you to practice but keep in mind you could add this and if it's still in the circle that's okay to do so we've got our formula all worked out we have sine of the first cosine of the second plus cosine first sine of second that's what our formula says to do we have the sines the same for sine now we're going to use our unit circle so sine of pi over six that's going to be one half cosine of pi over two we already know that that's going to be zero cosine of pi over six that's square root three over two sine of pi over two is one so one half times zero is zero plus square root of three over two times 1 is just square root 3 over 2. now what if we had added them this adds together as 4 pi over 6 or 2 pi over 3. and sure enough sine of 2 pi over 3 is exactly square root of 3 over 2. so it does work if you add them together provided that is still on the unit circle if it's not then this is the way to go so it's two options either one is really just fine that can save you some work sometimes though so i hope that makes sense what i'm going to do now is come back with another one where these things are not just easy to find where this is not on your unit circle i'll show you how to walk through that all right so last one before a couple proofs of what i said i'm going to do in and teach you that sine and cosine not just graphically but literally are phase shifts of one another so i'm going to show you that just a little bit some proofs and some interesting um kind of formulas identities that we can use from here on out so it looks really similar to the last type of example and at first glance we really want to do the same way we want to say hey that's an angle that's an angle that's great those add up cosine of that easy peasy but that's not a new circle and neither is that one so what we can't do man don't distribute that it's not going to help you anyway but we have to find some way to represent that and that as an angle so here's the thought process if i can represent this as an angle then tangent of that angle equals four thirds that's something i can draw that's something i can find sine and cosine for that particular angle same thing here i can write that as an angle cosine of that angle because i have an angle equals 5 13 that's something else i can draw that's something to find sine and cosine 4. well if i do that then i can take cosine of alpha plus beta whatever those angles are and use a formula and using my pictures i can plug in some fractions that represent the ratios given sine of alpha sine of beta cosine alpha cosine beta so let's set this up as an angle first so starting from the beginning hey those are inverses let's call them an angle if they're not on the unit circle we're gonna have to draw a picture of it so tangent inverse of four thirds equals alpha inverses give you out angles but this is only true if tangent alpha equals four thirds now we're about to draw a picture but remember this tangent inverse only works from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. why well because there's two places on a unit circle where tangent's positive and two places on the unit circle a tangent is negative but if i restrict it from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 there's only one quadrant where tangent's positive and one quadrant or tangent's negative so if tangent's positive from negative pi over two to pi over two it has to be quadrant one where that's happening not quadrant three that's off limits for tangent inverse so this angle must be in quadrant one i need to see that do you see that because we're tan inverse we're somewhere from here to here because tangent's positive that is in quadrant one that's a positive y and a positive x that's only quadrant one i can't assume it's a negative x and a negative y which would still give us positive four thirds because we can't be in quadrant three for tangent inverse so this is y over x saying we're going to have y of four x of three and we can certainly find our r for that we almost exclusively keep r positive so we're going to take positive 5 here and we're going to keep on going we're going to find cosine of alpha and sine of alpha why why in the world would you do that we'll get really get this we just call this equal to alpha so this whole thing right here is alpha that there is going to be beta in just a minute but we're going to have cosine alpha plus beta we've got a formula that shows us that so if we have cosine alpha plus beta we can write this as cosine alpha cosine beta minus sine alpha sine theta if we can just find sine and cosine of alpha we can fill out that formula when we get there so let's go ahead and find sine and cosine of alpha sine takes y over r so that's four fifths so sine alpha is four fifths cosine alpha takes x over r so three fifths and we're ready for that one so cosine inverse of 5 13. let's call that beta so inverses give you angles but that's only true of cosine beta equals 5 13. now we all know about cosine cosine beta cosine alpha equals 5 13 and that's x over r so x is 5 and r is 13 but think about where cosine inverse works cosine inverse only works from 0 to pi you see there there's two quadrants or cosines positive and two quadrants or cosines negative and so if we left this alone we would be able to draw two different pictures here we can't let that happen so cosine here is positive the only positive quadrants from zero to pi pi is quadrant one so this is in quadrant one that's a positive x and a positive r in quadrant one so let's draw that obviously not to scale all that really matters and i hope that you're seeing it that understanding the quadrant is very important for what we're doing here we have to have the right angle in the right quadrant so that we can find the right signs for the rest of our trig functions like positive or negative for the y positive or negative for the the x always positive really for the r so we said hey cosine inverse works from zero to pi because it's positive the only quadrant from zero to pi where cosine's positive is quadrant one we have to draw this in quadrant one and we have done that uh you can't make it quadrant four because cosine inverse doesn't work in quadrant 4. that would have a positive x and a positive 13 positive r but it wouldn't be appropriate because that cosine inverse system would work there so now we're going to go ahead and find y if we take plus or minus the square root of 144 we gotta understand that this is in quadrant one and the y is going to be positive in quadrant one so we can see it sine is also positive in quadrant one so we know that we need to take the positive there that's positive 12. now we already have cosine of beta but we certainly want to find sine of beta which in our case is 12 13. question why aren't we finding tangent of alpha and beta well we have tangent alpha already why don't we care about tangent beta look at your trig function our trig function is cosine cosine of alpha we have a picture for alpha and beta we have a picture for beta the formula for cosine of alpha plus beta has absolutely nothing to do with tangent so we don't need it it'll not come into play now if that had been tangent then yeah for sure we would have needed that but we don't hear so so all we've done really just a little recap is that was an angle that's called alpha find a picture and find sine and cosine because you're going to need it later call that an angle draw a picture and find sine and cosine because you're going to need it later for that formula now because this is alpha and that's beta let's use cosine of alpha plus beta to write our formula out so i have cosine alpha plus beta cosine alpha cosine beta minus sine alpha sine beta and we have all of this stuff right here so cosine alpha that's three fifths cosine beta that's 5 13 minus sine alpha that's four fifths sine beta that's 12 13. we can do a little bit of simplification but it might not be great to do that because if we simplify this we can't simplify that and we lose our common denominator so that looks like that is 65 as a common denominator so 15 minus 48 over 65. all in all that's negative 33 over 65 it's kind of ugly but you can't simplify that and that's really all there is to it kind of a weird little example that says hey cosine of this angle what what's that it mean the x-coordinate of something on a unit circle with this angle that we don't even know made up of two inverse functions added together would be an x coordinate of negative 33 60 fifths on a unit circle so hopefully you found it quite interesting at least it's really good practice so what we're going to do now is i'm going to show you those proofs of how sine and cosine are really actually fascists also these formulas are great for identities moving forward okay so last little bit these are some very standard identities that you get in any textbook those are not those ones i'm going to show you because this proves the phase shift idea but you're really going to want to make sure you understand these two they come up quite often they're a way that you can change from cosine to sine or sine cosine same same with those you can do it so i'm going to prove them i'm going to show exactly what this is it's really just using our sum and difference formulas for cosine and sine and then sine and cosine again so let's go through let's let's really see what's going on here so if i have cosine of pi over 2 minus theta you could really think about that as a difference of two angles inside cosine let's use the the difference formula for cosine so cosine pi over 2 cosine theta different sine so plus sine pi over 2 sine theta that's what our formula says now cosine of pi over 2 is 0. so this whole thing 0 cancels out cosine of pi over 2 is 0. what about sine of pi over 2 sine of pi over 2 is 1. so wait a minute if we use the difference formula for cosine then cosine of pi over 2 minus theta is actually equal to sine we just proved it and that's a very nice identity to use honestly we can prove this one directly from here if we took this and reversed our terms factored out a negative and used the fact that cosine is even to say opposite inputs give you equal outputs it doesn't matter whether that's a negative or not that's still going to give you outside now i'm going to prove it with the difference formula again maybe you can do it on your own but that's also going to equal sine theta this is going to equal well let's see let's figure out our formula sine of pi over 2 minus pi minus theta all right so sine of pi over 2 cosine theta so sine of the first cosine of the second keep the same sign for this difference formula for sine then cosine of the first side of the second we have that down sine of pi over 2 is 1. we know that cosine of pi over 2 is zero that takes care of that whole term there that means that we're going to get just cosine of theta so if we ever have pi over 2 minus an angle sine of pi over 2 minus that or if you can write it that way sine of pi over 2 minus that angle is going to equal cosine of whatever your theta is same thing here cosine of pi over 2 minus theta is going to equal sine of whatever that theta is every time now this is going to prove our phase shifts so sine of theta plus pi over 2 try it on your own all right i've gone ahead and written those out so sine of theta cosine pi over 2 plus cosine theta sine of pi over 2 cosine pi over 2 is zero this whole thing is gone sine of pi over two is one giving us cosine theta something very similar happens here cosine pi over two is zero this is gone plus sine of pi over two is one leaving a sine of theta now appreciate this appreciate the graph with what that says you just need to remember your transformations do you remember that whenever you add or subtract something inside the parentheses next your input inside input means you're moving left or right so you're affecting the input now how does it affect it if we add to that input it actually shifts our graph left if we subtract from the input it actually shifts our graph right so here's what this says cosine is actually just the sine function shifted to the left pi over 2. the cosine here is in verbal if you take sine and shift it left pi over two this whole thing goes boop you actually get cosine this is sine and that's cosine now take a look at this one it says cosine theta minus pi over two equals sine theta here's what this says sine theta is if you take cosine and shift it right pi over 2. if you take cosine shift it right pi over 2 you're going to get sine here's cosine it's purple if you shift it right pi over 2 you're going to get cosine this is like algebraic proof that cosine and sine are just phase shifts of one another they give you the same graph but they're off by pi over two so you need to take cosine and shift it right to get sine or likewise take sine and shift it left to get cosine that should make sense they're phase shifts of one another and now we've finally got to prove that because we have a couple formulas of lettuce so i hope this video has made sense um whoever really hammered down on what uh sine and sum and difference formulas for sine and cosine and tangent r i hope you've enjoyed it and i'll see you for another video 

Transcript for: Proving the Double and Half Angle Formulas for Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 27)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about how to prove the double and half angle formulas that you're going to use a lot of especially when you get to calculus 2. so some of these formulas they look kind of like whoa where are we going to do that and then you get to calc 2 and they'll come back and so i'm going to show you how to prove them we're going to walk through those proofs right now after that what we're going to do is on a different video just just use them figure out how they're how they're used some proofs get some more identities out of that and then deal with some equations involving some double angle and half angle formula so let's get right into it the first thing we're going to do is acknowledge that a lot of these formulas that we've already had can be used to make more formulas if you use an identity to make another identity you kind of get two for one and so what we're going to do is use like the the sum and difference formulas for sine and for cosine over tangent to develop these double angle formulas and here's the thought process if this is the sum formula for sine so sum of those two angles and we know what that equals what if we just called alpha and beta the same angle so instead of sine of alpha plus beta maybe it's sine of theta plus theta well what's theta plus theta theta plus theta would be two theta or double some angle and it'll give us a formula so we're going to do that right now so suppose for this sum formula for sine that we just do that we say instead of sine alpha plus beta we have sine theta plus theta what would that do instead of alpha and beta in the rest of this formula because alpha is replaced by theta and beta is replaced by theta both the first and the second angle are just theta so all of these would be theta now we know what sine of alpha or theta plus theta is that's sine of two theta but check this out we would have sine theta cosine theta plus cosine theta sine theta we know that when we have multiplication the two factors that we have are commutative so cosine theta sine theta is the same thing as sine theta cosine theta so what that means is that this and this are identical so we have 2 sine theta cosine theta so sine of two theta equals this is sine theta cosine theta this is sine theta cosine theta so add them up and basically combine like terms we get two sine theta cosine theta and that's it that's our very first double angle formula it's the only one that we have for sine we're actually going to get three of them for cosine but for sine of two theta this is it this is all we get for our double angle formula so that's if you have sine two theta this is the one that you're going to use and you are going to see this an awful lot in calculus two we often times go from here to here sometimes we go from here to here now let's give it a try with cosine alpha plus beta we're going to deal with the same thing we're going to think well if i want a double angle formula instead of alpha plus beta let's just consider them to be the same like theta and theta that would give us cosine of two theta and in the same fashion that we just did if alpha and beta are both the same angle let's call it theta then all of these angles will be replaced with theta as well this is the sum formula for cosine but now that we have the same angle we have cosine theta cosine theta sine theta sine theta so we're just replacing alpha and beta with the same angle so that we can get something like that cosine of 2 theta and all of these will be replaced so cosine alpha cosine beta says cosine of the first angle cosine of the second angle well both of our angles are theta now so cosine theta cosine theta same thing for here sine theta sine theta and really conveniently we see that cosine theta times cosine theta is cosine squared theta we know that when we multiply something times itself we get an exponent of two cosine theta cosine theta gives us cosine squared theta and remember when we write that we write the cosine with the power two and then the theta but it represents cosine theta in parenthesis the whole quantity squared so left-hand side we're going to have that cosine 2 theta on the right hand side we get cosine squared minus sine squared theta that right there is one of three double angle formulas for cosine so we're going to manipulate this a little bit but that's the very first one how in the world are we going to manipulate well we can do a few things knowing what cosine squared theta and sine squared theta are by the pythagorean identity so so we can change this around a little bit and get get kind of three for one so let's take a look at what sine squared theta is i hope you remember that i hope you remember that the pythagorean identity simply says sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta equals 1. if we solve for sine squared theta by subtracting cosine squared theta we get 1 minus cosine squared theta at the same time we could have subtracted sine squared they didn't got cosine squared theta is 1 minus sine squared theta we could have done that as well let's use this one right now what we're going to do is we're going to take this double angle formula that we've already made from our sum formula for cosine so then those are the same this has to be cosine squared minus sine squared but let's go ahead and substitute if sine squared theta is 1 minus cosine squared we know that by the pythagorean identity let's take this and replace it with that so instead of cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta we've replaced sine squared theta with one minus cosine squared theta because of the pythagorean identity it's really important to have those parentheses because our signs are going to change and if we combine some like terms man we got a cosine squared theta cosine squared theta that's 2 cosine squared theta minus 1. that's the second of the double angle formulas for cosine so cosine 2 theta you could use cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta that's the one i'm going to use most often but you could also use this cosine 2 theta is also equal to this identity that's another double angle formula for cosine now we can also do the same thing or something very similar by solving this for cosine squared theta and replacing this piece with whatever that equals so let's try that now so instead of solving for sine squared theta let's solve for cosine squared theta so this was option one but if we subtract sine squared theta from both sides from here we get cosine squared that equals 1 minus sine squared theta we've used that many times before but now let's use it to create another formula for this i've gone ahead and just written this again so this is the same exact formula but it's a little nicer to see here so we're going to replace this piece with 1 minus sine squared theta by the pythagorean identity so 1 minus sine squared theta that is cosine squared theta same thing minus sine squared theta you see something really similar happened to what we've just done we have some like terms again so we could also write cosine two theta or the double angle formula for cosine as one minus two sine squared theta those starred items that i've done here here and here those are the three double angle formulas for cosine so we use the sum formulas we said this is the only one for sine double angle formula for sine is that um but for cosine we've got a few of them because we have some some manipulations of the pythagorean identity we have one here cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta we actually saw that earlier we could have used identity this is an identity that formula counts as an identity we've changed it we said yeah we could write this as 2 cosine squared theta minus 1 or we can write this as 1 minus 2 sine squared theta so those are the three formulas double angle formulas for cosine we can also do a couple other things we can take and solve for sine squared and cosine squared and get something a little bit different some identities based on these double angle formulas so let's try that now let's take a look at this cosine 2 theta equals 2 cosine squared theta minus 1. if we solve for cosine squared theta we would add 1 and divide by 2. so cosine two theta plus one over two that would solve for cosine squared theta for us oftentimes you'll see this written as one plus cosine two theta instead of cosine two theta plus one nothing simplifies there not even the 2 and the 2 because 2 theta is the argument of cosine in order to change that you have to have some sort of identity that's what these double angle formulas actually do they allow you to change that angle into something perhaps more usable we're gonna do the same thing with with this guy so if we solve that for sine squared theta we would subtract 1 and divide by negative 2 or we could add sine squared theta subtract cosine 2 theta and then divide by 2 that's what i'm going to choose to do so i don't have to divide by a negative so i'm going to add 2 sine squared theta subtract cosine 2 theta if we do that we get 1 minus cosine 2 theta and because we added 2 sine squared theta we have that positive over here now we divide by 2 and we solve for sine squared theta and this and this are a couple of identities that we can now use so we have four new identities or formulas on the board we've got sine two theta equals two sine theta cosine theta the double angle formula for sine we've got cosine 2 theta equals one of three things cosine squared minus sine squared theta or 2 cosine squared theta minus 1 or 1 minus sine squared theta so those are the double angle formulas for cosine from there from those the last two formulas we get a couple of their identities that we use quite a bit so we're going to now get into tangent but there and i'm going to recap all this write it down for you but there's now five new formulas that we can use i guess i miscounted there are six new formulas that we can use and we're about to create two more let's look at tangent tangent of alpha plus beta is tangent alpha plus tangent beta over one minus tangent alpha tangent beta if we say yeah let's just suppose that those are the same angle then call them both theta then tangent of alpha plus beta would give you well if they're the same angle called theta tangent of theta plus theta that's two theta it'll create a double angle formula for tangent so let's go ahead and replace these two with theta giving us 2 theta and everything over there with theta saying we're still following the formula the sum formula for tangent but now if we have the same angle all those angles let us combine some like terms multiply and get a power 2 for tangent so tangent of theta plus theta equals everything would get replaced with theta tangent to the first plus tangent to the second both theta over one minus the same thing so tangent of two theta would be this is two tangent theta tangent theta plus tangent theta says yeah two of them you combine like terms two tangent theta over one minus tangent theta times tangent theta is tangent squared theta remember that when you multiply two things you to power two when you multiply trig functions that power two looks a little funny it's right above the actual function so you don't get it confused with a a squared angle it's a squared function that's why it's there so tangent squared theta means tangent theta quantity squared that's exactly we have that's the double angle formula for tangent there's only one of them but we can do something a little bit different combining some of these ideas remember that tangent equals sine over cosine so tangent squared theta would equal sine squared theta over cosine squared theta but check this out because we've already solved for something sine squared theta and cosine squared theta in an identity we can now use that these are identities they come from the formulas that we've just proved from other formulas that are proven already so we can now say yeah if you ever have sine squared theta you could certainly write it as this if you ever have cosine squared theta you could certainly write it as that no problem let's go ahead and replace that so tangent squared theta equals sine squared theta let's use this instead over cosine squared theta let's use that instead and it will create yet another identity for us now that looks kind of nasty because it's a complex fraction but if we multiply both the numerator and denominator by two two over two that's a fancy one but it's going to allow us to simplify our fraction then what we're gonna get is one minus cosine two theta over one plus cosine two theta and that gives us another formula or identity for tangent so or at least for tangent squared theta so we gain a couple other ones we have a double angle formula for tangent and we have another identity for tangent squared theta so what i'm going to do right now is talk about the half angle formulas we're going to prove those and i'm going to recap everything and show you all the formulas that you would want to have next to when you're working on some some of these next few problems okay i know i've done a lot of proofs so far and they've been pretty quick because they're they're really fairly straightforward uh from our formulas but now what we're going to do is something kind of fancy we are going to create half angle formulas from our identities that we got stemming from are double angle formulas now that sounds like a lot of words but remember we used our sum formulas to get our double angle formulas we manipulated our double angle formulas to get these three formulas for sine squared cosine squared and tangent squared theta now what we're going to do is kind of trick them a little bit we're going to let theta equal alpha over 2. now remember we've already proved these i want to prove them again we're getting something new from them so here's the idea i'm going to say let's imagine that theta is alpha over 2 half of some other angle well then if theta is alpha over 2 2 times alpha over 2 would give us just alpha the angle itself that we had a half angle of for our formula so we're going to get this formula for half an angle related to the whole thing which is much nicer to deal with that fraction then we're going to take a square root of it and have a plus and minus and the plus and minus will be determined by the quadrant of alpha over two so i'm talking about all the way through that but that's where we're heading you should know where we're going on this one because it's a it's a little bit weird so step number one we've already done it we have some formulas that we're going to manipulate and say let's let this guy be half of some other angle let's call it alpha over 2. so what would sine squared of instead of theta alpha over 2 b we'd replace theta everywhere with what we're calling theta equal to alpha over 2. that means we still have a 1 we still have this minus cosine but 2 theta is now 2 times alpha over 2. all over two well what what's that give us this gives us sine squared alpha over two but on this side we get one minus cosine your twos are going to cancel that's just cosine alpha all over two now we gotta think back if we really want to find a half angle formula for sine we got to get rid of that power 2 which means we're going to take a square root and you have to remember this that when you take a square root you've got to put a plus and minus in front of that square root that says that what you get is either positive or negative because power twos always maintain positivity means if you plug in a negative and square it you could also get a positive so we're going to do that just saying same thing with any other algebra that we do when you take a square root you've got to put the plus and minus there so power 2 square root we're gone we've got just sine of alpha over 2 equals plus or minus the square root of 1 minus cosine alpha over 2. that right there is the half angle formula for sine and you go yeah but that's really confusing because what about the plus and minus there's an important note that you really need to make the positive or negative is determined by the quadrant of alpha over two so what do i mean by that remember that sine is positive in quadrants 1 and 2 because y is positive there cosine's positive in quadrants 4 and 1 because x is positive there tangent is positive in quadrants one and three because positive over positive negative or negative give you both positive so sine is positive and quadrants one and two negative in quadrants three and four cosine is positive in quadrants 4 and 1 negative and 2 and 3. tangent's positive and quadrants 1 and 3 negative and 2 and 4. so we use that we find out where alpha over 2 is and i'll show you how to do that and wherever that angle is then you can determine sine of that angle would be positive or negative and so um we would use positive four angle over two in quadrants one or two but negative in three and four so we locate where that is to determine what sine to use for sine itself you're doing positive for one and two negative for three and four cosine we go through the same exact math we're going to take a square root after calling theta alpha over two so let's call it alpha over two so 1 plus cosine 2 theta now we're calling 2 alpha over 2. your twos are going to cancel we're going to end up getting cosine squared alpha over 2 is 1 plus cosine alpha all over 2. and the same way we did here we're going to take a square root to solve for cosine alpha over 2. we got our square root we got our plus and minus and we've just solved for the half angle formula for cosine so cosine of half of some angle equals plus or minus the square root of one plus cosine of the whole angle so twice this amount if this is half the angle this is the whole thing over two again you take the positive or the negative depending on the quadrant of alpha over two so cosine of alpha over two says cosine is going to be positive in quadrants 1 and 4 negative 2 and 3. so you locate this you determine cosine of that angle like whether it's positive or negative and then you go ahead and pick positive or negative for the square root after that so last one tangent squared theta equals one minus cosine two theta over one plus cosine two theta let's go ahead call this alpha over two then we're gonna get alpha and alpha right here we'll take a square root after that so we're just replacing theta with alpha over two that's half of some other angle because our twos cancel here which is the whole reason why we use these formulas because th that double angle cancels half an angle gives you just the angle which is nicer to work with in a lot of cases those are all gone we're going to get tangent squared alpha 2 equals 1 minus cosine alpha over 1 plus cosine alpha now we're free to go ahead and take a square root and we're going to get tangent of alpha over 2 equals plus and minus the square root of one minus cosine alpha over one plus cosine alpha and that's it that's the three half-angle formulas that we have one for sine one for cosine one for tangent in the next video i'll show you exactly how to use them right now i'm gonna come back and just have them written on the board explain which formulas are which and then we'll be done all right that's about it we've got a lot of new identities a lot of new formulas that we can use we started off by using our sum formulas for sine and cosine and tangent and we got these pretty easy we got sine cosine tangent of two theta these are the double angle formulas there's one for sine there's one for tangent there are three for cosine because we can manipulate this pythagorean identity a couple different ways that's the reason why that happens that's why we did the way we did it so this one's pretty common we use this one a lot these ones you use them not as much for sine you only have one so if you're going to use a double angle formula for sine it's got to be that for tangent it is this that's all you use for here you have options now you might be thinking well which one do i use if there's more than one it it depends on the context it really depends on what you're doing for some basic work you can use any of them any of them that you want they're going to come the same thing they are equivalent this equals this equals this how do you know that look this is manipulative pythagorean identity it's all it's doing they have to be the same so that's pretty cool from there we solved these two for cosine squared and sine squared and got two new identities so that comes from these two from tangent we just use the fact that tangent squared is sine squared over cosine squared put these in ratio we got that one and eliminated the twos from these three we took square roots and got half angle how do we get half angle we called these angles alpha over two so that smartly two times alpha over two would just give us alpha and let's deal with a usually easier angle than alpha over two so we got those half angle formulas a big note you gotta write down is the positive or negative the plus and minus is determined by the quadrant of alpha over two you look up where that is and it will determine whether sine cosine and tangent is positive or negative in that quadrant and then we pick the appropriate sign for our half-angle formulas so i hope that made sense i know it's a lot of proofs not a lot of examples i kind of like the proofs i think they're very interesting and it's it's valuable to know where this stuff comes from not just thrown at you so this is all stemming from really two ideas the sum formulas and the pythagorean identities and then just taking square roots so i hope it's made sense i hope you enjoyed it and next video we're going to talk about how you use this so we'll start with some very basic examples move on to some identities and then some equations at the end hope you're doing well 

Transcript for: How to Use the Double and Half Angle Formulas for Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 28)
hi there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to use the stuff that we just proved in last video we're going to use the double and half angle formulas for sine and cosine and tangent um are they hard no not really i mean they're just they're really just some formulas we're just practicing right now the two hardest things about this are figuring out sine and cosine of an angle that you don't know we've done that many times we've done that many times with with a lot of the things like drawing the triangles and figuring out the quadrant the other one is finding the quadrant for alpha over two or theta over two as the case may be that can be a little bit challenging but understand something about this when they ask you to find all of this stuff all of the double angle and half angle formulas for a trig function by giving you just one of them if you can find sine and tangent you can find the rest if you know the quadrant you can find the quadrant for alpha alpha or theta over two and you have to be given the quadrant in order to do any of this stuff so let's suppose that cosine theta equals three fifths that would be given to you let's also suppose that they tell you theta is somewhere between zero and pi over two so that would be quadrant one so they're they're telling you a few things here they're telling you what cosine theta is which allows you to understand the x and the r for the appropriate quadrant that you're in they're also telling you that theta is between zero and pi over two so theta is in quadrant one that says some important things that says that sine cosine and tangent are all positive why because if the angle is in quadrant one all of those trig functions are positive in quadrant one furthermore when we get here to theta over two if theta is between 0 and pi over 2 then theta over 2 is half of that between 0 and pi over 4. it's also in quadrant 1. so when we get there i'll show you that as well but number one thing is we know cosine we know it's in quadrant one let's find sine and tangent so that we can work through all this stuff fairly quickly so we're in quadrant one now being in quadrant one we can draw where that angle is and identify x and r from that we've done it many times we're just drawing a triangle but because we're in quadrant one we know that x here and r here x being positive would put you in quadrant one or four which is why cosine is positive in quadrants one and four but in our case v in quadrant one says you're going to have an x of three and an r of five in quadrant one in order to find sine and tangent you have to know what the y is because we're in quadrant one we know that y is positive so sine and tangent will also be positive we just have to use the pythagorean theorem to do that and doing just a little bit of work we get that y equals plus or minus the square root of 16. 25 minus 9 is 16. take a square root of both sides we've done it a few times here we'd get plus or minus 4. this is the same exact logic as the plus and minus that we're going to get for all of the half angle formulas that you see on the board we need to identify the quadrant to know what sign to pick so if we have quadrant one identified for angle then y is positive in quadrant 1. that's why sine is positive in quadrant 1. it's also why tangent is positive because both x and y are positive that is the same logic we're going to use we need to half-angle formulas so for us we said hey cosine theta is three over five that's x over r so x is three r is five we know it resides in quadrant one let's just draw a triangle in quadrant one that represents what cosine's telling us the x is 3 and the r is 5. not a problem the radius is 5. finding y becomes a matter for pythagorean theorem we know quadrant 1 says y is positive in this whole quadrant in fact in quadrants 1 and 2 y is positive so we're going to pick positive 4 and not negative that right there allows us to find both sine and tangent of theta without even knowing what the angle is so sine theta takes y over r tangent takes y over x so we get four fifths and we get four thirds respectively now we're ready just to find the formulas for our double angle and half angle illustrations here that i'm using so if we have sine of 2 theta really what we're going to do is find the formula write it down and evaluate with the triangle that we just made we already know cosine we know sine we know tangent we're just going to be substituting so sine of two theta there's only one formula for the double angle sine formula so sine of two theta is always equal to two sine theta cosine theta that's the only one we really use a lot for for sine for sine of two theta so sine of two theta equals this the things and things not to do it's really difficult to try to take whatever this angle is double it and try to figure out the trigonometry from that because that's what you'd have to do if you didn't have a formula you have to go over here and say hey this is my theta now let's double that i don't know what it is then let's figure out all the trigonometry from that i don't know what that is and then we can answer sine of two theta that's a really hard problem instead we say let's use the formula that we've we've produced that we've proven and now based on two theta being sort of simplified into 2 sine theta cosine theta this is that theta if we can just find sine of theta and cosine of theta we will now know sine of 2 theta based on the formula but we already know those things so we can just write down two times sine theta is four-fifths this is the same angle as that it's just we're multiplying by two and we have a formula that lets us do that what what you can't do the other thing is we can never pull out factors inside angles we can't ever do that we can't say oh this is just 2 sine theta it's not the way that works that's why we did the whole entire video last time on how this stuff actually does work so sine of 2 theta is not just 2 times 4 fifths in fact it's 2 times sine theta which is 4 5 times cosine theta which is three-fifths and that's really all we can do we can use a formula we've created based on some trig functions that we've found to find something that's that's unknown so sine of 2 theta in our case is well let's see 24 over 25 2 times 4 times 3 is 24 over 25. so we can find trig functions like sine of two theta by using formulas but it's really hard to do directly we almost always have to have some sort of an identity that lets us do it so this is the way we walk through that i suppose it's pretty cool not even knowing what the angle is we can find sine of 2 times that angle let's go ahead and do cosine 2 theta so cosine 2 theta does the same thing it says pick one of the double angle formulas for cosine which one it doesn't matter whichever one works easiest for you so let's suppose that you only had to find that well if you only had to find that maybe you would use one of the the functions for the or sorry one of the equations for the double angle formula for cosine that was based on what you already had for instance if this is not making sense to you for instance you know that you're given cosine right you have a few choices for cosine 2 theta you have cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta but that involves both cosine and sine you have 1 minus 2 sine squared theta and you have 2 cosine squared theta minus 1. so look at what you're given what you're given is cosine theta if you hadn't have had to found or find any of this other stuff which involves sine and cosine you could certainly take 2 cosine squared theta minus 1 that cosine theta is that cosine theta so this would simply work out to 2 times well if cosine theta is 3 5 cosine squared theta is 3 5 squared minus 1. just do that that is based on the cosine that you already knew you would not have had to find sine or tangent if you were only looking for that thing so what this means for us is hey 3 squared is 9 5 squared is 25 so 9 times 2 is 18 twenty-fifths minus one so let's see eighteen twenty-fifths minus twenty-five twenty-fifths that would be one that's negative seven twenty-fifths so cosine two theta is negative seven twenty-fifths now what if you wanted to do it differently would it give you the same answer yes of course having three options can't save some work like like i showed you you would not have had to do this if you were just finding cosine two theta but let's say you wanted to use one of the more common ones um not the super different but you could have said cosine 2 theta equals cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta notice something right off the bat that if you choose to use that formula for the double angle cosine that you're going to need no sign so that causes you a little bit extra work it causes you to have to find that now if you've already done it it's not really a big deal to use but if you hadn't that would have been easier so cosine squared theta says take your cosine that's three fifths square it minus take your sine that's four fifths square it and subtract it so nine twenty-fifths minus sixteen twenty-fifths wait a minute 9 minus 16 is negative 7 that's still negative 7 25 so anyway you go whether you want to use this one because you were given sine cosine or this one because you're more comfortable with it or if you want to use the other one the other one would be 1 minus 2 sine squared theta and if you had that you'd you might not want to use that because you were given cosine but if you were given sine instead you could certainly have used 1 minus 2 sine squared and got the same exact thing so no matter which way you go with the double angle formulas you're going to yield the same result just do whichever one looks easier to you if you already have all of them take your pick it doesn't really matter let's go ahead and do our half angle formula for sine and half angle formula for cosine this is where knowing the quadrant is very important so i'm going to show you with the plus and minus with our formula and then the very end will determine which one to take the positive or the negative so sine of theta over 2 well that's half of some other angle theta and so when we use our formula we're going to show this as plus or minus square root 1 minus cosine theta over 2. that's our formula hopefully you can look that up you have this next u or maybe you've memorized it sine theta over 2 is plus or minus square root of 1 minus cosine theta over 2. now do you know cosine theta yes yes it's right there it's talking about that angle this is why the half angle formulas are so nice i have no idea what that is i know where it is though we'll talk about that in a second but i don't know what it is but i do know what that is so it relates it to something that i know by a formula again what you can't do you can't just say let's pull out the one half it does not work that's why these identities exist is to be able to change arguments to be able to look at this under a different lens rather than theta over two because it's really difficult lets us do easier things with it so we're going to go ahead and say all right this is plus or minus square root of one minus because cosine theta is three fifths we can substitute that one minus three fifths is two-fifths two-fifths divided by two is one-fifth if we take that square root and apply to both the numerator and denominator we're going to get square root of 1 which is 1 and square root of 5 which is square root of 5. now we do oftentimes rationalize the denominator you can probably do in your head at this point but you multiply by the square root of five over the square root of five 1 times the square root of 5 is the square root of 5. square root of 5 times itself just gives you 5. so you have this choice to make right now the sine theta over 2 is either positive or negative square root 5 over 5. now which one this is why i've been training you this whole time to draw a picture of your triangle in the appropriate quadrant because take a look at this if this is theta theta is in quadrant one we all know that it even says that where's theta over two really look at this you could seriously do this cut this in half this would be theta over two in what quadrant does that lie well if i cut something in quadrant one in half this is still in quadrant one so i know for sure that theta over two is in quadrant one could you do it differently yes you can more algebraically you can do it right from here so i'm gonna erase a little bit of this but if you took this and divided everything by two why by two because theta divided by two is theta over two that's fantastic what do you do with inequalities when you divide your center piece that that middle inequality of the double inequality by two well you divide the the wings or the sides by two also zero divided by two is still zero we never change inequalities when you divide by positives theta over two is exactly what we want it to be theta over two and pi over two divided by two is pi over four here's what this means if your original angle is somewhere in quadrant one then half of that angle is somewhere in quadrant one between zero and pi over four it's like even more in quadrant one it's totally in there you can even see it if this is somewhere in quadrant one then half of it is somewhere in quadrant half of quadrant one uh zero to pi over four it's somewhere in there all that to say that sine cosine and tangent will still be positive if sine cosine and tangent are all positive in quadrant one this is still in quadrant one it's actually between zero and pi over four that's definitely within quadrant one so theta over two is in quadrant one if sine is positive in quadrant one it's positive in there as well so we would look at this and say this is still in quadrant one take the positive and now we would know for sure that sine of theta over 2 is positive square root of 5 over 5 and not negative you can't take both of them you got to choose one depending on the quadrant that's why it's in your note that way that with your half angle positive negative is determined by the quadrant of alpha over two or in this case theta over two let's go ahead and let's do cosine theta over 2. we're going to use a very similar formula so with cosine theta over 2 it looks really similar but that's a plus right there but by doing that because we can't just pull out a one-half or something we've allowed ourselves to look at an easier angle something that we already know so one plus cosine theta would be one plus three-fifths do some similar work uh we're not subtracting we're of course adding so let's see five fifths plus three this is eight fifths eight-fifths divided by two is four-fifths if we take an applied square root we're going to get 2 over square root 5. and if we rationalize the same exact way multiply by square root 5 over 5 the square root of 5 we're going to get 2 square root 5 over 5 because the square root times itself gives you that radicand now which one do we pick the positive or the negative from all of our discussion we know that our angle our theta over two here our angle is somewhere between zero and pi over four that's what we showed mathematically that's what we saw in our graph but in either case it's still in quadrant one this is still in quadrant one just half of that quadrant what that means is sine was positive but cosine and tangent are also positive so we're going to pick the positive one because this angle this angle here alpha theta over two in our case is still in quadrant one i really hope that's making sense that if theta's in quadrant one half of theta or theta two is still in quadrant one that's not always the case so if you have something in quadrant let's say three half of that angle is not necessarily in quadrant three anymore it's probably in in quadrant two but we'll take a look at that so we want to generally i do it this way with our original definition of where the angle is to find out where half of that is it's probably the easiest way instead of drawing pictures it's nice is to do the algebraically now let's go ahead let's move on to our tangent so we're going to do tangent of double angle and tangent of a half of an angle so with tangent of two theta we're really just looking at the formula and our formula tells us that we're going to take and do two tangent theta over one minus tangent square theta and thankfully we know those things we spent some time to figure out tangent so tangent theta is four thirds we're just going to substitute so two times four thirds gives us eight thirds over one minus sixteen ninths that's four thirds squared so one minus sixteen ninths my goodness that would be nine ninths minus sixteen ninths that looks like negative seven ninths if we multiply by a common denominator or the lcd that's going to give us let's see 9 simplifies to three giving us three nine simplifies here giving us negative seven so we get 24 over negative seven you'll also notice something about this that with your double angle formulas the signs of them not sign but signs like positive negative are taking care of themselves that's really interesting because half angle doesn't do that double angle does you see tangent is positive in quadrant one what's twice of something in quadrant one something in quadrant two well well from z from zero to pi over two so something generally in quadrant two so if we double that any any angle that relies where a double of it would be in quadrant two that negative sign will show up so double of this angle would be in quadrant two it says tangent is negative in quadrant two and that shows up cosine is negative in quadrant two that shows up sine is positive in quadrant 2. that shows up as well just be careful to not make some assumptions if you have a very small angle and you double it it's not necessarily in quadrant 2. so sometimes you you have positive sometimes you have negative for cosine and tangent what i'm telling you is that the signs will take care of themselves do not worry about the signs for double angle they will work themselves out it's the half angle ones and you see it in the formula those are the ones that you have to worry about so let's wrap this up with tangent of theta over two we have a formula for it we're going to use the formula we'll determine the sign in just a little bit so tangent of theta over two says we're going to take plus or minus the square root of one minus cosine theta over one plus cosine theta i suppose i've memorized it just by looking here and here i know that tangent is sine over cosine so i know that sine is going to be this minus and cosine is going to give us that plus so that's why i memorized the formulas the sine over the cosine now we just plug in what cosine theta is because we already know it's three-fifths we just substitute that so one minus three fifths is two fifths over one plus three this is eight fifths thankfully those denominators cancel we get one-fourth two over eight is one-fourth also thankfully that simplifies square root of one gives us one square root of four gives us two so we get plus or minus one-half now it's up to us to determine which one of those we take do we take the positive or the negative you look at your quadrant because theta over two is somewhere between zero and pi over four that's what that says it literally says that zero to pi over four is still in quadrant one tangent is positive in quadrant one if you want to take the positive version so tangent of theta over two is one half these can take a lot of time obviously i'm walking you through these verbally so it's taking us a little bit longer but in general this is the way you go through it you figure out your trig functions first if you're required to find all of these pieces if not maybe just find the ones that you actually need so like if we were working on a long problem they wanted to know what uh what cosine theta over two is cosine theta over two has nothing to do with sine or tangent you would not find it we just need to know what quadrant we lie in what half of the quadrant is then you just have one formula used that's pretty nice i'm going to come back with one more example of an angle that's not in quadrant one then we'll go through some identities and and do some equations let's keep on going so we have another one which at first glance is kind of awkward because you have cosecant cosecant this side has to do with cosecant what the world do we do and then you have cosine theta is negative or less than zero this is what they're trying to tell you with this they're trying to give you sine and tell you a quadrant so in order to find a quadrant you need to know the value or sign of two different trig functions so you need to know whether two different trig functions are both positive both negative or once positive one's negative that will determine the quadrant for you so that's what they're really trying to show you here um but it's kind of wrapped up in some stuff so if you're given a cosecant but everything you have to deal with is in sines and cosines change it if cosecant theta equals negative square root 5 then sine theta is the reciprocal sine theta has to be negative 1 over square root 5. if we rationalize that's going to be negative square root 5 over 5. so what have they just told you here they've told you that sine is negative furthermore sine of theta is negative square root of five over five they've also told you that cosine is negative cosine's less than zero so where is both sine and cosine negative well in quadrant one sine is positive so that's on the table in quadrant two sine is positive that's off the table in quadrant four cosine is positive sine is negative but in quadrant three both sine and cosine are negative so what they're telling you all hidden in this is that cosine's negative sine's negative the only place that happens is quadrant three so what they're telling you is that your angle theta is somewhere in quadrant three however don't just write quadrant three while that's important in order to deal with some of this the half angle it's very very useful to say hey if we're in quadrant three then our angle is somewhere between pi and three pi over 2. specifically it's not actually equal to there it's somewhere between there that is what quadrant 3 is from pi to 3 pi over 2. so we know we're somewhere in that quadrant because sine and cosine are both negative now because we know that we can write this or draw this picture of this angle really clearly so with our sine theta being negative square root 5 over 5 you could have done it here might have been a little bit easier even to consider this to be y and this to be r remember that we want our x's and y's to be negative but we do want our r's to be positive so wherever you go from here whether this is y and this is r or this is y and this is r you'll get it you'll get the same proportion for x so what we want to do is write this as negative 1 for y but square root 5 for r now what if you had chosen negative square root 5 for y and positive 5 for r while your x would be different the proportions u of cosine and tangent they would not be different so it doesn't really matter i'm using this because i like the one so either one of these it doesn't matter your cosine and tangent will come out the same either way you go so not to worry about that so i'm picking negative 1 for y and square root 5 for r again you want your y to be negative that it is your r to be positive it is giving us the sine of theta being a negative negative 1 over square root 5 or negative square root 5 over 5. from there we've got to find the x so we're going to do that we'll use pythagorean theorem and find the x so we'd have x squared plus negative 1 squared equals square root 5 squared if we do just a little bit of simplification here square root of five squared is five if we subtract the one x squared is four let's take a square root now which one do you pick that's where your quadrant comes in so if we're in quadrant two that's we've drawn this picture we can see it we can literally see that x has to be negative there you have to pick negative 2 and not positive 2. now that we've done that we can find our cosine and we can find our tangent it had told us cosine's negative oh we're seeing that now negative 2 would give us a negative cosine here because r is r is positive so that we know if i write the negative that cosine is negative tangent is also tangents positive so let's go ahead and find cosine and tangent of theta cosine says take your x over your r so we have negative 2 over square root 5. tangent says take your x o take your y over x so that's negative 1 over negative 2. and we can simplify that a little bit yeah we really should rationalize that so we should get negative 2 square root 5 over 5 and we should get positive 1 one-half now that we've done that we're ready to go and find all of our double angles because we have sine we've got cosine we've got tangent and our half angles because we have sine cosine tangent of whatever that angle is and we know that angle is in quadrant three which will allow us to figure out what half of the angle is and then the sine of that that angle so we'll come back and we'll do that all right so let's get to it now that we've found sine cosine and tangent for whatever angle we've been given let's find the rest of our double angle and half angle formulas so let's take a look at sine of two theta since there's only one double angle formula for sine we really have to use 2 sine theta cosine theta again you can't just pull the 2 out the only way to change arguments of a trig function is really to use an identity like the formulas you've been given so i always write out the formulas instead of just doing them in my head or writing down what the the fractions are for sine theta and cosine theta just so i can memorize them i'm used to them and i can i can follow what's what's really happening so sine of 2 theta equals 2 sine theta cosine theta i've written it out now it's really easy for me to look at what sine theta is as negative square root 5 over 5 and cosine theta as negative 2 square root 5 over 5. so i'm going to write that down so we have let's see 2 times negative square root 5 times negative 2 square root of 5 over 5 times 5. so it looks like we've got positive 4 times 5 over 25 and multiply everything together this times this gives us five that gives us four so we're going to have 20 over 25. so if we simplify that sine of two theta equals four fifths now what do you do with cosine two theta you have three options so if we want to use a double angle formula cosine squared minus sine squared theta is pretty common to use none of them are super difficult but it does depend on what you've been given as to maybe make it easier so if you were just given sine theta and you wanted to find cosine two theta you wouldn't have to do any work if you use the one identity that's one minus two sine squared theta you just plug that right in there square it take one minus two times that and you'd be done whatever way you want to go about it sometimes these different formulas are more appropriate depending on what you've been given so i'm going to do both i'm going to do the cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta now it's not all that hard but keep in mind that we had to actually find cosine theta in order to make that work so this will be negative 2 square root 5 over 5 squared minus negative square root 5 over 5 squared what that's going to give us is positive 4 times 5 so that's 20 over 25 minus this will give us positive 5 over 25 and what that means that cosine 2 theta is positive 15 over 25 or just three-fifths now i said sometimes it's easier depending on what you've been given so if we didn't want to have to spend the time to find cosine theta and all we were looking for was cosine 2 theta we might have used a different identity we might have used 1 minus 2 sine squared theta now does it still give us the same answer well let's find out if we did that notice we've been given sine theta it wouldn't have been all that hard to find so that's 1 minus 2 times negative square root 5 over 5 that's sine theta it's quantity squared well that's going to give us positive 5 over 25 times 2 that would be positive 10 over 25 so 25 over 25 minus 10 over 25 gives us 15 over 25. that's exactly what we get there it doesn't matter which formula you use but sometimes one of the formulas is a little bit more nicely suited to what you've been given so in this case you could have just used this formula and not had to find the cosine for that so either way you go you're going to do the same thing though so it's not a huge deal let's move on and go ahead and do our half angle formulas maybe before you start your half angle formulas it might be a good idea to figure out where this this angle actually is so the best way that i found to do this is draw your picture determine your your your quadrant but then take a look at the inequality version of that if you divide everything by two it will show you where theta over two your your half angle is so we're gonna do that so we know if we're in quadrant three we're between pi and three pi over two if we divide that by two you can see quadrant two word quadrant three so if we divide that by two this says that if your original angle is in quadrant three from pi to three pi over two and you cut that angle in half where are you going to be well pi divided by 2 is pi over 2 3 pi over 2 divided by 2 is 3 pi over 4. you're going to be somewhere between pi over 2 and 3 pi over 4. that's what that says so by writing your quadrant in inequality form finding half an angle is not all that bad just divide everything by two it says you are now between pi over two and three pi over four you are in quadrant two now so this angle half of an angle changes from quadrant 3 to quadrant 2. now that's really important because we know a few things about quadrant 2. we know that sine is positive we know cosine's negative we know that tangent is negative so when we get to our formulas right now we'll know the appropriate sign to take so let's take a look at sine of theta over two we know the sine of theta over two says you're going to take plus or minus one minus cosine theta all over 2. we know what cosine theta is we worked hard to find that that's negative 2 square root 5 over 5. it's pretty important to get the signs right so we know we have one minus but you do have that as a negative so cosine theta is negative be careful that's a really common mistake to make and now we're just going to simplify this so 1 minus negative 2 square root 5 over 5 is positive so 1 plus 2 square root 5 over 5. all over two if we find a common denominator that would be five over five so five plus two square root five all over five and then over 2. i'm going to write that out for you when you have this and you have a fraction divided by a number take and multiply these denominators so you have 5 plus 2 square root 5 over 5 over 2 if you reciprocate and multiply the 5 and the 2 end up getting multiplied together so you're going to have 5 plus 2 square root 5 over 10. now that's really nasty so what do you do you leave it there's nothing you can do to actually simplify that and get away from the exactness of the answer we don't really want to approximate this is def with decimals we want to leave that as exact the only thing we have to really determine is what to do to take the positive or the negative so we go back and we look at where our angle theta over two actually lies the original theta was in quadrant three we cut that angle in half we're now in quadrant two so in quadrant two sine is positive sine is positive in one and two so quadrant two says hey this angle is positive take the positive version of this we're just going to erase that we know that sine of theta over 2 is positive square root 5 plus 2 squared 5 over 10. it's ugly you could approximate it but leave it as an exact let's go ahead and move on and do cosine of theta over two so cosine of theta two is very very similar except you add instead of subtract so 1 plus cosine theta 2 you're seeing i'm still writing out the original formula before i start to substitute in some of these values that we know we know that cosine theta is negative two square root five so of one minus two square root five over five all over 2. so we find a common denominator again 1 over 1 or 1 minus 2 square root 5 over 5 i should say you can write this as 5 over 5. so 5 minus 2 square root 5 over 5. all over two we're gonna do the same thing that whole multiplied by the reciprocal or multiply your denominators we're going to get plus or minus square root 5 minus 2 square root 5 over 10. all that's left to do now is determine whether that's positive or negative so we take a look back at our quadrant we say that theta over two is in quadrant two we've already determined that by cutting this in half so theta became theta over two pi became pi over two three pi over two became three pi over four we're in quadrant 2. let's see sine is positive in quadrants 1 and 2 cosine is negative in quadrant 2. positive and 1 negative and 2. so if cosine is negative in quadrant 2 where that angle is then we're going to take the negative version of that square root so cosine theta over 2 equals negative square root 5 minus 2 square root 5 over 10. it's a lot of work to do as far as the simplification goes some of the times but honestly we're just following the formulas the biggest thing that i said at the beginning is the quadrant determine your your trig functions uh in in the appropriate quadrant and then determine the quadrant of theta over two all right let's go ahead and do tangent of two theta the double angle formula for tangent we've got a couple ways to do this so i didn't show this on the last last example but i really want you to see it now the first way we do this is with our our original formula so tangent of two theta gives us two tangent theta over one minus tangent squared theta now because we spend some time to find tangent theta this is not a big deal tangent theta is just one half so we're going to plug in one half here of course we'll square that on the denominator two times one half that is tangent theta for the appropriate angle in the correct quadrant two times tangent theta is two times one half over one minus tangent squared theta which is one half squared two times one half is just one over one minus one fourth so one minus one fourth is three-fourths or this whole thing one divided by three-fourths is four-thirds and so it tells us tangent of two theta is just four thirds now could you have done that differently yeah you could if you remember that tangent equals sine over cosine well what that means is that tangent of two theta should equal sine of two theta over cosine of two theta tangent always equals sine over cosine for whatever the angle is so this would equal sine of 2 theta over cosine of 2 theta but wait a minute sine of 2 theta is there cosine of 2 theta is there so if you want to do this a different way if you've already found sine of 2 theta you've already found cosine 2 theta just take sine divided by cosine simplified we get four fifths over three fifths 20 over 25 simplifies to four-fifths so four-fifths over three-fifths if you multiply by the reciprocal there so four-fifths times five-thirds the fives are going to cancel you are going to get exactly four-thirds and that would just be taking sine over cosine do it a number of ways any way is right as long as you're using an appropriate identity that gives you what you're looking for there's often times many ways to do it okay so let's take a look at tangent of theta over two the half-angle formula for tangent what we're going to do is basically take a look at this formula and this formula and the twos cancel so tangent is always a sine over cosine idea that's that's where it comes from and so we're going to take square root plus or minus square root of 1 minus cosine theta over one plus cosine theta cosine theta is negative 2 square root 5 over 5. so we're going to put that in both places so 1 minus a negative it's going to give us 1 plus 2 square root 5 over 5 divided by 1 minus 2 square root 5 over 5. with our common denominator of five there you can do a couple things you could find a common denominator here and here or you could multiply both the numerator and denominator by five but if you do that do not forget that you have to distribute to that one i'm going to show you that right now but either way you go you can put this as one fraction over one fraction or you can multiply by the lcd as long as you distribute here and here so 5 plus 2 square root 5 over 5 minus 2 square root 5. the 5's cancel on the second fraction now as far as simplifying there is technically one more thing you do you could multiply by the conjugate of the denominator and make this a little bit uh nicer so we could take some time to do that depending on on who your teacher is or what you're working on they might they might or might not do that so i'm actually not going to you could rationalize and make it a little bit simpler but in our case right now we just have to determine whether we take the positive or negative so we look back at our theta over 2. theta 2 is in quadrant 2. well what's tangent in quadrant two tangent is negative so we're going to take the negative square root of that that about does it for our double and half angle formulas just working through some of the basics what i'm going to do now is show you why you might want to know this for some very awkward angles to get exact solutions without having to approximate then we'll talk about two identities so we'll talk about two equations and then we'll be done all right so we got a couple examples that illustrate that sometimes these identities these formulas help us to find exact answers of angles that are not on your unit circle so this is quite valuable if you have to find an exact answer like cosine of 22.5 degrees that's not our unit circle so here's the thought process could you use either a double angle or a half angle formula to rewrite this as a better angle or at least one that's on your unit circle so i might i might think 22.5 looks like an angle that's cut in half it actually looks like like half of 45 degrees so so wait a minute maybe i can write this as half of 45 degrees instead of 22.5 so if i write this as cosine of 45 over 2 notice 45 over 2 that's still 22.5 degrees but if i write this as 45 over 2 degrees well that's a half angle formula that's something that we can use because because when we have an angle over 2 well our formula says that we can take and use this angle in that formula remember that the half angle says plus or minus square root of 1 plus cosine theta over two the only question is what is your theta now we've been doing a lot of examples but if you remember it was theta over two here's why the half angle formula is so nice if you can write this as an angle over 2 you get to use that angle over there cosine of 45 degrees is really nice for us to use that square root 2 over 2 but this is the reason why we want to use this sometimes is so that you can get away from doing this and say hey i can use a half angle formula and really think of it as 45 degrees because of that formula so we're going to say this is plus or minus square root of 1 plus cosine 45 degrees over two that's much easier or at least possible to find an exact answer that one's not so much because 22.5 degrees is on the unit circle here we go hey cosine 45 degrees go to my unit circle looks like square root two over two one plus square root two over two that would be two over two plus square root two over two so that's two plus square root two over two so common denominator here you could also multiply both the numerator and denominator by two and as long as you distribute just be sure that you're doing that and you could get two plus square root two over four we're going to actually get the same exact thing here we're going to get 2 plus square root 2 2 divided by 2. well 2 plus square root 2 over 2 divided by 2. multiply your denominators multiplied by the reciprocal multiplies your denominators so either way we go about it whether you want to do it that way or whether you want to multiply both the numerator and denominator by the lcd and distribute two twos cancel here over four get the same exact thing the only thing that's left for us is to determine whether that's positive or negative so you you have to think back to your angle now because we're given a specific angle we're given 22.5 degrees where is that well that's in quadrant one or where's 45 over two wait a minute that is 22.5 degrees that's in quadrant one think about cosine in quadrant one cosine quadrant one is positive so take the positive and you're done so that's one way that we can use these half-angle formulas to find an exact answer not just approximation but exact answer for an angle that we don't really have on a unit circle we're going to do the same thing with tangent of 9 pi over 8 but there is one thing about this i want you to notice that angle is outside of the first period of tangent so tangent goes from 0 to pi that's its first period 9 pi over 8 is just outside that anytime that happens like if you saw 5 pi over 2 inside of sine or cosine you might want to put this on the first period so we can always do this by subtracting or adding any number of periods to this like 9 pi over 8 i'm probably thinking let's subtract pi why because it moves it from from quadrant 3 in quadrant 1 it's a little bit nicer to deal with even though tangent is is positive in both of those it's just a little bit nicer so any what i'm saying is that anything outside of the first period of your trig function you can always subtract some periods to get into one period so since the period of tangent is pi let's subtract pi what that means is that if we find tangent of pi over eight it's going to be identical to tangent of 9 pi over 8 and that's nice it's a little easier to deal with but then comes the hiccup you go wait a minute that's not on my unit circle either i know it's in quadrant one think about why that is if you cut pi into eight please pieces so one two three four and five six seven eight and you go to one of them you are in quadrant one so tangent is going to be positive so when we deal with our formula our half-angle formula which you're going to get a little bit we're going to take the positive square root but pi over rate's not on anything so how in the world could you could you think about that well pi over 8 looks like half of some other angle or an angle pi over four pi over eight is half of pi over four if you took pi over 4 and divided by 2 you get pi over 8. therefore pi over 8 is a half of an angle of that and that is what we need to use in our formula that's what makes it so nice so we're going to write out our formula just keep in mind that angle that theta is this thing you we're really kind of tricking the problem we're thinking of this as half of some other angle it's that angle that you get to use which is what makes this all possible anyway so we're going to use pi over 4. we've actually done that haven't we because cosine of 45 degrees and cosine pi over 4 power 4 is 45 degrees we're going to get that square root 2 over 2 again in this case i would certainly multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2 getting rid of that lcd as long as we distribute so 2 times 1 gives us 2 square root 2 over 2 times 2 is just square root 2. something very similar happens here we get 2 plus square root 2. we could rationalize the denominator multiply both of these by 2 minus square root 2 over 2 minus square root 2 and distribute that would work but in our case i'm not going to do that it's just a little bit more than i want to spend time on right now what i will do though is is look at the sign so because tangent of pi over four over two or pi over eight you're looking at pi over eight that gives you your quadrant that's quadrant one tangent is positive in quadrant one we'll take just the positive version that square root you never leave both positive and negative four for these half-angle formulas so i hope that's made sense we're going to come back with two very fast identities then we'll do three equations pretty quickly and then we'll be done okay we're about to go through two identities because it's really good to remember these things you deal with identities many many times especially in calculus too when we deal with a lot of trigonometry in some things called integrals so we're going to get there so right now we're going to refresh just on how how proven identities works remember that what we want to do is start on like the harder side and there's lots of different things that we we deal with but one of the main concepts was look at the harder side look to see if there are any identities right there if there are take care of it if there's not see everything's in sines and cosines make one fraction maybe factor if you can so let's go ahead let's start with this guy cosine to the fourth theta minus sine to the fourth theta equals cosine of two theta i think the harder sides of this side so i'm going to start there i'm looking at that that's how well there's there's not more than one fraction so i can't make everything one fraction i don't see an identity that's right there popping up at me everything's in sines and cosines um i might try to factor this because i'm i'm seeing this as kind of like oh man it's kind of like a difference of squares it's something squared or cosine squared squared minus sine squared squared so it's lack of difference of squares maybe i'll write it like that now that we've written this as a difference of squares difference of squares can factor do you remember that it's very similar to x squared minus y squared and you write this as x minus y and x plus y that's a difference of squares factoring we're about to do exactly the same thing it's just that we have this squared minus this squared first thing squared minus second thing squared how it works we take cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta times cosine squared theta [Music] plus sine squared theta i'm really hoping that you see the similarity here it's just a difference of squares this stuff is first thing squared minus second theta squared just like x squared minus y squared we just take our cosine squared minus sine squared cosine squared plus sine squared as a product of one another so after that what do you do don't factor again that's what you don't do don't factor again you see the thing about proven identities is we want to make sure that we're always checking for a known identity like after everything that we do so i don't want to start going and factoring that that doesn't factor but i certainly don't want to factor that the reason why is because if we're checking for identities oh this is this is a beautiful one cosine squared plus sine squared theta is one that's the pythagorean identity so this is just one what about this one cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta if we have our identity sheet next to us or we're really used to the double angle identities this is one of the double angle identities formulas for cosine so cosine two theta there was three double angle formulas for cosine the first one was exactly what we see here so that that's a big point that these formulas they're not just one way they go both ways so if you have cosine two theta sure you could write it as cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta but on the other hand if you have cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta like that you could also write that as cosine two theta now that's perfect because cosine two theta times one is cosine two theta and we've just started with the hard side we've done some factoring we used some identities and we've ended with what we wanted to prove so that states it and that's it so we've just proven that identity how about the next one this is super similar very very similar because we're going to use the same exact formula we see right here that that is a difference of squares but if you notice it's also this right here so you go wait a minute that doesn't have two theta in it that just has theta in it yeah but we can do the same thing so keep in mind what happens cosine 2 theta equals cosine squared theta minus sine squared then here's what this this really says it says cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta is you can write this thing as cosine of two times whatever that angle is cosine squared theta minus center of theta is cosine of two times whatever that angle is as long as they're the same which they are so what about that this can be written as cosine of two times whatever that angle is which is two theta wait a second we started the hard side we saw an identity right off the bat we've used it and now cosine of 2 times 2 theta 2 times 2 theta is 4 theta and that's exactly what we're trying to prove that proves our identity so about these identities now that we have more tricks in our bag we don't it actually makes things a lot easier um so when we see an identity right off the bat you can go for it a lot of times there's some factoring involved but keep with the same kind of core features of how to solve identities number one if you have fractions you get one fraction use known identities anytime you can and immediately after you do something check check for an identity there factoring is always a good tool if you're getting stuck and then remember that identities are not just one-way streets they're they're two-way streets we can go forward we can go backwards on them it oftentimes helps with a lot of things that we deal with last little bit we've got three equations that we're going to solve they're going to go fairly quickly but you're going to notice something about this there's an appropriate choice for some of these double angle formulas that you have to make so we're going to take a look firstly at cosine of two theta plus sine six sine squared theta equals four um when we deal with these often times the worst part of this is the double angle you see that that doesn't play along very nicely with things that aren't double angle and so typically the way these equations work is find the double angle use the appropriate formula to get away from that double angle and then almost always we have some sort of a factoring involved so cosine 2 theta i don't i don't really like it the sine squared theta i i don't really want to change that i don't want to change that into a double angle because they're a little bit harder to deal with so maybe i'll look in here and change that out of a double angle now which one do we use because we know that we have three different formulas for cosine two theta this kind of goes back to an identity idea look at what else you have like what else is outside of that if you have a choice of once you make that what's the best choice would you want to see more cosines or would you want to see more signs here's a sine squared so wait a minute if i use the cosine squared sine squared that might not cancel that all the way and then i have another cosine squared that's growing larger not getting better if i use the 1 minus 2 sine squared oh well i could combine some like terms so that would be a great choice let's use that one let's use the one that identifies with the the trig function we already have so we've taken a look at it we said i really don't like double angles let's change that first but i'm going to use the appropriate one that matches what i already have one minus two sine squared theta looks like a good choice because i already had some sines where theta is up there now we can combine some like terms and once we do we see 1 plus 4 sine squared theta just combine like terms hey there's only one trig function left if we isolate that we can take a square root both sides so we'll subtract 1 and divide by four so we work all the way down to sine squared theta equals positive 3 4. remember that sine squared theta means sine theta squared so you have your variable inside of a function to a second power the whole thing's to second power you can take a square root but if you do it you've got to remember to take it on both sides and you have to put that plus and minus we see that we get this sine theta equals plus or minus square root 3 over 2. now square root of 3 over 2 is a great number it's on our unit circle but just remember that you have to find out all the solutions on 0 to 2 pi that equal either positive square root of 3 over 2 or negative so sometimes i'll do this i'll write this out as two different equations find sine theta equals positive square root of three over two and sine theta equals negative square root of three over two just so i don't get confused and the reason why i'm doing that is you can hopefully you can see that on zero to two pi you're going to have two angles that give you this and two angles will give you that there's gonna be four angles here so we walk through this we think about where is sine theta equal to positive square root of three over two that would be quadrant one and quadrant two sine is positive in one and two where would sine theta equal negative square root of two that's quadrants three and four signs negative and three and four so we're gonna get theta equals pi over three and two pi over three so where's sine theta equal negative square root of three over two that's in quadrants three and four so let's see pi over three two over three then at four pi over three and at five pi over three we would get angles that give us a y coordinate of negative square root of three over two so all in all there's four angles that satisfy this equation there's four angles that give us either a y coordinate of positive or negative square root of three over two and that's all of our solutions on one rotation around that that unit circle or from zero to two pi so i hope that makes sense hope you're seeing really the the uh the necessity of changing our double angle into something that relates relates to what we have already that's the appropriate choice to make is something that matches up with what you have otherwise we might be going in circles for a little while if we pick the wrong thing here so be very careful on what you're picking make sure it's matching what you have all right let's look at the next one we got cosine of two theta equals cosine of our forgotten theta equals cosine of theta now what do you do here i really want you to think through this on your own don't pause the video but think about what i'm i'm asking you to do look at the piece that is difficult to deal with hopefully in your head it's the cosine 2 theta now cosine 2 theta that's a double angle that has three different formulas which one matches up best with what you have already would you want to see signs or would you want to see cosines well if you already have a cosine you can change this into one of three things you can change it into cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta you can change it into one minus two sine squared theta or you can change into two cosine squared theta minus one which one matches up with what you have over here well probably not the stuff with signs in it so maybe i choose the double angle formula for cosine that has to do with cosine and just cosine that's going to give us 2 cosine squared theta minus 1. so where do we go from there well at this point i hope you're noticing that the format of this you've got a power 2 cosine you get a power 1 cosine you get a constant this is a really good opportunity for us to factor so let's get everything on one side and let's see if we can factor this so we've got things on one side in order we've kept our first term positive the first term is the term of the largest power and so in our case we want to keep that power 2 cosine keep that positive i hope it's making sense that we want to pick the thing that matches what we have that lets factoring happen a lot easier that's a lot of other combined like terms happen so when we look at this and say which one do we choose oftentimes it's based on what we have outside of that double angle like here we had sine squared we want to combine some like terms pick the stuff aside not cosine here we have just the cosine pick this up with just cosine and not sine now that we have this this could be an opportunity for a substitution you could call cosine theta equal to u you have something raised to the second power something raised to the first power and it's the same something call that u or some other dummy variable so we get 2 u squared minus u minus 1. we've talked about substitutions a lot in this series and in past series it just lets you factor easier it lets you change things that look hard to factor into things that are easy so two u squared minus u minus one is pretty easy for us to see that we can factor that we'd have negative one negative two looks like we'd get negative two and positive one if we wanna divide by our a and simplify you can factor this as one u minus 1 over times 2u plus 1. or you could just straight up solve this right now if you change these signs that will solve your u so you could put down here u equals positive 1 u equals negative one half and you're done uh so if all we're looking for is the solution not the factoring you can go right from here as long as you've divided by your a first that works if not if you like the factory better you can do two u plus one one u minus one equals zero and you can probably see this two u plus one equals zero would give you negative one half uh u minus one equals zero would give you positive one we're not done but we're very close remember that we use this substitution here so what is u really u is really cosine theta so if u equals one that means cosine theta equals one and if u equals negative one-half that means cosine theta equals negative one-half could you have just factored from here yeah that's fine if the substitution is not necessary for you you can easily factor this as 2 cosine theta plus 1 and cosine theta minus 1. that's fine too it doesn't really matter i'm just giving you another option what isn't optional is solving this the rest of the way so we take a look at our unit circle cosine theta equals 1. so what angle gives you an x coordinate of one that's got to be zero so cosine theta equals one only when theta equals zero notice that we don't allow this to get two pi so it's just at zero cosine theta equals negative one-half at two places in quadrants two and three because cosine is the x-coordinate the x-coordinate is negative in quadrants two and three and will equal an x coordinate of one half negative one half i should say at let's see um two pi over three and four pi over three if you look at your unit circle we're just finding out where cosine theta equals negative one half you're going to find 2 pi over 3 and 4 pi over 3. and those are all the solutions on one revolution of the unit circle or from 0 to 2 pi that satisfy that equation okay last one so we have 2 sine of 2 theta equals cosine theta we really want to change some double angles they're difficult to deal with when we deal with other things that don't have a double angle so like when we have sine of two theta and cosine theta the two theta makes it very difficult for us to manipulate that because if you have different angles they're hard to combine they're hard to factor you can't factor them you can't pull the two out you can't do anything with a double angle if you have other angles that are not 2 theta that's why we were changing all the double angles into the appropriate formula so now when we get sine of 2 theta equals cosine theta we have to change that sine of 2 theta now this is really good news because there's only one formula for a double angle for sine so sine of 2 theta only equals one thing and you really have to use it so you don't have to choose anything this is only going to equal 2 sine theta cosine theta for the last time you don't just need to pull the two out the only way you change arguments and trig functions is with identities the identity for a double angle for sine says you can change this as long as you do sine of 2 times sine of theta cosine theta since there's only one formula it's the one that we have to use now what do you do well this looks like it could be another factoring issue because i have something with a cosine and i have a cosine over here so maybe we start getting everything on one side to see if we can factor equations usually work that way when you have two different terms with the same same function or the same variable or one squared and one's not let's see if factoring works let's get everything on one side one thing to be cautious of i've seen it from time to time doesn't happen often but don't start dividing both sides by something to eliminate it because what happens is you'll start to eliminate some of your solutions so if we divided both sides by cosine theta sure it would cancel out but you're going to eliminate some solutions and you're also technically divided by something that could equal zero and so you do run into some demand issues there so don't do that get everything on one side and see if you can factor it so if we have two sine theta cosine theta minus cosine theta hey you've got two terms they both have cosine data in them let's let's factor that out now that we've factored all when we have a zero you can use a zero product property for this so because you have two pieces multiplied together equals zero either cosine theta equals zero or two sine theta minus one equals zero now that's already solved we're just going to have to find the angle that gives us an x coordinate of 0. here we'll add 1 and divide by 2 we'll isolate that sine theta and on the interval from 0 to 2 pi the only place where we have an x coordinate of 0 is at pi over 2 and at 3 pi over 2 so we hit x coordinate of 0 at pi over 2 and then again at 3 pi over 2 so this has two solutions the only place where we have a y coordinate of one half on the unit circle happens at pi over six and at five pi over six so we'd certainly want our unit circle handy to be able to find out if cosine theta equals zero we're really just asking what angle gives us an x coordinate because cosine is the x coordinate circle of zero and that's pi over 2 3 3 pi over 2. what angle on the unit circle gives us a y coordinate of one half because sine theta is the y coordinate on the unit circle that happens at pi over 6 and 5 pi over 6. so i hope this has made sense i hope i've walked you through enough examples to illustrate the use of a double angle and a half angle formula when to use them what they look like especially in in identities and some of these equations on how to do that these can get pretty confusing but remember that the double angle piece is typically the piece we want to get rid of usually not always but usually with cosine we just want to pick the right one that matches the rest of our stuff either to combine like terms or that makes factoring possible so i hope that helps you hope you've enjoyed the videos and we'll see you for next time for a couple different identities that we'll make you 

Transcript for: How to Use Product to Sum and Sum to Product Formulas in Trig (Precalculus - Trigonometry 29)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the sum to product or product to some formulas I'm going to prove them for you they're not that bad we'll deal with a few examples it'll be a briefer I suppose relatively briefer video um but I'm going to make sure that you understand how to do this we'll end with a couple identities how to prove them using these formulas that really it really sinks in and then solve an equation so hope you're ready for it so what we deal with with with the product to sum and sum to product formulas is how to really change between these these products or these these s and cosine functions multiply together and change them into a sum or from a sum into a product they're both very useful uh they're both necessary later on in some math so let's get right into it first thing I'm going to do is prove the product into sum formulas for you so let's take a look at the well let's see this was the sum and difference formulas for S and cosine and here's what we're going to do the whole idea behind these proofs is if you can add these together what's going to happen is part of this equation is going to cancel if you subtract them on this one at least another part's going to cancel and we'll be able to solve for a product or a product that we can write as a as a new identity so let's go ahead and do that let's see what happens when we take these two formulas and we add them together if we do add them we're going to end up getting cine of alpha minus beta plus cosine of alpha plus beta so I'm adding these equations together this would give us this equal to the same thing happens here we're adding these together so if you remember anything about like systems of equations you can add equations as long as you add one side and add the other side at the same time so we're adding the left side we're adding the right side but what happens on the right hand side if we take a look at this we would get cosine Alpha cosine beta cosine Alpha cosine beta we would get two cosine Alpha cosine beta but what happens here this is sin Alpha sin beta minus sin Alpha sin beta those are going to cancel those completely drop out of that equation so when we're adding systems add one side add the other side but those things cancel when we add now if we solve for cosine Alpha cosine beta we're going to get our first product into a sum formula let's just divide everything by two now we're going to write this as a 1/ half in front instead of creating this fraction because often times we deal with fractions in here well sometimes deal with fractions in here it's just kind of awkward to do so if we divide both sides by two or multiply both sides by one2 we end with cosine Alpha cosine beta a product of cosine of one angle time cosine of a different angle that's what's important here equals 12 remember we're dividing both sides by two cosine Alpha minus beta plus cosine Alpha plus beta so this takes here's what it does takes cosine of one angle time cosine of another angle at product and changes it into a sum of cosine sometimes that's a lot easier to deal with uh sometimes it makes other things possible later on in math as well now this is our first Formula what do we do about Sin Alpha time sin beta maybe there's a way to change that product into a sign so if we take a look at our our formulas that we've already dealt with what if we didn't add what if we just subtracted this entire system well if we just subtracted them we get cosine Alpha minus beta minus cosine Alpha plus beta but on the right hand side remember that when we subtract more than one term we've got to really think about subtracting term by term or changing the signs remember that when we subtract we sometimes distribute that idea that subtraction idea so cosine Alpha cosine beta minus cosine Alpha cosine beta well that's zero but check this out sin Alpha sin beta minus a negative you think about that as a negative that sin Alpha sin beta minus a negative or plus sin Alpha sin beta so if we if we subtract these this system we get something very similar to happen that we had right here we're just going to get the cosiness cancelling and leaving two sin Alpha sin beta so let's subtract them on the left hand side we get cosine Alpha minus beta minus cosine Alpha plus beta on the right hand side remember we're subtracting these are going to cancel these are not that's going to create two s Alpha sin beta if we follow that that idea let's divide everything by two then we'll have solved for S Alpha sin beta or a product of sign functions with two different angles and we can see it we can see sin Alpha time sin beta equal cosine alpus beta minus cosine Alpha plus beta these are the first two of our product into sum formulas notice what they do they take a cosine times a cosine with different angles and change it into a sum they take a s times a sign function of two different angles and change that into a difference or a sum with a negative so these are our first two now what what's the only one that's missing well we got cosine cosine we've got s s what we don't have is a sin cosine or a cosine sign now because multiplication is commutative we don't really have to find a s cosine and a cosine sign it's enough just to find a s cosine or a cosine sign uh what that means is we don't have to do this whole add and subtract thing but let's take a look at this if we have S Alpha plus beta equals all that that sum and difference formula for for S we have sin Alpha cosine beta plus cosine Alpha sin beta then sin alpus beta equals something very similar with a different sign let's suppose that we just add those together if we add them we're going to get sin Alpha plus beta plus sin Alpha minus beta on the left hand side on the right hand side hopefully you see what cancels out we're going to get two sin Alpha cosine beta that's what we're looking for looking for not cosine cosine not s sign but s cosine of two different angles this is going to give us the last of our our product in some formulas that we actually need so we're going to cancel these guys and have two sin Alpha cosine beta and like if we multiply everything by 1/2 or divide everything by two we can solve for the last of our products that we didn't know sin Alpha cosine beta and that's it that's the last of our product into some formulas for S and cosine we can see that we can have one of three things we have cosiness multiplied with different angles we have signs multiplied with different angles we have S and cosine multiplied with different angles I said something ear that maybe now you can see we don't need both s time cosine and cosine Time s because whatever these angles are doesn't really matter for the formula if you have sin Alpha and cosine beta or cosine Alpha sin beta th those those variables don't really determine what your angle is your angle determines your angle it doesn't really matter what what those are so we only need one formula there and that's our last one so what we're going to do is I'm going to come back show you how to use these with just four examples um that illustrate that and then we'll talk about our last four formulas like ever uh for trigonometry before we get into some of our our triangle right triangle trigonometry law of cosiness law of signs so hope you're ready for it we'll come back with a couple more examples so let's look at how to actually use these often times we're given some some junk some trigonometric junk and asked find an exact answer for this well that's pretty hard to do with angles that are not on your unit circle like 285° or 7 de I know we've been dealing with uh with radians very often but it's it's time to start thinking about degrees because as we move toward right triangle trigonometry sometimes we deal with those quite a bit more so I'm going to start prepping you for that as well so let's suppose that we had these these angles that are clearly not on the unit circle but you still want an exact answer for them that's pretty difficult so one thing that we can do like I've shown you a lot of other formulas is if we have a product sin s cosine cosine or sin cosine we can change it as long as they're multiplied together we can change those angles hopefully it creates something a little bit easier to deal with on the unit circle so let's take a look at this this is s of an angle times s of a different angle um the reason why I say sign of a different angle is because if they're the same angle you can just get S squared of that angle we have some other identities that deal with u with angles that are the same like we dealt with double angle formulas things like that but here we have two different angles and a product of two sign functions so let's take a look at what our formula says we just created it but our formula says if you have S of one angle Time s of another angle we're going to have cosine of subtract the angles minus cosine of add the Angles and that's really how I think about it we put a 1/2 in front of it and this will simplify this problem for us and allow us to find some things that otherwise would not be on our unit circle so let's go ahead and do that so we know we at 1/2 all of these product some formula start with 12 the S time sign says take your cosine subtract your angles minus cosine of add your angles I typically write these out every time just so that I can double check my work make sure I'm not accidentally subtracting or adding something wrong in my head I'm always just double checking so I know I have S sign got it 1/2 got it cosine I've subtracted looks good minus sign is really important cosine of okay now I've added them then I'm going to go ahead and simplify and hope that this is something I can work with a little bit nicer so 285 minus 75 is 210 285 + 75 is 360 now that's really nice because 360° is one full Revol Revolution just like 2 pi so I already know that one that's on our unit circle 210° is also on our unit circle so we might want to have our unit circle handy because we don't deal with degrees all that much or at least we haven't so far so let's take a look at this cosine 360° is great that's the same exact thing as 2 pi so cosine of 2 pi that's one so I already know that one that's that's fantastic this is going to be one but 210° is also in a unit circle right there it's the same thing as 7 < 6 so cosine of 210° or 7K 6 is < tk2 so we still have our 1/2 we looked up cosine 210° we looked up cosine 360 if we had to that's pretty much it I mean we can do a couple things to simplify this like maybe factor out a negative would look a little bit better you could find a common denominator to make one fraction But ultimately Ely what we' get is exactly this this is your exact answer I'm going to factor the negative make sure you factor from both terms and leave it just like that let's take a look at another one we look at cosine 285° * cosine 195° remember we have a a formula that will deal with any of these products of ss and cosiness we've dealt with stimes sign now we see cosine * cosine so let's take a look at the formula cosine * cosine of two different angles say put your 1/2 like all of them have then we're going to have cosine of subtract the angles plus cosine of add the angles exactly the same thing that we did just were adding here instead of subtracting so let's let's copy that we're going to start with our 1/2 cosine of subtract them plus cosine of add the two angles that follows exactly what we we know that formula is going to do for us it says that we're going to take subtract the angles add the angles cosine in both places and add them together so we've done exactly that so if I take 285° and subtract 195 we're going to get exactly 90° so this is cosine of 90° that's pretty convenient because that's the same thing as Pi / 2 when we add them together we're going to get cosine of 480° now that's great cosine of 90 degre is on our unit circle cosine 480° not so much remember even though we're dealing with degrees you can still subtract a period from any of these angles if we had like cosine of 5 Pi / 2 we would subtract 2 pi if we have cosine of 480° let's subtract 2 pi but do it in terms of the type of angle that you're measuring in so if our period is 2 pi or 360° for cosine and for S and 180° or Pi for tangent we can always subtract that or add that get the same exact value on our unit circle so if we have 480° that's not on there well subtract the period if we subtract 360° we're going to get 120° again cosine 90 is pretty nice that's Pi / 2 that's going to give us zero so cosine of 90° is zero remember we're looking at the x coordinate for cosine cosine of 120° is same thing as cosine of 2 piun 3 those are the same angle it's going to be --2 so 0 + -2 * 1 12 that's -2 that's 1 12 so 12 * -2 is -4 now we've done something pretty impressive we found the Val an exact value not an approximation you can do that with the calculator really easily we found an exact value for a product of two functions of two angles that are not even our unit circle and that's what a lot of these formulas let you do they let you work with things that otherwise you might not be able to do so let's go ahead we'll come back and do one more with a S and a cosine so we've dealt with s s cosine cosine we'll do a S cosine let's keep on going so a lot of times we're asked can you express this product in terms of just a sum of signs or cosiness um it helps a lot in calculus to to write things as sums rather than products because you have a a different different rule for them and it's a little bit easier if things are just added rather than multiplied you're going to get there but just just know that sometimes you want to break up products into sums so let's suppose we wanted to do that so we have S of 4 thet time cosine of 6 Theta we get a s and a cosine multiplied together as a product here's what this formula tells us to do it say put your one half like all of them have we have sign of add the angles plus of subtract the angles this is the only we need for S and cosine so let's go ahead and try that sin 4 th * cosine 6 let's start by putting our 1 half sign of add the angles together plus s of subtract the angles now you're going to know something very important while it's not imperative which angle you call which it is imperative that you add them or well namely subtract them in the proper order so you cannot do something like 4 theta plus 6 Theta and then 6 Theta minus 4 Theta that doesn't work and the reason why it doesn't work is because this this does have an order for it for the angles you'll get a negative angle in there now that that's fine we can deal with it but you have to know that sign you see sign's an odd function if we want to change the sign of the angle well then we need an identity to do that and because sign's odd we can it's just that we have to know the proper sign in order to get it correct so we've got this we said hey s cosine we have a formula for it we're going to double check looks like we've got it right s of added them plus sign of subtracted them now I'm going to simplify a little bit so I'm thinking hey s of 4 thet + 6 thet is 10 theta plus s of -2 Theta now I'm really hoping that you remember that because sign is an odd function you can change the sign of your angle provided that you change the sign of your function odd means opposite inputs give you opposite outputs so if I change that sign I have to change the whole sign I'm not just pulling out the negative if I could do that why wouldn't I just pull out the two and pull out the 10 or pull out the four and the six and call it good we can't we need identities to change angles in intrig functions always so if I want to change that to a positive I need to change a sign of my function now now could you just take and subtract those and make that s of 8 Theta no that's the reason a lot of identities exist is to let you let you do things like that but you got to follow the rules if we just subtract them we're making up our own identities and that's not okay that's not a good thing a lot of people run into a lot of problems doing that so this is as good as we can get we cannot simplify anymore um and make it look any better this is in terms of all signs they're being subtracted and so this would be somewhat easier to deal with if we had do certain things later on in math that you're going to find out okay one last one how about cosine 3 th time cosine 4 Theta we see a cosine times a cosine again really you should stop the video and and try this on your own just pause it see if you can identify the proper formula to use see if you can evaluate it appropriately and simplify it if we run into evenness versus oddness remember cosine is an even function let's give it a try right now so we've got 1/2 they all start with 12 cosine * cosine of two different angles is this this formula right there we're going to take cosine of subtract plus coine of add the Angles and so we've done that cosine of subtract the angles plus cosine of add the angles we going double check check it looks really good we have to subtract the angles in order that's really really important and we've done that first angle second angle I've subtracted them now let's go ahead and simplify this 3 Theta minus 4 Theta is negative Theta at the same time 3 thet + 4 thet is 7 Theta now there's not a whole lot we can do with the the we don't even know that angle but we can use the fact that cosine is even to say opposite inputs give you equal outputs that's how every function works so instead of just pulling out the negative that that doesn't work at all actually we're thinking because cosine is even if I change the sign of my input or change from negative Theta to Theta it will not affect the sign of my output so I'm going to remove that netive it's going to look like it just disappears but we're using the fact the identity that cosine is an even function fun that says opposite inputs equal outputs that's as simplified as we can get we've just written this as all cosiness in a sum sometimes it's a little easier to deal with now I said something earlier I said that the order really really matters on what you're doing with these angles you have to subtract them or add them in the same same order mostly subtract them but it also said said that multiplication is commutative so you should be able to switch these around and get the same result you can as long as when you switch them you maintain the order um you can probably see it here but cosine of 3 thetus 4 Theta if I reverse this would change to cosine of 4 Theta minus 3 Theta well that's different it is but because cosine is even it will maintain that sign that's absolutely fine um one thing that we can't do remember that s and cosine while you could commute them if you have cosine 6 Theta sin 4 thet that would no longer fit that formula this says s has to come first so if you're ever given cosine s commute them first then use the formula and it'll work out just fine as long as you're maintaining the order When You Subtract it's going to be just fine for you so let's go ahead and come back I'm going to give you four new formulas show you how to use them and do um do one more example of how to solve an equation okay so as you can see I've put up four new formulas for you I'm going to lead you through three examples um to use three of these that they're very very similar and in what you do um as far as our product and sums we're now just going from sums into products and so that they're used quite quite similarly um all of the ones that that you'll encounter with this are fairly similar to what I'm I'm giving you so let's go ahead and see what what's going on here if we want to add two sign functions with different angles or subtract them or add two cosine functions with different angles or subtract them we now have a formula to do that to put them into a product now does it help yeah yes we go both ways from products into sums from sums into products at different times in math and we have a product to do we have a a way to do that I should say so s of alpha plus s of beta is two s you add the angles over two cosine of you subtract the angles over two if we want to subtract our signs we have something very very similar be careful on your signs here if we want to subtract our sign function with different angles we have two s you subtract the angles over two cosine you add the angles over two cosin's a little bit um little bit different so cosine of alpha plus cosine beta so two different angles adding the cosines we have two cosine add them over two cosine subtract them over two if we want to subtract the cosine functions -2 s add them over two s subtract them over two so we're just switching our functions here from cosin to signs and put in a negative in front let's see if we can do this with a few examples how about cosine of 2 thet plus cosine of 4 thet so we're going to check out our our formulas we know that we have a sum of cosine of two different angles so that's going to be right here so what's it say to do put the two first cosine of add them over two cosine of subtract them over two two cosine of add them over two cosine of subtract them over two remember just like in the product of sum the order is very important here so we want to make sure we're adding and subtracting especially subtracting in the proper order and then we're going to simplify so 2 theta plus 4 Theta that's six Theta over two and cosine of 2 thetus 4 that's - 2 th/ 2 take some time to simplify the fractions we're going to get 3 Theta and negative Theta now the cosine 3 Theta is set you can't do anything with that but cosine of negative Theta because cosin's even we know opposite inputs give us equal outputs we can change the sign of our argument without changing the sign of our function that's it flip the sign you're good to go with even functions so 2 cosine 3 Theta and then cosine positive Theta it's really tempting to want to pull the three out it's really tempting to combine your cosines and combine your angles you can't unless you're using an identity the stuff we want to do by pulling stuff out it really does not work so leave it just like that you're done that's kind of nice kind of refreshing that you don't have to do anything more with that you really can't unless you have an identity let's take a look at this we have cosine functions being subtracted with different angles if we have them subtracted they count as a sum into a product formula but we're just subtracting instead of adding and that that's okay it's like you're adding the the negative so we're right down here we're subtracting cosines with different angles we're going to start with this with a -2 then sign add them over two s subtract them over two -2 sign let's add them all over two so -2 sign add your angles got it over two and then sign subtract your angles over two we have a bit of simplification to do here one thing you could do you could multiply both your numerator and denominator all by two and distribute and kill off your fraction right now if you want to do that that's totally fine so we' get twos cancel Theta 2's cancel 3 Theta 2 * 2 gives us 4 you can do that if you prefer to make already have a common denom make this one fraction you can do that as well I'll show you that here it just might start looking a little awkward with complex fractions so thet / 2 - 3 thet / 2 is -2 thet / 2 now our twos are going to simplify giving USGA Theta over 2 and for Theta over 4 we can simplify that now please keep something in mind I said something that's kind of confusing for some students to understand what I told you is you can not manipulate the argument to change it but then we're adding and subtracting things in here and that seems Maybe contradictory keep in mind I'm not actually changing the argument I'm simplifying it I'm not moving anything out I'm not putting anything in I'm not changing the sign I'm just manipulating this inside but I'm leaving it inside I'm not pulling it out I'm not changing that from what it is I'm just making it look a little different by by simplifying the fractions in there and things I'm not changing the value of it to change the value of it the sign of it you need an identity I hope that makes sense to you we're just kind of messing with this to make it look prettier we're not fundamentally changing it like changing that sign to a positive that's different fundamentally changing like pulling a three out or something that would be changing the value we're just changing the uh The Look by simplifying our fractions so 4 Theta over 4 we are just going to get Theta now the negative Theta over 2 that's inside sign so if we wanted to change that sign of the angle we could but we need an identity because sign is an odd function opposite inputs give us opposite outputs if we change the sign of our input it'll change the sign of our function our output so we're going to do that we're going to change this to a positive but it's going to change this function to a negative negative * a negative is going to give us a positive so I'm going to change this but it's going to change my sign here so I'm showing that right now I'm showing that this is odd so I can do this with it now a negative times a negative is going to give us a positive that's about as good as we can get as simple as we can make that no this two and that one half do not cancel because again to change your argument fundamentally to move things out put things in you need identities okay last one you should really pause it and try this on your own take a look at which of these formulas actually works see if you can understand the concept of what's going on behind it and then simplify as much as you can so for us we have S of theta over 2 minus s of 3 thet over 2 so we have two sign functions with different angles being subtracted it looks like that one so what's it say put a two got it s of subtract over two cosine of add over two so we have two different functions there SS and cosin so we've got two s subtract the angles over two cosine add the angles over two you can see the only one we're not using in these examples is that one it's very very similar to everything else we've done so follow the same pattern but we always do want to double check so I'm going to double check subtract got it angles look really good first minus second so I have an order over two okay I'm adding them over two I haven't messed up any my angles now we're going to go ahead and simplify um I should showed you that you can multiply by LCDs that's that's nice these already have a common denominator if you just want to combine them that's totally fine too I'm going to do that here so Theta / 2 - 3 thet 2 is -2 Theta / 2 so -2 thet 2 all over 2 still and then we'll have four th/ 2 all over 2 and fortunately we can simplify that -2 thet 2 is Theta / 2 cosine of well let's see 4 th 2 is 2 2 / 2 is Justa now I'm hoping you see what's happen what's going to happen next cosine looks great cosine Theta you're done s of theta 2 think about what sign is is s an even function or an odd function we're thinking that's an odd function what do odd functions do opposite inputs give us opposite outputs so if I'm going to change the sign of input it's going to change the sign of my output if I want to change this in other words it's got to change that sign evens don't do that opposite inputs equal outputs so if I want to change the sign of my input I don't change the sign of output that's why for cosine with a negative it looks like you just dro the negative it's because it's an even function the sign of the function does not change when you take an opposite input so I'm going to make this negative this says change your input for an odd function you have to change the output sign that's as good as we can get that's as simple as we can get that's to taken a a a difference of sign functions with two different angles and made them a product and only signs and cosiness sometimes it's very valuable I hope that's made sense we're going to come back and do one equation um and then we'll call it good so you might be wondering why in the world do we do a lot of this stuff uh why do we change from a sum to a product why do we change from a product to a sum a sum to a product is very nice why well because if you're trying to solve equations a sum cannot be solved very easily by stuff that's nice to use like the zero product property but but products can think factoring like factoring works because you create these these factors that you can set each one equal to zero by this zero product property what could you do there like we can't pull out a two we can't pull out a four we can't Factor anything about this in order to change the arguments you need identities if they're not the same you can't add them you can't Factor them you cannot factor a sign out here you can't factor a two out here you can't do anything with it you can't set each of these equal to zero they're not products there are some and so a lot of times when we deal with equations like this with different angles of s functions or cosine functions added or subtracted it's very nice to make them a product we have the same situation that we have here notice that the signs are being added with different angles let's use our formula so this says you're going to take s of add/ 2 2 cosine of subtract over 2 so we are solving an equation I'm working on this side I still have this equal to zero I'm not not putting things in random places or anything I've used the formula appropriately let's see I had of different angles being added I've got two I got two s added over two cosine subtracted over two in the proper order first angle second angle so I want to make sure that's correct and now I'm going to simplify it so I did this one pretty quick 2 + 4 is 6 6 2 is 3 2 - 4 is -2 Theta that negative is important divid two that's going to give us negative Theta so let's write that now what do you see what hopefully you see that cosine of Theta is an even function I'm going to change the argument without changing the function sign change the sign of the input it will not change the sign of the output for even functions now this is why we might want to use a formula like this to change from a sum into a product you see if we have this now as a product equal to zero the zero product property still works let's take all of our factors that contain variables not the two the two doesn't even matter here but if we take all of our factors that contain variables we're able to set them equal to zero so if things multiply together equal zero each one of those things those factors equal to zero provides a solution for us so I'm going to take s of 3 thet equals 0 and cosine of theta equal 0 let's start with the cosine theta equals z so we pull our unit circle out we take a look at it and go hey when does cosine Theta equal Z when do we have an x coordinate of zero remember cosine of theta says our x coordinate for this angle is in this case Zero that would happen at Pi / 2 and at 3 Pi / 2 that's when our x coordinate is zero we're done with that we're done with this one this one's a little trickier man I hope that you remember that when we have Co like s of 3 Theta one of the first things that we we learned about solving these equations was you can you can do a substitution it it puts more uh frequency on the same period remember that cuts your period by three or it it it compresses it uh into a third of a normal period so three of them are going to fit on a normal period that compresses it so that more fit between 0 and 2 pi and if we're looking for Solutions on 0 to 2 pi which we almost always are then we have to take that into account so here's what to do this is a recap we would call whatever that angle is something different let's call it Alpha for a second so Alpha equals 3 Theta we're making a substitution can you solve that now yeah yeah that's not bad s of alpha equals z alpha is let's see if s of alpha gives us the a y coordinate for this particular angle and says your y-coordinate is zero I'm looking for angles that create a y-coordinate of 0o s is the y coordinate on a unit circle that's going to be zero and Pi now we just talked about this but because that shortens your period or compresses it more will fit on the same period in fact whatever that number is do you remember this whatever that number is ADD periods so 2 pi for s pi for tangent 2 pi for cosine add periods until you hit that many cycles so I'm going to add 2 pi I'm going to add 2 pi again so 0 + 2 pi is 2 pi add another period That's 4 Pi how about 4 4 Pi do the same thing remember that three of these periods are now going to fit in the original 0 2 pi so I'm going to add 2 pi again that's going to give us 3 Pi add it again you're going to get 5 Pi so we have 0 Pi 2 pi 3 Pi 4 Pi 5 Pi those are all the the solution is way more than 2 pi right now for Alpha but look what's going to happen because we use a substitution because we said hey we're calling 3 Theta into this alpha alpha can be this to satisfy a y-coordinate of zero either Z or 2 pi or 4 Pi or uh we could do s of Pi or 3 Pi another Revolution or 5 Pi when we take and put our substitution back and say yes but do you remember Alpha is really 3 Theta what's going to happen we have to divide everything by three in order to solve for Theta that brings it from way outside of 2 pi like 5 Pi is way outside that brings it from way outside 2 pi back into it because it's compressing that it's making more periods fit on the original 0 to 2 pi so let's divide everything by three so we would get zero pi over 3 2 pi over 3 3 pi over 3 is pi 4 pi over 3 and 5 pi over 3 notice what happened all of these are between 0 and 2 pi one revolution on the unit circle we just happen to fit more periods on that original Revolution so combining these Solutions with this solution satisfies that equation I hope that makes sense to you I hope that you're seeing the utility in using the sum to a product so that way we can make them factors use a zero product property and solve them with a substitution like we already know otherwise if you don't see that that gets really really hard I'm not obviously doing more because the only things I can really do are put a minus there or do cosine plus cosine or cosine minus cosine and we deal with the same type of formula we do the same type of problem so um you can do that on your own hopefully you understand what we've been talking about hopefully that this helps you I hope you're enjoying the videos have a great day 

Transcript for: Introduction to Right Triangle Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 30)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to take another look at trigonometry up till now we've really only focused on all of our trigonometric functions as part of a unit circle or relating to a unit circle or a circle with a different size radius but really as part of a circle we're going to adjust our thinking a little bit we're going to take a different view as trigonometry relating to a triangle so uptown now we thought hey if we have a circle here then sine of an angle on that circle would give us the y coordinate or y over r if our radius is not y that's what we see that we see sine of theta is y over r cosine related the x coordinate to our radius so sine theta would give you give us x over r on a unit circle is just x because our radius was one and for tangent theta we get y over x this is what we know already we already know that on a circle or a a unit circle sine theta relates to the y coordinate specifically y over the radius cosine relates to the x coordinate specifically x over the radius and tangent relates to the ratio of the y or x coordinates now let's take a look at just this triangle no circle just the triangle something like this often times you'll see right triangles labeled with a b and c as your capital letter points so so we label those with capitals and our sides with lower case letters like little a little b and little c for the sides opposite angles a b and c respectively so if we take a look at this and we identify theta right here very much like we have then in order to translate into right triangle trigonometry we just need to do a few things number one we're going to label the sides of our right triangle very specifically as hypotenuse and opposite and adjacent to whatever reference angle we're given so in this case i'm giving you angle a as theta this is the one we're looking at according to that angle we can label our sides so here's how to label sides the very first thing we do in a right triangle is we always label our hypotenuse first every single time if you're having trouble labeling your hypotenuse what i typically do is i'll put my pencil on the right angle and i'll just imagine a straight line right through the triangle just like that whatever straight line you put through the triangle from angle c is going to intersect your hypotenuse so right here this is our hypotenuse it's very much like our r our r acted like a hypotenuse in a right triangle that was formed on a circle so if we take away the circle on the right triangle itself r is just this distance here we call that a hypotenuse so i'm going to abbreviate height for hypotenuse now that that side's never going to change no matter what angle we're looking at the hypotenuse is always the hypotenuse but in right triangle trigonometry it's very important to understand an opposite side and an adjacent side to whatever angle we were referenced so whatever we're given or whatever angle we're looking at in this case angle a so here's the thought process on right triangle trigonometry if we can identify the hypotenuse look for your angle identify your opposite and your adjacent sides what our trig functions are now going to do is take an angle and relate it to two sides of a triangle that's what trigonometry does all the time for right triangle trigonometry takes an angle and relates to two sides so three things an angle and two sides so once we label our hypotenuse we take a look at our angle that we're given and then we're going to label the opposite side next so if you take a look at angle a and do the same thing we did to find the hypotenuse just imagine a straight line right through your triangle it's going to intersect the side that's opposite angle a or our theta the the angle we're looking at so this is the opposite side the only side that's left over if you follow this technique is going to be what's called the adjacent side adjacent is the side that's next to your angle kind of like a neighbor would be adjacent or right next door to you adjacent is the side next to your angle that's not the hypotenuse that's why we label the hypotenuse first so we label hypotenuse saying this is the hypotenuse no matter what then we label opposite and the process of my elimination says the last side that you have would be your adjacent side so hypotenuse longest side of a right triangle always opposite 90 degree angle identify your angle we've got it opposite side is just imagine a straight line through it you're going to hit the opposite side to whatever angle you're referencing and the last side is jason keep this in mind if we were to take a look at angle b this would no longer be the opposite side this would be opposite this would be adjacent but your hypotenuse never changes also in trigonometry we really don't use this 90 degree angle we already know it's 90 degrees trigonometry often involves these two angles that's really what we're looking at so let's think let's take the unit circle approach and let's apply to the right triangle what sine did on our unit circle it took from our angle the y over the r that would be the opposite side over the hypotenuse and that's exactly what we're going to get here sine theta is opposite over hypotenuse cosine theta is this x distance this x coordinate over our radius or the adjacent side look at that here's our hypotenuse this would be the adjacent side over the hypotenuse that's exactly what we get here for whatever angle we have cosine theta cosine of that angle we always relate an angle of two sides is the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse very much like the x over the r now tangent tangent took the y distance the y height the y coordinate which is the y height divided by the x distance or the or the x coordinate the the x part of our triangle that would be the opposite over the adjacent sides if we're using that angle so here on a right triangle tangent is going to do the same thing we're going to take the opposite very much like the y divided by the adjacent very much like the x if we were to draw this on a x y coordinate system that's precisely what we'd have so tangent takes opposite over adjacent you'll also see a lot of times that people label the sides opposite angles with the lower case versions of them it's actually if you've ever seen the pythagorean theorem before as a squared plus b squared equals c squared that's where this comes from so if we take a look at this the side opposite a we would typically write this as lowercase a the side opposite b so imagine a straight line through your triangle from your angle that's side opposite b you typically see that as a lowercase letter b and the side opposite c remember a straight line through that that's a hypotenuse you typically write that as lowercase letter c can you see right now that if i took a squared plus b squared leg squared plus leg squared i would get c squared that's where that a squared plus b squared equals c squared thing comes from but that also means that we can adjust our sine cosine and tangent so yeah sine theta is opposite over hypotenuse but you'll often see it defined as a over c the opposite side over the hypotenuse side cosine is for sure all the time adjacent over hypotenuse but you're probably going to see this as b over c and tangent theta is opposite over adjacent that would be a over b if we're using a lower case size now could you do the same thing with our our reciprocal functions could you find cosecant of theta could you find secant of theta cotangent theta yeah really easily the the code the the reciprocal relationships still work so if you know sine of theta you automatically will know cosecant theta so you could really just put that this would be c over a but by rights we define it as the hypotenuse over the opposite so if we want to write cosecant theta we're going to get hypotenuse over opposite if you want to take a look at our angle we would take hypotenuse c over opposite which would be a c over a secant is the reciprocal of cosine reciprocal just means interchange the numerator with a denominator so we would have hypotenuse over adjacent and for us that would mean we get c over b likewise for cotangent it's the reciprocal of tangent so we would get adjacent over opposite whether or not you just want to reciprocate a over b or take a look at adjacent over opposite for your referenced angle there we would get b over a i hope that makes sense let me do just a little bit of a recap to make sure that that you're really seeing this so on a unit circle what we did is we said here's your angle and what sine is going to do is compare the y height to your radius that is the opposite over the hypotenuse when we take a look just at our right triangle that's exactly the same thing we're doing notice though you have to go from a specific angle so if you're going to if you're going to identify the opposite sides and the adjacent you have to identify your angle first so we say if that if that's our angle then that's the opposite side then that's the adjacent side your hypotenuse is always the same side no matter what angle you look at which is kind of nice if we take a look at cosine we have x over r and tangent is y over x so for our triangle we have adjacent over hypotenuse and we have opposite over adjacent respectively so we've just made a jump from a triangle on a unit circle to just a triangle we're relating i hope you see it we're relating the same sides to the angle that's given so the angle is relating the same exact two sides for whatever trig function we're doing that that we've already been dealing with it's just we're looking at a right triangle now so we're going to take a look at a lot of examples to make sure that we are really hitting home on this concept to make sure that you really understand sine cosine and tangent as related to a right triangle at this point so the the main concepts here are right triangle trigonometry works on just right triangles that's why the name's there identify your hypotenuse first locate the angle that's either given or that you want to find then from there identify the opposite and then adjacent sides in that order and this goes very smoothly also there's a nice way if you've ever had any bit of trigonometry before there's a nice way to remember your trig functions so sine is opposite over hypotenuse cosine's adjacent over hypotenuse and tangent is opposite or adjacent a lot of times we see this sohcahtoa you have heard of that before so socatoa is just a mnemonic device it helps you remember that sine is opposite over hypotenuse cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse and tangent is opposite over adjacent i can't stress this enough i know i've said it many times but trigonometry always has three pieces to it trigonometry always has at least a right triangle trigonometry an angle and two sides that's all these trig functions do they relate an angle to two sides so how do you remember cosecant is hypotenuse over opposite secant is hypotenuse over adjacent cotangents adjacent over opposite well you could just remember sohcahtoa and reciprocate them okay last bit before some some examples the pythagorean theorem really did work on the unit circle we took x squared plus y squared equals r squared because those were the two legs and the hypotenuse respectively we can get something very similar for our right triangle trigonometry but there's a few different ways that we can think of it the first way to think of it is the basis of pythagorean theorem altogether that really what you're doing is you're taking a leg squared plus a leg squared and equal to hypotenuse squared this is oftentimes how you would teach pythagorean theorem the very first time no a b or c just identifying the hypotenuse and the two legs this works really well for a lot of students because it's it's really just written out for you so if you ever want to use pythagorean theorem like that it's just fine the only thing that i want to say is keep the hypotenuse by itself on one side put the legs together that's really all you have to remember to use the pythagorean theorem keep hypotenuse on one side put the legs together square everything and add the legs that's really about it if you want this in terms of opposite adjacent you can certainly do that the legs themselves have to be the opposite and the adjacent side the hypotenuse doesn't change so you can change this a little bit and that's really descriptive of what's going on for a right triangle we oftentimes will label opposite adjacent and hypotenuse typically though i'm doing the pythagorean theorem before i even get to that point i would always find my sides first if i'm able to before i label the opposite and adjacent sides so you can use that for sure the other way is mostly in textbooks that you see this you'll see that pythagorean theorem because we oftentimes will label opposite sides as lowercase letters of their angles we'll see a squared which is a leg b squared which is a leg squared equals c squared which is the hypotenuse why is it always the hypotenuse because your 90 degree angle is always labeled c opposite of that is going to be the hypotenuse which is labeled lowercase c and so we translate it as a squared plus b squared equals c squared in order to really understand this you would have to actually know a little bit of trigonometry wouldn't you would you would have to know that a and b are the legs and c is the hypotenuse so either one of these is going to work it's just fine i mostly think about it leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared because it works all the time for every right triangle so we're going to get into some examples we're going to talk about how to use the pythagorean theorem to find missing sides and that way we can practice all six of our trig functions so let's go ahead and practice finding some of our basic trig functions the the main six trig functions on our on our right triangles i've written sine cosine and tangent only the reason why i have is because it's going to be very common for us to find sine and use a reciprocal defined cosecant find cosine use a reciprocal to find secant find tangent use a reciprocal defined cotangent so i haven't written those but you can certainly have those handy so sohcahtoa is really helpful we can just reciprocate to find the uh the cosecant the secant and the cotangent so there's a but there's a real order in how we find these trig functions on the right triangle so notice wherever we have a right triangle the first thing we want to do is make sure that we have an actual right triangle because right triangle trigonometry doesn't work on non-right triangles so firstly make sure it works so that's a right triangle they're all right triangles that means that we can actually use our right triangle trigonometry the sine cosine tangent do now relate to opposite over hypotenuse adjacent over hypotenuse opposite over adjacent respectively so we've got that down the first thing we're going to do on any right triangle like ever is label the hypotenuse so take a moment just label the hypotenuse so i'm thinking that's the 90 degree angle i'm imagining a straight line through my triangle not like this right through it it's going to intersect the hypotenuse so i'm going to label that the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to write down or i'm going to mark somehow what angle i'm given what angle i'm referenced or what angle i need to find so right now the theta is referencing that particular angle now i haven't marked it a b or c it's not super relevant right now but it has marked exactly what angle it wants you to determine the trig functions for and so i'm going to mark that i'm going to say this is the angle i'm looking at according to that angle now label the rest of your side so i already have hypotenuse we're done that's great label the rest of your sides so we're going to label the opposite side after the hypotenuse so i've done hypotenuse i've referenced my angle i've got it according to this angle imagine a straight line through here a straight line through this triangle would intersect this side therefore that 2 that is the side opposite the referenced angle or the given angle or the one you need to find this says we have this as an opposite side the only side remaining if you do it this way is going to be the adjacent side and that should make sense here's our angle one side is the hypotenuse for sure the other side is the one right next to it that's what adjacent means right next to the angle but not the hypotenuse that is adjacent now in order to find all of our six trig functions we're missing a pretty important piece we have adjacent and we have opposite oh now think about this what trig functions could you find right now without doing any other work well you could find all the stuff that doesn't deal with the hypotenuse that would be tangent and that would be cotangent you don't need the hypotenuse to find tangent and cotangent that's important later if we're only looking for tangent type stuff we don't need the hypotenuse to find that so if we're trying to find all six trig functions though we absolutely need to know the hypotenuse so what's going to let us do that if you have two angles in a right triangle or sorry two sides of the right triangle you could find the third side we just need to know the pythagorean theorem so we're gonna write that out the way that i deal with pythagorean theorem i always write it out as in parentheses i just have parentheses squared plus parenthesis squared equals hypotenuse squared i do this every single time every time i do pythagorean theorem and the first thing i write down is the hypotenuse i write down what the hypotenuse is on the right hand side so i always start this way it keeps it very organized in my head it creates a pattern for me i really never make a lot of mistakes because of that so i know hypotenuse is all by itself so what's the hypotenuse i don't know let's just leave it hypotenuse if you want to write a letter c up there that's totally fine now the way that i do it is write hypotenuse and know that my legs go together so i'm just going to write the two legs over here what are my two legs well one of them is three and one of them is two it does not matter the order in which you put those absolutely does not matter what does matter is that in the pythagorean theorem you have leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared in the equation hypotenuse must be by itself b and all of them are being squared your legs have to be together and added together so they've got to be on one side added now we're going to simplify this so 2 squared is 4 3 squared is 9. and that equals hypotenuse squared by the way i'm going to show you the three different versions of this using opposite adjacent hypotenuse i'll show you a squared b squared c squared i'll show you all those things i'm just giving you options as we go through so 4 plus signs 13 that's fantastic equals hypotenuse squared now in order to get rid of a square you need a square root and so we're going to take a square root on both sides now you might remember that when you take a square root you've got to have a plus and minus well with triangles you don't really ever have any negative measurements so we don't need to include that we're just going to take a square root and we'll know that the hypotenuse is the square root of 13. in general you have to simplify that so if it had been something that some square root of a number that we could pull a perfect square out of we would do it and you would leave it as a perfect as a exact answer so you wouldn't want to use a decimal for this we're going to leave them exact so our hypotenuse is the square root of 13. let's put that up there at this point we've done a lot of important work and these should be pretty easy to find you see once we have our right triangle with all of our sides and we have our angle reference and we've labeled opposite adjacent hypotenuse these fall right into place so we first label hypotenuse second find your angle that you are looking at so right here that's our reference angle or a given angle or the angle we need to find we relate the opposite side and the only remaining sides got to be adjacent find the missing sides if you need to and then go ahead and find trig functions so sine takes its e sine is opposite over hypotenuse sine would take look how nice it is if you live i hope you're seeing it i hope you're seeing that labeling this is opposite adjacent hypotenuse makes it nice to find if sine is opposite over hypotenuse i just got to find the opposite side and put it over the hypotenuse side that's 2 over square root 13. cosine would be well cosine is always adjacent over hypotenuse we've labeled that that would be 3 over square root 13. tangent of whatever angle you're looking at tangent is opposite over adjacent that would be two over three those are our three basic trig functions and then we have the reciprocals from there so i hope that i hope you're getting it i hope it you really it's really clicking for you that all trigonometry does is relates an angle to two sides in a ratio sine does opposite over hypotenuse cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse and tangent is opposite over adjacent if we can label those sides from a given angle it's easy to find a couple things about it you're probably going to see this rationalized if you remember rationalizing the denominator we multiply square root of 13 over square root of 13. you could see this as 2 square root 13 over 13 3 square 13 over 13 but this would just be two-thirds now how about our reciprocal functions you got a couple choices you could go back to your triangle and reciprocate all of these so cosecant would be hypotenuse over opposite that would be square root 13 over 2. but if you've already done this sometimes it's a lot easier to remember that cosecant is the reciprocal of sine just reciprocate what you've already found for sine you'll notice something too did you notice that i didn't rationalize that before i found the reciprocal because if we had then we'd have to reciprocate and then re-rationalize so times we're going to find both of these and then rational rationalize them when we have to after that so cosine of theta is 3 over square root 13 that means that secant theta is square root 13 over 3 just the reciprocal and tangent theta is two thirds cotangent is just the reciprocal three halves that is exactly what we would have found if we use the the identities for cotangent secant and cosecant cosecant is hypotenuse over opposite got that secant is hypotenuse over adjacent get that and cotangent is adjacent over opposite it's the same either where you go whether you want to go from the triangle or whether you want to just reciprocate sine cosine tangent either way is fine they both work okay let's move on to the next one so we have a we'll check is what we want to use going to work with what we have so we want to use right triangle trigonometry is it a right triangle yeah it is that means 90 degrees so we do certainly have a right triangle that's fantastic the first thing we do with any right triangle ever label the hypotenuse so right now you should be doing that so if we look at our 90 degree angle imagine a straight line through this is our hypotenuse so we're going to label that hypotenuse is 4. next we take a look at where our angle is that we're referencing either we need to find it or it's given to us or it's marked under triangle and we make a mark there we say this is where i'm going from so i'm going to take a look it looks like this is our angle so i'm going to put a mark up there i'm looking there the next thing we do is label your sides according to that angle so if this is the one we're referencing find the opposite side first notice your hypotenuse is done you do that first every time find the opposite side first that would be three so imagine just a straight line through our triangle from our angle it's going to always intersect the opposite side so that is the opposite side to the angle that's being referenced the last side the one you haven't marked yet with hypotenuse or opposite has to be your adjacent side that happens to be the one that's missing so there's a couple ways to do this the first thing you could do is you could label these a b and c and write little a little b and little c and use the pythagorean theorem that way you could do it the way that i've shown you and use hypotenuse opposite and adjacent just remembering that the hypotenuse goes by itself that's the way i prefer to do it or you can just use leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared you call this any variable that you want it doesn't really matter so i'm going to show leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared so i'm always going to show open parenthesis no matter what i'm really thinking about for the the pythagorean theorem whether i'm using a b and c or leg leg hypotenuse or opposite adjacent hypotenuse it doesn't really matter what does matter is that the pythagorean theorem really is it's a concept more than is a formula the concept is square the legs add them and it must equal the hypotenuse when you square it so all that says is your hypotenuse goes here write that down first so if our hypotenuse is 4 i'm going to make sure the hypotenuse is by itself on one side of the equation and that i've squared it over here on the other side the things that are getting added those are the legs so i'm going to put down 3 squared that's one leg and adjacent squared i can use the word adjacent i could call that a variable x i can call it a letter like lowercase b you probably wouldn't want to use c because that stands for your hypotenuse and most trigonometry so i'm going to just call this b and then we're going to solve for that so 3 squared is 9 and 4 squared 16. if we're solving for b we've got to subtract 9 first so b squared is going to give us 7. now we're not quite done because we do want to solve for b so this is where we take a square root you can disregard the plus and minus for the right triangle trigonometry because the measurement of our our triangles can't be negative we're talking about real triangles here so b is going to equal the square root of 7. so i'm just going to erase this b now that i found it this is the square root of seven from there we should really be able to find all of our trig functions notice what we've done we label the hypotenuse first we label our sides opposite adjacent we find all of our missing sides and then it's pretty nice because your sides are actually labeled so because we've referred from our angle to our sides we know that those sides are in reference to that angle that was already talked about so when we talk about sine of theta is opposite over hypotenuse you've already labeled opposite and hypotenuse according to that angle so we just have to write down the sides that match up with the words opposite hypotenuse for us that would be three over four so sine theta is opposite we've already labeled it over hypotenuse three over four cosine theta cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse so for our angle we've already labeled our sides that would be square root 7 over 4. tangent is opposite over adjacent well that is three over square root of seven i'm gonna double check my work here real quick sine is let's see opposite over hypotenuse i get that through four cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse that's the so and then the co adjacent over hypotenuse square seven over four tangent is opposite over adjacent toa three over square root seven looks really good now i'm going to go ahead and find my reciprocal functions cosecant matches up with sine secant matches with cosine cotangent match it up with tangent they're just reciprocals if you want to go back to your triangle then cosecant would be hypotenuse over opposite or the reciprocal of sine that'd be four over three either way you go secant is hypotenuse over adjacent 4 over square root of 7 or the reciprocal of cosine cotangent is adjacent over opposite or the reciprocal of tangent square root 7 over 3. besides the fact that these two should be rationalized you're done i typically don't rationalize until right now if i did i would multiply the square root of seven over the square root of seven and get three square root seven over seven and here we would multiply square root seven over square root of seven i get four square root of seven over seven that's about as good as we can get those are all six major trig functions of whatever triangle we have and given the specific angle they wanted you to reference okay i'd encourage you to pause the video and try that by yourself see if you can do this see if you can recognize that right triangle trigonometry will work see if you can write down the hypotenuse see if you can write down according to the angle that you're given the opposite side and then the adjacent side find the missing side and then label all six trig functions i'm going to model my thinking this one last time before we get into the co relationships like sine and cosine why they're called that tangent cotangent why they're called that we'll talk about that in just a minute after this example so we're going to start right now the very first thing we do is our model my thinking one last time is in any right triangle we always label the hypotenuse first we do this for pythagorean theorem we do it for all of our trigonometry it's really helpful to label that so we're going to start by identifying the longest side of the right triangle the side opposite 90 degrees it's called the hypotenuse i'm thinking draw a straight line from the 90 degree angle it's going to go right through the hypotenuse this is my hypotenuse the next thing i do i make a mark somehow to know what angle we're referencing so they said theta's here that's the angle they're talking about and so everything's going to be referring to that angle so all my sine theta says hey this is the theta i'm talking about so give me sine according to that angle remember what tree does it relates one angle to two sides that's all it does we need to know all the sides of our do it we also need to label those sides in order to do this properly so according to this angle i'm imagining a straight line right through my triangle this is the opposite side and the only side remaining would be adjacent adjacent means right next to but it's not the hypotenuse so on this angle you have two sides that are right next to it the hypotenuse and this guy over here that guy over there is called the adjacent side now think about this for a second what trigonometric functions could you find without having to find that side everything that doesn't involve opposite so sine tangent cosecant and cotangent all involve the opposite side you couldn't find those but you could find cosine and you could find secant those are two that you do right now cosine would be adjacent over hypotenuse that's 2 over square root of 5. secant would be hypotenuse over adjacent that'd be square root 5 over 2. you could write that down right now if you wanted to if you don't want to that's fine but you're going to have to find that opposite side that missing side in order to figure out the rest of those four trig functions so we're going to do that i'm going to list just leave this in the word opposite i know how pythagorean theorem works i know that what we do is we take our legs squared and equal to our hypotenuse squared so i'm going to write this out in parentheses always write that out in parentheses legs squared added together equals hypotenuse squared i'm going to look at my triangle i'm going to make sure since i've already labeled that my hypotenuse is on one side my legs are on the other side they're together i will have two and the opposite side i'm going to leave this the word opposite because i like to you don't have to you can write x you can write a b or c whatever you want to do there that's fine you can write the word leg that's totally fine i just like it because it tells you exactly what your you've already labeled it gives you very specific instruction on what you're finding so this is pythagorean theorem the legs are together two and opposite cool again my hypotenuse by itself we're going to solve for that so two squared gives us four square just treat it like a variable square root of five squared gives you five five minus four is one now opposite the opposite side squared or whatever you want to call that squared equals one you still have to take a square root but remember the square root of one is just one so our opposite side is one now we're really free to go to find sine cosine tangent and then the reciprocals so sine theta says now that you've labeled your entire triangle sine theta takes your opposite side over your hypotenuse it's 1 over square root 5. if you want to reciprocate right now or take hypotenuse over opposite we'd get square root 5 over 1 or simply square root 5. cosine takes adjacent over hypotenuse notice how easy it is or now how nice it is that you've already have your sides labeled you just have to look at the adjacent over hypotenuse if you remember cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse cosine takes 2 over square root 5. you've already labeled that finding secant is a matter of reciprocating cosine or taking the the sides in the reciprocal operation so that would be hypotenuse over adjacent or square root 5 over 2. tangent tangent is always opposite over adjacent so according to this angle this is opposite we've labeled it this is adjacent we've labeled it it's one over two and cotangent is the reciprocal or adjacent over opposite just 2 over 1 or 2. if you need to rationalize you'd rationalize sine theta that would be square root 5 over 5 and you'd rationalize cosine theta that'd be 2 square root 5 over 5 and that's it that's as much as we can do with our right triangles as far as setting up our trigonometric functions what we're going to do now is come back and talk about why sine cosine and tangent are called have co co-functions so sine and cosine are co-functions tangent and cotangent are cofunctions secant and cosecant are co-functions why that is we'll talk about that we'll see why it's useful i'll actually recall an identity that we talked about in one of our our trig identities we'll see it kind of in a different fashion which is very useful very important i'll show that to you and then we'll do some examples about how to find missing sides and missing angles okay so i've drawn a triangle up here that's all labeled out with a b and c and we see that this is angle a and that's angle b and then we have opposite sides so opposite side to b is little b opposite side to big a is little a or lower case a and this is little c or the hypotenuse now quick question do you remember i hope you remember that the angles inside of a right triangle or any triangle add up to 180 degrees if one of those angles is always 90 in a right triangle the other two angles have to add up to 90 all the time if all the triangles add if all the angles of triangle add to 180 and one of those is always 90 for a right triangle then it's only 90 degrees left and those two angles have to add up to it what we call that when two angles add to 90 degrees is called complementary so complementary angles add up to 90 degrees a and b would be complementary angles now this is really important for us because that fact lets us create an identity in just a minute something we've shown before but haven't really shown for a right triangle so i'm going to get that get to that in a second the last thing i want to do before we get there is talk about why sine and cosine are named the way that they are so sine and cosine tangent and cotangent secant and cosecant are called co-functions for a very specific reason here's the reason we're going to find out right now that co-functions of complementary angles are equal i know that's a that's a mouthful what in the world does that mean check this out i want you to take a look at sine b we're going to figure out all of these these functions right now so sine b cosine b tangent b cotangent b cosecant b c and b if we talked about sine b sine b if we looked at b remember this is an angle trig functions always relate one angle to two sides here's the angle they're referencing so i'll put a little mark up here sine b would take the opposite side to b that would be little lowercase b over the hypotenuse which is c so sine of angle b would be b over c cosine for angle b would be a over c the adjacent over hypotenuse tangent of angle b would be opposite over adjacent that's b over a cotangent of angle b so here's our angle would be adjacent over opposite that's a over b cosecant the reciprocal of sine just like cotangent was reciprocal of tangent cosecant would take hypotenuse over opposite that would be c over b and lastly secant would take hypotenuse over adjacent that's c over a that's all well and good but we know that already we know how to find these trigonometric relationships of a right triangle but there's something that's really interesting here we're going to now take a look at the cofunction of the complementary angle so i want you really look at this sine b is b over c i want to now find cosine the cofunction to sine of angle a the angle complementary to b so let's take a look at cosine of a so cosine of a is the co-function to sine this is cosine this is sine they are cofunctions this is b this is a those are complementary angles remember b plus a has to add up to 90 degrees therefore they're complementary so this is a co function of a complementary angle check out cosine of a if i just erase this for a second cosine of a now this would be opposite this would be adjacent if we're talking about angle a now which we're doing on that co function so cosine of a is adjacent over hypotenuse that's b over c exactly the same as that interesting think about cosine b the cofunction of cosine would be sine the complementary angle to b is a so let's think about sine of a these are cofunctions sine and cosine of complementary angles a and b are complementary they add to 90 degrees so let's take a look at sine of a sine of a would take opposite over hypotenuse that's a over c i hope you're seeing the relationship trying to build the statement i made a while ago was and probably it didn't make a lot of sense but now it should be making more sense cofunctions of complementary angles are always equal every time so if i take sine of one angle and cosine of the other angle those complementary set not 90 degrees they're going to be equal if i take tangent of one angle and cotangent of the other you're going to get the same thing check out tangent tangent b was b over a what's tangent a so there's the cotangent of a so the cofunction for tangent is cotangent so tangent cotangents or cofunctions b and a are complementary this is one angle this is the other one cotangent a is adjacent over opposite b over a just like tangent b what about cotangent b cotangent b was a over b the cofunction to cotangent is tangent the complementary angle is a tangent a is opposite over adjacent a over b exactly like cotangent b was cosecant b is c over b the co-function with cosecant is secant the complement complementary angle to b is a well let's look at secant a secant a would take hypotenuse over adjacent that is c over b exactly the same as cosecant and b and lastly if secant b is c over a then these are cofunctions the the cofunction with secant is cosecant the complementary angle of b is a cosecant a would take hypotenuse over opposite that's c over a exactly the same thing as secant of b so here's the thing this is this is really showing you what's going on this is proving it really is that cofunctions of complementary angles are equal sine and cosine cosine and sine tangent cotangent cotangent tangent cosecant secant secant cosecant these are all co-function relationships they're called cofunctions because this works this way so a cofunction says if you take a cofunction of a complementary angle you are going to get the same thing like i mentioned before if you take secant of a or cosecant of b angle b same thing take tangent of a cotangent of b sine of a cosine of b you're going to get the same relationship now that leads to something because angles a and b are complementary that leads to an identity for us so if i take a look at sine b equals cosine of a think through this identity real quick sine b equals cosine a but take a look at this if a plus b equals 90 degrees let's solve for a if a plus b is 90 degrees then a would equal 90 degrees minus b if we let a equal 90 degrees minus b we can make a substitution so sine b equals cosine of 90 degrees minus b ma i hope you remember this i gave you identity a little while ago i said that sine and cosine are phase shifts of one another graphically but i also gave you this that sine of theta equals cosine of pi over two minus theta this is saying precisely the same thing sine of your angle is equal to cosine of 90 degrees meister angle pi over 2 is 90 degrees so sine of theta is cosine of pi over 2 minus theta this is the exact same thing if you want to change between sine and cosine or cosine sine all you have to do is change your trig function to a cofunction and subtract 90 degrees minus your angle we're going to practice this in just a little bit i've written the rest of them down i don't know that i would try to memorize them it's more of a concept it's more of an idea that co-functions of complementary angles are equal what that allows you to do is change between cofunctions sine and cosine cosine sine tangent and cotangent cotangent tangent secant and cosecant cosecant secant by taking 90 degrees minus the angle so you can always do this with any cofunction tangent b equals cotangent of 90 minus b we're going to practice that right now to make sure that i really illustrate this how to change between a function and co-function just by taking 90 degrees minus that angle it helps us out a lot with simplifying some expressions let's practice this briefly so if i take a look at sine of 30 degrees let's say that i just wanted to change this into cosine y well because one of these has got to change for us to combine something about it sine with cosine just subtracted it's really hard to deal with so what if i just wanted to change this what if we just we're trying to practice changing from a function to a cofunction if sine of 30 degrees has a co-function of cosine then here's how we change it all you have to remember is that if you want to find a co-function 90 degrees minus your angle is how you do it so sine of 30 degrees equals cosine of 90 degrees minus 30 degrees co-functions of complementary angles remember complementaries and 90 degree idea are equal so i've taken sine of 30 equals cosine of 90 minus 30 that's cosine of 60 degrees if you were to look that up on a unit circle right now you would find that sine of 30 degrees is one half cosine of 60 degrees is one half they are equal how about tangent tangent of 50 degrees the cofunction of tangent is cotangent so if i want to change this to cotangent we simply have to take the cofunction subtract 90 degrees minus your angle so tangent of 50 degrees equals cotangent of 90 minus 50 degrees that'd be cotangent of 40 degrees same thing with secant secant of 5 degrees the cofunction for secant is cosecant so if we want to change the cosecant co functions are always interchangeable with 90 degrees meister angle so we take 90 degrees minus 5 degrees that's going to be cosecant of 85 degrees can oftentimes help us if we have some angles intrigue functions that are are different so like sine of 38 degrees minus cosine of 52 degrees there's not much we can really do with that so those are cofunctions that means you can change one of them into the other one of them by using this identity that we have it really stems from the pi over 2 minus angle we've already seen that before and you could do that with all of these things but if we have two trig functions or cofunctions you can change one into the other so sine of 38 degrees minus cosine of 52 degrees i'm going to choose to change the cosine you could easily change the sign it doesn't matter but let's say that i change cosine in my head i know that cosine is a cofunction with sine so if i want to change cosine to sine i just have to change the trig function and take 90 degrees minus the angle wow when we do that because cosine is changeable into sine its cofunction by taking 90 minus your angle then we see that we have sine 38 degrees minus sine 30 degrees that's zero subtracting something from itself gives us zero how about tangent 20 degrees minus cosine 70 over cosine 20 degrees now this looks pretty hopeless because that's tangent those are both cosines it would be awesome if we could just cancel the cosines or simplify 70 over 20 you can't they're all they're one piece so because your trigonometric functions relate one angle to two sides that cosine of 70 degrees is referring to a pair of sides that's what's happening here you can't just simplify pieces of that that doesn't really make sense what we can do is really take a look at it and go i really wish that was tangent now let's think back to our basic trick if i really want that to be tangent tangent is a sine over a cosine idea maybe if i change that cosine into a sine how can i do it remember sine is a co-function with cosine so i'm seeing tangent i really want this to be a tangent so maybe i can combine them tangent is sine over cosine ah i have cosine over cosine let's change this into its cofunction of sine how do we do that cofunctions are changeable by 90 degrees minus your angle so i'm going to say that this is the same thing as its cofunction of 90 degrees minus the angle that i'm giving that's how you change from one function into its cofunction so that's going to be sine of 20 degrees and we see a beautiful relationship because tangent theta equals sine theta over cosine theta sine 20 degrees over cosine 20 degrees gives us tangent of 20 degrees i promise they don't all work out to zero but this one does tangent minus tangent of both 20 degrees is going to give us zero how about we take a look at cosine 35 degrees sine 55 degrees plus sine 35 degrees cosine 55 degrees you go that does not look good at all why why does it look good actually if you think about the sum to product formulas this actually does look pretty good you could you could change that into sine 35 degrees plus 55 degrees and get sine of 90 degrees and get exactly one but if you if you don't see that why it looks bad is because that's cosine sine and sine cosine maybe if i got both these to be sine or cosine both those to be sine or cosine i could combine them so i'm going to try to make both of these into sine and both of those in the cosine what why because sine times sine gives us sine squared and cosine times cosine gives us cosine squared and sine squared of an angle plus cosine squared of an angle gives us one so so that might work really nicely so i'm looking this going let's change this one into sine how do i do it the co-function for cosine is sine these are cofunctions that's what's nice so i'm going to change this into sine but if i do that if i change from a function to its co function it's 90 degrees minus the angle now i'm also going to leave this one alone i want these both to be signed on the other hand i really don't want to get a different angle here so i'm going to leave the cosine alone and change the sign the reason why is because i know that's 55 degrees this one's going to be 55 degrees i don't want to start changing this into 35 degrees because then we wouldn't be able to combine anything i need my angles to be the same so if i've stuck with my 55 degrees here i need to keep my 55 degrees here that means that i've got to change my sine function so because cosine and sine are cofunctions i can change this sign into cosine by subtracting 90 degrees minus an angle here we get sine of 55 degrees we already had sine of 55 degrees plus cosine of 55 degrees that's why we kept the 55 so that all these angles would be the same and another cosine 55 degrees and we know this when we multiply something times itself we get a power 2. so this is sine squared 55 degrees plus cosine squared 55 degrees and beautifully this is the pythagorean identity i hope you remember it when you take sine squared plus cosine squared of the same angle you get one sine squared 55 degrees plus cosine squared 55 degrees gives you 1. the pythagorean identity if you don't remember says that anytime you have the same angle which is why we had to keep it the same of sine squared that angle plus cosine squared the angle you get exactly one that's pythagorean identity it's kind of nice okay last one so i'm looking at one plus tangent square to 5 degrees minus cosecant squared of 85 degrees and i'm thinking back to my pythagorean identities and i'll remember that 1 plus tangent squared plays well with secant squared because 1 plus tangent squared equals secant squared but not cosecant squared so one thing i'm looking for here if i need to simplify that is maybe using a known identity somewhere in this problem but in order to make that work i've really got to change the piece that doesn't fit into it so 1 plus tan squared 5 degrees looks great this is going to give us let's see 1 plus 10 squared theta equals secant squared theta 1 plus tan squared 5 degrees is going to be secant squared 5 degrees but secant squared and cosecant squared are cofunctions that means we can change one of them into the other to be honest either one is changeable you can do it just fine if you want to change secant into cosecant or change cosecant into secant that would be just fine to do i'm going to choose to change cosecant into secant here so cosecant of 85 degrees can be changing its cofunction its secant function by taking 90 minus 85 degrees that would be secant to 5 degrees so if cosecant of 85 degrees equals secant of 5 degrees cosecant squared 85 degrees equals secant squared 5 degrees the reason that is is because it's a whole entire quantity being squared there it's really cosecant 85 degrees quantity squared which is why we can change that into a cofunction and not really worry about that power and that gives it i gotta end with a zero make sure we're consistent with all the other zeros i really hope that right triangle trigonometry has has been explained well enough we understand i hope that you can see the change from a unit circle that had a triangle on it really into just a right triangle yeah we're adjusting a few names instead of calling it y it's opposite and instead of calling x it's adjacent why that is is because the orientation of our angle doesn't have to be the same all the way all the time so so we can't really stick with this is always why this is always x because we can talk about a different angle in a triangle the orientation can be all flipped around and i'm all weird if you will um so we really had to have a different way to look at that so what we know is now we can relate a hypotenuse an opposite and an adjacent side depending on what angle is referenced in a right triangle sine cosine tangent cosecant secant and cotangent i hope i've done a good job of explaining that to you we're going to come back with another video on how to find missing sides and angles with this right triangle trigonometry have a great day 

Transcript for: Finding Sides and Angles with Right Triangle Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 31)
hey welcome to another video so in this video i'm going to teach you how to solve for missing sides and missing angles in a right triangle we're going to use trigonometry a lot because sometimes pythagorean theorem and interior angle sum just simply won't solve for everything we need but it's an important point i have it written down when we're doing this when we're using trigonometry to solve a right triangle like the missing sides and angles one thing there's a few things that we really try to do every time number one try not to make it harder than it is use the easy stuff first so what what that means is that if we're going to be using trigonometry at some point there's no reason why we can't use pythagorean theorem and interior angle sum if it solves some of these parts for us there's a number of reasons why we do that as we get on through i'll be explaining that so what we're learning today is really just how to solve for missing sides and angles we'll be using trigonometry but don't forget this stuff is quite important and oftentimes a lot easier than using the trigonometry or maybe if it's not easier it at least gives us an exact answer rather than the approximations we normally get with tree so we're going to jump right into it i'm going to lead you through the process of how i pretty much always uh solve a right triangle how i label the sides how i identify what's going on we're only going to do four examples i'm going to work my way through exactly what i would expect you'd understand so let's take a look the first thing about working with right triangle trigonometry is making sure you actually have a right triangle because the sine cosine and tangent will not work the way that we've set it up with the sohcahtoa or sine is opposite over hypotenuse cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse tangent is opposite over adjacent it won't work without that being a right triangle so if we have a right triangle that's the number one thing we want to look for that this is going to work just fine the second thing i do on a right triangle is i always label the hypotenuse first before i do anything else i don't care whether it's pythagorean theorem or whether i'm using trigonometry i'm labeling the hypotenuse so i'm thinking if that's the 90 degree angle the hypotenuse is opposite of that so i'm thinking straight line right through my triangle it's going to hit my hypotenuse i label that after that i might start looking to see if i can find out anything else about this triangle before using trigonometry now i said i'm going to explain you why you might want to do that instead of just jumping right into the trig it's because when you use trigonometry you oftentimes will give an approximation we do not want to use those approximations in finding more measurements unless we absolutely have to why because when you take an approximation you're rounding a number if you use that rounded number in other functions you're going to round it again you're compounding error so you have a little bit of error because you round it then you use it again and then you round again well that's going to compound that there's really only one operation that we'll be using that does not compound error and it's subtraction so i'll talk about when we get to finding angles more about how subtraction does not compound our error in this case but just just keep this in mind pythagorean theorem will give you an exact answer every time in terms of a square root and interior angle sum will give you an exact answer every time in terms of in terms of degrees of an angle trigonometry sometimes doesn't do that so it's really in our benefit to figure out everything we can the easy stuff or use interior angle summit pythagorean theorem before you start to treat so when i'm looking at this i'm seeing yeah there's a four there's a b i can't really find my hypotenuse i'm not even asking for that anyway but pythagorean theorem really isn't going to be useful for us because i only know one side however interior angle sum is very useful for us if i know the angles of a triangle in triangle add up to 180 and i also know that this is a right triangle 90 of that 180 is taken up that's only 90 degrees left between the two angles that i have what that means we talked about this word while back last video actually is that these two angles are complementary that means adds up to 90. so if you know one of them you automatically know the other so it's always okay to take 90 degrees minus one angle and you get the other angle in a right triangle so i know for sure that a is going to be 80 degrees because a and 10 degrees have to add to 90. now did we need trigonometry to do that no and it's nice to have that that angle now we're going to go ahead and try to figure out what our missing side is so there's something that i often do i'll teach students this is kind of a process of elimination of finding out what trig function you need so i've identified a right triangle i've put my hypotenuse i figured out my angle by interior angle sum of a triangle and now i'm going to be looking at this triangle as what else can i label here's what i mean by that when you're dealing with a right triangle and about to use trigonometry it's super useful to label your hypotenuse but then what i want to do i want to look at what angle is given or what angle i want to use if both of them are given and then relate the sides to that angle so right triangle yes hypotenuse i've labeled it i'm going to mark down what i think is the angle that would be easiest to use i know both 10 degrees and 80 degrees i'm really more comfortable using this angle i don't know why it just seems easier to find the opposite side the hypotenuse i ever sorry opposite adjacent sides from that so i'm going to be thinking about this angle so after you've labeled the hypotenuse after you've identified the angle you want to find or want to use after that then we're going to label our sides i'm going to think straight through my triangle here is going to give me the opposite side to the angle i want to use i'm going to label it opposite the only side left is the adjacent side what this does for us it makes it really easy to choose a trig function because what we're going to do what trig functions always do they relate an angle to two sides well what trig function relates the angle that i've marked that i want to use with the two sides that i one know and other don't well that would be opposite over adjacent we can find a trig function that relates opposite and adjacent to an angle it's going to be tangent there is another way to look at this look at the one side that you don't know and you don't care about well that's the hypotenuse i'm not asked to find it and it's not given so i can't really use it so if you have eliminated the hypotenuse from your useful sides eliminate the hypotenuse on your trig functions and it will leave you with the one you have remaining it's kind of a process of elimination so sometimes i'll have students just write out sohcahtoa because that's sine cosine tangent what we actually use to solve for angles and sides and right triangles most of the time and i'll say what side don't you really care about i don't care about hypotenuse okay i'm not given it i'm not asked for it that uses hypotenuse that uses hypotenuse what's only one left tangent we have to use tangent here to find that side if we're going to be looking at that angle so we write it out now that we know that that's 80 degrees we don't have to use angle a we know it's 80. can you see how it's useful to know both angles if at all possible if you're given one you do know the other it's pretty useful to know because it it lets you have more options that also says something there's more than one way to do this so could you have identified this angle and then labeled this as opposite and this is adjacent to that angle yes absolutely as long as you use it in a trig function appropriately you really can't go wrong okay so i know i know it's right triangle i label hypotenuse i've identified an angle that i want to use opposite adjacent from there i've eliminated the possibility of sine and cosine i'm dealing with tangent tangent relates an angle to the opposite over adjacent sides in this case tangent of 80 degrees is 4 over b now how in the world would you solve for b this is really a two-step process you see if we if we have a fraction with variables on it we got to get rid of that denominator even if it's itself is a is a variable how we do that is multiplying both sides by our denominator so we're going to multiply both sides by e on the right hand side yeah these cancel and you get four but on the left hand side we get b times tangent of 80 degrees we're really close to done we we just have to divide and if we do that tangent of 80 degrees divided by tangent eighty degrees is one it leaves us with v and we get b equals 4 over tangent 80 degrees listen this is what is called an exact answer this has all the information about that side this is exactly how long that side is in terms of whatever units you had but it's not very useful you see we can't probably can't cut a piece of lumber at 4 divided by tangent of 80 degrees because we don't really know we don't practice using that in real life so oftentimes you'll see this approximated so in doing that you take your calculator plug it in just like it looks 4 divided by tangent of 80 degrees we get about 0.71 0.71 units if that had been inches we'd put inches feet feet and so on there there's something that i just said though this is about 0.71 here's what i don't want you to do this is something we really got to avoid if this is 0.71 and that's been approximated don't use approximations in future math if you can avoid it at all almost at all costs there's times when we have to but if you can avoid it do not use approximations to figure out other measurements so how in the world would you figure out c if i asked you to well what we could do is use trigonometry but just look at either a different angle or a different trigonometric relationship to do it if we wanted to continue if i wanted to find out what the hypotenuse was the last thing i'd want to do is pythagorean theorem right now why well because well that's 4 this isn't exactly 0.71 is it it's like 0.705 something something something forever if i use this i've already rounded then i'm going to put this in a square so i'm going to square 0.71 0.71 squared is going to make that error worse then i'm going to add it to 4 squared and take a square root of it when i take the square root it's going to make the error worse yet and then i'm going to round it again and it's really the second rounding that causes the compound of the error i will have rounded used it and rounded again it's going to be more off than i want it to be i don't want to have that much error in it so if you can avoid it don't use your rounded numbers so so let's think is there a different way we could go to find out c well let's see if i'm not really concerned about finding the adjacent and i can't use it does that eliminate some other trig functions i mean i already have the hypotenuse i already knew what that was already have this angle that i'm comfortable using so i'm going to mark that again this is still the opposite side this is the adjacent side this is the hypotenuse side for sure but if i can't use the adjacent side anymore because it's already been rounded if i can't use it that eliminates the possibility of cosine and tangent the only thing that's left open to us to solve for our hypotenuse is sine and that's really nice that's really the way we want to go through it is eliminate what you can't use and that will leave you with what you can some people just look at and go hey there's my angle i have opposite i need hypotenuse sine would relate the angle i know or want to use to the opposite hypotenuse that's fine too either way you want to go we run into a really similar situation so we're going to multiply both sides by c to remove the fraction and then divide both sides by sine 80 degrees to solve for c and we get that c is exactly 4 divided by sine 80 degrees but approximately 4.06 question is it making sense why this number is slightly bigger than this number i want you to think about sine remember that sign always returns values between negative one and one there's nothing bigger than one so if i'm going to divide four by a number smaller than one it should give me a larger number that's why division here gives you a larger number not a smaller number also let's make sure this makes sense remember that the hypotenuse has to be the longest side 4.06 4 and 0.71 okay good hey that's a great way to check our work also smaller angles generally open to smaller sides 10 degrees opens to opposite 0.71 80 degrees opens to 4 that makes sense our larger angles are opening to larger sides and our smaller angles are open to smaller sides the last thing is that i'm just going to reiterate one more time if you had done pythagorean theorem of 0.71 and 4 you'd be close to this number but this would be more accurate because you didn't have to round a rounded number i hope it makes sense i hope you're seeing the the process of going through it labeling your hypotenuse finding your angle labeling your sides and then kind of determining which trig function lets you do what you need to do don't use rounded numbers in other math unless you have to the only time we really do that is when we're subtracting angles i'm going to get to that in a couple examples for right now let's go ahead and do another one let's go ahead and give this one a try so we have a triangle it's a right triangle that means pythagorean theorem and trigonometry you're going to work for that's the first thing i check is if i'm if what i have is going to work with what i want to use so that's a right triangle it works with pythagorean theorem it works with trigonometry that's a good thing next i'm trying to identify what in the world i'm trying to find and ultimately going to be labeling my hypotenuse so i take a look and say that's a right triangle before i do anything else i'd label hypotenuse now that we've labeled the hypotenuse one of the first things i always do is see if some of the maybe it's not easier but the things that will give you the exact answers will work on this what i mean by that trigonometry oftentimes gives you approximations back you're using your calculator and you round it pythagorean theorem doesn't do that interior angle sum doesn't do that it gives you a square root for pythagorean theorem it can give you exact angles for interior angle sum and so that would be preferable than rounding something so i'm always looking does pythagorean theorem or anterior angle sum help me find what i need if i have to find two angles in the hypotenuse in this case i'm probably seeing that these guys work for for me first i see two sides they're their legs that's great i see a hypotenuse that i'm going to have to find pythagorean theorem works great this is preferable to using trigonometry also i don't have any angles so i kind of have to do something now now what's the other thought process couldn't you find an angle first and then use this angle to find the hypotenuse you can but remember when you find one of these angles it is going to be rounded for you to be able to use it later and so if you use a rounded angle here this is not going to be exact pythagorean theorem returns something exact for you that's pretty that's preferable that's nicer and so we're going to do that so use the things that aren't trigonometry to figure out some of these these measurements before you use trig if you can so i'm thinking all right if this is the hypotenuse this is a leg and this is leg this is why i label hypotenuse first every time so off to the side i'm going to write out my pythagorean theorem i always do it the same i always write out parentheses parentheses square everything and add these together then in my mind i really know what happens i know the hypotenuse is by itself it's always alone being squared that's just c in this case i know my legs are always together and that'll really help you to fill out pythagorean theorem always fill this out with hypotenuse on one side legs on the other side everything's being squared added together so leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared if we solve that this is 9 plus 25 that's 34 so c squared equals 34. if we take a square root you actually do not need a plus and minus because we're not dealing with like an x y coordinate system where we could have a negative radius or something these are actual measurements so this is just the square root of 34. now that is exactly what this hypotenuse is this is not an approximation i know for sure that's square root 34. what i don't want to do i don't want to round that to well let's see something just under six five point something i don't wanna round that and use that in later math remember do not use rounded numbers in future math if you can avoid it i'm gonna leave this as exactly square root of three four now could i do an approximation yeah sure and if you wanted to cut this to a measurement or something you might do that but to use it in math it should be exact so i looked at it uh man right triangle looks good label hypotenuse if i can do anything else besides trig i do it now so i can't find any angles i don't know one of them i can find the hypotenuse by pythagorean theorem we're looking pretty good now the benefit of understanding that that's an exact answer is that you can use this in trigonometry this is this is what it is it's not round it's not an approximation you can use that that's why we do things like pythagorean theorem and interior angular first it gives us exactness which you can then utilize trigonometry doesn't do that um if we round it it is rounded and you should not use it so now we gotta find some angles um how we do this depends on which angle you want to find first it doesn't really matter my personal preference i like finding angles at the bottom of the triangle because it works better in my head so i've already labeled hypotenuse but once i've identified an angle that i'm given or an angle i want to use or find which i have i want to find that angle then i go on and label the rest of my triangle and now i'm going to go ahead and look straight across that triangle this is the opposite side and this is now the adjacent side it has to be because all relatable hypotenuse that's why we do it first so now that we've done that i'm thinking through what trig function do i want to use or that i can use to relate the angle i want to find to two of the sides that i i know now i know all three sides so so look this gives you options you can do this a number of ways any way is right as long as you're using a correct trig function that relates two sides that you know one thing we don't remember i'm going to say this a lot one thing we don't want to do do not round that and then use that you cannot do that i guess you can but don't do that so normally what i would do is look for two sides that are kind of easier i probably don't want to use the square root of 34 even though it doesn't really matter so i'm looking at angle a and i'm thinking hey i know opposite over adjacent i know opposite over hypotenuse i know adjacent over hypotenuse i know sine cosine and tangent of all these but tangent uses what i would consider simpler numbers so i'm thinking with sohcahtoa if i know all three of them i can use any of those trig functions but if i don't want to use the hypotenuse then i probably don't want to use sine or cosine i'm going to use tangent and because tangent of angle a relates an angle to the opposite and adjacent side we get tangent of angle a equals 5 over 3. now how in the world you solve for an angle like that everything in math that you want to solve for requires a type of inverse for instance if you want to solve something with addition you need its inverse you need subtraction if you want to solve something with multiplication you need its inverse you need division if you want to solve something with tangent you need its inverse see multiplication and division just addition subtraction are not inverses for this this tangent says i'm a function that relates a this angle to two sides if you want to undo tangent you need the thing that undoes tangent and we call that tangent inverse the second part of it is whatever you do to an equation you're pretty much good to go as long as you do it to both sides so when we see tangent of angle a equals five thirds i need the thing that undoes tangent we call that tangent inverse so if we do this to both sides and say i'm going to take tangent inverse of both sides of this equation then here's what this here's just basically says in plain english thing that undoes tangent of tangent now what's going to happen tangent the thing that undoes tangent is going to undo tangent you're just going to be left with a much like multiplication cancels division much like addition cancel subtraction tangent inverse cancels tangent this is going to go away you wouldn't want to use like sine inverse for tangent match the appropriate function so i'm going to undo tangent with tangent inverse it's inverse it's undoing thing i just have to do it on both sides because that's how equations work so i'm left with just a on the right hand side we have tangent inverse of five thirds now that looks a little funny but this is exactly what that angle is this would be called an exact answer tangent inverse gives you out an angle if tangent of an angle gives you outsides tangent inverse of sides gives you out an angle specifically that angle the one that you mark the one you set up for this the angle that you are referencing so that's exact that's exactly what it is but it's not as usable is it because we can't we don't really know what that measurement is off top of our heads so we can take our calculator press tangent inverse it's usually right above the tangent you'll need a shift or a second button and press 5 thirds and we're going to find out the degree measurement for this if your calculator is in degrees which i'm going to use or the radian measurement for this if your calculator is in radians usually with right triangle trigonometry we're more about degrees so i'm going to keep this in degrees now we get the angle a is about 59.0 degrees a couple things about this is kind of important that a lot of people just skip if you're gonna round something even if you round it and says oh you're gonna have zero don't put just 59 that 59.0 tells people that you've rounded it says oh yes i've rounded to one more decimal place and the information i'm given that's usually how the rounding rule works but i've rounded this and this 59.0 would tell people that so it's not exactly 59 degrees and people would know that by how you're writing that secondly if this is about 59 degrees we now know this angle could you figure out this angle angle b and the answer is yes this is the one time that you can use approximated values to figure out something else here's why subtraction in this case does not compound your error if you were to do this another way how much you do it well you might do it tangent of angle b equals opposite three over five but what you're going to get is an approximation that when you subtract from 90 is exactly the same as this one so if you're only caring about the approximations you can easily subtract this from 90 this from 90 degrees and get that angle and we would get that b is about 31 degrees hey they're complimentary they add up to 90 degrees remember you don't really want to do that with any any of this other stuff pythagorean theorem or any other trig functions the only time it really doesn't hurt us all that much is with interior angle sum now let's say you needed the exact answer and 31 degrees wasn't good enough and they said you have to know exactly what it is it's like that well then you'd have to go through the trigonometry so you'd have to adjust the angle you're looking for what that means is that the side you've marked as adjacent is no longer adjacent if you change angles you change or you swap those sides so i really don't want to look at angle a if i'm trying to find angle b by itself now your hypotenuse won't change but opposite would now be three and adjacent would now be 5. so we could set up tangent again tangent of angle b equals opposite over adjacent if we take tan inverse the inverse or the thing that undoes tangent on both sides we're going to end up with tangent inverse of three fifths tangent inverse of three fifths is about 31.0 degrees this is the exact angle that that is for sure but when you approximate it to use it you would end up getting which is why it's okay to subtract them you would end up getting exactly what you get when you subtract 90 minus that approximation it does work every time that what you get here and what you get here if you round to the same digit is going to add to 90 degrees which means you can use it for approximations you can't use it for exactly so can you like this this does not tell you the exact answer if you subtract you'd have to do other trigonometry for that so i hope that that's made sense i hope you're seeing the process of going through it label the hypotenuse use the stuff before trigonometry that you can and then with trig we're identifying an angle that we have that we want to use or that we want to find after that labeling opposite and adjacent and using an appropriate trig function we're going to come back we're going to do one more and then we're going to give you a real life example okay last one before our application type problem we want to solve this right triangle what's solving a right triangle means just finding all the missing sides and angles so let's let's look at this it is a right triangle and let's label what we want to label first mostly on this example i'm just going to walk you through exactly how i would do this problem and model in my thinking so i'm looking at a right triangle thinking right triangles have a hypotenuse i label this first every single time the next thing that i do is i see if anything else can be used before my trigonometry to figure out some missing pieces the reason why i do that is because pythagorean theorem and interior angle sum give out exactness and not approximations trigonometry oftentimes will give us approximations i don't want to be using approximations to figure out other pieces of math so i'm looking at this as a right triangle yes hypotenuse yes but i'm noticing have two sides and i can find a third one so i'm going to use pythagorean theorem to find that side and not trigonometry i don't even have an angle anyway so i can't but i don't want to use trigonometry to find an approximation to an angle then use that approximated angle to find a missing side that would be a no-no that would take an error and compound it to more error error being slightly off from the exact that's what we mean by that so i'm looking this going pythagorean theorem is is a win for me i'm going to do leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared we'll go ahead and i always fill my hypotenuse out first so i have a pattern that works in my head i know hypotenuse is always by itself being squared so i locate it i've already labeled it now 6 goes there i'm just going to make sure my legs are on one side it doesn't matter the order it just matters that the legs are are together on one side equation hypotenuse on the other and you follow the pythagorean theorem then we're going to simplify i know b squared plus 16 would equal 36 b squared now would equal 20 if we subtract 16 if we take a square root b now equals let's see 20 is 4 times 5. the square root of 4 would be 2. the square root of 5 is not simplifiable in a square root so this side is exactly 2 square root 5. you could certainly find an approximation just take two times square root of five and you'll have about how long that is here's what you can do and here's what you can't do what you can do you can use this in more math why because it's exact this is not a rounded thing here this is exactly what you you you have for that length which you can't do you can't approximate this which means giving you a decimal that your calculator gave you you can't give me a decimal and then use that number because that's rounded that's not quite exactly what it is now do you really want to use that side well i'll tell you what these two sides are a little bit nicer to use so i'm probably not going to do that but you could if you wanted to so i've used pythagorean theorem i found out everything else that i could that's an additional sign but i still need to find two angles so how do i do it identify the angle that you want to find now that could be either a or b i'm going to find angle a because it looks a little bit nicer for me to label opposite and adjacent doesn't really matter the reason why we mark it is so that we don't accidentally get confused what angle we're working with so i mark angle a i've already labeled hypotenuse but after you've marked an angle you can now label the opposite side and the adjacent side so it goes in a very specific order hypotenuse find out the stuff you can without trig label an angle you have or one you want to find i've done that from that angle label the opposite side that's right across draw a straight line or imagine a straight line from that angle right through your triangle it will hit your opposite side the last side has to be adjacent what adjacent means is next to so the adjacent side would be the side that's next to your angle but not the hypotenuse you've already labeled hypotenuse so that's not even a big deal it's got to be this side now we're free to go we know all three sides you can you could use tangent as 4 over 2 square root 5. i wouldn't you could use sine as 4 over 6. you could use cosine as 2 square root 5 over 6 which one would be easiest i like the one that doesn't have the square root so when i look at this i see angle that i have i see an opposite side i see a hypotenuse side i probably don't want to use adjacent so if i don't want to use the adjacent maybe i rounded and i can't use it you shouldn't but maybe because as a square root i don't want to if i don't want to use adjacent i don't want to use tangent or cosine i just want to use sine so i'm going to relate sine of a that's the angle i've marked that the sides that i reference according to the angle sine of angle a equals four over six notice this technique of eliminating what you you really don't want to use or eliminating what you don't have can be very helpful a lot of students really like that it works especially if you only know two sides or sorry if you only know one side and an angle and you're trying to find a specific missing side that works very very well so now that i have sine of a equals 4 over 6 i've got to solve for a so i need to undo sine i know sine sine inverse undoes sine so i'm going to do sine inverse of both sides sine inverse is going to undo the sine and leave us with a sine inverse of 4 6 is an exact answer that that is that is an angle so if sine of angle gives you sides sine inverse or sides gives you back an angle this is the exact angle also you do not need to simplify that at least well i wouldn't because your calculator is going to do it for you you can it's not a problem for an exact answer if you need to leave it yeah you probably use sine inverse of two-thirds but when you're using this for an approximation purpose plug it in just like that so we get that angle a is about 41.8 degrees now how in the world you find angle b if you're only concerned about the approximation just subtract 90 minus the angle absolutely fine so 90 minus 41.8 is 48.2 if you needed the exact angle you'd have to do more trigonometry so we would re-identify what angle we're looking for like angle b we re label our sides like this is the opposite and this is the adjacent your hypotenuse does not change and i think about what i want to use in order to find angle b so i probably don't want to use a square root so i'd cross out let's see that would be the opposite side i wouldn't want to use tangent and i want to use sine because those include the opposite side i've used cosine cosine of angle b would be adjacent over hypotenuse 4 over 6. if we do all the work if we take it cosine inverse of both sides if we use that as an approximation then we're going to get exactly the same thing we got from subtraction if we round to the same decimal place so this is about 48.2 degrees but that is the exact that's exactly what that angle would be the last thing we want to do is is check make sure that this makes sense how's the pythagorean theorem held to that's the longest side yeah it really has that's less than six has it held to larger angles open to larger sides this opens to four uh this larger angle opens something slightly more than four this is a little over two so something a little over two times two is something a little over 4. so i hope that's made sense to you i hope that this uh this process is really starting to click it really does help to label the sides the way i've shown you in order to pick out the right trig function so i'm going to come back with one more and then we're going to be done okay last example let's suppose you wanted to find the height of something really tall but you couldn't actually measure it like maybe a volcano because you can't measure the top of a volcano that you won't want to climb to the top of a volcano so is there a way to do it well with some instrumentation you certainly can so let's imagine that you look on i don't know google maps or something and you found that a distance from the center of this volcano to a place that you can reasonably stand is like 80 feet and from that place you're able to take an angular measurement with like a clinometer or hypsometer or some sort of tool and you figure that from that point to the top of that that volcano is 85.4 degrees can we figure out the height well the height would create this this perpendicular this this right angle so we have a right triangle so what now what we're going to do the first thing you do on any right triangle is label the hypotenuse so if i see this right triangle i'm going to label the hypotenuse next let's see if we can find anything without trigonometry so pythagorean theorem man if i knew the hypotenuse i could find the height i wouldn't even need trig um i could find that angle it's not really relevant to this i'm not asked for it so i don't really need to find it i'm just focused on the height here so there's not really anything that's causing me to need anything but trig here so how do i know i need trig i'm given an angle and asks for a missing side that's usually an indication you're using trigonometry so i have seen right triangle i've done hypotenuse i've checked if i need anything else besides trigonometry and i don't let's go ahead and let's mark out the angle that i'm given or an angle that i want to use now i'm seeing that i've been given this angle of 85.4 degrees i'm going to be using this angle so i'm going to mark that from that angle let's label the opposite side and the adjacent side the hypotenuse is done so thinking straight through this triangle i would come across this as my opposite side the only other side left is the adjacent side so i right triangle got this got opposite got adjacent now we're going to find the trig function that actually works so let's see what we have let's see what we don't have and what we don't need to find opposite looks pretty important because i need to find it adjacent looks pretty important because i have it hypotenuse hypotenuse is not given nor is it even asked for so i don't need to use it and i certainly don't want to use anything that that needs it so if i don't need or don't want or don't have hypotenuse it has nothing to do with the problem that means that all the trig functions that involve the hypotenuse are off the table the only one left is tangent and thankfully tangent of this angle is going to relate the hype the opposite what i want to know with the adjacent what i already know remember that with three things an angle and two sides you need to know two of them to find the missing one so i need to know an angle and a side to find a missing side and that's exactly what we have so tangent of 85.4 degrees equals h that's the opposite over 80. we're going to solve for h when you have a fraction with a variable in an equation most of the time we get rid of that fraction by multiplying by the denominator so let's multiply both sides by 80. okay you know what we're done if you were looking for an exact height of this volcano or whatever it is this is it this contains all the information about how high this is from the base to the very top of that volcano now most of the time we want to do an approximation just to get a better handle on what that means so plug this into the calculator we get about 985.91 feet so that's a pretty good approximation for how tall that that volcano is provided that our information is accurate now what might be a better approach is this number actually reasonable to find well maybe if you have like a a map of it from from the top you could do that like a google earth thing look down and there's a center there's an edge where i'm standing that's fine a lot of times though we don't we don't have that so what could you do if you did not have this number number one tangent would not work because you need that adjacent you need to know something else what some people do is they take uh what's called a laser rangefinder and they say hey if this is a certain distance from here to here then i could use well what if this is a known number like from a range finder or something you could use here's your angle you'd still know that here's your height you'd still want to find that if you knew this number it would be opposite over hypotenuse you wouldn't be able to use adjacent you wouldn't be able to use cosine or tangent you'd have to use sine now it's still very possible you just multiply sine of 85.4 degrees times whatever that number is that you would find that's probably a little more realistic for like i want to do this right now type of thing rather than having us to look from like a bird's eye view or something so i hope this lesson has made sense i will be giving you a good technique on how you take trigonometry and apply it to right triangles to find missing sides like we've done here and missing angles like i showed you earlier i hope you're doing well we're going to move on to law of sines next time and deal with non-right triangles which is kind of fun too have a great day you 

Transcript for: How to Use the Law of Sines in Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 32)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about something called the law of sines why in the world do we need the law of sines or the law of cosines which we're going to talk about in the next video um because up until right now really all we've focused on last few videos is right triangle trigonometry so kind of begs the question what do you do if you don't have a right triangle can you still use trigonometry and the answer is yeah that's why we have the law of sines and the law of cosines so right now in your head i want to build this category like we have sine cosine and tangent to deal with with right triangle trigonometry pretty nicely but if you do not have a right triangle well then you have to use something else to find missing sides and missing angles like pythagorean theorem that's fine or interior angle sum that's great or the law of sines or the law of cosines so we'll deal with the law of sines right now we'll talk about the types of triangles you can get besides a right triangle we'll talk about this idea if you know two things in a triangle you can find a third and how that changes just a little bit when we're talking about a non-right triangle how you need to know three things to know a fourth and why in the world that is so firstly what are these non-right triangles called a non-right triangle is called an oblique triangle and really you can have two cases honestly in all triangles you only have three cases you can have one right angle you can have all angles less than 90 degrees or one angle greater than 90 degrees though the triangle with a right angle is called a right triangle but the other two cases if you have no 90 degree angles and all of them are less than 90 you have what's called an acute triangle they're all acute angles or you could have a triangle with one obtuse angle so all acute are all less than 90 one obtuse would be one more than 90. and that's really it those are the two cases of oblique triangles that we can get so when you're categorizing this oblique triangles are solved with law of sines or law of cosines right triangles are solved with our right triangle trigonometry we've already covered so we needed to know something else because right triangle trigonometry does not work for oblique triangles that's why we got this law of sines and law of cosines so so the first thing is when do they work well there's really four cases four cases of these oblique type of triangles that we can solve the first one is well what if you know two angles in one side or one side and two angles or what if you know two sides and one angle or all three sides or two sides in an angle but the angles between the two sides those sides would be adjacent to the angle these are the four cases that we can solve with law of sines and with law of cosines now i mentioned something a little while ago i said that in right triangle trigonometry you need to know two things to find a third like you would need to know two sides to find an angle or an angle and a side to find a missing side that those are the two things you would need to know to find a third but but really if you think about right triangle trigonometry you already know one thing in a right triangle you would already know one angle you would know a 90 degree angle so really in right triangle trigonometry it's you need to know three things in order to find a fourth you need to know it's a right triangle you need to know an additional angle and an additional side in order to find a fourth side or you need to know 90 degree angle you need to know two sides in order to find a missing angle and so really because you already know it's a right triangle it kind of reduces that to oh i need to know two things to find a third but in right triangle trigonometry remember you already know it's a right angle so you know three things to find a fourth that's exactly where we find ourselves in law of sines and law of cosines with non-right triangles you need to know three things in order to find a fourth thing you need to know two angles and a side to find a missing side you need to know two sides and an angle to find a missing angle you need to know all three sides to find a missing angle so those are our cases here i hope that you can see that that in a right triangle you already know one angle and so it reduces that to just two missing things and it would actually fit a lot of these models so we're going to take a look at what works for what our first two cases for law of sines our last two cases for law of cosines when we get there i'm going to show you that so let's take a look at what works for our law of sines here's what we can do if we know two angles and one side whether that side is between our angles or not these are the two cases you could have knowing two angles in one side we can solve for the missing sides really really easily with law of sines how could you find the missing angle it would not require law of sines oh man i remember i hope you remember in the last couple videos i've been telling you use non-trigonometry stuff if you can because it's easier you would not want to find that angle by anything to deal with our our trigonometry like law of sines or anything what we want to do is just use interior angle sum all three angles add up to 180 degrees if you know two angles you automatically know the third one so that's pretty nice but if you know two angles in one side you can find the missing sides with law of sines that's what that does now what if you have two sides in one angle and the angle is not between them that's that's pretty key so one of the things about the next two videos is understanding what works whether we're using law of sines or whether we're using law of cosines because this one and that one get confused an awful lot you can probably see it in both cases you know two sides and you know an angle but this angle is not between the two sides these sides are not adjacent to that angle and that one that the sides are adjacent to the angle that you know so law of sine says if you know two angles in one side use all signs if you know two sides in an angle and the angle is not between those sides the sides are not adjacent to the angle use law of sines these are both cases where you use log signs i do want to talk a bit more about this guy this is what they call an ambiguous case and the reason why is because this can give you one of four results you have four results how would that happen well i want you to think about this if you do not know this side then this side can be really short this side can be really long and this side can be not long enough to make it down to it so there's one of four things that can happen here the first thing that could happen is you could actually get no solution with this if you know a side a side and an angle not between them you could actually end up with the case that this is too short to make it no matter what you do cannot make it this is not going to make a triangle out of it that wouldn't make a triangle so this could happen in this case and you're not able to solve it so there would be no solution here if you know this it will make a triangle and you can find the sides that it would take to make that but notice you're kind of fixing two sides here and you're fixing an angle this side could be too short to actually make a triangle this is one case where you would get no solution what's the next case the next case is that this could be perfectly long enough to make a right triangle exactly one right triangle that could be one of the cases so first case is too short you only make triangle second case is you make exactly one right triangle that would be if this is exactly how long it would take to make this side this side match up with a sign on that angle so you could you could definitely do that the the third and fourth case is what if this side is longer than this what if it becomes too long well then you have two more cases that could happen you could get you could get one triangle that's all acute or one triangle that is uh one obtuse angle so they're both oblique but this is two cases do you see how you could get two solutions here you go oh yeah this side would be fixed this angle is fixed if you don't know this side length and it could be anything then you could do uh maybe think of a shorter side that would cause an oblique angle sorry an oblique triangle with an obtuse angle or you could have a longer side which would cause an oblique triangle with all acute angles there's two cases there an obtuse triangle and an acute triangle i hope you're seeing that that this side could kind of kind of pivot so our our three cases so far are no triangle it misses a right triangle it's perfect if this side's too long you could get two cases one an obtuse one and a cube now i need you to notice something this only can happen if this side is shorter than this side why because if this side that can make your two options are shorter than this side then you can go ahead and put that down to this missing side and not kind of overrun it you don't have this this case if this side is longer than this side so if it is if the second side is longer than this called first side then you really only have one option if this side's longer then you can't make this obtuse angle come about why because if this side is longer than this side it would go past this side that third side that you don't know that would not cause a right triangle or sorry not cause a triangle because that angle is fixed so there there's really four cases uh you have this no triangle you have a right triangle you have a i could have two options if this side is shorter than that one i have one option if this side is longer than that one now that seems like a lot to remember don't worry about it the law of sines will take care of this for you i really just wanted to go through these so that you would understand why sometimes you get one right triangle and why sometimes you get no triangles why you get sometimes two and sometimes one that's not a right triangle and it really just comes down to if this is too short you can't make a triangle if it's perfect you make a right triangle if this is longer than perfect you could get two if this is longer than this one you only get one that's the reason why and so when the law of sines tells us what we're getting out of that this is this is why you don't have to memorize it which is very nice this will take care of it because sign will show you whether it's possible or not and we're going to get to some examples of course in this video that explain exactly what's going on and i'll be referring to those cases so the only two cases that really work for law of sines are you know two angles in one side or one side and two angles or you know two sides and one angle but the angle is not between them this is when you use law of sines and work itself out you will know whether you have one none or two solutions uh with this case this one will only give you one solution every time so this is easier now what if you had some other instances where you know three things you're trying to find a fourth you could have two sides and one angle between those sides you could have all three sides that are known those would be known three things in asking for a fourth thing these are done with law of cosines we'll also learn how the pythagorean theorem is really a special case of law of cosines how you can know one angle and two sides and it will give you a third one you wait a minute how would that happen well you know one angle and right triangle already you know the 90 degree angle so i hope you're saying in all these cases you need three things to find a fourth you need two angles and a side to find another side you need two sides and an angle to find another side or another angle you need two sides and an angle to find another angle or another side you know all three sides to find angles so you know three things to find a fourth one what we're going to do now is talk about what in the world the law of science is how it works it's a very nice proportion you will understand why you need to know this when we go through it and then we'll practice some examples so provided you have one of these two cases one side two angles or two sides one angle not between them you can use law of sines what in the world does law of sines mean well firstly you're using law of sines on non-right triangles because you have right triangle trigonometry to deal with the rest could you use it on a right triangle yes yeah you really could but you don't need to so law of sine says if you have this this triangle this oblique triangle with our angles a b and c and our opposite sides listed as lowercase letter a lowercase letter b lowercase letter c so abc again the first thing i want to remember is you don't need any sort of law of sines or law of cosines or right triangle trigonometry if you know two angles to find a third because a b and c those angles on a on a flat plane always add up to 180 degrees the interior angle sum of any triangle on a flat surface on this plane is 180 degrees so if you know two angles you can automatically find the third that's really nice don't use law of sines for that just use interior angle sum if you know two angles already so anyhow we have this is pretty important our angles are going to add to 180. what the law of sines does is creates proportions for you and they're really nice it's probably something you'll be able to memorize pretty quickly here's what it says in plain english sine of an angle over its opposite side always equals sine of another angle over its opposite side so all we've got to do is match up on each fraction angle with opposite side so for law of sines that's going to say find sine of angle let's say angle a over its opposite side which is lowercase letter a equals sine of any other angle over its respective opposite side so let's take sine of b these two things are going to be equal sine of a over a equals sine of angle b over side b it's also equal to any other angle over its opposite respective side so sine of angle c over lowercase c this is the law of sines now there's one really common mistake that the students make because they don't quite understand what's going on here they try to use this whole thing at once don't do that this is not meant to do this this is meant to create a proportion all it's saying in plain english is you can create a proportion what's a proportion a proportion is simply two fractions that are set equal to one another so just set two fractions equal not all three because then you can't cross multiply it it's crazy so all it's doing really is creating a proportion for you one fraction equal to another you don't use all three it says find an angle and it's opposite side set it equal to any other angle over its opposite side now here's what i want you to see can you see that because you need to know sorry can you see that because you're setting up a proportion ignore this one for a second you would need to know either two angles and one side cross multiply to find the missing side or two sides and one angle cross multiply to find the missing angle that's exactly what we have here two angles in one side two angles and one side cross multiply finds a missing side you don't need to find the missing angle because of interior angle sum that's why this works how about two sides one angle no two sides and one angle you can cross multiply and figure out the other angle that's that's really nice that's how this worked you don't use all three of them if you just need to find c it's okay it doesn't doesn't really matter what we call these things you'll see that as we're going through that all we're really trying to figure out is do i know an angle and it's opposite side can i relate that to either a missing angle over its known opposite side or a known angle over its missing opposite side and then we just cross multiply it's not a hard process you just need to be able to identify that two angles one side you use this and two sides one angle but the angle is not between them you use this so anyhow we'll see that as we go through some of our examples but long story made short use interior angle somewhere you can use it first it's really nice to do it doesn't cause any error in our problem so the angle we find with it we can use for law of cosines or law of sines with no errors and then really we're just using one proportion you're not using the whole thing at once so let's go ahead and try some examples let's go ahead and practice some so we have i put the loft signs up there again i put the interior angle sum of a triangle up there just so we can have something a reference to let's take a look at these examples let's determine if they fit law of sines if we can solve them and then we'll set up an appropriate proportion and you'll find it's not too bad you'll also find that this case angle angle side or side angle angle is easier than side side angle y this only has one case so if you have this it is easier you're finding a side with law of sines and there's not multiple options for you this one you have four options now we don't need to know what those options are going into the problem but it does cause us more work i'll spend more time on side side angle just because there are those options we'll i'll give you an example of a no solution i'll give an example of a one triangle i'll give you an example of how you have the options of two triangles that are possible here so we'll deal with that one so these are nicer so first let's make sure that it actually fits let's take a look at our triangle in our triangle we're seeing that firstly it's not a right triangle so right triangle trigonometry does not work right there like if you're seeing right triangle trigonometry doesn't work put this in the category of all right i'm dealing with either law of sines or law of cosines we do need to know what works where three sides law of cosines side angle side with the angle between our sides law of cosines anything else that we have we're dealing with law of sines so notice we need to know three things to find a fourth in any triangle right triangles that was included because you have that right angle in there that means you need to know two to find a third because i already knew one so let's see i know an angle an angle and a side oh that's great hey angle angle side or side angle angle that's something i can solve with law of sines so right in my head i'm thinking i'm dealing with law of sines i'm probably going to write this out actually right out of proportion if you're going to deal with law of sines you're going to be dealing with a proportion write that out now i'm going to let that kind of hang on for a second and i'm going to do what i've taught you how to do in all of right triangle trigonometry use non-trigonometry things or i guess it's technically part of trigonometry but use things that are not like law of sines or right triangles or non trigonometry to find missing pieces if you can so if i have side angle angle if i know two angles the very first thing i'm doing besides checking if it's a right triangle is i'm finding that missing angle so if i know that this is 95 degrees and now that i know that that is 45 degrees i'm going to put this as well 180 degrees minus those two angles another thing we might do as we're doing that is start labeling your triangle so i'm going to subtract 180 minus those two angles but it is nice to call them something so here's here's one point though it doesn't matter what you call them they could be angle a b or c it doesn't really matter so just just pick a letter so i'm going to pick a and then after that everything kind of flows into place as far as your sides so if this is angle a let's call this little a i don't care what that angle is let's call this little b or lowercase letter b why because it doesn't matter if this is a b c or a b c for sine law of sines of work all law of sines does is puts sine of two angles and sides opposite them in a proportion so you can cross multiply that's all it does so i've looked at this i said not a right triangle i thought okay what do i have i've got two angles in the side great i know three things what category does it fit it fits law of sines because two angles one side is dealing with law of sines i've written out my proportion i know i'm going to fill this out in a minute i've labeled a triangle using a because there's a missing angle lowercase letter a because it's opposite lowercase letter b because if i wanted to call this angle b that would be the side opposite again it doesn't matter whether that's b or that's b that's c or that c that doesn't matter then i'm going to be using non-trigonometry like law of sines type things to find missing pieces so i can find angle a angle a is just 180 degrees minus 95 minus 45. so already we know that angle a is 40 degrees now here's why that's useful it's because when you find that angle you subtracted you're not compounding air you don't even have any air we know that this is exactly 40 degrees and why that's important is because you can now use it in other formulas without having any error so now we're ready to go we know all three angles and we know one side all right so what do we do now create a proportion whatever side you want to find all we're really looking for is know three things to find a fourth so you need to know two angles and one side that's opposite them what that really means since that's the only side we actually know is we're going to have to create this proportion with an angle over the side we know equals an angle over a side we don't know or an angle over side we don't know that means you're going to be doing two equations here let's go ahead let's solve for lowercase letter a first so all we're doing is creating a proportion we say hey sine of 95 degrees an angle i know over 5 the side opposite that i do know equals sine of either one of these will work use 45 over b or 40 over a i said i'm going to solve for a so i'm going to take side 40 degrees over side a so now that we have that we have sine of 95 degrees over 5 that's an angle i know over side that i know equals sine of 40 degrees over a that would be an angle that i i know over side that i don't i'm going to cross multiply every proportion can be solved like that so let's do it what we're going to end up getting is a times sine of 95 degrees equals 5 times sine of 40 degrees if we divide both sides by sine of 95 degrees this is what's called an exact answer this is the exact length of that side use lowercase letters for your sides that way when you solve them you won't make the mistake and actually call aside an angle or something like that so that's a side length this is the exact amount but it's not super useful in application because we don't really understand how much that is so we're going to approximate you can put this entire expression on your in your calculator if you use parentheses appropriately so most calculators what they do is they would open up a parenthesis around that sign so close that before you start plugging this in put a parenthesis here and then close that one and then press divide or press fraction and it'll make a fraction out of this so i would put parentheses 5 sine and that's an open parenthesis 40 degrees i'm going to close that one close my my numerator press divide or press fraction and then sine 95 degrees make sure your calculator is in degrees we get that a that side is about 3.23 whatever the units are and give you any units here but 3.23 units in this case which is pretty impressive that we can do that now here's what not to do begging you please don't do this please do not try pythagorean theorem with this being 3.23 why not two reasons number one that's not a right triangle so pythagorean theorem will not work secondly that's rounded and so if at all possible we do not want to use rounded values in future math now we're going to come up with some cases that you have to like law of sines sometimes you have to um especially when we have multiple steps in a problem like the last example i'm going to give you but try not to because that compounds your errors so we've looked at it we've said that is angle angle side great find another angle put it in there now you can use that find other other pieces and you you actually had to to find that then create law of sines as a proportion angle you know over side you know equals angle you know over sides you don't then you can cross multiply next find the other side but do not use that in your proportion why well we just talked about it if that has error in it because you round it even says it right there don't use it again so find another proportion that relates an angle you know to a side you you you also know uh equal to an angle you you know over the other side you don't if you know all three angles it's fine you should be able to do this just fine so we're going to put sine of 95 degrees over 5 again equals sine of 45 degrees over b you do not want to use this as your known angle inside because that is not really fully known it's an approximation so we take a look at it again angle i know oversight i know using stuff that was given to me not stuff that i found that i rounded equals angle i know over side i still need to know i want to find so 45 degrees over lowercase letter b so i'm going to double check um yes this is angle and opposite side this is angle and opposite side i'm not using approximations looks really good now we can cross multiply and divide so we've done the work we've cross multiplied we divided i put this in my calculator all at one time just so i don't make a mistake of rounding and using that in future math so i put parentheses here and around my numerator press divide you should end with about 3.55 if you round into the same decimal place so this side is approximately 3.55 that's done we've solved the entire triangle we've all three angles it did not take law of signs to do it we use proportions to figure out the other two sides that's it that's all law of sines does it creates proportions so that you can cross multiply the last thing i'm going to mention what if you were to use this on a right triangle well if you were to use this you would get sine of 90 degrees at some point in your proportion what's sine of 90 degrees it's the same thing as sine of pi over 2 that would give you just one and what would happen is you would create just a right triangle trigonometry equation out of that where you would get sine of an angle instead of sine over sine so it's that's really all it is you could use it with a right triangle it's just assigned to 90 degrees gives you one and eliminates itself from that equation all right let's move on and try another example so i'm going to model my thinking i'm going to move a little bit quicker because we've already kind of experienced this once if you would like to you should probably stop this video and try that on your own see if you can solve that using what what we know about it so here's here's my thought process the first thing i'm looking for is will right triangle trigonometry work can i use sine cosine tangent and make it easy on myself um it doesn't look like it because that's not a right triangle so how do i know it's not a right triangle i'm doing some math kind of quickly in my head realizing that's also not 90 degrees so this is not for sure not a right triangle the the next thing i'm doing is i'm probably thinking what's going to work to solve so i'm looking at this going hey i know two angles and i know one side wait two angles in one side means i can use law of sines for this so in my head i'm thinking law of science the other thing i'm thinking is if i know two angles i'm gonna be able to find a third one so i'm probably gonna label it first and think if this is angle a then that would be lowercase letter a we don't really need to know that right now um if this is angle b then this would be lowercase letter b if that's angle c this would be lowercase letter c it does not matter what you call the angles or the sides because law of sines only works on proportions you just need to know two angles on one side to find a fourth or two sides of one angle to find a fourth piece of information whether it's a side or an angle so that's what i'm thinking i'm thinking not a right triangle i'm thinking i can find that missing angle first i'm going to do that first i've labeled my sides now i'm going to use the interior angle sum i'm going to find that angle because i want to do that in order to use it for law of sines so let's take care of it so we found that angle a is exactly 45 degrees this is not an approximation this is why we can use it in our law of sines and why we want to find it first so i thought what do i need to do first that doesn't use the trigonometry i'm about to use like law of sines love cosines or right triangle trigonometry i found that missing angle now what i'm going to do is look for three things i know and one thing i don't in a proportion so if i'm thinking law of sines i probably am going to write out the proportion law of sines first the proportion that creates then i'm going to put two angles i know over one side i don't because that's exactly the what we the case that we have for law of sines we know two angles you know three we know one side so i'm looking at this thinking hey this is the only side i know so i'm gonna have to use this angle with this side and one proportion i don't know the other sides so i'm gonna take sine of 45 degrees over 3 an angle i know over a side that i know that is opposite equals any other angle over one of the sides that you don't know i'm going to pick sine of 50 degrees over the side opposite it now here's what you can't do don't go sine of 45 degrees over 3 that's great that's an angle over an opposite side equals sine of 50 degrees over b that's not how the law of sines works law of sines takes an angle over its opposite side so as long as you're doing that that should be fine so i've thought sine of 45 degrees go across the triangle that's the opposite side sine of 50 degrees go across the triangle that's the opposite side it's going to be lowercase letter c if we cross multiply and divide which you can do pretty quickly we're going to get c times sine 45 degrees equals 3 times sine 50 degrees and if we divide we get 3 sine 50 degrees over sine 45 degrees and we use our calculator we're going to get an approximation this would be your exact exact solution but that right there well let's see we can put this in parentheses 3 sine 50 degrees in parenthesis again and this parenthesis over sine 45 degrees we get approximately 3.25 units so i'm going to create my proportion but really i'm thinking i've got to use this proportion again because it's the only side i know that is not rounded so sine of 45 degrees over its opposite side equals sine of i want to find this missing side it's only one left and that's its opposite angle so i'm going to take sine of 85 degrees over the side i want to find i'm going to double check uh let's see angle opposite side got it angle opposite side that i don't know got it i'm not using rounded numbers it looks pretty good so we're going to cross multiply and divide remember there's no um there's no two options here you're just finding a side length and there's going to be only one solution that makes that happen it's not a multiple case scenario like the next few examples we're going to deal with so cross multiply and divide we're going to ultimately end up with b equals 3 sine 85 over sine 45 degrees you should really work that out for yourself now we get that b is about 4.23 so we've solved this triangle we used interior angle sum to find the missing angle that was pretty easy and then we're using the proportions that law of sines creates remember you're not using all three of these at once that's not the idea the idea is this will create a proportion for you of either two known angles and one side that you know to find this inside or two known sides you know with one angle you know to find a missing angle what we have done right here so far is we've just used um the two angles we know on the side to find a missing side that's the easier case we're about to get into the case where you're trying to find a missing angle and more options can happen okay let's start another example we're going to take a look at the case where you're not finding just a missing side with law of sines which is what we did the first two examples it's pretty easy at least it's easier we're going to be finding a missing angle with law of sines we need to be really careful about this this is one of those cases where you could have four options now do you need to know which of the four options happens before you go into the problem no that's the beautiful thing about law of sines the sine function will tell you what's possible and what's not possible and so we'll deal with that not a problem so let's take a look at it and see if it even fits our model so i'm looking at triangle i'm thinking i actually don't know if it's a right triangle or not the only thing that i know is i don't know for sure if it's a right triangle so i'm not going to be using a right triangle trigonometry i hope that makes sense like we don't know yet all we do know is that we are given two sides hope you see it and an angle where is that angle that angle is not between those two sides that would have to be here if that angle is between those two sides it would be here so we're going to categorize this can you see that a lot of students would use either law of cosines or law of sines on the wrong thing so we're going to look at this and say hey i really know a side and then a side and then an angle that's not between them that is exactly what this is talking about or an angle in two sides uh in that order that's fine it's just we don't say that because anyway so we know two sides and we know one one angle this is a is a case for a law of sines but i need you know that with this more than one thing can happen and we're going to see that as we go through it so first things first after identify it's not a right triangle or maybe not a right triangle we're not sure about what it is we just have two sides an angle not between it i want to think in my head this is law of sines i might even write down the proportion i might think in my head what do i need in order for this to work i need two angles and one side or i need two sides and one angle hey that's exactly what i'm given from there i'm going to be labeling what else is going on in my triangle so i want to give names to these things i'm about to find so i might call this angle a and this would be lowercase letter a i might call this angle b then this would be lowercase letter b i might call this angle c and this would be lowercase angle c i might do that just to give it some names it does not matter what sides or angles you call them as long as your letters you're using match up so c with c b would be a with a uh that way it's it's a little bit easier to see what's going on you don't you don't want to confuse those letters because a lot of signs really would get confusing then um so that's what i'm doing the next thing i'm doing is i'm seeing if anything besides my law of sines will solve for any of this man i only know one angle and so there's no way for me to find those other two angles without something besides interior angle sum i know two sides but can i use pythagorean theorem to find the third no because i do not know if it's a right triangle so i can't use that we're stuck with law of sines so let's go ahead let's let's figure it out well let's see if i go ahead and i try to find use law of sines i know two sides and i know one angle so i'm going to create a proportion out of one of the things that i already know i know one angle and i know one side opposite to it do you see that that has to be one proportion you you use if not you'd say uh well an angle i don't know over 2 equals an angle i don't know oversight i don't know that's not helpful so you need to know one complete piece of information that's why in both these cases you need to know an angle and one side that's opposite to it we saw in the previous two cases you had to know at least one angle and one side opposite to it now we know one angle one side opposite to it let's create that proportion so angle with opposite side equals well what do i do now i need to have another proportion with only one unknown that means that i'm going to have to use that 2 somehow i can't use that letter c in that letter c because i know neither of those we wouldn't want to do that we want to say sine of 50 degrees over 3 equals sine of angle i don't know oversight i don't know that's also not useful it's too many variables so pick out this relationship that you know one complete proportion and you know half of the other one that's half the other one you either know an angle or a side we dealt with knowing the angle in the last two examples now we're dealing with you know a side so what side do i know i know side two what angle is opposite that side angle b i'm going to double check let's see 50 over 3 so that's one proportion equals i can do sine of b over a known side that's great this leaves me with just one unknown now we're going to cross multiply and we're going to divide so sine of angle b equals 2 sine 50 degrees over 3. this is where some other information has to come about i'm going to tell you exactly what we're going to do before we get there that way it's not a surprise so here's what's going to happen in order to solve for angles man you need inverses do you remember that i hope you remember that in order to solve for b you need to take sine inverse of both sides now i also need you to remember that on a unit circle from 0 to 180 degrees on a unit circle you can get two angles that give you the same y coordinate this is why we get more than one option for side side angle is because sine of an angle or an angle can have two equal y outputs one on one side one another that are both positive that we can use and i'm going to show you that in just a minute so step number one is creating the the proportion correctly we're cross multiplying step number two is after you get there you need sine inverse so that's an old piece of information we need to bring up we're going to solve for b on your calculator you press sign inverse it'll open a parenthesis for you 2 sine 50 degrees close your parentheses divide by 3 and that will all be inside your sine inverse we're going to get about some sort of an angle here notice that this is the exact angle this is what angle b is for short contains all the information about angle b it's just not super useful so i'm going to approximate and we're going to get about 30.7 degrees i'm not going to write that up there because it might be two different triangles it could give us this and here's how to discover what that is so i this is the second piece of information i told you we're going to get to we need to understand that if we have some sort of an angle let's call it theta on a unit circle that angle if it's a positive angle all of our angles are positive on triangles um everything's between 0 and 180 degrees on our on our triangles to create this either acute or obtuse angle it's past 90 degrees so every single angle on our unit circle positive angle is going to give you this y coordinate now with sine remember what sine does this is this is where the old stuff comes back at you is that the sine function on a unit circle gives you out the y coordinate that's what it does on a unit circle this angle would have a positive y coordinate do you see why you see this positive y axis you're going to have a positive y coordinate but you also hopefully remember that there was another case where you could get a positive y coordinate anything in quadrants 1 and 2 sine is positive why because the y coordinate is positive in quadrants one and two so there's another angle that would give you out the exact same value it's the angle that you would reflect now this is great this is okay but i'm talking about this is option one but this one right here is option two i need you to think about what that angle is so this angle is theta and the reflected angle gives you the same exact y output which it does then this angle would be 180 degrees minus that data it's like oh you went too far how much did you go too far i went too far theta so going to 180 degrees minus theta that will give you the other option for a side side angle uh law of sines proportion so i'm going to take this 30.7 degrees and what i'm going to do is i'm going to subtract 180 minus 30.7 we'll go through it one more time with you this angle 30.7 degrees will have a y coordinate 180 degrees minus 30.7 will have exactly the same y coordinate on a unit circle so therefore sine of 30.7 and sine of 180 minus 30.7 will be identical what that means is that this angle could be one of two things provided it makes a triangle for so we're about to find that out i'm going to call this option one for b i'm going to call this option two for b option one is that we have 30.7 degrees option two because of what i've just explained to you because angles positive or 180 minus that angle will give you the same y coordinate then this can be 180 minus 30.7 well that's 149.3 degrees now how in the world do we know if those are both options or only one of them works or or if none of them works look at your triangle look at your triangle and plug it in if this option 1 gives you 30.7 is there enough left over in your triangle to create an angle that adds up to 180 yes yes there is you go yeah if this is 50 and this is 30.7 there's enough in 180 degrees to subtract both of those and still be left with an angle think about 149.3 degrees option two try that here try option 2 and b 50 plus 149.3 degrees that's like 199.3 wait a minute all of our triangles can have at most and exactly 180 degrees so if you go over that you have a problem that is how you determine whether or not there's two triangles or only one i'm going to go through that again because it can be confusing the first time you hear it we take a look at this and go hey if i plug that angle in here there's enough left over for me to still have an angle if i plug this angle here there's not enough in the interior angle sum for me to still have that angle therefore there's only one option that actually works if that doesn't work and you keep on going watch what will happen even if this is a god that doesn't make sense watch what would happen if you keep on going let's try to find angle c if this is 30.7 degrees then i would take angle c angle c would be 180 sure interior angle 7 is 180 minus 50 minus 30.7 would that leave me with anything well let's see angle c would be 99.3 degrees okay that seems pretty reasonable because 99.3 or about there i should use the equal signs that are approximated why well because this is approximated you can't use an approximate angle and somehow get an exact angle so let's see if this works if this is about 30.7 degrees rounded and this is 99.3 degrees and this is 50 that still adds to 180. that's great that's that's exactly what i want check out if option 2 were put in there if option 2 were put in there at 149.3 and you tried to find angle c we'd have angle c would be 180 degrees minus 50 minus 149.3 and we would get angle c as about negative 19.3 degrees and go wait a minute does that hey that's exactly what we talked about when i said does that work and we plugged it in we got 1 99.3 that's 19.3 degrees over 180 that's going to show up here so if you ever get a negative angle your triangles can't have negative angles not a real triangle that we're talking about right now all of your angles are between 0 and 180 degrees all of your angles have to be positive so if we break any of those things then this option is not possible this is how we determine whether we have one solution two solutions or no solutions so when we're going through this you do have to think about your options here with the angles that you're finding so find your first angle let me start let me kind of go back a little bit if you are talking about side set angle find your first angle give it both options using what you know about the sine function that sine of an angle and sine of 180 degrees minus that angle that's all you have to do to subtract 180 minus your angle will give you two options check both how do you check both just use interior angle sum so use option one if it gives you a valid angle you're good use option two if it gives you a valid angle you're good if it doesn't then that's not possible which means that this angle is wrong too this is not an option for you what if it gives you no possible angles then there's no solution and that's exactly how we go through the cases you don't need to know all four of them it will work out in your sine function so which is the valid case well not option two so this one worked but this one does not work so i'm gonna yeah this this isn't right for us so we only have one option here if we had two options it causes you a lot more work because it says there's two triangles here you have to use that to figure out your missing sides from those two triangles so i know for right here that this is 99.3 degrees for angle c because our only option for angle b was 37 30.7 degrees so we figured out both of our angles that's typically what we do when we're using law of sines for side side angle is you find your first angle why because you have to you can't find a side first why not if you only know one angle and two sides you can't find a missing side you have to find another angle first in fact you had to find that angle first that angle gave you two options option one or option two only option one was valid because option two came up with something that was a contradiction you cannot have a negative angle in a triangle so we only had one option if you had had two options you'd be drawing another triangle right now you'd be saying okay i have one that's 30.7 i have another one that is whatever it is 149.3 if that had worked and then you would use that to find the last remaining side so you could have more work on this now that we only have one option we know that's about 34.7 we know that's about 99.3 we're going to find the missing side now what i've said this whole time is avoid using rounded numbers if at all possible in this case it's not possible to avoid to to avoid using those rounded numbers you're going to have to use one of these two angles which one it doesn't matter which angle you you actually are forced to use they're both going to be equally rounded so it doesn't really super matter um so we have to use this at some point to find that missing side that's okay it's just something that that we're dealt with so let's set up the law of signs again what law of sine says is a if you know uh two angles and a side you can find a missing side i do know two angles and a side now here's what what i won't do i won't use too many rounded numbers but i can avoid it so what that means is i probably am not going to go sine 30.7 over 2 equals sine 99.3 over c why because that's rounded and that's rounded avoid using rounded numbers as much as possible use the things that you're given if you can so i'm certainly going to say sine of 50 degrees over 3 because both of those are given and they're not rounded equals sine of angle i know over opposite side that i want to find so 99.3 degrees over c i'm going to double check stuff i know this is opposite things i want to know over an opposite angle that looks pretty good i'm going to cross multiply and divide so at this point this is exactly like the first k first examples i gave you where you knew two angles and one side now you know two angles in one side so it's kind of simplified the case for you so cross multiply and we're going to divide i hope you're seeing also that while we want to avoid using rounded numbers as much as we can we actually did that we avoided using that rounded thing in lieu of using this one sometimes it is not avoidable with law signs because you had to find that angle to find that side and that's rounded that's approximated so c is going to be 3 sine 99.3 over sine of 50. that's about 3.86 whatever units those are last little bit to ch sort of check your work um not prove that you're right not find mistakes but at least that you haven't you haven't made one is that bigger angles open to bigger sides so 99.3 degrees should open to the biggest side because that's the biggest angle it does uh 30.7 should open to the smallest side because the smallest angle it does and that should be right between them so that's a great way to check your work it's why i draw a triangle the last one is hopefully it's obvious these two not have to be to scale um they don't have to represent the correct angle 99.3 is over 90 degrees it's an obtuse angle it's just a way for us to get a picture down so we can we can visualize it so it doesn't have to be perfect man i hope that's made sense i hope that you're seeing that while this one is pretty easy because you're just finding a missing side and there's no options this one can be a little tougher we really have to know what we're doing and it relies on your knowledge of what sine function does on a unit circle so when you find an angle you need to have two options and we're going to do that with this the law of sines so we have our two options we go through both of them if they both work you have twice the work you have to do more work here set up two triangles if you don't or at least draw write this twice it's fine you can erase it if you if you don't have two options then it will show with just some logic you're gonna get a negative angle somewhere it will show that you don't if you have two cases that they don't work both of them don't work then you have no solution so let's keep on going i'm going to show you next the case where you have two triangles that are possible all right let's go ahead and try another one so we're taking a look at our triangle we notice that it's not specifically telling it's a right triangle we don't know really what it is so we're not using right triangle trigonometry we're taking a look at it then are we in the case where we have law of sines are we in the case where law of cosines look at what you're given i'm given two sides i'm given an angle that's not between them also one thing i want to say a lot of textbooks will in in your homework or your practice or whatever they'll give you a triangle with a b c and a b c as angles and sides and it'll say hey do this if little a is this and little b is this and angle c or whatever is is this um when they do that they're just drawing a triangle like i'm doing you just have to do it yourself because they probably don't want to waste space or something i don't know so that that could happen just draw your triangle make sure you have the angles and sides in the correct relationship so i'm looking at this thinking i'm going to be using law of sines or cosines i see that i know two sides and an angle not between them that's going to give you law of sines also in my head right now i'm thinking i'm probably going to have two options coming out of this i definitely have options maybe both of them work maybe one of them works maybe none of them work but i'm certainly going to have two options in finding that first angle so i'm thinking law of sines i'm thinking side side angle i'm going to have to find an angle first i hope you see why you can't find a side first here there's not enough information to do that so i know i'm finding an angle first i might label it i'm thinking lot of signs i might write down the proportion sign over side equals sign over side but ultimately what i'm going to look at is let's start labeling these i might label this angle a in which case the opposite side would be lowercase letter a maybe this is angle b over lowercase letter b and this would be angle c over lowercase letter c you don't have to write the b and the c you can if you want to it doesn't really matter but you need to label the things that you you don't know and label them with the letters matching opposite so a with a c with c b with b if we know two sides we are only missing one side but we're probably missing other two angles so what can we do what can't we do you can't use pythagorean theorem we can't use right triangle trigonometry because we're not sure and we also can't use interior angle sum of a triangle which means that we have to use law of sines or in other cases law of cosines first it also means that we're going to have to use some rounded values in future math but we're going to avoid using too many if we can so i know that this is going to be law of sines i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to set up my proportion okay what's that mean i'm going to have to set up one fraction with things that i fully know so an angle over a side law of sines requires that you have to know at least one full relationship an angle and its opposite side now i know that i know 40 degrees and two perfect now to find a missing angle you need to know another side well we do that's what side side angle tells you you would know a side and an angle those will be at some point opposite one another and you would know one more side but not an angle opposite so i know this side this is going to set up with finding angle c notice right now there is absolutely no way for us to find angle a angle a over a would not would not create something where you know three parts to find a fourth we do not know interior angle sum so there's no way to do that right now you're forced to find angle c well it's kind of nice it eliminates options but then it creates more by finding that angle so sine of angle c over three i'm gonna double check hey 40 degrees side opposite got it sine c of side opposite that i know i got it so at this point we're just going to cross multiply we're going to divide we want to make sure that we're not dividing both sides by sine c because you're trying to solve for the angle c so we're trying to eliminate everything around that angle so divide by two and hopefully remember that if you have an angle so sine of an angle equals some sort of relationship that that angle is sine inverse of that relationship so our angle c is sine inverse of all this stuff or takes sine inverse of both sides so angle c is exactly sine inverse of all of that stuff use your calculator approximate it so c is about 74.6 degrees now it's time to think if you just found this angle and you used sine to do it remember that sine has two options to give you out the same value on a unit circle you could have one angle positive angle or 180 degrees minus that angle it would give you the same thing it's kind of like taking a square root of a number you do a positive and a negative you go hey because x squared will square both 2 and negative 2 to give me 4 then both of those are solutions because sine of two angles gives me out the same value they both would have to be solutions here now how do you find it it's it's really right here your angle or 180 degrees minus your angle will give you out the same value according to the sine function they're both giving you out the same exact output and therefore they would both be possible solutions so we think through if c is 74.6 degrees then 180 degrees 74.6 180 degrees minus 74.6 degrees would be the same thing according to our sine function now are both of those valid this is the time that we check we really have to think about it imagine that c is 74.6 is that going to leave you enough in your interior angle sum to develop another angle yeah it appears so 40 plus 74.6 isn't 180 yet that leaves you enough for to complete the interior angle zone check option two plug in 105. if this were 105.4 degrees and that's 40 degrees still would that leave you enough to add up to 180 and allow room for the angle yes this is the case where you actually have two solutions so both of these are valid for interior angle sum it will work out if you just do interior angle sum right now it'll show you you'll get no negative angles so the last example when we did it option two gave us a negative angle it was this impasse like you got to that's not possible perfect well try everything until it actually shows you whether it's possible or not so all we've done is say hey sine functions give you these two angles out that have the same y value on a unit circle so sine of 70 sine of 74.6 degrees would give you this out or sine of 105.4 degrees would give you this this thing out either the angle or 180 minus the angle now walk through and see if interior angle sum that's what you're using is valid for both of these so option one if option one is 74.6 degrees then angle a would be approximately 65.4 degrees that makes sense that's not a negative angle that doesn't ruin our interior angle sum so i would put that down could you now go and use this information to find lowercase letter a absolutely so this you'd have to use a rounded number but you'd use sine of 40 degrees over 2 equals sine of 65.4 degrees over the last remaining side that you need to find what about this information option two option two would be take the angle 105.4 degrees think about this as that you might want to draw another triangle here option two if option two is the case and we've drawn another triangle then angle a would equal about 34.6 degrees that's also valid so we haven't run into anything that says this isn't possible we've used sine to give us two outputs and both of those outputs create triangles for us this if this if these angles are positive still and they're not negative once you've used interior angles if there's enough to create triangles with both of these angles you have two triangles available notice how you don't need to know the outcome before you start you just you really really need to give two different angles using 180 minus the angles you find that's pretty important so once we do that if we have it run into an impasse this is right this is right they're both positive i'm going to make this 34.6 degrees and now we're able to find our missing sides for both of those triangles this is why it requires more work is because now you got to go all right i can take sine of 40 over 2 equals sine of 65.4 degrees over lowercase letter a or i can take sine of 40 over 2 equals sine of 34.6 degrees over lowercase letter a i'll give you two options because there are two triangles a shorter one and a larger one this is exactly what's happening okay so i've drawn two triangles just to make it easier for my brain you don't necessarily have to but i think it's a really good idea that way i can double check for option one our first triangle i want to use given information over using um these rounded things so i'm using sine 40 over two i got it equal sign 65.4 over a i can't avoid using this rounded thing but i want to avoid using that one at the same time so use only one if you can so sine 40 over 2 that's given over sine 65.4 over a that's rounded but it's the least amount of round information i can use um i'd solve for a in that case option 2 says use sine 40 over 2 still equals sine 34.6 over a that will solve for the second option my other missing side on my my last or my my option two triangle so a is about two point eight three or one point seven seven for those two options uh you should work both out we're just cross multiplying dividing and rounding cross multiplying dividing and rounding and i'm going to put this up there just to make sure that larger angles are opening to larger sides so 2.83 and 1.77 a double check it looks like wow all three of my angles add to 180 all three of my angles out of 180 haven't broken the interior angle sum that's what tells you whether you have one option two options or no options it appears that that my larger angles are opening to my larger sides smaller angles of smaller sides that looks really good so i've used that to check my work not to tell me whether i've made a numerical mistake but at least i haven't made a proportion mistake i hope that makes sense it's the hardest one understanding that when you find sign you have two outcomes that will satisfy this that sign of an angle then which one works or if both of them works is a matter of interior anglosome so check that out hope that makes sense i'm going to come back with one more example before an application about what happens if you get no solution all right let's move on to another example i know already ruined the suspense for you and told you there's no solution but let's see why that is you're actually going to really like this case uh once you understand it you're going to really like this case you're going to think give me 30 of these because you don't have to do any more work with it it's kind of nice so let's go through the whole process i'm going to model my thinking one more time just to make sure that you see this right exactly how i want you to uh the first thing that we do is we see what works for for what we're given if we have a right triangle and you know it's a right triangle then you're using right triangle trigonometry if you know that you have two angles given you're using interior angle sum we don't need to touch law of sines until that happens so we're looking at this thinking yeah it's not a right triangle i'm thinking uh that's not right triangle trigonometry i'm seeing two sides in one angle that i'm given that means i can't use interior angle sum to find a third so i'm really just left with the the side side angle and that means i'm using law of sines if i would have had an angle here and not here that would be law of cosines it's the next thing we're going to talk about so i'm seeing side side angle or angle side side i'm seeing two sides and angles not between them this is law of sine so in my head i'm thinking that i might go ahead and label this so if this is let's say b and c then that would be side lowercase literacy opposite it after that i'm really just focused on doing the law of sines so i'm going to set up my proportion law of sines works by taking one proportion of things you already know with a mixed proportion of one thing you know one thing you don't um if you have two sides that means that you're going to have sine of an angle that you know over sine of a side that you know so 60 degrees over its opposite side which would be 4 equals sine of i need to have one proportion of something that i actually know i cannot do sine of c over c because i know neither of those things i have to choose sine of b over a side that i know you need to know three things to find a fourth and that works i'm going to double check sine of 60 degrees over a side that's opposite it those are both known equals sine of b over a side that is known that's an opposite side and it's a side that's known so i know three things i'm going to find that fourth if we cross multiply we get four times sine b equals five times sine 60 degrees now we're going to solve for angle b so let's divide by 4. and then we're going to take sine inverse i want you to notice something this is precisely what we've done for the last two examples we noticed it wasn't a right triangle we labeled stuff we saw we had two sides and one angle that's not between us so we chose law of sines we set up a proportion and then we solved we solved for that angle in the first case we had one option that worked and one option that didn't in the second case we had both options that worked and we had to form two triangles and solve them and in this case let's try to solve for angle b we're still going to use sine inverse it's still the same process it's what happens next that determines what you do if you have two angles that both work two triangles if you have one angle that works one triangle if you have no angles at work no triangles so let's find angle b and so we have this sine inverse of 5 sine 60 degrees over 4. so you take your calculator up and you plug it in you go sign inverse and you do your parentheses 5 sine 60 end parenthesis divide it by 4 and it goes error what do you mean error stupid calculator why would you give me error it's because this isn't possible so if you get error here you're done why but why are you done i want you to go back one step i want you to go back one step and figure out what this is do it on your own right now do five times side 60 and parenthesis divide by four and it gives you 1.082 something something something 1.08 something now think oh man i hope you remember what is the range of sign like you plug in anything the domain of signs all real numbers you plug in anything you want but what's the range of sign the range of sign is negative one to one and since we're only focused on zero to 180 degrees the range of this particular sign because we can't have negatives for our our sine values here is just zero to one you will not get out anything if you plug in a number to sign besides negative one to one in our case zero to one so wait a second and that that by the way is because we don't have negative angles and all of our angles are between zero and one eighty so you can only get out zero to one so look what's happening this says sine of your angle is 1.08 when you plug in this angle sine of this angle is over one that can't happen side can give you a maximum of one so this is breaking the range this is not possible for side even give you so this angle is impossible there is no angle that you can plug in take side of it and it gives you what you need to complete this this picture this is an impossible picture to complete where does it show up if you don't do this first it's going to show up right here as an error now double check your work make sure that you've done everything right 64 b 5 cool so i've done this i have i haven't misplaced anything i've solved it i've done sine inverse i make sure my calculator is plugged in correctly this still gives me an error that means that this is more than one that means that this angle is impossible there is no solution here so what that says is that no matter what you do you cannot put an angle here that makes this triangle possible it's not possible to do and so we have a no solution this is the case for side side angle that none is possible so i've given you no triangle i've given you exactly one triangle and i've given you two triangles are possible what about the exactly 190 degrees that will show up in the one triangle case so that'll show up as oh yes you have just one possible and it turns out the other angle is 90 degrees so that'll work there as well so we're going to do now hopefully that makes sense we're going to come back with one application and then be done okay last one so a lot of times you're given this type of a problem in a right triangle trigonometry section i i actually gave you one in a video that said suppose that you are standing a certain distance away from let's call it a volcano and you measure 47 degrees yay and i am a certain distance away from the center of that volcano how in the world you supposed to know how far away you are from the center of volcano i said maybe you look at like the google earth thing and you you measure out like distance wise how far you are but that takes a lot of technology to do that so what if you're not able to do that what if you have no idea how far away this is from where you're standing could you still figure out an approximation for the height the answer is yeah so suppose you did this suppose that you stood at this point you don't know how far away this is but you measure by looking up maybe a clinometer or something like that that this is 47 degrees that you're looking up at the top of this angle elevation top of the volcano is 47 degrees you say hey there's something i can do though without knowing this distance but knowing that i can stand back a certain distance further 900 feet 900 meters whatever this is 900 meters in this case and measure the angle again now that's physically possible to do you could stand at one location measure stand a known distance away and measure that angle again and find out the height of this this object so we're going to it's a two-step process we're going to do we're going to use this information to figure out one of these distances and then use a right triangle to figure out the height that is going to be possible to do with some right triangle trigonometry but we'd have to know one of these sides first so let's think about how we can do that what do we know so far we know that this angle is 35 we know that this angle is 47 we know that this is 900 that's all we know however if we think about just this triangle could you find that angle yeah because that's a that's a straight angle that's 180 degrees this would be 180 minus 47 degrees would leave you with 133 degrees now we're left with that triangle what does that triangle tell you well you know two angles and a side that is law of sines so let's go through the two angles and one side that we have used before in a couple examples the first two examples to figure out either this side or this side which one it it doesn't matter if you figure out this side then in a moment we'll be using a right triangle with one side known one angle known and you can use sine to figure the height if you choose to find this side which i'm going to do you have one angle known one side known and you can use that to figure out your height either way actually works but the important point here is that you know two angles and you know one side you're thinking law of sines and when we have two angles before we even use our law of sines let's find this missing angle as we did every time hope you remember the first two examples you have to find this angle why because this angle relates to the only known side that's opposite to it that's going to be 12 degrees so 180 minus 35 minus 133 gives us 12 degrees because we know that let's label some other pieces to this maybe that's um that's angle a and little a this is angle c and little c this is angle 12 and 900 so we don't need letters for that and you have your choice i'm not asking you to find both of those missing sides really just one of them because it's all it's going to take to find the height i'm going to choose to find a lowercase letter c as a side so because we know that this is law of sines let's set a proportion of what law of sines does for the last time is takes sine of angle over opposite side equals sine of any other angle over its opposite side now you do have to use a known proportion so i need to use sine of 12 degrees over 900. that's why it's so important to use the interior angle sum before you do law of sines with the angle side angle is because uh you have to have a known proportion equals sine of another known angle remember you will know all three if you have two angles in one side so a sine of another angle over the side you want to find in this case i want to find side c you do with either one i want c i'm going to double check angle i know over side i know that's opposite angle i know over side i want to find that's opposite looks good to me we're going to cross multiply and we're going to divide we're going to end up getting c times sine 12 degrees equals 900 sine 133 if we divide by sine 12 we get 900 sine 133 degrees over sine 12 degrees there's no two outcomes here we're not dealing with finding an angle so this is the side length that we're getting that's the exact side length actually when we approximate it we round it and there comes the um the error in it and it's okay it's it's a little more usable uh for our pythagorean theorem we're gonna actually have to use that rounded number so we try to avoid rounding any time we we can and this would be exact but to use it later on for to make our math a little bit nicer easier we're going to round this and say that this is about 3165.86 meters now what did we just find this is why we drew the the triangle the way we did so we could identify that this is this side right here so that's 3165.86 meters approximately that also means that this side is 3165 point meters and we're almost done you see now that we know this we used 47 degrees for only one purpose really to find that angle we already knew this was 900 so we found this missing side could you have found this missing side yes but in either case you would have gone you now have this right triangle you have either 35 degrees a height that you want to find and a hypotenuse oh it's a right triangle hypotenuse that you know we can use right triangle trigonometry with the sine function to figure that out or if you would have found this side you would have a hypotenuse that you know you'd have a height that you want to find and 47 degrees an angle that you know you can again use the sine function but you use a different angle and consequently a different hypotenuse either way now i can't do that one because i don't know that side i know this side this hypotenuse so i'm going to label this as hey what's the angle that i'm given that angle from that angle label your hypotenuse your opposite and your adjacent all right well what do i know what do i what do i not want to find don't really care about in our case having gone from the angle that i know and the side that i just found which was our hypotenuse i really don't care about the adjacent side all i'm really looking for is the opposite and i've been given the hypotenuse so adjacent is something i'm really not concerned about this says you will be using sine sine of what sine of the angle that you just referenced which is 35 degrees why why that one why not 47 is because you found the hypotenuse for that triangle the one that had 35 degrees in it so sine of 35 degrees equals opposite i don't know if it is height over hypotenuse which is 3165.68 meters keep in mind we try to avoid using rounded numbers if at all possible but in this case it's really not avoidable unless you want to plug in that entire thing now you could do that you absolutely could but it just makes our mouth look pretty really nasty um anyway it's it's your your choice here i'm rounding and using that because that is that's what i i chose to do based on the kind of necessity of not using all that all that junk at one time you could but it's your option so we're going to multiply both sides by 3165.86 if we do that if we approximate we're going to have 1815.86 meters and you're going to look at that and you're going to say yeah but remember what you've done you have a height to you and your face is probably not on the ground looking up at that volcano sort of explodes and your face is on the ground it's getting burned so you're looking up from a height of well for me it's about two meters so i would have to know what that height is and add that to it so i'm going to add 2 and so we get 1817.86 meters don't forget to add your height if you don't do that you'd have to find an angle of depression and do more trigonometry which is kind of a bummer it's easier just to add your height to height to your eyes to that so here's what i hope i hope that have explained the law of signs in a way that makes sense i hope that you understand that the knowing two angles in the side you're just finding the missing side with law of sines it's pretty it's a little bit easier with the knowing two sides and an angle not between them you have that two options that you really need to get because sine will give you out sine of two angles would give you out the same exact y value the circle creates two options for you so work your way through that i hope it's made sense if i'll explain in a way that you understand hope you're doing well and i'll see you for the next video on law of cosines have a great day 

Transcript for: How to Use the Law of Cosines in Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 33)
welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the law of cosines we just finished talking about the law of sines but there was two cases that the law of sines did not work for for these uh these oblique triangles and they were cases three and four so law of cosines does we'll talk about why it does we'll talk about why law of sines doesn't work i'll tell you exactly what law of cosines looks like and how to work with it it is quite a bit more straightforward than law of sines because there are are not two cases that can work like these uh side side angle that we saw with law of sines so what law of cosines does working with these oblique triangles like we know it does it will solve your triangle for you if you know two sides and the angle between them so the sides are adjacent to the angle or if you know all three sides of triangle it will solve the rest of it for you so we're going to take a look first at this what the law of cosine says how to apply it to two sides of the angle between why why law of sines will not work for that and then um all three sides and y law of sines won't work for that so here's what the law of cosines says if you have a triangle and you don't know if it's a right triangle or not what law of cosines really talks about is a way to to compare an equation two sides and an angle between them with another side here's how it looks the law of cosines says a side squared is always equal to the other two sides squared and added so the sum of the other two sides squared minus twice the product of those sides and the cosine of the angle between them now that sounds like a lot that is a lot but i want you to notice a couple things about this this is a side this is the angle opposite that side this is the angle between these two sides so when you're setting this up you look for an angle that you know if you don't know an angle you're solving for an angle so you identify the angle you want to know just like you've done every other time identify the angle you want to know or the angle that you have and the side opposite is the one that you need to find why well because this works for side angle side this works for you know two sides and you're missing a third so naturally you want to find that third side well you need to know the angle between these two sides to do that this side is found by knowing these two sides boom boom boom boom and the angle between them right there that's exactly what that is talking about you know two sides an angle between them therefore you're able to find that side now what do you do after that you find the angles because you'll know all three sides you can find the angles after that now of course what if we're not just looking for side c what if we're looking for side a or b so there's three kind of permutations of this rearrangements that we can deal with if you wanted to find side b well then b squared would equal the sum of the squares of the other two sides minus twice the product of those sides and cosine of the angle between them if you remember that you don't have to remember the formulas as much just remember that this side and this angle are opposites and the rest of the stuff are the sides that you already know what if you're trying to find side a well then a squared is going to be the sum of the other two sides squared minus twice the product of those sides and cosine of the angle between them this is opposite that angle these sides you would know this is what the law of cosine says one more thing i want to mention is that if you know all three sides then you're solving for an angle because why would you want to solve for a side you already know it so this really only works in two cases if you know two sides and an angle between why because that allows you to set up this with all the information uh law of sines would not do that we'll see that in our very first example if you have all three sides then we'll be solving these four angles i'm going to give that to you right now as sort of an aside so if you were to solve this for cosine c cosine b and cosine a it would give you three different formulas how we're just going to subtract these two subtract these two and divide by this or you can think add this subtract your c squared and divide by two a b either way you go you'll end up with a different equation the other thing the last thing this is quite important i want you to see what would happen if that angle was 90 degrees think about this if that angle was 90 degrees do you remember what cosine of 90 degrees is do you remember cosine of pi over 2 it's zero if that's 90 degrees this part is zero this part is zero now think about this if that's 90 degrees what's the side opposite 90 degrees it would be a hypotenuse this would be a right triangle and you would get a squared plus b squared equals the hypotenuse squared if this angle was 90 degrees cosine of the angle 0 it zeros the whole thing out pythagorean theorem is a special case of the law of cosines if you have one of these angles 90 degrees and you have pythagorean theorem what if this angle is 90 degrees well then that would be the hypotenuse if this is 90 degrees this is zero that's a hypotenuse a squared plus c squared equals the hypotenuse squared it works it's just a special case so i'm going to solve these for you all i'm going to be doing is honestly i'm going to be adding this to both sides subtracting c squared and dividing by 2 a b and so you could use this to find your angles of course we plug all this in and then take cosine inverse of both sides to find find a missing angle this is typically the process we go through so i'm going to explain to you so there's no surprises if you have a side angle side yes you're using law of cosines we're going to find out that law of sines will not work you find the side you're missing first and then you find another angle second how do you do that you use either this if you have all three sides then naturally you're gonna be finding an angle and you'd have to use one of these so that's why i'm giving it to you that's why we're gonna practice it just to make sure that we're seeing it all right let's take a look at an example we got this triangle we know two sides and one angle now this is why it was so important to understand law of sines and the difference in law of cosines law of sines says you know two sides like we do and an angle but in law of sines the angle is not between those sides while cosines it is so which one is this we have a side then an angle then a side this is a law of cosines it's two sides with an angle between so in my head right now i'm thinking number one this is not a right triangle do you remember that like if we the first thing we do when we look at is think is this a right triangle um it's not or at least it's not telling me that it is so i cannot use right triangle trigonometry i'm looking at it and thinking okay let's categorize it uh this looks like it's a law of cosines because there's a side two sides in the angle that's not between them also i'm looking can i use anything outside of law of sines loft cosines trigonometry to solve for a missing side or angle you cannot please do not use pythagorean theorem you're not sure if that's a right triangle or not it's not you cannot use pythagorean theorem to solve for that side unless you are absolutely certain that you're dealing with the right triangle we can't use interior angle sum those are the two things we normally want to do before trying our trigonometry type stuff is pythagorean theorem it won't work uh anterior angle sum it won't work because we don't have enough information so we said right triangle no it's off the table what's it fit better law of sines law of cosines looks like law of cosines i don't have anything else i can fill out let's start labeling this triangle now so i'm going to call this side there's angle a and so this would be side a lowercase a let's call this angle b this would be lowercase v i'm i'm going to write that now just so that we can follow our formula if you're more of a formula type person it helps to label all of your sides and all of your angles so you can just plug it in if not if you're more of a concept person like like i am you don't really have to label a lot of this just the things you're missing and so this would be angle c and of course the opposite side of that would be lowercase letter c now because we already know that law of cosines is going to work we can follow one of these formulas but keep in mind what you need to do there's no way to solve for an angle right now you can't do it you don't have enough information if we tried we would only know two sides we'd only know one angle so we can't find another one of these angles because we'd be missing too much also notice notice why the law of sines does not work remember what law of sines does it takes one completed proportion a fraction and sets it equal to kind of half of a completed fraction in a proportion notice that we don't have that we don't have one complete fraction we have an angle with a missing side we have a missing angle with the side or missing angle with the side we'd have two pieces of information and we're asking for two more you can't do it you need to know three things in order to find a fourth thing with law of sines we'd have an angle over a oh man that's not completed a side over that's not completed or a side over that's not completed law of sines fails because of that that's why we had the side side angle working for law so cosine i love signs but side angle side the angles between them this is where law of cosine shines is because it works here law of sines doesn't i hope you see that i hope you see why it doesn't because our one of our our fractions in our proportion would not be completed we we can't complete either of them so it fails so what do we do well because you can't solve for an angle right now no notice if you tried to solve for let's say angle b you would need to know a and c we don't know a we can't solve for that angle if you want to solve for angle c we need to know a and b we don't know a therefore you can't solve for the angle so in order to solve for the angle you need to know the sides that are next to it that's what this is really saying you need to know the sides that are next to that in order to solve for that particular angle so our first step would be let's solve for this side that's opposite the angle that i know that's what this is going to let us do so when you deal with law of law of cosines and you have side angle side you're solving for this side first now if you're more formula oriented you've labeled everything then this is going to drive what formula you use you look at this and go i know my b i know my c i'm missing my side a i'm missing this you're going to use this one and then you fill out all of your information from that formula if you're more of a concept person like i am we write down the side that we're missing we think this is basically like pythagorean theorem it's just i have an angle between the two sides that i know and so what i'm going to do is i'm going to say okay a squared is going to equal 3 squared plus 4 squared the other two sides it doesn't matter the order in which you put those by the way i know i might be out of order here it doesn't matter addition's commutative and multiplication is commutative it doesn't matter what does matter is matching up this side with cosine of the angle opposite it so i'm missing side whatever it is a i have 3 squared plus 4 squared great great i'm going to subtract 2 times their product and then cosine of the angle between them if it's the angle between them that angle is opposite the side you want to know so this and this angle are always opposite in law of cosines so this and this angle so i'm going to put cosine of 30 degrees i'm going to double check uh side i want to know equals sum of the other two sides squared great i've squared the set i want want to know minus 2 times their product i've done that and cosine of angle between them which is also the angle opposite the side we want to know because of the side angle side that we've we've come up with and now we're just going to do all the work so this gives us 25 minus 24 cosine 30 degrees begging do not subtract those very common if you're going really fast you're stressed out about a test to accidentally subtract those that's not what we're doing this has a product with it and order of operation says you do multiplication before you do addition subtraction so you need to know that first so cosine of 30 degrees that's like square root 3 over 2. for us we can use our calculator and approximate this but if you're going to approximate it take a square root of both sides and put the square root around the whole thing put this in your calculator what not to do don't figure this out then round it then take square root of a rounded number because you're going to be compounding your error so do all the math first let your calculator do the work for you a equals this thing this is the exact amount like this is exactly how long that side is with that angle and these other two sides that's great but it's not as usable as we like so we'll approximate it and we get approximately 2.05 units whatever that is so we've used law of cosines we found out our missing side now what well there's only one more thing we have to find and then we'll use interior angle sum to find the last angle we have to find an angle how we do this is up to you whether you want to use law of cosines or whether you want to use law of sines oh man check this out the one piece of information that was missing for us to use law of sines was that side if we had known that side at the beginning we would have taken sine of an angle over its known opposite equals sine of an angle over its known opposite that would have caused a law of sine situation we could have solved very easily for that angle yeah we would have had two cases that's that's true we don't have that here we won't have that for a law of cosines but at this point you could certainly do law of sines right now you could do law sine of 30 degrees over 2.05 equals sine of c over 3 and you could figure out sine angle c you could do the same thing for angle b that's very very possible on the other hand if you don't like that you don't want to deal with the law of sines again you could use the law of cosines to find a missing angle we just have to really remember that when we're solving for an angle you're you're really using these formulas so if we want to solve for let's say angle c we need to use cosine of angle c uh and what that does is that takes the sides that are adjacent to angle c the opposite side divides them by the product of the sides adjacent so this angle is between those two sides that you know also notice one other thing whether you use law of sines or whether you use law of cosines we can't avoid using this approximation in our math we could if we wanted to use this whole thing it gets really messy but typically we are using an approximation here so i'm going to use the law of cosines i'm going to find angle c so in my head i'm thinking if i want to find angle c it's going to use the adjacent sides and subtract the opposite side squared and divide by the product of 2 times the product of the adjacent sides so cosine of c here's angle c this is what i'm finding i'm going to maybe make a reference here i'm going to square my sides adjacent subtract my side opposite squared and divide by the product of 2 times my adjacent sides that's about it so this is going to give us cosine of c if we want to find what c is we need to take cosine inverse of both sides me personally i would plug all of this in at one time in my calculator i would say that c is cosine inverse of all of this stuff and i would do it just like that i would do cosine inverse put a parenthesis um put a large parenthesis for my numerator here and here plug in my 2.05 squared plus 4 squared minus 3 squared in parenthesis fraction or divide and then put in 2 in parentheses here as well 2 times 2.05 times 4. that way i'm not i'm not doing things like oh round this and write it down then add this and subtract 9 and then write it down and then divide by this written down rounded because you just compound a lot of errors that way so it's best to not round as much as you can until the very very last step and we get that c is approximately 46.9 degrees now if that's 46.9 degrees how do you do the rest of it there there's again two options could you use interior angle sum to figure out angle b absolutely yeah that's totally fine you can do that why well because subtraction doesn't compound the error that you get if you round to the same number so option two is you use the law of cosines again to solve for angle b so you get b equals cosine inverse of all this stuff you'd square 2.05 you'd square three you'd add them you'd subtract 16 divide by 2 times 2.05 times 3 take cosine inverse of that and that's going to give you exactly what angle b is that is actually a great way to check your work so remember interior angle sum has to add to 180. if you use interior angle sum and you find this out what if you were mistaken here if you were it wouldn't show up if you use the law of cosines again to solve for angle b and then you add these things if you've rounded you the same decimal it should add up to exactly 180 degrees so that is a definite good way to check your work me i'm going to just kind of be lazy a little bit and i'm going to use the interior angle sum so 180 degrees minus 30 minus 46.9 is going to give us angle b and we get about 103.1 again if you really wanted to be sure you would have to set this up again law of cosines with angle b you'd have angle well i guess we could write it out angle b would be well cosine inverse you have to take cosine versus both sides let's see the sides adjacent to angle b squared so 2.05 and 3 squared minus the side opposite squared that's what this is telling you here divided by 2 times the sides of json so these same two numbers that's precisely what we had down there remember the three was opposite c just like four is opposite b and this is going to equal if you round to the same decimal place exactly what that is 103.1 degrees i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing the the ideas going through it um one other thing is if you were to use law of sines you could certainly do it here but because that's rounded and you have to use that in a sine inverse it's going to really compound a lot of error also you'll have to deal with the two solutions idea there and only one of them is going to work so this is it can be quite challenging so my encouragement would be use the law of cosines there's not two options here you just get that one and then use either law of cosines again to find the different angle or interior angle sum if you're sure that you got that right interior angle sum would not check your work though where another law of cosines would so i hope that makes sense it's a little bit more straightforward than all signs let's go ahead we'll do a couple more examples and end with an application okay so we have another example we've got a triangle we're not sure if it's a right triangle we know only that we know it's three sides well pythagorean theorem won't help us anyway we already know the three sides and turns out this is not a right triangle it's something where we only have to find our angles now how should you go about finding your angles you have a few options here on how you want to do this number one the side side side knowing all three sides is perfect for law of cosines notice while while notice why law of sines wouldn't work we have no angle and so we would not be able to complete uh one of those fractions with law of sines you have to have a complete fraction equal to half of a completed fraction that's a proportion for you where you solve for one part remember three pieces to find a a fourth for law of sine you need to know either two sides of one angle or two angles on one side and that's that's not what we have here so we have all three sides law of cosines will do that for us but we're only finding of course our angles so this doesn't really work because this is how we find our sides we need to know how to find our angles so here's where the options come in while you have to use law of cosines the first time once you find that angle you could use law of sines now should you i'm going to say probably not most of the time and for a couple reasons when we get there i'll explain to you a little bit more but because the law of sines is going to compound by a sine inverse some of these these errors cosine can do that as well but you don't have to use that in cosine to use law of sines you'd be using a rounded side and the sine inverse is going to make a large difference numerically if you if you're using a rounded number now if you're not then it would be fine the second reason and probably the most important is that with law of sines you get two answers for your angle do you remember that like you have this theta and 180 minus theta you'd at least have to check this only one of them is going to work in law of cosines so there's only one equation that will be true here there's not an ambiguous case but you would have to go through the process to see which one is which and that can be kind of annoying so could you yes should you it depends now i said the beginning like yeah i would normally use law of sines but there and there's a trick i'll show you that you can do but you have to know a lot about it to do it so i'll teach that to you as we're going through so anyway we have this we know three sides idea we know that's a law of cosines let's go ahead and find an angle i'm gonna find let's call this angle a i'm gonna find angle a i'm gonna find the angle opposite the largest side why for a number of reasons number one if it happens to be 90 degrees then i can make a lot of my work easier number two because using the law of sines to find the angle opposite the smaller side the smallest side guarantees you have an acute angle and it guarantees you don't have to check 180 minus theta that's the way i would use law of sines to kind of trick the problem and not have to use law of cosines twice but again you didn't know that i'll explain that as we go through right now so i've labeled this i said if that's a let's call this b and call that c i have three sides i know i'm finding an angle so if i want to find angle a what i'm thinking is i'm going to have cosine of angle a equal to the square of the sides adjacent to it that's four squared and five squared as a sum minus the angle oh sorry minus the side opposite to it so the sides adjacent squared and added minus the side opposite okay so a and opposite over two times the product of the adjacent sides it's two times four times five so we can simplify all that if we want to we can also just use our calculator take cosine inverse and plug it in at one time and we're going to get about 125.1 degrees now what about the other angles so all we've done really is said maybe not a right triangle don't know can't really use anything with it because i'm not sure we know through sides of law of cosines we're finding an angle so great cosine of an angle equals add the squares of the adjacent side subtract the square of the opposite divide by two times the product of the adjacent sides and then take a cosine inverse and we've done that we've got 125.1 degrees one of the rest of them can you use interior angle sum right now to figure out these two angles no no you can't you need to know at least one other angle and then you can do that so what do you do you either do cos law of cosines to find one of these angles doesn't matter which then use law of cosines again or interior angle sum to subtract and figure out what the third one is or i said this i would do this you can use law of sines if you found the largest angle or the the angle opposite the largest side that would be the largest angle why because if you have the smallest side of your triangle it will be opposite an acute angle so when you take sine of that there won't be an obtuse option why because you found the angle opposite the small side it would be an acute angle would be less than 90 degrees that means that you have just one option and the 180 minus theta will not apply so whatever your sine inverse gives you that's your angle that's one way to kind of trick this problem and uh and use it to your advantage so what i would do is i would take sine of 125.1 degrees over eight equals sine of c over four we're going to try that right now sign of known angle over known side equals sine of unknown angle over known side i've completed one fraction i have this equal to another fraction that i know only one part of i know three things i can find a fourth if we multiply by four and take a sine inverse then what we're going to get is c equals four times sine of 125.1 degrees over eight now this is something i told you a little while ago this is dangerous to do why because you've already rounded that and if you're going to use it which i am right now i'm using i probably shouldn't but if i'm using that rounded number this is going to be a little bit off um so c is going to equal really we should have it here too because we're using an approximation c is going to equal an angle that is slightly less accurate than you could get with law of cosines this is maybe a little bit faster but it is less accurate if i knew what that angle was exactly i would for sure use law of sines so that's kind of the caveat to what i was explaining a little earlier would i do loft signs yeah if i was sure about that angle i knew exactly what it was because that's a little faster for me i like dealing with proportions i'm more comfortable with them than remembering law of cosines although it's not all that bad so that that's the that's the caveat so if you want to use law of sines you need to know one angle perfect and then you're finding the angle opposite the smaller side because sine of this angle it has to be acute you don't have two options so we would get 24.1 degrees approximately so this is about 24.1 now let's say that you were actually given an angle like here then law of sines would work just fine as long as you're finding the um the angle that's opposite your smallest side so that that's kind of the necessary thing otherwise otherwise what would we have to do if we didn't know this was a cube if we didn't know it was the angle across from the smallest side which has to be an acute angle then we would have two options here the angle and 180 minus angle you have to go through the process of figuring out which one of those is right there would be only one but it's kind of annoying to have to do that now what what if you don't like that what if you don't like the ambiguity of it you want to use law of cosines that's totally fine if we take and find angle c let's pretend we didn't know is 24.1 and we want to do law of cosines we're going to do the same exact thing and notice that there's no rounded numbers in that so cosine of angle c equals take the squares of the adjacent side the sides next to that square it subtract the side opposite it squared over two times the product of the adjacent sides that i might be messing these up a little bit but it does not matter as long as you're the concept of it's right if you're trying to find angle c we're just going to verify that it's 24.1 right now if you want to find angle c then your adjacent sides are five and eight your opposite side is four square everything subtract the four squared divide by two times the adjacent sides and then take a cosine inverse now first glance you're you might be thinking you're getting exactly the same thing but notice something this is actually an approximation from here because you you act well actually really here because you use an approximation this just happens to be exactly what you get around the same decimal place as this but you would be more exact here you could get exactly what you want to as many decimal places as you want because you did not use any rounded figures so that is that's more appropriate if you're going to use something rounded here if you're not then law of sines is perfect you can do it just find the angle opposite the smallest side it works just fine for us this is going to be 24.1 degrees approximately once we round which is what we get by the law of sines now consequently because we know both of these angles you can use interior angle sum to figure out this one you could also use the law of cosines one more time but it's it's really up to you at this point i'm going to use interior angle sum and say the angle b is 180 degrees minus 24.1 minus 25.1 we get the angle b is approximately 30.8 degrees by the interior angle sum man i hope i'm making this make sense i hope you're seeing how the law of cosines it could give you something a little bit more exact if you use an approximation i hope you're also seeing though that you can use law of sines here it is okay but you must use law of cosines to figure out your first angle or with the side angle side you must use your law of cosines to figure out your your other side that gives you the ability to use law of sines later or continue with law of cosines either one is fine as long as you're remembering that rounded numbers really decrease your accuracy so avoid using them if at all possible so maybe on this one if you had the choice i'd use log law of cosines because it is a little bit more exact in its in its essence so let's come back i'm going to do one more example with you we'll give a real life example or at least an application and then we'll be done okay last one before an application we got this triangle it's clearly not a right triangle so we can't use any sort of things like pythagorean theorem to find that missing side even though we might want to can't do it can't use right triangle trigonometry so what are we left with well we could be trying to use interior angle sum if we note another tri angle we certainly could do that we can't use pythagorean theorem so we're left with law of sines or law of cosines think through it don't just do law of cosines because we're in the section or the video or whatever you're doing think about what we're really asking so what would what would really work could you even set up a law of sines and make it make sense law of sines requires you to know an angle and one side opposite to it in order to even use it so here's an angle i don't know that side here's a side i don't know the angle here's the side i don't know the angle law of sines is done like you cannot use that with side side side you had no angles so you cannot use that that means we rely on law of cosines law of cosines says that for a side an angle and a side or two sides and an angle between them we can solve it and so let's start labeling some things again if you like the formulas then you can label this with letters like everywhere you do that so this is maybe a and then little a uh if this is b then this would be lowercase b if this is c then this is lowercase letter c that would be fine if you're the type of person who likes to label things like that that's okay i i like i like a label i'm more of a concept guy when it comes to formulas though so when i think about the formula what i'm thinking is with my side angle side what could i what could i even find right now could i find an angle right now really think through this in order to find an angle you need to know the adjacent sides that's the only way that that our our formulas actually work so if if i want to find angle a i would have to know this side and the set and i don't if i wanted to find angle c i would have to know this side and this side and i don't why because in finding your your angles uh you have to actually have to know all three sides you'd have to know all of your sides for the a squared plus the b squared minus the c squared over 2 times a b you have to know all of them and so i don't know all my sides so i can't find any of my angles i have to find a side first this last remaining side so i'm going to do that i'm going to find side b how does it work finding out the side says think pythagorean theorem if i'm finding out that side i'm going to take my other two sides and square them subtract two times the product of those sides times cosine of the angle between them which consequently is the opposite angle to that side so finding that side says add these two sides square them we'll add the squares of the size you should say subtract 2 times those two sides and cosine of the angle between which is the opposite angle to the side you want to find now we're going to plug in some numbers so b squared is well let's see 3 squared 2 squared minus 2 times 2 times 3 times cosine of 110 degrees if we really wanted to be fancy take a square root of the whole thing do it all at one time on your calculator so i just happened to simplify it at 9 4 12 cosine 110 you don't have to you can just take a square root right from here put the whole thing in as long as you use your parentheses appropriately b is about 4.1 units that's great okay so now now what do we do you have some options on what you you want to do you can either use law of cosines again or you can use law of sines which should you do it really it depends on what you're given um and it depends on what you're going to find if you are given the largest angle and you've found the largest side which you have then if you want to use law of sines use it to find the angle that's opposite the smallest side here's why for the last time that with your law of sines you remember that you have two options two two options an angle and 180 minus an angle if you know that you are an angle opposite the smallest side that's what you're finding that will be an acute angle it will be less than 90 so you don't have to worry about this other one 180 minus your angle is going to be obtuse you don't have to worry about that you know you're acute so it's 0 to 90 degrees that's an acute angle so if that's the case then you know for sure that that's a cute there's only one case there and you can do a law of sines so sine of c over 2 equals sine of well there's only one other complete fraction you have and but notice you are using the rounded number now what about using angle code law of cosines to find angle a you'd still be using a rounded number so no matter what unless you plug in this entire piece for for either formula you're going to be using something rounded in later math not the best option but it is really typically what we do here so i can show you both of them i'll show you law of sines and then i'll show you law of cosines so so law of sines says you know one complete fraction you know an angle and a site opposite to it and i'm going to find the angle that's opposite my smallest side i know it's acute that gives me this non two options idea i would cross multiply or i can just multiply both sides by two and take an inverse sine inverse of both sides so c is sine inverse imagine this multiply both sides by two you would get 2 side 110 over 4.14 and then you would take a sine inverse of both sides that's what i would plug in my calculator i wouldn't write down little numbers or anything plug the whole thing in i got like 26.997 and i rounded it to 27. please do this make everyone happy when you do this by the way when you round something if you round to 27 but you've rounded to get there put 27 point whatever 27.0 to show that like this put 27.0 so that it shows you rounded to get there if you just put 27 without the point zero even though the point zero doesn't mean anything numerically it means something rounding wise this will show people you rounded to get there if you put exactly 27 without the decimal point 0 it seems like that's a whole number it seems like that was an exact answer so don't do that that's why you put the point 0 even though 27 would be counted as the same thing now that's law of sines law of cosines would say hey if you want to find angle c here's how we do it we take cosine of c square this square the sides adjacent to it and add them subtract the side opposite to it squared divide by two times the product of the the adjacent sides to whatever angle you're finding exactly that then we're going to take cosine inverse okay i want you to know that i have a slight mistake on the board right now this and this are technically still approximations because i've used an approximation in it i know i'm reiterating myself a lot but it's very important that you understand something we get out of using an approximation is also an approximation it can't automatically become exact somehow so those really should all be approximations and what i got out of that was 27.0 degrees if i rounded but i wonder if you noticed something if you did both of these this was like 26.99 something this was 26.9 and a different something it was slightly different so i think 26.96 but it was slightly different that is because we used an approximation when we did our math so cosine and sine will take that approximation and and it will deal differently with the error in that um so rounded wise it usually works out as long as you're not really super rounding that number it's typically pretty fine but i do want to point it out to you so which way is better if you're rounding it doesn't make much of a difference if you're looking to be as exact as possible don't use a round number if you didn't use a rounded number here and you use this exact thing this expression in both of your equations they would come out exactly the same so i hope that's made sense i hope that you've seen that you really do need to solve use law of cosines to solve for that missing side after that you have options you can do law of sines you can do law of cosines law of cosines is preferred for two reasons number one sometimes it lets you not use rounded numbers while signs will not do that if you if you're working on this type of triangle secondly is that law of cosines doesn't make you use the two options like law of sines does the only way around that is to do what i've shown you and find the angle opposite the shortest side with law of sines that would avoid your two options because you know you're an acute angle after this because you know that angle c is about 27.0 degrees you can use interior angle sum that's fine you could use law of sines if you wanted to that'd be fine you could use law of cosines again with a with to find angle a that's also fine i'm going to use interior angle sum uh at this point it's not going to compound any more errors we already have that error built in so it wouldn't compound that and so we would get angle a is 180 minus 110 minus 27.0 and finally angle a is approximately 43.0 degrees i hope this made sense we're going to come back and do one uh real life example and see if if we can put blob cosines to good work okay last example so let's pretend you are flying uh you're flying from city a to city b i've never visited city b but i hear it's wonderful this time of year city a whatever um and you're chugging along you see a little readout you're going about 220 miles an hour and it takes 330 miles to get from city to fly from city a to cdb and after 15 minutes your pilot discovers ah man i've been going 10 degrees off course maybe didn't account for a crosswind or something and he's been going off course a little bit so there's a couple questions firstly what course does he correction does he have to make at 15 minutes after he left city a and secondly how long is it going to take to get there or what speed does he have to adjust to get there in a certain amount of time both of those questions are things we can answer so let's start with with this if you have this type of a triangle is there a way that you could you do anything right now without knowing more information not really remember you need to know three things in order to find a fourth you know only two you know an angle in one side there's nothing in triangles that we can deal with only knowing two things in a right triangle you automatically know one angle is 90 degrees so it'll be three things that you know so here it's no you can't have they give another information that we can use yeah it says that you detected an error after flying this way for 15 minutes if you're going 220 miles an hour for 15 minutes or a quarter of an hour remember that distance equals rate times time if distance equals rate times time then if we travel 220 miles an hour for a quarter of an hour not 15. you didn't go for 15 hours so make sure your units match here 15 minutes is 0.25 hours that would be 55 miles so we now know a second side of this triangle well that's nice now we have a lot more we have three pieces of information let's see what it fits does this fit a right triangle model um do we do we know it's a right triangle no and so we really can't use right triangular trigonometry can we use law of sines law of sines requires you to know an angle and one side opposite it in order to do anything with it i know an angle but i don't know the opposite side i know a side i don't know the opposite angle i know the side i don't know opposite angles so law of sines will not work if you really look at it there's two sides and an angle known between it that right there is what we can deal with with law of cosines so we're certainly in law of cosines what do you do with law of cosines well you really can't find an angle until you know all three sides why finding an angle requires you to know the adjacent side so if i wanted to find this angle i'd have to know both of these sides if i wanted to find this angle i'd have to know both of these sides i'm missing this side we have to find that side first so let's call this side a if you want to label everything then this would be angle c side c side b we already have angle a and angle b now our law of cosines is going to tell us what to do we're trying to solve for this side so a squared equals whether you want to use your formula or not conceptually or or just kind of copy it down either way is really fine typically your given formula but conceptually is a little bit nicer for me because it helps me to memorize things so if i'm trying to find a side i think by failure and theorem i think okay a squared equals the sum of the other two sides squared well the sum of the squares of the two sides so 330 squared and 55 squared the formula would tell you b squared plus c squared minus 2 times their product of what you just squared and cosine of the angle between them so cosine of 10 degrees or the angle opposite the side you want to find so let's see here's my side i want to find i have some of the squares of these other two sides minus the product of two times those sides times cosine of the angle between them which is also the angle opposite the side i need to find so if we take a square root of that entire expression and do not round it this a is exactly that now that's not very useful if we think well i want to know what the distance is and be able to do some distance rate time on it so we're going to approximate that so we get almost exactly 276 miles like 276.00 something miles so we now know that if you're flying for 55 miles 15 minutes going 225 miles 220 miles an hour then at that point you are exactly 276 miles away from your destination this wonderful glorious city be now what do you do after that well we want to know a couple things one thing we want to know is what's this course correction what angle do you have to adjust to what that's going to take is us knowing what angle c is and subtracting that angle from 180 degrees to know what adjustment we need to make so we probably ought to find that angle do we care about this angle no not so much not really at all actually so let's use law of cosines you could certainly use a law of sines so sine of c over 330 equals sine of 10 over 276 now that you know it but be careful because this is the longest side of your triangle hope you're listening because that's the longest side of your triangle this is going to be your largest angle this will be an obtuse angle this will be um but in other triangles you can't guarantee that here you can because it's such a small angle so law of sines in a lot of cases would not be preferable because you'd have two options so you could certainly do it i'm going to choose to do law of cosines though because i want to avoid the two options outcome that i'd have to go through so it's kind of frustrating so i'm going to do law of cosines and think i want to find angle c okay how does that work when you're finding an angle it says you need to know the adjacent sides square them and add them that'd be 55 and 276.0 squared each you need to know the opposite side which we know it's 330. and we're going to divide by 2 times the product of the adjacent sides these two should always show up right there if we take cosine inverse of that entire mess of junk we're going to get whatever this angle is which is about 168.0 degrees again we rounded but it rounded to point zero so we're going to show that that's this angle please don't get confused that's this angle not this one so this is 168.0 degrees then what's your course correction well if that's 168 a straight angle has 180 degrees these two angles are supplementary let's subtract 180 minus 168 is approximately 12.0 degrees so this guy's going along at 220 miles an hour after 15 minutes or 55 miles he says oh man i got to make a correction what's the distance the distance to my destination is 276 miles the course correction i need to make judging from my my math that we did here is a 12 degree course correction now how fast does this guy have to go if he wants to make the entire trip 90 minutes still an hour and a half 1.5 hours well here's one thing that students would often do they'd say oh well if i'm here and i need to go that far because distance equals rate times time rate equals distance divided by time so can't i just take 276 and divide it by 90 minutes or 1.5 hours no what why because you already burned up 15 minutes remember if you if you want to make your entire trip 1.5 hours you already pointed boined up you already boiled up maybe the city b is boston you already burned up 2.25 hours of this so you only have 1.25 hours left hopefully that makes sense to you maybe it doesn't maybe i can re-explain a little bit you discovered after 15 minutes or a quarter of an hour that you are here you have that far to go if you're traveling 220 miles an hour and you want to make your entire trip 90 minutes that is you're here you only have 75 minutes left to get here so this distance divided by 75 minutes or 1.25 hours would give you your speed so rate equals distance over time i have that far to go i have 1.25 hours left to get there that is 75 minutes because i burned up my first 15 minutes if you need to get there from a to b in 90 minutes you have to pick it up a little bit how far uh or how fast so 276 divided by 1.25 says you're going to have to increase your speed to 220.8 miles per hour so increase it just a little bit more and you will make it there right on time whole trip all together after burning 15 minutes going wrong direction would be still 90 minutes if you increased at this point to 220.8 miles an hour hope it's made sense i hope you're seeing uh law of cosines and i've explained it well enough for you i hope you see when you can use law of sines a lot of the times law of cosines is a better option especially if you don't completely understand the two solution idea of all signs just stick with law of cosines you'll be absolutely fine in fact it helps you check your work so that's about it for this video i hope you're enjoying them next time we'll talk about the area of a triangle and how in the world you can use it when you know certain cases like the law of cosines without having to find a height explicitly so we'll deal with that next time you 

Transcript for: How to Find the Area of a Triangle with Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 34)
hey there welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about the area of a triangle and you go yes but i already know that i know but i'm going to make this a lot easier for you you see when we talk about the area of a triangle you need to know a couple things about it you need to know the base and you need to know the height if it's not a right triangle you'd have to know what this distance is in order to find the area of a triangle until today after today we're going to be able to find the area of a triangle without knowing the height if we know two sides and an angle between it or if we know all three sides this sounds a lot like the law of cosines yes it does for a very good reason because we're going to use a substitution that takes into account this right triangle right here we're going to simplify the area of a triangle into using two sides and angle between it because of that or all three sides because of that reason and so if this if your triangle satisfies law of cosines you can find the area without explicitly knowing the height so we're going to talk about a few things uh we'll prove the area of a triangle here really quickly we'll do a substitution to figure out the angle area if you know two sides and angle between and then we'll use something called heron's formula to find the area of the triangle if you know all three sides so let's start with this how in the world do you find the area of a triangle well the idea behind the area of a triangle is if you can make the area of a rectangle it's pretty easy to find so let's suppose we have this triangle with a height of h and a base of b and the b goes all the way across this then maybe we double this triangle and make a rectangle double this triangle make a rectangle the area of the full rectangle the whole dotted thing with this base would be base times height so that would be the area of the entire rectangle however how did we figure out that area well we doubled this triangle put it here we've doubled this triangle put it here so the area of the rectangle is twice what this triangle would be and so if we divide by two or multiply by one half we're going to get the area of that triangle how we use what letter we use to represent the area is sometimes k so we're going to say k is the area of our triangle and it would be one half base times height that's where our area for triangle comes from in the first place now what if we knew two sides and an angle between it what if we didn't actually know the height is there a way that we could figure out the area from knowing two sides an angle between it once you loved it if one of those times i was like nope we can't end a video this is it never not gonna happen um but let's go ahead and here's what we're gonna try let's suppose that we use this formula we would know the base we know the side but what if we don't know the height is there a way that we can make a substitution so let's start with that area of a triangle is one half base times height what would we know if we knew two sides and hang between we'd know this side we know this side we know the angle we would not know the height but wait a second what that height does is creates a right triangle here here and that angle with our h create a right triangle let's go ahead and set that up now what we what would we know in that right triangle we wouldn't know this base why because that base is the whole entire thing i don't know where this comes so i don't know that but i would know the angle and this particular side oh my gosh if this is a right triangle and identify the angle that i know and given or in referencing i can identify my hypotenuse i can identify the the side opposite my angle then i can identify the side adjacent then what this is don't look at this guy but look at this guy if you know two sides and an angle between then your height creates a right triangle you would still know this angle of the right triangle you would still know the hypotenuse of that right triangle so what trig function represent that any trig function not including adjacent that would be sine and so we can use sine of the angle between the sides that we know equals opposite over hypotenuse i hope you're seeing that i hope you seen the right triangle there and that sine of angle c equals opposite over hypotenuse we don't want to use the b because we don't know well this side doesn't end here it goes the whole way we have no idea what that adjacent side is we would know knowing two sides and angle between that angle and the hypotenuse we don't know the height and that's the whole point of the next step that we're doing if we don't know the height finding this area would be really difficult but if we know this angle on that side maybe we can solve for height maybe we can use that to substitute so let's multiply both sides by a this says that the height of that triangle is going to be given for sure by a the hypotenuse times sine of angle c this is true this is just right triangle trigonometry now let's substitute it this h is the same as this h so if we don't know what that h is we can substitute this in there so the the triangle the area of that triangle is one-half b times h but instead of h i'm going to use this with a little bit of multiple uh switching or multiplication because that's commutative we get the area of that triangle is one half a times b the whole b not just this little part the whole b times sine of the angle between them that's pretty impressive so using a little right triangle trigonometry we can get around the fact we don't know h because we could find it with some right triangle trig so if you had to do this on your own without this formula you'd have to drop a height you'd have to figure out what this angle is what the that side is do your sine which would be horribly hard then you'd have your height this formula does it all at once for you we've just made a substitution to make it nicer so there's there's really three instances we have area is one half a times b times sine c we can have a times c times sine b we can have b times c times sine a all it really is is one half the two sides that you know times sine of the angle between them that's the concept i'm gonna write up the formulas but that's the concept so there's our formulas remember this only works if you know two sides with an angle between because that's the only way we'd be able to figure out the height with our sine function so this is for a side angle side knowledge of a triangle what it says the concept of it is man area of a triangle is still one half something but we're being kind of smart with the substitution so it's one half multiply the sides and sine of the angle between the sides that you know that's why you need to know two sides of the angle between that that's all this says multiply the sides times sine of the angle between those two sides have one half of that and you have the area of your triangle so i'm going to come back i'm just going to do two examples of this and then we'll move on to our knowing three sides and finding the area of a triangle all right let's get after it so we have this triangle i don't know it's right triangle i don't care all we really need to know to find the area is in general a base times a height now if we don't know a height if we know two sides and an angle between we can find the area of that triangle so all we've got to do is take one half times the two sides and sine of the angle between them if you need to label this as a b and c that's absolutely fine you don't really need to but you could if you need the formula that would be a a maybe this is b that would be lowercase b if this is c then this is lowercase c honestly though the formulas are more of a concept one half times the two sides and sine of the angle between them so one of the sides the other side sine of the angle between them no matter how this is oriented you can always find area of a triangle that way one half the two sides that you know or any two sides you know times sine of the angle between if we do this let's see sine of 30 degrees is one half that's going to give you three so the area of this triangle is three square units is that nice yeah you bet it's nice that's that's really great because you don't have to use right triangle trigonometry and then do something else with it it's all in one that's really all there is to it we've already done the right triangle trigonometry and do the substitution so that this was possible all right we have one last one with our side angle side i'm looking at this i'm trying to find the area of a triangle i don't really know the height how would you find the height you have to draw a perpendicular right here and find the height of that or draw one here and extend that you do both cases but really it's a lot nicer if this fits law of cosines you can use an area formula for it so the area of a triangle says all we really need to know is all three sides or two sides and an angle between i know that i know two sides and an angle between so if you want to label this as a a b b c and lowercase c that's fine our area is going to give us one half times multiply those sides together so four times one or one times four times sine of the angle between them which is 120 degrees now one half times 1 times 4 is just 2 and sine of 120 degrees let's see that's square root of 3 over 2 which leaves us with just the square root of 3 or about 1.73 if you want to approximate i hope that makes sense i hope that explained the area of a triangle really nicely if you've if you have two sides and you know an angle between them it's not all that bad we've just done a substitution so if it fits the law of cosines you can do it if you need the formula great if you're a constant person then just if you know the two sides and the angle between it's multiply the sides times one half and sine of angle between them so let's take a look at what happens if you know all three sides okay so last little concept here let's suppose that you know all three sides of a triangle can you find the area yes you can but it does involve a special formula it's called heron's formula the idea is add up your sides and multiply it by one half this is going to give you a value called s then take that value instead of square root s times s minus a times s minus b times s minus c it is a process i'm not going to prove it for you but it does work if you know all three sides of your right triangle to figure out the area pretty concisely otherwise you would it would take a lot of work to actually do this so you need quite a bit of trigonometry to figure out that area so let's go through it the ideas again is there's a part one and there's a part two figure out s first think of s as half the perimeter so s says add everything up and divide by two or multiply by one half so we would do that now it doesn't matter the order of course in which you add them but you do need to add everything together before you divide by two so that looks like we're going to have oh let's see one half of 19 should be 9.5 so we're going to find this quantity s half of the perimeter first after that we can find the area all we're going to do is take k equals or area equals the square root and inside that we're going to start with s so 9.5 and then we're going to continue to multiply by s minus each of the three sides it does not matter the order so 9.5 minus 9 9.5 minus 6 9.5 minus 4 or any sort of permutation of those for exact answer you actually could put square root of 91.4375 i haven't rounded that um but really in your calculators normally we would just put this all all in square root of use your parentheses appropriately and then when you take that square root it's going to give you about oh 9.56 so 9.56 square units whatever that is it's kind of a nice way to find the area if you know all three sides it's at least very quick so find s it's half the perimeter then square root of s and then s minus each of your sides multiplied together okay last one so you should probably try that on your own um just see if you can go through karen's formula see if you can figure out s and then use s in your area formula so for us we've got s is half the perimeter so add this up that would be one half of nine plus eight plus five in any order that you want so let's see that's oh 17 plus 5 is 22 half of that is 11. so s is 11. our area formula says take the s multiply times s minus each of those sides in succession multiply it all together take square root if we do that 11 times 11 minus 9 times 11 minus 8 times 11 minus 5 we're going to get 396 as the radicand the inside of that square root if we take a square root it's about about 19.9 19.9 square units whatever that is that's still an area i hope this makes sense i hope that i've explained to you well enough that if something fits law of cosines you can find the area of that triangle pretty easily with one of these formulas um so we're multiplying one half times two sides and sine of the angle between or when we're adding them up multiplying by one half to figure out s and square root of that s times s minus each of those three sides that's about it that's how we can find area without having to know the height i hope it's made sense to you and i will see you for another video we're going to go on to some harmonic motion 

Transcript for: Simple Harmonic Motion in Trig (Precalculus - Trigonometry 35)
welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about something called simple harmonic motion we're taking a side step away from triangles and going back to the functions sine and cosine really what their graphs are so we'll talk about what simple harmonic motion is i'll tell you how to create a function from information and how to get information about this harmonic motion from a function and that's pretty about much about it i will not be talking about damped harmonic motion we really haven't talked about e to a negative exponent in a while that would be involved so i want to get you rolling on what simple harmonic motion is in this video so what what does it mean simple harmonic motion is vibratory motion that does not lessen over time so you start a process and it continues going up and down or back and forth forever without lessening now oftentimes damped harmonic motion is a little more realistic where you let something go and it does this and then eventually gets to its its resting position this would be the case where you do this and it keeps on going forever and ever and ever what i'd like you to know about simple harmonic motion is that it can be modeled with what are called sinusoidal functions either the sine or the cosine functions without manipulating them or without multiplying by some other function and bounding them with with an upper and lower curve so simple harmonic motion is doesn't change over time and it can be modeled with sine or cosine functions so let's talk about what these these things are that i've written on the board this letter d stands for displacement or the the amount of distance between its resting position and where it is at over a period of time now there's two functions we can deal with to do this cosine and sine and we're familiar with them pretty much that hey that omega affects the period that t is time so over over a length of time what this is doing where it's at over a length of time and omega it relates to our period so when we deal with this yeah dia's displacement from rest the absolute value of a is our amplitude how far it gets in total away from your resting position this is usually where you push it to pull it to or where you hit it to from rest the period why is it two pi why is it two pi over omega oh man hopefully you remember that sine and cosine have a natural period of two pi we can divide that by whatever number is in front of our variable and it will shrink or grow that that period and then our frequency is how many oscillations happen per time interval it's really just the reciprocal of your period one other couple of things i want you to know before before we move on uh we'll get to this when we start building our functions if you are starting from a position that is away from your rest you will use the cosine function if you are starting your motion at rest you will use the sine function i want you to see why this is what the sine function is either positive sine so a is positive or negative sign a is negative so if your position is at rest when you start use the sign because sine starts at the origin starts at zero zero starts at a resting position of you're not away from your period your place of rest uh cosine is different cosine starts either positive amplitude or negative amplitude whatever that is so if you're starting away from your resting position like you've pulled down something let it go or you've pushed up something let it go if your displacement your position is starting away from your resting position use cosine that's because it's modeled better as positive cosine or negative cosine if you're starting at rest start with continuous sign so positive sign or negative sign we'll also use this idea to say from our functions what's happening where are we starting is our motion going down from start or coming up from start going up from start or going down with start and so we'll be able to determine that by understanding what our trig functions look like so we're going to get right into it let's say that you have a sign hanging down from some sort of spring and you pull it way down well actually it's only 7 inches you pull it way down seven inches and let it go what's gonna happen well if you pulled that down remember you pull it down and you're starting its displacement from down below where it wants to rest what model fits that best does this fit it are you starting below where it wants to rest no are you starting below where it wants to rest no are you starting below where it wants to rest yes so this is going to be a negative cosine function when we get done with it so we're going to pull down this sign and then we're just going to let it go i'm just going to do this forever theoretically in this model simple harmonic motion let's say you count it and it takes four seconds to return to where you let it go so you pulled it down remember it hasn't started its own natural motion until you let it go so you did this it hasn't started simple harmonic motion you're just holding it you're holding it and then then you let it go at that moment t equals 0 starts so you go up right there you have released this from below its resting position it's going to want to go up and you start counting one two three four and it gets down to exactly where you released it took four seconds to get there it's a really slow spring and let's figure out if we can determine everything about this problem and build a function from it firstly what's what's the amplitude how far away from its resting position is this ever going to make it well it's going to be seven inches you tip it down seven inches and let it go our amplitude itself the absolute value would be seven but i want you to think of where you also did where you also moved this this object this sign did you move it up positive seven did you pull it down negative seven in our case we pulled this down seven inches that's negative seven we'll also think of the period and use that to find our omega the thing that's going to go next to one of our functions inside our variable inside our parentheses next to our variable so our period is 2 pi over omega however we know what our period is our period is 4 seconds so if we read through this and say yeah we pulled it down 7 inches that's negative 7. your displacement is negative 7 when you start and then you let it go it takes four seconds to oscillate all the way up and all the way down from where you you let it go then our period is four seconds let's set this equal to four seconds in doing that what we can do is solve for omega so multiply both sides by omega divided by 4 or remember you can interchange these two things and simplify we're going to get pi over 2. what about our frequency the frequency is how many oscillations per time unit so how many oscillations per second now think about this if it takes four full seconds to go from where you released it back to where you released it how many oscillations per second does it have not even one actually one-fourth here's what happens your frequency is always going to be the reciprocal of your period so if your period is four seconds your frequency is one fourth of an oscillation per second and now we're actually ready to build our displacement formula our displacements can be modeled on where you pulled it to and what's happening when you release it if you are starting so you pull it down and start that position at that non-resting position if you are pulling this away from rest and letting it go or pushing it up away from rest and letting it go use cosine so we've already determined how far we're pulling it that's negative seven we've already determined that it's not starting from its resting position it's starting away from that actually it's starting from you pull it down use the negative seven cosine is use this when you start away from rest so cosine we have solved for our omega that's pi over 2 and our time unit is t that's our variable that right there is exactly how this this function would be modeled so so we would model this with a function negative seven cosine pi over two t and i needed to make sense to you i need to understand that cosine starts away from zero cosine starts away from rest so this was hanging there you pulled it down you're moving it away from its rest down seven units its amplitude is seven positive seven yes but where you moved it's negative seven this would this would look like a negative cosine function you pulled it down what's going to happen what's its motion immediately it's going to start going up so if you see a negative 7 cosine a negative something cosine its initial motion is going to go up why because you pulled it down and you let it go it's going to start climbing upward it's going to reach a peak it's come right back to where you released it that time period is your period how many oscillations fit in that is your frequency you can use your period to solve for omega and that is the coefficient of your variable remember that that is what has adjusted your period for you we're just kind of going in reverse so that's really the the idea on going through this is number one see what's happening with it are you starting from rest you sign are you starting away from rest use cosine are you pushing it up positive cosine pulling it down negative cosine because it fits the model are you shooting it up from rest positive sign are you shooting it down from rest negative side then all we really have to do is find our omega from a period how long it's taking you to return to your starting position so let's go ahead we'll start a couple more examples and go through this but this is the idea we're trying to really model what's happening in our physical simple harmonic motion to a mathematical model this this function of sine or cosine let's try another one so let's suppose this is the case you have this amplitude of 4 and you know that it's going to take pi over two seconds to return to where you in this case pushed up four feet and let go so this is all very important information firstly this is simple harmonic motion and this is where we're going to imply with this situation that if our amplitude is four we either pushed up four units or pulled it down four units we shot it up from rest four units or we shot it down from rest from rest four units in our case it says you push this up four feet and you let it go which model best fits that well starting from rest would be a sign issue starting not at rest displacement away from zero at rest is a cosine issue in fact we can look at this right here and say if your displacement at time zero is not equal to zero use cosine if your displacement is zero at time zero use sine in our case our displacement is four when we are at time zero why is that because you're pushing it up holding it there and then letting it go when you immediately let it go where is it at it's at positive 4. our displacement is 4 when we let it go this means that your displacement is away from its resting position you are using cosine here so if we push this up and let it go then our a i know our amplitude absolute value of a is 4 but our a is also positive 4. our period well our period is pi over 2 pi over two seconds but also remember that um our period is is equal to two pi over omega which means our omega our coefficient of our variable is if we reverse that if if our period is 2 pi over omega then our omega is 2 pi over our period because we know our period we can make a little substitution here omega is going to be 2 pi over pi over two so we're just substituting saying if period equals two pi over omega then omega equals two pi over period we know our period just substitute it in our case our pi's are gonna cancel we're gonna get two divided by one half that's four omega is just four if you wanted to figure out your frequency if you were ever asked for that because your period is pi over two your frequency would be two over pi there would be two over pi oscillations per second that's how you'd find frequency um it's not asked for right now but well you could find it maybe two over pi oscillations per second so less than one oscillation per second so now we're ready to figure out our displacement function displacement is find your a now if your amplitude's given and you know that it's four in our case you need to know whether this is pulled up or pushed down to start this one was pushed up so we know that this is positive four units away from its rest use that number so this is before we know that we're starting away from rest so use cosine we've taken some time to figure out our omega that's a coefficient of a variable that's 4 t and that's really it that that right there would give you the model of displacement now you can check your work if you know that if displacement is 4 at time equals 0 plug in 0. 4 times 0 is 0 cosine of 0 is 1 4 times 1 is 4. so this actually gives me my initial position based on my starting time of 0. that's a good way to check your work so if you had accidentally had a negative here you plugged in zero you'd get negative four wait a minute i know i'm at positive four when i start that's a problem what if you'd chosen sign well then four times zero would be zero sine of zero is actually zero zero times four would be zero you go oh this is starting at rest not where i want it to this is why we choose sine for starting at rest and cosine for starting away from rest because sine of zero is zero you have to start at rest cosine of zero is one you have to start at your amplitude that's why that works so in our case this would be you're pushing something up and letting it go where's its initial motion is it climbing or is it falling think about this positive cosine functions fall immediately that's what would happen if you push something up and let it go it's going to fall if you pull something down let it go it's going to climb on a spring or something so this right here this initial motion is falling it's going down what if you were to pull this down and let it go well then our initial position would be negative it'd still be cosine but it'd be negative 4 cosine 4t if you had pulled this down for feet or something and let it go i hope that's making sense you i hope you're seeing the a little bit more the modeling of cosine away from rest the idea of if i pull it up and let it go it's this model and it's going to go down first if i pull it down and let it go it's this small it's going to go up first let's go ahead and try a couple more okay i lied i wanted to change something on the previous problem let's suppose that instead of pushing this up or pulling this down this is at rest and it's moving up so imagine this imagine uh you have like a ball on a string and you just you just hit or a spring i should say and you just you hit it so here's the ball you just hit it upward what's going to happen it's going to start at rest you hit it it's immediately going to go up and then come down and go up again so let's say that it takes pi over two seconds to go up and come down and go back up to hit this resting position it's going to continue let's imagine that it still hits up to four feet up so our amplitude is still four feet our period is still pi over two but it's starting at rest and moving upward which model now fits that these are both not starting at rest this is starting from a displacement away from that these are both starting at rest but which one starts with the motion up positive sign or negative sign well positive sign does positive sign would be this case you have the ball hanging there you hit it it's going to start at rest and go upward then it's going to come back down and go upward again so when we're taking a look at that we're always going to use sine for starting at rest at time 0. because sine of 0 gives you 0 it's going to zero out that and start from your resting position so we still have the amplitude of four sure we actually still have a a positive four because we're dealing with a positive sine function our displacement though is zero at time zero where at time zero be right as you hit it its initial position is at rest it's at zero so our our period would still be the same our omega would still be the same but we're using a different function we'd use moving up means we're having a positive sine function we do have 4 positive 4 though sine of 4t think about the model here if you plug in 0 4 times 0 0 sine of 0 0 4 times 0 is 0. at time 0 you are at rest now you hit it what's happening it's going up why do we know that it's positive and so it would be climbing this match is moving up what if i would have had a negative in front well if i would have had a negative this would be a negative sine function that's the purple one that would say hey i'm going down oh that's not moving up that would be a problem which model would this fit this would fit a model of you're at rest and you hit it downward that would be initial motion down it would be negative it would follow that and that would work if that word was down i hope that makes more sense now i hope that you're seeing the interplay between cosine away from rest sine starts at rest because cosine of 0 is 1 but sine of 0 is 0. it puts it at the resting position all right we're going to take a look at four functions really quickly just to get a feel for how these look based on the function so we have a displacement function here the displacement of this object equals 5 sine of 3t i just want to get in your head what this would look like and what this is doing just simply by reading the function so let's start here can we see what the the motion is what type of emotion is whether we have damped harmonic motion or simple now we haven't talked about damped harmonic motion but damp would decrease with time it would have an actual decaying exponential um e to a negative exponent so this doesn't have that this is going to continue oscillating over and over and over just like sine and cosine both do so this is simple harmonic motion there's nothing in that that's lessening the function over time how about the maximum displacement this is also your amplitude how far does this get away from its resting position well that is always that number in absolute value so that would be five five units away from its natural resting position before it started taking motion how about the time for one oscillation what that's asking for is the period how long does it take to go from where you're starting it either away from rest or at rest back to where this whole situation started well that is a period how long does it take to create one oscillation um our period is always two pi over omega or it's it's uh it's the amount of time that it takes if it's given to you so because we have that we have that three our period is two pi over 3. remember that we can adjust our period by dividing by the number in front of our our variable in our case that is 3. so period is always 2 pi for sine and cosine pi for tangent and and cotangent we have to worry about that here but for sine and cosine it's 2 pi that's the period divided by whatever that number is this is shrinking that period or or compressing that so our time for one oscillation is two pi over three seconds how about your frequency frequency is always the reciprocal of your period so if we have two pi over three seconds to create a full period it'll be three over two pi oscillations per second how about your displacement at time zero like what would you do there you can either read the function or just plug in zero so if you just plug in zero uh three times zero plug in zero for t that's time zero plug in zero for t three times zero is zero sine of zero is also zero five times zero is zero your displacement is is zero that means that this position is at rest when the situation starts you could also look at the function this is a positive sine function okay what's a positive sine function that's this guy right here positive sine functions are like this black one that goes up comes down goes back up but where's the start it starts at zero it starts at rest now this answers the next question though what's its initial motion at time zero when it starts what does a positive sine function do does it climb does it go up does it fall does it go down in our case a positive sine function climbs so its initial motion is upward or climbing i hope it makes sense i hope you can now read the function and see like yeah this this is not going to change over time uh his displacement is its amplitude it's five away from rest uh our period is pretty easy we've studied period before frequency is the reciprocal of that it's its position is at rest when this starts because its displacement is zero and then its initial motion is modeled on whatever function that's given you so sine functions start at rest and either move up for positive or down for negative cosine functions start away from rest and either move down for positive or up for negative so let's come back with with three more we'll go through very quickly do basically the same thing okay so we've got another one we got d is negative three sine one half t let's go ahead and answer all these questions let's assume everything is in meters like like we will for the next couple examples firstly do we still have simple harmonic motion yeah there's nothing that says otherwise sine functions continue on forever and ever unless we just truncate them or alter them with some other function that binds them in some way that balance them how about our maximum displacement our maximum displacement is how far away from breath does this ever get that absolute value of your very first coefficient the absolute value of negative three will tell you that that's your amplitude your maximum displacement would be 3. your period or the time for one oscillation is always the period of your function divided by omega the number in front of your variable so in our case that's 2 pi divided oops did some math in my head there 2 pi divided by one-half if we multiply by the reciprocal we end up getting four pi so our our period the amount of time that it takes for one oscillation is four pi seconds our frequency is the reciprocal of that so one over four pi this would be one over four pi oscillations per second what about our displacement at time zero just plug in zero if i plug in zero one half times zero is zero sine of zero is zero zero times anything including negative three is still zero so this displacement is zero at time zero it is at rest when the situation starts you can see it from the function also if this is a negative sine function both positive and negative sine functions start at rest so this would tell you your displacement is zero at time zero and lastly the initial motion this is where you have to think about it think about what negative sine functions do negative sine functions go down when they start so this is like someone hit something downward this would be going down at the start so it's initial motion is downward not upward it's kind of nice for sine because positive means upward and negative means downward cosine's opposite though positive cosine functions start down at the beginning and go up for negatives at the beginning let's try one a little different let's work on a cosine function so so our displacement is negative 2 cosine of 2t is it still harmonic simple harmonic motion yeah cosine functions do the same thing as sine functions in that they repeat forever at the same maximum amplitude so we still have a simple harmonic case what is the maximum displacement that's still a that's still an amplitude question so we look at the the very first number this number in front of cosine or sine and we take the absolute value the maximum distance away from rest here is 2. now because the period for cosine is the same as the period for sine 2 pi we can find the period the same exact way take 2 pi and divide by the number in front of your variable that omega that 2. so if i simplify we're going to get pi so it takes pi seconds for this to complete it's one full oscillation these are typically in terms of seconds if not you'd have a different time unit but it would be whatever that period is time units to create one oscillation frequency is the reciprocal so it'd be one over pi oscillations per second how about its displacement at times zero two ways to do it either just plug in zero and that's fine two times zero is zero cosine of zero is one one times negative two is negative two this starts at negative two units or negative two meters below rest at time zero so mathematically displacement is negative two that means the tune is down what that means verbally is this starts two units or two meters in this case if we're using meters below its resting position right when you start so someone held this down and let it go held it down two minutes two meters and let it go um it's initial motion well now you could have answered this question by looking at the graph and we could do that so here's cosine what would have a display what would our negative cosine look like a negative cosine is like the purple one it starts down here and goes up would that have told you that your displacement is two units below rest yeah two meters below rest now how about initial motion think about this if this is a negative cosine graph like we have its initial motion would be upward so when you pull something down and let it go its first inclination of motion would be up not down up this is where some students get confused they think negative always means down it does it with cosine a negative graph would start climbing upward immediately i hope it's making sense i hope you understand the negative cosine starts upward i hope you're seeing the differences between sine and cosine cosine functions start away from rest at their initial position last one and then we're done how about d our displacement function equals six plus two cosine pi over two t oh my goodness is it still simple harmonic motion yes because that's what cosine does what in the world is a six the sixes initial starting position above zero but it's still its resting position it's like um it's like you're saying hey i'm holding this this ball six feet of or six meters above the ground now from there it's just holding there on a spring now hit it what's gonna happen it's gonna start at six meters but then from that position it'll climb it'll go below it'll come back up but it's in its like resting position is not at zero that would be like at the ground anyway so maybe this is a little more realistic we have this thing that's hanging six meters above the ground from there we're going to swing it back and forth so some sort of simple harmonic motion is still simple harmonic motion what's its maximum displacement from rest not eight why because six is its resting position from there it will climb two or go down two that's fine but it's only changing two units two meters from its resting position so its maximum displacement from rest is still two that's why the amplitude has nothing to do with a vertical shift our amplitude is from where it is how much does it go up and how much does it go down is at six has nothing to do with a vertical shift that is a vertical shift um it's just the absolute value of the coefficient of your function so it would just be absolute value two it's just two that's how much it's changing total from its rest at six meters how about the time for one oscillation still a period question so our period is still two pi because that's cosine divided by pi over two in our case which would still give you four so this is still four seconds per oscillation or the reciprocal of that is one-fourth of an oscillation per second that's our frequency how about our displacement at time zero now before we do this this is displacement from rest not total above the ground idea that would be a different question what would its total be from a height of zero and you'd say okay plug in zero and you would get eight pi over two times zero is zero cosine zero is one one times two is two two plus six is eight that would be total height if you're going displacement from rest then you stop here and you don't have the six because its rest is at six so displacement from rest at type zero is 2 still and lastly what's its initial motion think about what cosine does a positive cosine function even if you shift up six units so like two cosine pi over two t plus six would be shifted up six units it's still a positive cosine function it still looks mostly like this it might shift up but its initial motion would be downward positive cosines cosine functions from their starting position initially drop they do not climb so this would be down i hope i've given you a good introduction into simple harmonic motion um like i said we're not going to be covering damp harmonic motion in this video but for simple harmonic i hope that now you understand the interplay between sine and cosine and the functions that you get i hope you understand the initial motion and the displacement from this this resting position and where you start up or down depending on whether you're talking about sine or cosine so hopefully you enjoyed the video i hope it made sense to you and i'll see you for another video 

Transcript for: Introduction to Polar Coordinates (Precalculus - Trigonometry 36)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video i'm going to teach you about polar coordinates i think why leonard why do you have to teach me about a whole new coordinate system i just got a handle on x y like really good now you got to go screw everything up and tell me about something brand new why do we do that why do we teach you something like x y chord and playing and then all of a sudden throw something like polar coordinates at you you go hey learn this too because it's fun it is fun but honestly it's it's important what happens later on in math is that polar coordinates what i'm going to teach you today can actually make a lot of your math easier especially in calculus 3 some parts of calculus 2 sometimes graphing with polar coordinates is a whole lot easier than x and y why because for things that are not functions that don't pass the vertical line test they actually become functions using polar coordinates which means we don't have to break it up and graph it like piecewise functions we can be really annoying it also makes a lot of calculus easier for certain shapes things like spherical coordinates things like cylindrical coordinates are based on this idea polar coordinates and then we extrapolate from there so learning this number one can be a very very useful tool now can let you graph things that aren't even functions in x and y but r and polar coordinates can make certain uh certain things in calculus 2 and 3 a lot easier so that's that's why we're learning it so what in the world are polar coordinates polar coordinates are a way to graph points without using x and y in a rectangle but instead an angle and a distance and so here's the important things to know about polar coordinates polar coordinates have something called a pole acts like an origin and a polar axis acts like the x-axis and from there we can go positively or negatively a certain angle and then from that pole a distance out positive r or negative r so the key features here are the polar axis is a whole lot like the x-axis it's a horizontal line but it does definitely have this starting spot this this pole that we we treat kind of like an origin so how polar coordinates work is an ordered pair just like x and y but instead of x and y it gives you a distance from the pole from that point gives you a distance from that point along a certain angle that that point makes with the x axis or the polar axis if we take a ray and go out on the angle so so basically we say hey here's where you start go up a certain angle and then go out that distance and you will you will reach a point notice how with a given angle and a certain distance r you'll get a unique point we don't get like several points here we get one point for a given angle and a certain distance from the pole so we're going to practice the heck out of this a lot of examples but here's some things to remember i hope that you remember that positive angles are measured counterclockwise and the same thing happens here if we have a positive angle we'll measure it counterclockwise from a polar axis negative angles are measured clockwise so we measure clockwise from a polar axis positive r is a distance from that pole along that ray that you make really from the polar axis so we use our angle counterclockwise for positive and then from there r is the distance along that ray from that pole negative r would be the distance along that ray in the opposite direction and so we'd measure basically positive r and then reflected about that pole so we're going to practice right now one of the things to remember is that this ordered pair while it is ordered it's not x and y it's r the distance from the pole and theta which is the angle that we make of the polar axis so let's try a few of these things how about like two comma pi over four one of the things that you used to hear is just really the layout like what the coordinates actually mean so when we read two comma pi over four and we say these are in polar coordinates the first number we come to is the r is the distance from that pole now i want you to really recognize that positive r is going to be measured along the angle that you just you have right here negative r will be measured along that angle in the opposite direction of positive r and so we'll talk about that when we get to those those negative r's the second number you get is an angle with that polar axis so positive means counterclockwise and negative means clockwise the first thing i do all the time in polar coordinates is really look at my angle and i find out where i'm at first so if i'm talking about positive pi over 4 and this is my polar axis and that's the pole then i'm talking about from that axis going counterclockwise pi over four that puts us about here i'm also going to show you how to do some of this on a polar graphing system uh so you can find that sort of graph paper just like a graphene with polar coordinates and it pops up but from here we're going positive or counterclockwise power before it's about right there so i know that my angle is given by that number the second coordinate in our polar coordinate system um so that ordered pair says this is the angle you're making with the polar axis i've just done that now along that ray that you have just created you're going to go two units how in the world are we supposed to judge two units right now you're just kind of estimating we're approximating two on that you can be very accurate so i'll show you that in just a minute but we'd say okay let's imagine this is one and this is 2 we would stop right here that point is two units away from the pole and it's made an angle of pi over four with the polar axis this is how we graph polar coordinates it's just a matter of locating what your angle is doing and then going along that that angle that ray that the angle creates the certain r or the distance away from the pole let's switch it up a bit let's talk about negative two comma pi over four now negatives can be a little tricky for students to understand right right at the beginning because what we're really doing is we're going pi over four is an angle and then we're going to reflect about the pole so any time you see a negative r really what it says is graph this like you normally would graph the the counterclockwise angle graph the distance from the pole along that angle along the right and then go in the opposite direction if your r is negative so the whole process here would be okay i've got my negative 2 pi over 4 let's find a ray that's at pi over 4 from the polar axis well that would be such a raid this would be pi over 4 from a polar axis now let's go out positive 2 from there positive 2 from there be about there so what negative 2 does it says okay now that that's positive 2 i'm just going to go in the opposite direction from that if you remember i talked to you a while back about about negative r in some of our our sine cosine tangents remember trigonometry on the unit circle and so if your r is negative it reflects you about the origin if your r is negative here it does the same thing it reflects you about this origin that we call the pole so pi over four comma two it's here negative two says flip me 180 degrees or pi around that that pole that pole right there so we would just extend this the opposite direction and go out the same units this would be negative two comma pi over four you've gone up pi over four and then the opposite direction of that ray from positive 2. it can be confusing until you get the hang of it but this is how these polar coordinates work you use your angle first positive goes along the array you just created negative goes in the opposite direction of the ray that you have just created now is there a different way to look look at that is there a different way to arrive at the same point but with a different angle notice this doesn't contradict what i said about one r and one theta gives you a unique point that's that's true um it doesn't give you two points at the same time that would be non-function but we can arrive at the same point in polar coordinates with different angles as well so instead of going up pi over four and then reflecting from negative two could we get that exact same point with a positive r and a different angle well what if we tried positive two comma five pi over four so from our polar axis we say we wanna go five pi over four man i hope you remember what five pi over 4 would do pi over 4 is here then we'd have 2 pi over 4 that's pi over 2. 3 pi over 4 that's here 4 pi over 4 would make pi think about y 4 pi over 4 is exactly pi so 5 pi over 4 would go all the way to pi and then one additional pi over 4. because our r is positive we would go along that direction of that ray so we'd say okay a long theta two units puts us right about if that's one unit puts us right about here we would end up at exactly the same point that pi over 4 negative 2 does and there's something that we're going to get from this we're going to get that you can adjust our theta there's ways to manipulate it so r theta is exactly the same thing as negative r comma theta plus or minus pi what's that mean in plain english it means that if you add pi to your angle or subtract pi from your angle and reverse the sine of your r you'll end up at the same place let me say that again if you add or subtract pi to your theta it's going to put you 180 degrees or pi on the opposite side of that angle if you reverse your r you'll end up in the same place so for for instance if i add pi to pi over 4 i get 5 pi over 4. if i reverse my sign from negative 2 and to positive 2 i end up at the exact same point exact same point so this is always true r comma theta equals negative r and theta plus or minus pi if you if you go on the opposite side of the pole so add pi and reverse your sign on your r you'll end up at the same place the other thing that we can think of is much like on a unit circle if you just keep on adding 2 pi well you end up at the same point yeah or subtracting 2 pi so r theta also equals r comma theta plus or minus two pi you can just keep on going around and around and around and getting the same point over and over and over again so we can get the same point with different angles and with different r i'm going to recap this for about 30 seconds what i'm going to do is give you a couple more examples and then illustrate how to use this this graphing system on the like polar coordinate graphing system which is kind of nice save yourself from estimating what our angles are which is what we've done right here so the whole thing the all about polar coordinates is they're very useful for graphing non-functions in terms of x and y a lot of different functions and they're used to make math simpler later on so they're valuable to know how they work is is similar to x y coordinates in that you're given two numbers in order and they do a certain thing x tells you how far to go along the x-axis y coordinate told you how far to go on the y-axis and you get a point at that that intersection of x and y we get something very similar here we get from your polar axis go up or go down angularly positive you're going counterclockwise negative you're going clockwise that's the second number the second number will always tell you what angle you need to make with your polar axis from there you'll stop right you'll stop at some angle from there the distance from the pole to where you stop along that that ray that you're creating is given by r so r says once you've done this angle measure measure from the pull out and where that that number stops that is where your point is that's exactly what we've done here so 2 would be the distance from the pole to the point negative 2 that's the distance from the pole to the point remember that while theta is positive counterclockwise and negative clockwise r does something a little bit different r says positive you're going along the ray that the angle makes negative you're going in the opposite direction of that ray so basically you're adding pi to whatever this angle is that's why i've told you this right here you can always graph negative r comma some angle by adding or subtracting pi and getting back to a positive r you always change it like that just kind of nice saves us a little bit of a headache in dealing with negative r that's quite a bit more difficult to deal with let's come back let's try a few more examples and then i'm going to illustrate how to use that all right let's give a few more of these a try how about 3 comma negative pi over 3. so if you're told that these are polar coordinates we can graph them by really understanding the second coordinate first that is the angle that you make with the polar polar axis what's negative pi over 3 remember that positive angles move counter clockwise negan move clockwise so this is telling you from that polar axis i want you to go negatively or clockwise pi over three that's going to drop a third of the way from zero to negative pi and so we're going to do exactly that so negative pi over 3 is about right there so we're saying this is negative pi over 3 then look at your r if r is positive you're going to go along that ray that you just made three units so from this pole out one two three we end up right about there that's one point notice the the ray keeps going but your point stops your point is in one location so the point is negative pi over three you go out three units from there along that ray and you're done this is the location that point now how about 3 comma 5 pi over 3 notice what's happening i'm creating for you the same exact point but we can get there three different ways so if we talk about 5 pi over 3 5 3 is a positive angle we're looking at this saying this is polar i know my r i know my theta my theta is positive so from my polar axis i would go positive or counter clockwise one two three pi over three would be right here five pi over three would be another one pi two pi over 3. so 5 pi over 3 is 1 2 3 4 5. the exact same angle as this now think about this one full revolution is 2 pi 2 pi minus pi over three is five pi over three it's why it gives you this coterminal angle so if we go five pi over three and then from the pole it says hey you're going positive positive three units so i've made my ray i'm going along there one two three that's going to give me the same exact location that point now it's a different angle isn't it so it was done differently but the location is the same this also kind of shows you this it says you're going to get exactly the same point if you add or subtract 2 pi from your angle well that's what we did negative pi over 3 plus 2 pi that's the same thing it's just 5 pi over 3 same location different angle how about 2 pi over 3 as your angle and negative three two pi over three is positive so we're going to measure this from our polar axis positively or counterclockwise two pi over three is one two pi over three about like that however negative r's are a little bit challenging to deal with because you have to remember to go in opposite directions so i would really imagine this to be kind of a dotted line like this is this is my ray but really i'm going to be going in the opposite direction 180 degrees completely different direction well that's this way and i would go along that three units so positive 3 would be 1 2 3 here negative would be in the opposite direction that should make sense negatives are opposite of positives so if positive 3 would have been here negative 3 would be in the complete opposite direction of that 1 2 this would be negative 3. and we get the same location all three times what this tells you and actually you could change it if you if you took and said i want to change my negative to a positive what do i have to do i have to either add or subtract pi okay so let's do that so here's what this says i can change this to a positive but i have to add or subtract pi to do it let's say that i add pi to this if i add pi 2 pi over 3 plus 3 pi over 3 is 5 pi over 3. but i also said you could subtract pi and get the same thing so if i want to change my negative r to a positive all i have to do is add pi or subtract 5 i just added pi i got that same point or subtract pi 2 pi over 3 minus 3 pi over 3 is negative pi over 3. that right there is why there's multiple ways to get to the same point and i hope you see that i hope you see that we can get to the same point in multiple ways because we can take negative r's change them to positives we we have the ability to go across the opposite side of that pole given that negative r so if we just add pi or subtract pi we end up at the same point if you take a different angle with a negative r you'll end up at the same point that can be a little confusing because there's multiple ways to get to the same place but it's also a little bit freeing because you can change if you don't like negative r you could change it to a positive by adding or subtracting pi hope that makes sense to you um right now what i'd like to do is take some of these and do them here so imagine we had 3 comma negative pi over 3. here's how to use a polar coordinate system if it's given to you these circles these concentric circles going out they count as units so typically this would be one two three four five all the way to nine i've given you one half one one and a half two just so you can see uh see a little bit better so i'm counting this as one skip one two skip one three skip one four and then four and a half our angles are also given which is so nice because you don't have to estimate them so let's graph all of these and make sure that we're seeing the same thing how would we graph three comma negative pi over three well firstly locate your angle so if this is your polar axis this is at zero or at two pi negative pi over three would be right down here of course my graph says 5 pi over 3 hey but the way we're getting there is different negative pi over 3 says you are going to go clockwise from your polar axis until you hit that ray now along that ray this one right there we're gonna go down three units so one two three that's it that's where my point is now a lot of times we like to show the polar axis it's right here and we also like to show the ray it's a little bit easier to follow but this would be negative pi over three as your angle and positive three is your array so three comma negative pi over three if we did uh positive 3 comma 5 pi over 3 we're doing the same thing so here's your polar axis we'd go 5 pi over 3. well let's find it clockwise is negative counterclockwise positive so all the way here it's pretty easy to find because they tell you five pi over three and so we go okay all the way around here but we'd still go to the same exact distance from the pole so we've done our angle counter clockwise because it's positive 5 pi over 3 then down 1 2 3 along that ray that 5 pi over 3 makes with a polar axis that's the same exact point this is really nice actually if you're going to do negative r so with negative r we're going to go to the same exact angle that we we showed over here earlier so we're going to go to positive 2 pi over 3 so let's see from our polar axis up 2 pi over 3 is right here so i'm thinking this is the ray that's created by two pi over three i would go up let's let's see three units from there if i would have three units from there that's one two three this would be positive three so how negative three comma two pi over three works is identify your ray i've done it and then negative three is graphed in the opposite direction of that well look at that the opposite direction or 180 degrees or pi difference is along 5 pi over 3 or negative pi over 3 that's what this says right there it says either one of those will give you the same point so this says hey in the opposite direction of 2 pi over 3 is 5 pi over 3 or negative pi over 3 you're just going to put that point reflected across that pole just like that that's going to give you the same exact value and so we moved 2 pi over 3 graphed up 3 and then reflected across the opposite direction okay we're going to work through a couple of them very very fast just to make sure that we're good at graphing this so we can move on a little bit and change from polar to rectangular rectangular polar coordinates and actually understand what we're getting so remember all of these are ordered pairs they start with the r the distance from that pole along the theta the second coordinate the angle that that ray makes with that polar axis so if we take a look at negative two comma zero the angle is second so zero says you are right here on that polar axis now go negative two what the world's that mean that means if you went out along this polar axis or along the ray that you've just created which isn't is nothing besides this so go along to and then reflect that or add pi to it you can always change this also so if you wanted to change the sign add pi so change the sign of your r add or subtract pi either way so if i change that to positive 2 i have to add pi or subtract pi so this would either be positive 2 comma pi or positive 2 comma negative pi and will get you the same location now you are graphing that point but you're using using a different point to actually assess where it's at so okay so negative two comma zero says you have a you have an angle of zero this would be positive two negative two would just be on the other side one two units right there if you wanted to do this this would be positive pi and then go out two units from there one two you're ended up at the same exact place okay how about negative three comma pi use your angle first so pi says we're going to go all the way to here pi radians away from that that polar axis so we've gone an angle of pi now if we had positive 3 it would be 1 2 3. negative 3 says at this point you're just going to reflect this so 1 2 3 we'd actually end up right there so negative negative 3 comma pi says go pi and then reflect on the opposite direction that could you change it could you find this out a different way change the value of your r add or subtract pi to your angle so i changed the sign of my r to positive 3 i subtracted pi that should be the same exact point here's an angle of zero and one two positive three exactly the same how about two comma negative five pi over four are angles second negatives mean clockwise for your polar axis so negative five pi over four you might do some counting remember though that you're just counting pi over four or multiples of that so negative pi over four would be one two three four five this is the same thing as negative five pi over four now along that ray that we've just created from the polar axis negative five pi over four we're going to go along that positive 2. all this this is great i like the positive r because i just have to go along that array so that would be 1 2 right there so we went negative five pi over two and then out two units along the ray that that angle makes with our polar axis can you think right now about what other angle you could use to get that maybe two what could you do well you could take positive 3 pi over 4 and go out positive 2 you could take negative let's see negative pi over 4 and do negative 2 or you could do positive 7 pi over 4 and negative 2. it would all give you the same exact location i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing the interplay when you first see it it's kind of weird hopefully now it's making more sense you understand that the first number is the distance from the pole the second number tells you the angle just like on a unit circle the toughest part is the r negative r's can be a little tricky remember that's the opposite direction of the angle that you're making how about negative 3 comma 120 degrees our angle is 120 degrees which doesn't work all that well on a graph intended for radians but if you remember what 120 degrees is it's actually 2 pi over 3. so if we take a look at our unit circle or you can do your conversion um it's kind of a quick way to do it is to uh to take 180 and 120 and simplify them as a fraction so you would get that what goes into both numbers the largest number what well 60 pi over three is the same thing as 60 degrees this is two of those things so two pi over three so that's going to be 120 degrees right here now we're going to go to that race so from our polar axis we went to 120 degrees but this is negative 3. so i'm thinking yes this would be for a positive r negative r just reverses that so instead of up here at 120 degrees i'm going right across from that right down here at 5 pi over 3 or negative 60 degrees or 300 degrees any of those things and i'm going one two three units so our angle was 120 degrees we're just going in opposite direction of that or go up three one two three and then reverse or change the sign that would be negative three that's the opposite direction uh could you do it differently you could arrive at the same point but this is the one coordinate that they've asked you for we could get the same point by changing the sign of our r now adding or subtracting pi well remember that pi is 180 degrees so if i take 120 plus 180 we're going to get 300. or i take 120 i i subtract 1 8 you're going to get negative 60. that's exactly what this is this is either 300 degrees or negative 60 degrees that's 5 pi over 3. i really hope it's making sense i hope that you're seeing the interplay of negative r and the angle that you're creating with the polar axis right now i'm going to take a look at one more example and then we're going to call it good okay last one often times textbooks ask this to get you to practice and understand the interplay between negative r the opposite direction of r and how to change your angles and arrive at the same point it's very useful for what we're doing later in math so first thing can you plot the point r comma 3 pi over 4. do you understand that 4 is the distance from the pole to your point and 3 pi over 4 is the angle that you make with the polar axis plot your point first so if we take a look at this the first thing we do is identify your angle so positive means counterclockwise i'm going to go to 3 pi over 4. along that ray that we've created we're going to go out four units so that's one two three four so i've used my angle to make a positive angle or counterclockwise angle with the portal axis i've gone out four units along that ray because we had a positive r what if we would have wanted had a negative r you would have done this and then reflected it right down there now this the last three things that we're going to do sort of play on the idea of can you find the same point by using a different angle or a negative r well think about that what if you wanted to keep your r positive but you wanted this angle to be between negative pi over 2 or sorry negative 2 pi and 0. how would you get there remember that you can add or subtract 2 pi and arrive at the same exact point so instead of going this way 3 pi over 4 if you subtract 2 pi you would get there by undoing this a full circle what would that be just subtract 2 pi from your angle if you take 3 pi over 4 and subtract 2 pi you're going to get negative five pi over four now that's kept your r positive that's created an angle between negative two pi and zero now let's see if that's the same point negative five pi over four would take negative one two three four five pi over four that's negative five pi over four and you kept your positive r so you go along that ray it's just measured in the opposite direction the angle is measured in the opposite direction isn't it so negative angle instead of a positive angle this is somewhere between 0 negative 2 pi and 0 negative 5 pi over 4 and the same exact way this point is right there just in a different angular direction now what if you wanted to get to the same point but you wanted your r to be negative and you wanted to remain in 0 to 2 pi so you want to end up there but you want to use a negative r to do it how we change to negative r is by adding or subtracting pi or 180 degrees if you're dealing with degrees so we can do that let's change our r change the sign add or subtract pi now should you add or should you subtract if you subtract pi you're going to be negative that's not what it's asking for this says i want you to keep your angle positive between 0 and 2 pi so if i subtract pi it would put me at negative pi over 4. while that will give me the same point with negative r it's not the directions they've given so i want 0 to 2 pi i want to be actually i want to add pi so if i add pi to this it's going to put me right here at 7 pi over 4. so we can change the sign of our r by adding or subtracting pi we can move outside of a period as or one full rotation or revolution by adding or subtracting 2 pi we just have to follow the directions why didn't we add 2 pi here well we had to subtract so that we fit what they're telling you to do we wanted to add subtract 2 pi to fit from negative 2 pi to 0. here we have to add pi so that we can change the sign of our r but still fit in here so 3 pi over 4 plus pi well pi is four pi over four and so that would be seven pi over four let's see it works if we go to seven pi over four that's all the way right there positive 4 would be 1 2 3 4 units along 7 pi over 4. negative says you're going in the opposite direction that that's the same exact point lastly what if you wanted to keep your r positive but you wanted to be from two pi to four pi so one full revolution about that what would you do you're from zero to two pi here if you want to be from two pi to four pi you'd have to go all the way around this circle one more time you'd have to add 2 pi we can always arrive at the same point by adding 2 pi so 2 pi is 8 pi over 4 that would give us let's see 9 10 11 pi over four now let's see if that works eleven pi over four should move us all the way around the circle one time and then a couple more or three more pies over four so let's count this would be remember positive so positive 11 pi over four one two three four five six seven eight nine ten here's 11 pi over four and we go along the ray that this creates because we kept our positive r that's what it told us to do four units one two three four exact same point so i hope this all made sense i really hope that i've introduced this concept well enough that you can grasp it we did a lot of examples so that you could grasp it that you would understand your polar axis acts like an x-axis and that you start here all the time you have a pole the first thing we do actually is look at the second chord it tells you the angle you're making with that polar axis positive is counterclockwise negative is clockwise like we would expect make our angle first positive r goes along that angle negative r goes in the opposite direction of that angle we can always find the same point by changing the sign of our r and adding or subtracting pi we can always get the same point by keeping our r exactly the same and just adding or subtracting 2 pi she moves a whole revolution around that circle the negative r moves half a circle but then reflects that's really what's going on here so i hope that makes sense i hope i've shown you how to use the polar coordinate system well uh what we're going to do next is we're going to talk about how we can convert from polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates it's not too bad i'll show you that in the next video have a great day you 

Transcript for: How to Convert From Polar Coordinates to Rectangular Coordinates (Precalculus - Trigonometry 37)
hey there welcome to another video in this video i'm going to show you how to convert from polar to rectangular coordinates and the next video from rectangular to polar converting from polar to rectangular is a little bit easier a little bit nicer we'll see that right now but let's talk about exactly how in the world we do this hopefully you remember how to even graph these polar coordinates so that what a polar coordinate really does it gives you r comma theta it gives you a distance from something that we call the pole along an angle with a polar axis that this this this point creates a polar axis along some sort of array and so all of our polar coordinates are r comma theta now that's great but sometimes we actually do like to see rectangular coordinates i mean we're really used to it rectangular coordinates are x comma y so is there a way to get from here to here yeah i'm doing a video on it there's going to be a way to do it so how do we do that if we understand what this actually means that r comma theta is a distance from the pole along some sort of angle that we create with what acts as an x-axis like a polar axis then we can create a triangle so if this this is our theta from a polar coordinate and this is our r distance from the pole then what if we draw a perpendicular right down to that polar axis then if we superimpose this on an x y coordinate system this distance at that point would just be y and this distance to where that point would fall on that x-axis would just be x now i hope that you see the beauty in this because our right triangle trigonometry is going to make it very easy to convert from polar coordinates into rectangular so we thought polar just means r comma theta distance from the pole along some sort of an angle let the angle be superimposed on an x y coordinate system that point will have a certain vertical distance it's y that point will have a certain horizontal distance that's x let's use our trigonometry what in the world would we know well we know sine cosine tangent so what sine would do sine would take sine of whatever angle we have equals opposite over hypotenuse or sine of theta equals y over r cosine of theta is always the adjacent over the hypotenuse or x over r and tangent of theta just from our right triangle trigonometry is opposite over json or y over x man we've seen this for a really long time now think about what's going on here we want to somehow take what we know about r and theta take what we know here and what we know here and solve for x and y but wait a minute do you see y and x can be solved for right here if we just multiply this equation and this equation by r on both sides we're going to end up with y equals r sine theta and x equals r cosine theta this is all you need in order to convert from polar coordinates into rectangular coordinates this is it all you got to do is find your wine your eggs put them in the correct order of course x comma y but but look at what you're given if you're given a polar coordinate well then you have r and you have theta so you would have r here and you would have your angle here all we've got to do is take r times sine of the angle they give you bar times cosine of angle they give you and that will solve for y coordinate and x coordinate respectively that's all there is to it use these and only these to convert from polar to rectangular they give you everything you need here to plug in here and find this that's great we're going to practice that so what does tangent do tangent is one half of the way you convert from rectangular back to polar so if tangent theta equals y over x then the angle so notice you'll be given y and x in a rectangular coordinate until you like negative two comma three or something you'd be given this you want to find the angle how would you do that take tangent inverse this is how you'd find the angle if you're given rectangular right here y and x you can put them in a ratio y over x take tangent inverse it will give you your angle now this is a little tricky because our quadrants can get a little bit messed up we have to really watch this but you might be also thinking where's the r come in well because this also does create a right triangle pythagorean theorem works x squared plus y squared equals r squared leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared you can do that and so if you took a square root on both sides we would end up getting r equals the square root of x squared plus y squared and you're probably wondering where's your plus and minus this is why the quadrants have to be taken into account when you're doing uh rectangular into polar because without that negative r we can be in the wrong quadrant if you want to use negative r you can but most of the time it's easier to find a different angle than it is to deal with a negative r long story made sure it is this is how you convert from polar to rectangular and this is how you convert from rectangular to polar polar to rectangular is a little bit easier because you don't have to really worry about switching quadrants this can be a little tougher because we typically keep positive r and adjust our angle to fit the quadrant that our rectangular coordinates were in so find coordinate first do all your your work to figure out your polar and then locate if that's in the correct quadrant switch your angles if you have to so i'm going to write this out that this is for polar to rectangular this is for rectangular polar we'll talk about all this in the next video so we'll talk about how you can find the quadrants of your x y coordinates uh that ordered pair and then we can use that to determine your polar coordinates it's not too bad it just requires a little bit more work right now i want to focus on how we can change from polar to rectangular we'll still identify quadrants i'm going to use this to do it just to make sure we're in the right place and then we'll we'll do the math pretty quickly again it gives you everything you need all right let's try a few examples just converting some polar coordinates into rectangular coordinates uh we've already seen that it's not too bad as long as we're given polar we can identify the r or the radius really and the angle that we make with the polar axis so this this theta and according to that we know that because sine theta equals y over r y equals r sine theta x equals r cosine theta so here's here's the process going through it number one we're going to take a look at our polar coordinates here identify the r and identify the theta really write it down that way when you're converting to x and y for rectangular coordinates you know exactly where to look so when we take a look at this r is always first in polar coordinates so r is four here and our angle is three pi over two once we've done that think about what quadrant we're in now it's not such a big deal from polar coordinates to rectangular because we're never going to make a mistake on what quadrant this actually actually has but going from rectangular to polar that does make a difference and and the reason why it does is because tangent inverse only gives you back angles on quadrants four or one negative pi over two to pi over two so if something is actually in quadrants two or three we have to manipulate it that doesn't happen here but it's good practice to get in just to check your work to make sure you're there so if we think about an angle of 3 pi over 2 all the way right there and a radius of 4 or an ro4 that's 1 2 3 4. we are actually right on the negative y axis so we know that this is kind of a quadrant angle so we're not in a quadrant we're on one of our quadrant angles there so we should end on the negative y axis if we don't we've made a mistake it's a great way to check your work so now that we've got our rs4 our theta is 3 pi over 2 all we really have to do is find x and y it doesn't really matter which order you do it in so i'm going to start with y y equals r sine theta so if r r is four and our theta is three pi over two we're just going to look at a unit circle or your calculator whatever you really need to do this sine of three pi over two is negative one so four times negative one is negative four x is found really similarly but instead of using sine we're going to use cosine that's what makes sense sine was really always associated with a y type of idea y over r uh cosine's always associated with an x idea x over r so if we take our r of 4 and cosine of our angle so r cosine theta cosine of 3 pi over 2 is 0 the x coordinate of that that angle is 0 times 4 is still 0 so x is 0. if we put that together just make sure you do the right order it's not negative 4 0 it's 0 negative four remember we're converting from polar which is always r theta into rectangular which always is x y so this is zero comma negative four now the reason why we talked about the quadrant was so that you check your work 0 negative 4 is you go over 0 you would go down 4. hey that's on the negative y-axis these both refer to the exact same point it's just a different way to get there polar says find me an angle and then go a distance out from that and rectangular says use an x and use a y to rectangularly get to the same exact point that's just about it we're going to practice a few more but this really kind of shows you what you'll be doing to convert from polar to rectangular let's try this one so we have a point in polar coordinates that we want to change to rectangular the very first thing we're going to do if we are if we know we're in polar coordinates is give the r and the theta r is always first in this ordered pair so r is negative two and our theta is zero after that we're going to look at the quadrant so negative two zero in polar coordinates means your angle is zero so we're we're really on the polar axis but negative two means we're going this way so we'd say hey we're not going up it's not positive it's not negative that's at zero but negative two is one two positive but this way would be negative two so we're really over here it's on this this negative x-axis so it's another quadrant angle really let's see if the rectangular coordinates give us the same thing in order to convert we just need to know r and theta we've written it down so that we're sure what they are find x or y in any order that you want it doesn't really matter some people like finding x first because they know to put that first in the ordered pair for rectangular coordinates that's fine so x is given by whatever your r is cosine of whatever your angle is so cosine of zero is one you find out the unit circle you memorize it use a table cosine of zero is one one times negative two is negative two now notice something you don't have to worry about what quadrant you're in with polar because these negative r's and angles tell you precisely where you're at and those signs really do translate into rectangular importance system very very well so there's never really a confusion about what quadrant you have we're just going through it to make sure that we have amazing mistakes really checking your work so negative 2 times 1 is just negative 2. we do the same exact thing for the y coordinate but we're using sine because sine relates to our y sine of zero is actually zero so negative two times zero is zero the y coordinate here is zero and so we get this point negative two comma zero think about where that would be on the rectangular coordinate system negative two comma zero is on the x axis you go negative 2 on the y-axis you go zero this is exactly the same point now hopefully you see something interesting these are the same numbers but they mean something completely different in polar coordinates this means the angle which was zero this means the distance from the pole in the opposite direction of positive r which would be this way this means you go left two on the x-axis and you do not move on the y it's going to give you the same point but they do mean different things this is rectangular that's polar let's take a look at this example so we have a point in polar coordinates 6 comma 150 degrees think about what that means these polar coordinates or these these points in polar coordinates are always ordered that means that r comes first and the angle comes second so let's write that out the r has to be six here and our angle is 150 degrees i gotta throw some degrees at you eventually so we're going to write that down after that we're going to determine the quadrant of that point now even though polar coordinates into rectangular will always maintain the quadrant it's not to worry about that it's so that we can check our work so let's think about what an r of 6 and an angle of 150 degrees actually means from our polar axis 150 degrees positive is the same thing as 5 pi over 6 so we're going right to there and because the r is positive six along that that ray we go one two three four five six we'd be right about there each of these concentric circles represents one unit we'd be right exactly there now it's not to graph this point even though that's very useful it's great practice to be able to go 100 degrees and out positive 6 for r but we're getting a quadrant of 2. here's what that'll let us do when we finally figure out our rectangular coordinates it better end up in quadrant two if not we've made a mistake so this is simply to check your work we know this point is in quadrant two if we were to superimpose this on a rectangular coordinate system therefore the coordinates we get has to match that after that it's really a matter of using the right trigonometry for the right point if x relates to cosine then use cosine to figure out x we're just going to take our r of 6. and cosine of our angle which is 150 degrees cosine of 150 degrees or 5 pi over 6 is negative or negative x square root 3 over 2. if we simplify that we'll get negative three square root of three the y coordinates found really similarly but we're using sine because sine relates to y so 6 times sine of 150 degrees now because sine of 150 degrees or 5 pi over 6 same thing is one half we'll end up with six times positive one half remember at 150 degrees that y value is positive so if we put this together remember that x comes first y comes second put them in order we're going to get 3 comma negative sorry negative 3 square root 3 comma positive 3. now i almost did something there that the quadrants would have caught let's say for instance i had accidentally reversed this and got 3 comma negative 3 root 3. if i had if i'd done that positive 3 comma negative 3 3 would have been quadrant 4. i would have looked here and said wait a minute this 150 with the r of 6 is in quadrant 2 i actually got something quadrant 4 that does not work and so i know i would have made a mistake the way i have it if i put this x and y in order correctly negative 3 square root 3 is okay that's that's left that's a negative x value positive y would give us something in quadrant two quadrant true matches quadrant two these represent the same point but using different coordinate systems this is polar and this is rectangular but it's giving you the same point what's nice is these also go pretty quick so we only have like four more to do it'll just take us a couple minutes honestly let's go ahead and convert this on i want to give you some negative r some negative radius so that we can get pretty used to it especially in identifying the quadrant that's pretty important when we're just going to go from rectangular into polar we won't really be using negative r they're just a lot easier to deal with if we use positive r but we will have to manipulate some angles so we're going to practice that now getting used to where these go that way we can sort of fix that problem in the next video so if these are polar coordinates and we are given this by r theta all the time the first thing we do is identify our r our r is negative two now there's no worry going from polar to rectangular these negatives will work themselves out to be in the correct quadrants for your rectangular coordinates we just want to make sure that we we nail it the first time and understand what quadrant this point is actually in so this point in polar says you've got an r of negative two given by an angle of 3 pi over 4. spend just a second and figure out what quadrant that's in so positive 3 pi over 4 for an angle says from our polar axis we're going one two three pi over four that's right here so here's our array that we just created but we're going negative 2 so along this ray in the opposite direction is going to put me along 7 pi over 4 really or negative pi over 4 but opposite direction from positive r along that ray would be right down here one two so negative two that puts us squarely into quadrant four so i'm thinking quadrant formula write that down so quadrant four figure out x and y the same way so x relates to cosine so negative 2 times cosine of 3 pi over 4 cosine of three pi over four is negative square root two over two notice also i've kept the negative r this will work itself out you do not have to worry about it the y value the y coordinate is going to be given by negative 2 sine of 3 pi over 4. which when we simplify figure that sine 3 pi over 4 is positive square root 2 over 2 simplify our 2 so we get negative square root 2. putting this together in the right order is important we have x comma y that's positive square root 2 comma negative square root 2. this should be exactly the same location of this point according to rectangular coordinates well let's see let's see if it's at least in the right quadrant this was in quadrant 4 because we went positive 3 pi over 4 and negative 2 put us from quadrant 2 into quadrant 4. this says go positive square root two and down square root two so along the x positively along the y and negatively that puts us into quadrant four so our quadrants match this is exactly the same point but according to a different coordinate system let's come back we'll do three more then we'll be done okay moving on we've got another point in polar coordinates of negative three comma negative pi over three every polar coordinate system is in the same same manner we always do r we always do theta seconds so r is negative three we're gonna write that down along with negative pi over three for our angle now let's take a look at that negative pi over three says from your polar axis you're gonna go well clockwise really pi over three that's the same thing as five pi over three but you got there in a different way we went down here then negative three said yeah you'd go along that if you're a positive but if you're negative you're going to reverse right across that pole like basically reflect that and you're gonna or add pi or subtract pi you're gonna be in quadrant two essentially like you went to two pi over three so this point is in quadrant two if we were to put this on an x y coordinate plane now we're going to figure out x and y exactly the same way so for x because x relates to cosine we have negative 3 that's our r always r first with the sign it'll take care of where this is located on the quadrant so we're just going to make sure that we haven't made a mistake by matching our quadrants up cosine for x sine for y so cosine of negative pi over three you can use your circle and do this you can think of this as five pi over three anyway you go you're going to get positive one half you could also do something like this though just so we don't forget this remember that cosine is an even function and sine is an odd function so you could really say hey because cosine's even i can change the sign of my argument without changing the sign of my function opposite inputs have equal outputs so this is the same thing as negative three cosine positive pi over three now don't do that before you've identified your quadrant though do this in a certain order so always your r always your angle without changing it always your quadrant without changing it but when you do your math you can rely on some of these identities we've talked about but you've got to find this first so because cosine's even you can do that to figure out the value of the x coordinate of that angle so cosine pi over 3 is positive one-half cosine of negative pi over three is positive one-half so negative three times positive one-half is negative three-halves now sine is an odd function and so if you want to figure out sine of negative pi over 3 you could certainly do it by thinking of 5 pi over 3 or negative pi over 3 on your unit circle you're going to get negative square root 3 over 2. you could certainly do that you get negative 3 times negative square root of 3 over 2 it'll give you positive 3 square root 3 over 2. positive 3 square root 3 over 2. you could also at this point since you've already written this down and you're not going to change it now you could change this by its odd function into negative sine of positive pi over 3. opposite inputs give you opposite outputs for negatives so i'm going to show that just to refresh your memory odd function change the argument change the function this will give you positive 3 sine pi 3. because sine of pi over 3 is square root 3 over 2 we're going to end up getting 3 square root 3 over 2 exactly what we would have got if we looked up sine of negative pi over 3 but for some students a little bit easier and i wanted to make sure you remember about those odd functions either way we go though we now have an x coordinate we have a y coordinate we can put this together and this will be the rectangular coordinate way to represent the exact same point now all we've got to do is make sure the quadrant is right so that we haven't seen any major mistakes here if our x value is negative one and a half that's x is negative one and a half y is positive that puts us right in quadrant two exactly where we thought this is just a different way to represent the same exact point they're both in quadrant two at the same exact spot okay in the last two examples i really want to focus on what you need to be doing if we don't have things that are on our unit circle like negative 3.1 comma 182 degrees something kind of strange like we don't really we can't really look that up very easily and so you'll be using your calculator that's perfectly okay but we do still want to be good at locating what quadrant this polar this point in polar coordinates is and then making sure that this matches that so this is a point in polar coordinates write down the r first if it's negative that's fine leave it if it's a decimal that's okay too so we just have negative 3.1 with an angle of 182 degrees so if we have an r of negative 3.1 an angle of 180 degrees notice that if we started from our our polar axis here and we went 182 degrees that's like oh just past 180 that's like right here it would be in quadrant three if our r was positive but it's not so this goes all the way to 182 degrees and says ah yeah but i want to switch it up here i'm going to put you reflected back over here that would put us in quadrant 1. i hope you see that 180 degrees is here 182 degrees is just past that and we would go out 3.1 123.1 positively and this says yes but you'd go in the opposite direction of that positive r you would go along this ray in the other direction that would put you from quadrant three into quadrant one now think about this remem i hope you remember this you can always change the sign of your r by adding pi what that also means is that positive r and negative r are pi radians or 180 degrees different from one another so if you were 182 degrees at negative 3.1 that'd be the same thing as subtract 180 2 degrees with positive 3.1 this would be at 2 degrees positive 3.1 we did that math already i'm not going to repeat it but we were able to change the sine of r by adding or subtracting pi or 180 degrees this would be 182 in the other direction or 2 in the positive r direction 2 degrees with positive 3.1 as your r now anyway you go you're going to be in quadrant 1. now we can go ahead and find x and y but you're going to have to approximate them in order to get kind of useful information here so x is negative 3.1 cosine because we have x 182 degrees and y is negative 3.1 sine of 182 degrees if we use our calculator to approximate we get about 3.10 for x and about 0.11 for y why so small man i really hope i put this together for you but if you have gone 182 degrees and then reversed that because of your negative r you're going to be floating right above this at 2 degrees just barely 2 degrees and 3.1 out so what's it going to do point wise for x that's going to be almost 3.1 not it's just me just under that so this is 3.1 this is probably rounded up just a little bit and then slightly above the x-axis that's what that y tells you you're just floating right above there not very much just 0.11 because your angle would only be 2 degrees up that polar axis so does it work is this still in quadrant one yes x is positive and y is positive it's just barely in quadrant one but so is this point this was just barely two degrees up the polar axis and three point one units out so they're both in the same quadrant they actually represent the same point this is just in rectangular coordinates and this is just in polar last one now we don't see this very often but occasionally you'll have some sort of radians that aren't just pi over two or pi over four or five pi over six radians but something like three point eight radians uh it's still polar coordinates and it's still a point that's written with r and theta and we're going to write that down but when you go to use your calculator because you're going to have to approximate this a couple things firstly make sure your calculator is in radians because just like from before we have in degrees when dealing with degrees you're going to want it in radians secondly we really want to understand that pi is 3.14 about radians and so that will help you determine what quadrant this is in so we're going to write it down r is 6 let's write down 6 for r and our angle is 3.8 radians let's think about that if pi is 180 degrees or pi is 3.14 radians because all those those pi type units are in radians then pi stands for 3.14 radians where would 3.8 radians end up well it's measured positively so it still be counterclockwise but we'd go from zero radians all the way to pi radians 3.14 and then a little bit past that 3.8 radians would put us in quadrant number 3 as long as our r is positive so it says go past 3.14 to 3.8 somewhere along there you're going to go from a pole one two three four five six units out that's what that says so we are in quadrant three for sure what if it had been negative r then you'd go 3.8 radians and you would reflect back you'd go in the opposite direction of that angle 180 degrees or pi different and you'd be in quadrant one this one happens to be in quadrant three and then we go about finding x and y so we're still going to do the same thing but we're going to have to approximate so make sure your calculators and radians like we've already talked about and if we do that we're going to get 6 times cosine 3.8 radians is about negative 4.98 and y is about negative 3.85 if we use sine of three point radians times six so that's going to give us this point in rectangular coordinates same point different way of looking at it let's just make sure the quadrant matches negative x and negative y puts us right in quadrant three this was in quadrant three just just past 3.14 radians and positive six quadrant three matches it looks really good uh just a different way to look at the same thing honestly so hopefully that makes sense i hope i've explained well enough how to convert from polar to rectangular the usefulness of double checking with your your quadrants just to make sure you haven't made any errors this is going to be exceptionally useful when we go the other way around so so the next video is going to talk about what if you have rectangular coordinates for a point can you get to polar yes but the tangent's a little bit tricky because it can only return angles in quadrants four or one so if your rectangular coordinates are giving you angles in quadrants two or three you're going to have to add or subtract pi to get there we'll talk about the next video hope this has made sense hopefully you see usefulness and the connection to our right triangle trigonometry and i'll see you for another video you 

Transcript for: How to Convert From Rectangular Coordinates to Polar Coordinates (Precalculus - Trigonometry 38)
hey there welcome to another video in the last video i showed you how to convert between polar coordinates and rectangular coordinates of a point same point different representations in this video i'm going to teach you how to go between rectangular representation or rectangular coordinates of a point into polar so we need to be able to go both ways last video was really straightforward not easy because it was different but really straightforward because everything about changing between polar and rectangular representations of points works just fine there's never an ambiguity of where you are at in whatever quadrant your angle resides for polar and therefore there's never an ambiguity on what point you get for rectangular however in reverse there is you see here's the thing when we did all this work last time we said hey because we have a right triangle because theta can represent some sort of an angle in polar coordinates where your point is we can convert between them nicely because we have sine of theta equals y over x or y over r so y is r sine theta cosine theta is x over r so x is r cosine theta and this is how we changed from a polar coordinate into a rectangular coordinate for any point that we had very very nicely however there was two other things i gave you i hope you remember that the pythagorean theorem says x squared plus y squared equals r squared or r is square root of x squared plus y squared this will let you change from rectangular coordinates x and y into polar oh that's a radius that's our r that's what the r meant also because tangent of theta is y over x well theta would be tangent inverse of y over x this is what lets you change from rectangular into finding an angle and that's exactly what polar does polar gives you an r and a theta a radius and an angle to tell you exactly where this point is in a slightly different way a very different way than x and y then a rectangular coordinate system these two are how we change from rectangular to polar but there is one thing that you got to watch out for enter angle you see when we do this when we find this angle from tan inverse we have to remember what tan inverse does tangent inverse only works from negative pi over two to pi over two so a couple things can happen here firstly because tangent inverse only works from negative pi over two to pi over two if you have an angle in quadrants four or one if your point is in four or one you are set tangent inverse will work perfectly don't change the thing so if your point if your rectangular point rectangular represented point is in quadrants four or one just do tangent inverse and you are basically done one caveat to that however if your point is in quadrants two or three tangent inverse will not give you that angle it will only give you angles from four to one that's what tangent tangent inverse does it's only defined for negative pi over two to pi over two so it can't even give you angles in quadrants two or three from pi over two to three pi over two so here's what to do if you have a point in quadrants two or three and your your angle is only going to be given in quadrants four one just add pi so we're going to be plotting our points we'll determine our quadrants just like we did in the last video but we're going to understand that if our point is in quadrants 2 or 3 our angle that's given to us from quadrant 401 we just have to add pi to get there it's going to work out just fine i also said there's one more caveat if you have a point in quadrant four your tangent inverse will give you at a negative angle that's how it works from negative pi over two to pi over two is going to give you a negative angle if you don't want the negative angle if you have to have a positive just add 2 pi it'll bring it right back to quadrant 4 but it'll be a positive angle so with that that that's basically everything we're going to be doing that's a whole entire lesson we just need to practice right now so i'm going to walk you through exactly how to do these these examples change between rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates for a point there's really not a lot to it beside this we said understanding exactly what angle is being given to you based on our definition of tangent inverse so as we go through i'll be explaining everything again that i've just done but because this was not really super concrete because we have an example it'll make more sense as we go so let's get right to it the first thing we're going to do is identify what sort of a representation we have do we have rectangular or do we have polar sometimes it's very difficult to tell especially something like 3 0 that could easily represent polar coordinates with an r of 3 and an angle of 0. now it doesn't i wrote rectangular just so we would know that but understand that sometimes it's very difficult if you're not told what you're dealing with so in in this in this video we're talking about going from rectangular into polar what that means is that if we're given a rectangular coordinate representation of a point the first thing we want to do is identify the x and the r and then plot it identify where the quadrant is so x and r x is always first and y is always second for rectangular coordinates of a point and so i'm going to write this out explicitly very very similar to what we did in the last video for r theta we said hey r theta means you have a radius of one you have an angle that puts you in some position along the polar axis or from the polar axis then you go out from that that origin or the pole and that gives you a specific point well we always identified what the r was and what the theta was before we did any work on it we're going to do the same thing here our x is 3 and our y is 0. after we do that after we identify what x and y are we plot our point so x being 3 and y equals 0 because we have this rectangular coordinate system just really handy for us we're going to plot the point at 3 0. now that's right on the x-axis that's that would be like a quadrant angle really if we're talking polar coordinates or not yet but if we were that'd be a quadrant angle that's right in the x-axis so we're gonna do two things number one thing we're going to do the first thing we do we're going to find r there's really never any ambiguity with r r says just take the square root of x squared plus y squared because that is the pythagorean theorem if we do x squared plus y squared is r squared just take a square root of both sides you get r equals x squared plus y squared now you probably notice that i'm missing something i'm missing the negative and that's on purpose really we want to try to keep our r positive otherwise we'll switch back and forth between quadrants that we don't want to be in so we're going to take the positive r all the time our angle will determine our quadrant force accurately as long as we follow this so do your x and y write down that's fine plot your point identify where it is this is somewhere between quadrant 4 and quadrant 1. because tangent inverse is defined between quadrant 4 and quadrant 1 it will give us this angle perfectly that's what tan tan inverse does it works perfect from here to here that's great news so we've done our point we've labeled x and y we've plotted it we're going to find r first and we have in the back of our mind the tangent inverse is going to work fine so finding r r is just a matter of taking the square root of x squared plus y squared because x is three and y is zero that's three squared plus zero squared in our case that's just 9 the square root of 9 is 3 rr is 3. now that we have our r we move on to finding our theta our angle because tangent theta equals y over x that means that tangent inverse of y over x is going to be theta we already have the y and x the y and x are your coordinates all we've got to do is put them in a fraction in the right order and take tangent inverse and so we're going to do that so tangent inverse of zero over three there there's two things that are really important to think about number one what what the inverse really is and number two where it is so we're thinking tangent inverse of zero over three that's tangent inverse of zero tangent inverse of zero is zero so what this says is what angle gives you a y to x relationship of zero for tangent sometimes having that table is really really handy right here so tan inverse of zero is zero this is an angle of zero the second important thing to think about is where this is so what it is we got it we know it's zero but where it is is this angle well it's going to be somewhere between negative pi over two and pi over 2 but is it representing what we want it to is it representing something in the right quadrant or at least between the same quadrants and it is because our point is between quadrants 4 and 1 this angle represents this perfectly this is an angle of 0 along the polar axis now what if you had negative 3 0 negative 3 0 would be over here this angle wouldn't cut it in that case you'd add pi so for anything outside of quadrants four or one just take what your tangent inverse gives you and add pi to it it will work every time so that's kind of nice it's a little helpful hint hopefully you wrote that down um furthermore i want to talk just a little bit about the reason why this happens why tangent only gives you that you see the the problem is this y over x when we compare y over x a fraction doesn't know or a ratio doesn't know the difference between a negative y and a positive x and a positive y and a negative x it both works out to negative for the ratio it also doesn't understand the difference between positive y positive x and negative y negative x that's exactly why tangent inverse can't give you out both something in quadrants one and three positive y positive x and negative y and negative x when you put them in a fraction work out the same they're both positive that's why tangent's positive here and here and why tangent inverse cannot give you out both it will only give you out things in quadrant one the same thing happens with positive x negative y or positive y and negative x it gives you a negative for the fraction tangent inverse can't give you out both so it only gives you out quadrant four and we have to understand that if our angle if our point is somewhere between here and here we have to have add theta we have to add pi to whatever angle we're given so now that we have this we know that our r is three our theta is zero it's in the right quadrant or at least between the same two quadrants this right here would be an angle of zero and an r of three it's the same exact point it just has a different representation and so we can write it a little bit differently actually write it the same but it means something different we're still going to write 3 0. the way we write polar coordinates is r comma theta so 3 0 and that would be the polar representation of the polar coordinates for that point i hope it makes sense i hope you're seeing that it's really not a hard process you really are just using two things two formulas really r is pythagorean theorem and to find our our theta we're using a tan inverse we just have to be careful here if your point is in quadrants two or three add pi to whatever angle this gives you if your your point is in quadrant four and you need a positive angle add two pi not pi even though the period of tangent is pi we don't want to be outside of the correct quadrant so you have to add 2 pi to get back in the right quadrant but make it positive okay we're going to move on a little bit but we're going to go a little bit quicker since we've explained everything about it we're just changing between rectangular coordinates and polar x comma y and r comma theta so whenever we're given a rectangular coordinate representation of a point the first thing we want to do is identify the x and the y so in our case x equals two and and sorry x equals zero and y equals two next thing plot it see where it is because x is zero and y equals two that puts us on the y axis the positive y axis right there at zero comma two what what we would expect from there we can always find r very nicely and pretty easily there's never an ambiguity with r all you've got to do is take the square root of x squared plus y squared keep the positive r because the angle will determine the correct quadrant for you so r for the distance r for the radius and angle for the where it is at in our case because 0 squared is 0 and 2 squared is 4 the square root of 4 is 2. i keep the positive r this is how far away from the origin or the pole we really are that's great now we got to locate where this is to get the right orientation on the polar axis so our first never ambiguity just tells you how far you away from the origin and then our theta tells you where you are at in relation to your really x axis but we call a polar axis for polar coordinates so now we're going to find theta and you go wait a minute leonard you're giving me tangent inverse of 2 over 0 2 0 is undefined yes it is now think about where tangent is undefined what angle would give you tangent of an undefined relationship think about it it would be pi over 2 or negative pi over 2 or 3 pi over 2. now which one is appropriate this is why i'm giving this example so i can illustrate this concept right here you have to think about where your point is before you pick the appropriate theta before you pick the appropriate angle so we have a couple choices tangent is undefined at pi over 2 and negative pi over 2 or pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2. now which one of those actually fits this well let's see 3 pi over 2 would be all the way right here that's not where my point is pi over 2 would be right here that's where my point is negative pi over 2 would be down here that's not where my point is so the only appropriate choice to to have the same point with different coordinates is to pick an angle of pi over 2. remember our angle locates where our point is so pi over 2 says oh yes pi over 2 would be right here oh that's where my point is so we plot our point so it helps us to determine that if we hadn't applauded that we very well might have looked at this and i don't know which but to pick negative pi over 2 pi over 2 because when we're asked for this it says tangent of tangent inverse of 2 over 0 that's tangent inverse of an undefined thing tangent is undefined when our angle is what basically says what angle gives you tangent being undefined that would be pi over 2 negative pi over 2 3 pi over 2 any multiple of pi over 2 that would be a problem we have to find the right one that represents where that point is perfectly the only one that does is not negative pi over 2 not 3 pi over 2 but pi over 2. it still gives us something undefined that's still represented as well but it's locating where that point is exactly now that we have that all we've got to do is put it in a point in a polar coordinate point so that would be r comma theta that's r or two comma pi over two and that's exactly what where this point is in polar coordinates if i went pi over 2 that's saying this is where i'm at go from the pole up to or along this this angle 2 and you're going to be exactly right there it's representing the same point in a slightly different look okay next one we have a point in rectangular coordinates that's one comma negative one the first thing we're going to do to convert to polar is make sure we understand what the x is what the y is i always write it down to make sure that i don't actually change things especially when finding my angle hopefully you understand why that's so important uh if i plot this incorrectly or find my angle incorrectly have that thought down i'm going to get a completely wrong quadrant i don't want to do that so i'm going to label this as x y make sure my x is 1 my y is negative 1. so once i've done that i want to make sure that i plot this point before i do anything else even find r even though it's a little bit easy uh what i want to do is make sure that we plot this to locate where it is so because x is one and y is negative one that's going to put in put a squarely in quadrant number four so our point is one negative one i'm going to think hey this is in quadrant four but i do have it written down so i can always look back at my graph and say hey i plotted this point quadrant four fantastic that's that's why we do that so we can immediately locate where this thing is we know things about quadrant four we know that tangent inverse gives us our angles in quadrant 4 and 1. this is good news that means that i'm not going to have to add pi to this because tangent inverse works well in the quadrant where my point is that's important so i have that in the back of my mind so i've looked at said x and y are these i plotted i know where it is now we're going to find r there's never an ambiguity with r it's kind of the easy one we're going to take positive r saying how far we are away from the pole or the origin the angle is where we are and that's it's a little bit more difficult because of tangent we saw that here tangent inverse make things a little bit trickier because you have to think about exactly what angle to take in some situations like we already saw so find r though not too bad so in our case r is square root of 2. leave it as a square root that's just fine you don't need to put 1.41 or anything unless you absolutely have to approximate it leave it exact we really don't want to lose exactness here we're trying to represent exactly where this point is in a different type of coordinate system so this is exactly where this point is in terms of x and y we're finding exactly where this point is and we already have this in terms of r now we just need to find theta how do we find theta well we do tan inverse of y over x and we really want to make sure we get that as y over x that's why we label it so okay why is this x is this now we think about that so tangent inverse of negative one what in the world is tangent inverse negative one tangent inverse only gives you out net angles from negative pi over two to pi over two so tangent inverse of negative one says what angle will give me a y over x of negative one that's going to be negative pi over four that's how tangent inverse works remember it gives you from negative pi over two to pi over two so yes it works in quadrants four and one but it will only give you out negative angles for quadrant four that's going to lead us to a note here in just a second so our theta is negative pi over 4. now you're done tangent inverse works great for points in quadrants four and one since our point is in four and one tangent inverse gives us our angles in those two quadrants that's perfect we could easily write this as r comma theta or square root two comma negative pi over 4. now i did say there was one caveat for points in quadrant four we're going to write a note here if you have to have a positive angle so it says give me your polar coordinates but i want you to make sure that you're from 0 to 2 pi this is not in it this is below zero and so that would be a problem if you have to have positive angles and you have a point in quadrant four tangent inverse will only give you negative angles for that it will not give you a positive add two pi do not add pi why why not even though the period for tangent is pi adding pi would put you in quadrant two hey that's the way we're going to get angles for quadrant two find this one add pi that's perfect just like if we have a point here we're going to find quadrant one angles and add pi but if i add pi to something here it's going to give me something in quadrant 2. i don't want that i want to add 2 pi to get back to exactly where i'm at oh man i hope you remember that if we add 2 pi we get right back to where our point is we've just gone one full revolution around our unit circle that's basically the same idea if i had 2 pi i'm going to get right back to where this point is but i will have a positive angle instead of a negative angle something between 0 and 2 5 so write a little note here if your point is in quadrant 4 and you need positive angles add 2 pi for points in quadrant 4 add 2 pi not pi even to the period tangent is pi add 2 pi to get the same quadrant with a positive angle so for us that means if we add 2 pi to negative pi over 4 let's see negative pi over 4 plus 8 pi over 4 that would be 2 pi would be 7 pi over 4. we could write this equivalently as square root of 2 comma 7 pi over 4. and that would give us an r and a theta same exact point whether we do this or this or this but it does depend on on how we want to see it on what we're working with is it the same does it does it do the same thing yeah if we do negative pi over 4 that's that angle that's negative pi over four and an r of square root two hey look at that if you have a one and a one on a on a triangle like an isosceles right triangle your your your radius there your pi your your hypotenuse is the square root of two that's exactly why we got the square root of two it's pythagorean theorem this angle is negative pi over four or seven pi over four but either way you're going to get exactly the same point with a different type of coordinate system i hope it's making sense i hope you're seeing why we're using these two things to get from rectangular and polar because it relates x and y to r because it relates x and y to theta i hope you're seeing the the issue that we have with tangent inverse that because it only gives you angles in quadrants four or one negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 there's a little bit more work to do that's why i said it's a little bit harder in the last video and it is you do have to think about it you don't have to think about arc keep the positive r the angle is going to tell you where you are so r how far away you are angle where you are locates where you are so we're going to talk about what happens when we don't have an angle in quadrants four or one we already talked about some quadrant angles here which is kind of nice but we'll go ahead and deal with angles that end up in quadrants two or three next let's keep right on going so we've got a couple more points represented as rectangular coordinates we want to translate them into polar we're going to consider negative three comma three if that's rectangular which i've said it is then x is negative 3 and y is positive 3. we're going to write that down first after that we're going to plot it and we're going to start thinking about where that's at negative 3 comma 3 puts us into quadrant 2. right about there now another thing these don't have to be perfect you just really have to get the right quadrant so whether or not this is to scale or anything especially on stuff like negative 2 square root 3 who cares it doesn't really matter what matters is a representation telling you where the quadrant is why because in the back of my head right now i'm thinking r is going to be nice to find it's never going to be ambiguous for us but when i go to find my angle tangent inverse can only give me out angles in quadrants 4 and 1. negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. in fact in quadrant 4 it only gives negative angles so i have to do something with those angles if i need a positive but for angles in quadrant 2 and 3 i'm certainly going to have to add pi to whatever angle i find here so i have that in the back of my head so i've got x y i've plotted it i know my quadrant i'm in quadrant two i'm thinking about angle ahead of time now i'm going to find my r and it looks like our r is three square root two so negative three squared is nine three squared is nine not the sine is eighteen um the square root of eighteen we can simplify by by taking that and factoring that as nine times two the square root of nine is three square root of two is i don't know square root 2 but we do have the first half of our polar coordinates we have 3 square root 2. now it's time to find theta theta is still found by using tangent inverse and relating y over x that's fine but what we do is we realize that because the angle it's given us is not in the right quadrant we have to do something to it and you can probably see it here tangent has no way of telling whether you mean negative 3 over positive 3 or positive 3 over negative 3 because of the way that negatives work in fractions we explained a little while ago but there's no way for to know which is why we had to choose when we defined tangent inverse to only pick quadrants 4 and 1 because of the one-to-one function inverses have to be otherwise we'd have two options every time and tangent will let you do that so because tan inverse only gives you out angles in quadrants four and one this right here this tan inverse of negative one is going to give you negative pi over four again now really appreciate this please don't just treat this as a formula please don't treat it like oh if it's in quadrant two i just add pi you can but really think about why that is tangent inverse gave you this angle of negative pi over four from your polar axis that's going to be here it would say here's where your point is but that's not right my point is in quadrant two how do i get to quadrant two add pi that's why this works is because this is always going to be off one pi away from your actual quadrant if you are in if your points are in quadrants two or three it's going to give you something that's pi radians away so this says all right negative pi over 4 that's the wrong quadrant i'm going to add pi it'll put me into quadrant two so let's see negative pi over four plus four pi over four that's three pi over four can you see how a lot of people who really don't understand what tangent universe does they would give that and then they'd be really confused like why doesn't that work i'm doing tangent inverse it's what the notes say it does say that but because of the way tangential inference works we have to really think about what it's giving you and if we're outside of what it's giving you you just add pi to it because it'll put you in the correct quadrant because it can't give you out everything only gives you a half the unit circle so that's why this that's a no go you do not want that and sure enough when we do plot the polar coordinates with an r of 3 square root 2 and a theta of 3 pi over 4 r tells you how far away from the origin or the pole you are if you super superimpose a polar coordinate system on this that would act as your origin of the pole the theta tells you where you are so three pi over four says from your polar axis basically the x-axis you're 1 2 3 pi over 4 and your whatever that r is away that's exactly the same point in exactly the same location we didn't approximate anything about this that's perfect that's what we're looking for it matches the right quadrant that's really what we're checking here if our math is right which it is then we just represent that point two different ways in two different coordinate systems let's move on to the next one so we got another rectangular representation of a point we got negative 2 comma negative 2 square root 3. first thing we're going to do identify x identify y second thing plotted so we can identify the quadrant so negative two x is negative two comma negative two square root of three y is negative two square root of three that's going to put us into quadrant number three now you notice that i i don't really know exactly where that is negative 2 square root of 3. i don't really care as long as my quadrant is correct it's going to be just fine for us our angle might be a little funny for our for our polar coordinates but that doesn't really matter as long as our quadrant is right so i've represented this as negative two negative two square root of three it's in quadrant number three so in my head what am i thinking i'm thinking r is going to be fine we're gonna take the positive r like we do all the time just tells us how far away we are the angle is going to tell us where we are but because i'm in quadrant 3 i know that what i get from tangent inverse is not going to be the angle i need it's going to be pi radians away i'm going to be adding pi to this because this angle is going to give us something out in or this this point this tan inverse for this point is going to give us something out in quadrant 1. i'm going to have to add pi to it to get quadrant 3. so with our r we're going to take negative 2 squared plus negative 2 square root 3 squared all instead of the square root that's going to give us 4. this is going to give us 4 times 3 which is 12. so 4 plus 4 times 3 that's going to be 16 the square root of 16. so we know for sure that for our polar coordinates for this point r is four we're going to be four units away from the origin or four units away from the pole that's great news now we're going to focus on our theta so theta equals tan inverse of y over x what happens when you take negative 2 and divide by negative 2 what do you get get positive you get positive 1 times square root 3. this is why this is the last time i'll say it really this is why tangent inverse can't give you both it can't tell the difference between negative negative and positive positive and so it chooses to take the positive positive quadrant one rather than quadrant three so that we had a one-to-one function for tangent so that it would actually become an inverse how we wanted it to and so this right here is going to give you out an angle in quadrant one so this says all right um what angle gives you a y over x relationship or ratio of square root 3 over 1. i'd use my table it would be just fine what we're going to get out of that let's see sine has to be bigger than cosine so it's going to be square root 3 over 2 over one-half that's got to be pi over 3. so i know that theta here is pi over 3. let's put pi over three there for a second is that going to work well we try here's pi over three that doesn't look like where my point is at all if i go pi over 3 and up 4 along that angle that would be incorrect because that is not at all the right quadrant that i want to be in now some of you are thinking well wait a minute what if i did pi over 3 and did a negative 4 negative r that actually would work but because we prefer positive r we really like to keep r positive and angle where it actually is in the correct quadrant that's a little bit less confusing to see but it is possible to do this with a pi over 3 and a negative r reversing your quadrant that's a little bit of tricky math uh but you could do it so i don't want the i don't want the pi over three what i want is the the angle that puts me in the right quadrant with the positive r that i've already chosen so in order to do that if my pi 3 says i'm here i'm going to add pi to get into the correct quadrant so pi over three plus three pi over three that's the same thing as pi that's four pi over three and what we'd end up with is 4 comma 4 pi over 3 in terms of polar coordinates let's see if that works 4 pi over 3 would be let's see 1 2 3 4 pi over 3 and out 4 units from the origin or the pole that's going to put us in exactly the same position as our rectangular representation of that point it is the same as long as we i identify the quadrant our points in and let tangent inverse give us out the right angle for four and one add pi if you're in two or three you're going to be all set if you need positive angles and you have a point in quadrant four you have to add two pi so i'm going to come back with some awkward ones things that aren't on your unit circle we'll talk about how to deal with that okay so these look a little funny because those are decimals and we haven't really dealt with that before we dealt with some square roots which worked out very nicely things i need a circle and these are not so i wanted to give you two examples on how to deal with that thankfully the techniques that i give you typically work all of the time always work all the time because i don't like teaching two different things so this is why that i gave you draw the picture and plot your point because it will determine where whether or not to add pi or not or add 2 pi if you have quadrant 4 and you need a positive angle so that's that's why i gave that to you and so we're going to follow the same exact steps the only difference is that you're not going to be able to find an exact representation of your angle on a unit circle you'll have to use your calculator and we'll approximate that and that'll be just fine so the first thing hey we got a rectangular coordinate representation of a point let's write down x let's write down y let's plot where that is so positive 1.3 for x negative 2.1 for y puts us into quadrant 4. let's say right about there all that really matters is that we are in quadrant four that's how we're going to find our theta in just a moment so now that we've plotted that we know we're in quadrant four i'm thinking in my head this is going to give me out a negative angle i hope you see that tangent inverse is going to give me out a negative angle for quadrant four if i need a positive i'm going to have to add 2 pi i'm not going to add pi i want to stay in quadrant 4 but i would add 2 pi tangent inverse gives you out things in 4 and 1 but negatives in 4. let's find r first so with r we're going to take a square root of x squared plus y squared and you get square root of 6.1 this is exactly what r is i didn't round that at all so if you wanted an exact approximation for or exact representation of r it would be square root of 6.1 if you're okay with the approximation this is about 2.47 so you could use square root of 6.1 there or if you're approximating 2.47 that's the distance away from the origin of this point is all we need to know to know is location of as far as an angle so what angle it creates with our x-axis or polar axis in order to find that we're going to use tan inverse now that's not super nice because we can't really simplify it and it's not on our unit circle and so we're going to have to use our calculator and so what we do we just press tan inverse make sure that you are in radians please make sure you're in radians if you're going to represent this in radians or degrees if you're representing degrees most of the time we pick radians and we add pi as 3.14 or 2 pi is 2 times 3.14 to make sure we're in the right location for our quadrants so i'm going to make sure that my calculator is in radians that's about negative 1.02 radians what in the world does that mean remember what pi is pi is approximately 3.14 radians so to get from here to here would be 3.14 radians one radian is really what one rating was the angle it took to create a radius equal to the arc length where it's one and one that's really what it was and so our our run radiance about right there takes about 3.14 to get to pi exactly about 3.14 to get to pi so negative 1.02 radians is well where would it be it wouldn't be past quadrant 4 yet it'd be somewhere between here and here why because pi over 2 3.14 divided by 2 is more than 1.02 so negative pi over 2 is more negative than negative 1.02 that angle is somewhere in here that's great that's what we wanted that is in quadrant four so if that's acceptable if you have negative angles you write that down and you're done what if that's not okay well if we found anything out it's that tangent inverse only gives you out negative angles for quadrant four and only angles from four to one so if you need to keep your angle in quadrant four but you need it positive you have to add two pi well now what is 2 pi 2 pi is 2 pi radians that would be 2 times about 3.14 or 6.28 so if we add 2 pi to this we get approximately 5.26 radians what in the world does that mean that that means this you can locate this same exact point with an r of around 2.47 or exactly square root of 6.1 and either negative 1.02 radians or positive 5.26 radians think about this 5.26 radians is less than 2 pi radians it's just 1.02 radians less than that it's going to give you the same exact location at point so whether we go negative one point zero two or positive five point two six we still do end up in quadrant four that's exactly what our point told us we needed to do that's exactly where a point is just a different representation i hope that one makes sense that that gets a little wild if you don't have a picture of that you know i i don't what's negative 1.02 even mean um that that's what it means i hope i've explained it well enough for you to understand it let's go into the next one so we have one last rectangular representation of a point our x is negative point eight our y is negative two point one we're gonna write that first then we're going to locate it so negative negative says we're in quadrant three some are about right there so negative point eight negative two point one at least we know we're in quadrant three now that says something about our our theta when we get tangent inverse it's going to give us something in quadrant one we're going to have to add pi to it let's find our r first but we have it in the back of our head and if we do all the work on that if we take x squared plus y squared take a square root we'll have square root of exactly 5.05 so that is an exact answer if you need an exactness you would use this one an approximation is i took a square root i got about 2.25 so r r right now our distance from the origin is approximately 2.25 units or exactly square root of 5.05 and then we work on theta because theta's given by tan inverse all we're going to do is take our y over x but that's not our unit circle negative or negative gives us a positive it's going to be in quadrant one can inverse when using our calculator is going to give us about 1.21 about 1.21 radians now is that okay is that where we want to be because 1.21 well that's not really even to pi over 2 yet so we are about right there that's where 1.21 radians is if we go to 1.21 radians and we go out 2.25 we are the right distance away from our pole but in the wrong location we're in the wrong quadrant tangent inverse cannot give you anything in these two quadrants i've made that very clear so what do you do to get to this quadrant you have to add pi to it because pi is approximately 3.14 we can do that at approximately 3.14 will typically work most calculators have a pi button on there so we're going to add pi for anything that's in quadrants two or three add pi to the angle that you get you will be fine you can even most of the time subtract pi but you'll get negative angles so you can add pi to anything in these two anything in these two quadrants add pi to the angle you get you'll be perfect anything in quadrant four add two pi 2 if you need a positive angle so i'm going to add pi because i was in quadrant 3. the angle says i'm in quadrant 1. i'll take care of that and so if we do if we do add pi and rounded appropriately we're going to get 4.35 radians let's see if that makes sense 3.14 radians puts us about at pi pi is a little bit more than that but 3.14 radians would be here 4.35 would be past that hey we're in the right quadrant it's not yet to three pi over two that's not enough so we are all the way to here and out 2.25 that's exactly the same location that point with a different representation i really hope i've made it clear on how this works the r is pretty straightforward we do generally keep the positive i gave you one instance where you could take the negative and still get the same location but it is more difficult to see for that reason we almost always take the positive r here we let the r determine the distance from our origin or pole we let the theta determine our location four quadrants four and one you have the right angle from your tan inverse for quadrant four add two pi if you need positive for quadrants for points in quadrants two and three just add pi to the angle that you get that's about all there is to it next time we're going to talk about is how to convert equations from rectangular to polar and then a different video on polar to rectangular hope you're doing well you 

Transcript for: How to Convert From Rectangular Equations to Polar Equations (Precalculus - Trigonometry 39)
hey there welcome to another video in this video I'm going to teach you how to convert equations from rectangular equations into Polar equations so stuff with x's and y's into RS and thetas it should be a pretty fast video although I always say that and it's never ever true so it's going to be a horribly long video maybe that way it'll be actually a little bit shorter like I really intend although I want to go in depth with this stuff so you actually do understand it so what a rectangular equation refers to is an equation that be that can be graphed on an XY coordinate plane so it has x's and y's in it the two variables that represent our axes so what's a polar equation something in RS and thetas that refer to a polar coordinate system something with a polar axis and a Theta that's referring to that polar axis and a pole or Looks Like An Origin so so we're going to convert basically we're just changing x's and y's into RS and thetas now why we might want to do that is because sometimes graphing with x's and y's in rectangular coordinates are very nice works extremely well for functions really good stuff but for things that aren't functions like circles ellipses um other types of Curves like cardioids none of those are functions they can be easier to graph with polar equations and so I need to show you how to convert with that basically there's really only two things you do you find any time time that you can get an x^2 plus a y^2 replace that with R2 this is this is prime like this is what you're looking for all the time if you can find that replace that piece with r squ if not then replace any extra additional or any if you can't find this x's and y's with we've already done this haven't we this is how we converted these polar coordinates into rectangular coordinates for points and well wait if functions are just an infinite collection of points so all the points that that would graph this particular function or or nonfunction as the case may be this this curve whether polar or rectangular then wouldn't converting equations have something to do with with the converting of points we're just doing it once and for all and that's precisely what we're doing instead of converting just one point we're converting all the points of a of a function uh whether it's a polar function or whether it's rectangular coordinate function by by translating these these functions from rectangular into Polar and later on next video in from Polar to rectangular so really just two things that we do let's go through I'll walk you through maybe four examples on how we go about doing this let's take a look at 2x^2 + 2 y^2 = 3 now ultimately what we want to do to convert from rectangular to Polar is use this first use this when we can't we've already seen that when we were converting points we're just going to use it here as well so let's see if we can find x^2 + y^2 if if we can it might involve some factoring might involve combining like terms could involve adding or subtracting to both sides of an equation grouping some things but we see it right here if we have 2 x^2 + 2 y^2 and we factor out the two we're going to be left with x^2 + y^2 well this rectangular equation which is only has x's and y's there are no RS and thetas can be nicely factored to provide something that's easily translatable for us now if we do that and we notice that x^2 + y^2 is exactly what the Pythagorean theorem tells us is R 2 on a triangle or on a unit circle then we can make that substitution so ultimately look here first find as many of these as you can translate them to R squ so X s+ y^2 yeah we can substitute R 2 for that now what do you do from there solve it for R if you can and the reason why we might want to do that is because it'll be easier to see what what this actually means so if we divide both sides by two and we take a square root just like we converted our our polar equ or polar point points into our rectangular points or our coordinate systems and rectangular into Polar we kept the r positive when we convert that way we said yeah you know we could make it negative but it's easier to keep a positive R and use the angle to determine where we're at the same logic applies here whether you have a positive r or a negative R you are actually going to get the same shape here uh you're going to I won't ruin the spoiler this time uh the shape we get does not matter whether you have a positive r or negative so to keep things nice for us we're going to keep this a positive r and if we rationalize by multiplying sare root2 over < tk2 we get R = < TK 6 / 2 now what in the world is Ral < TK 6/2 well firstly does it look a little bit simpler than this maybe not if you're not used to polar equations and we haven't really grabed them yet but we will a couple more videos um if you're not really familiar that that looks simpar there's not as much junk going on but we don't really understand what it is think about what R means R is a distance from some fixed point we call it a pole Looks Like An Origin out to where the points of your function would be or or the the polar function in this case uh that that would be a constant distance there's no variable here a constant distance away from some Center Point this is giving us a circle wait a minute R stands for a radius this says your radius equals < TK 6/2 this is a circle with a radius of exactly that it's just going to give you a circle around the pole that's all that's going to happen it says whatever your Theta is there's no place to plug in Theta so whatever your Theta is anywhere around there it's going to give you a fixed distance < T 6 over2 whatever that is that is going to be a circle now does it make sense that this is also a circle do you you remember that that circles are x^2 + y^2 if you have the same coefficient we could have divided everything by two and got x^2 + y^2 = R2 this would have been if I divide by two R SAR would have been 3 over2 the square root would be < 6/2 a circle with a radius of < 6 over2 same stuff if You' ever seen conic sections I've taught it before then that gives you a circle that's kind of interesting I hope that's interesting the center would be at the origin just like this Center is at the pole th this is why it's a little bit nicer is because this acts as a function for us where this one doesn't you have to know about conic sections you don't here um this is a function in terms of polar coordinates with a polar equation so every single unique Theta is going to give you out the same radius than every single point around there is a one input gives you one output idea and that's that's very nice so this is one reason why we convert into Polar so it makes it a little bit simpler for things that are like circles and ellipses and things like that uh it's a little bit easier to graph when you get used to polar equations and polar coordinates um and when you it lets you deal with functions a little bit nicer let's move on to the next one one of the first things that we do especially when we dealing with things like x^2 + y^2 = x when we're converting from rectangular equations into Polar we are always looking for this first if you ever see x^2 + y^2 replace it with r 2 there's very few exceptions to that now what about the things that you can't replace so x to the first power or maybe you just have an X squ or Y or an extra somewhere and you can't Factor it uh this was nice because you factor out a two but let's say you couldn't factor out the two then you would have like a 2X plus just y^2 this wouldn't work so well you can't get those coefficients to be the same so you wouldn't be able to factor it if that's the case and this doesn't work for everything that you have start reverting back to your individual variables so x^2 + y^ S is r^ 2 I nailed that but with the X itself I can't wrap that up in any way shape or form with this this is the nicest one then we get a revert to here so if x is our cosine Theta which we've seen before we're just going to make that substitution so now that we've done that we've actually converted from rectangular into a polar equation but there's a little more that we can do and actually you have some options if you remember to rectangular equations like just stuff with x's and y's normally we can't really divide both sides of an equation by a variable because we start to either lose Solutions or we start to deal with some domain problems and basically the same thing happens here there there is one exception though a lot of times textbooks will tell you ignore the solution of R equals z why because then you can divide both sides by R and cancel it out so if you did that okay if if I'm allowed to Discount the solution of R equals 0 then when I divide both sides that's gone we just get rals cosine th we're going to discover in a couple more videos what that actually is the shape that that creates on the graph now what if you're not allowed to do that uh what if it doesn't say that I can ignore that well then you can do a couple other things you can get everything on one side now that's something we've seen before we've seen that a lot in fact with lots of different equations of get everything on one side and Factor we could totally do that then we'd get r^ 2 minus r cosine theta equals zero if we factor out the r we really do get to use a zero product property and create two different equations here r equal 0 or Ral cosine thet that here is exactly what we got here the only additional solution would be the the single point imagine this if you have a radius of zero it says Ah radius zero you are right at that pole it's basically the C it would be the center of a circle with no radius just a little dot that's why most textbooks would exclude that and say don't worry about that uh which allows you to divide by by R and exclude that one solution um some don't and so you'd show both of them but remember that you do have a couple options here so let's move on we've got x^2 = 4 y we're going to go through the same process that's rectangular rectangular means we'll work on a rectangular coordinate system that's x's and y's everything's in terms of x's and y's is it a function actually it is a function in terms of Y if you divide it both sides by four you would get a parabola hopefully you see that we're going to now write this in as a polar equation and see what exactly this would do so in order to do that though we're looking really at two things first look for this if you have an x^2 + y^2 anywhere you can get that make that happen first if not replace your x with r cosine Theta your y with r sin Theta I see an x s but I don't see a y^2 and I can't make it and so what happens here is we've got to replace the X with our cosine Theta and the Y with r sin Theta we've already talked a long time ago about why this works on a unit circle we're now just use it to transform translate or convert if x is R cosine Theta then x^2 is R cosine Theta quantity squar oh my goodness do not just Square this thing it happens from time to time we make little mistakes but really be conscious that X is R cosine Theta if you're squaring X you're squaring that whole thing and four four stays but why is our sin thet it's really nice if you've memorized that cosine with X and S is with Y that way these work a lot nicer when you're plugging these in you go oh yeah Y is just R and then I know Y is associated with s x is just R and well X is associated with cosine now we're going to square the r and square the cosine Theta and again you do have a couple options if R is not allowed to be zero it says just exclude that you could totally divide by by R right now and remove it from your equation you'd end up getting divide both sides by R you get R cosine you get 4 sin thet hopefully you see div by R would eliminate one of these RS one of those RS and this is what you'd end up getting if you are allowed to exclude the R equals z that's a big if what if you're not well then another thing we can do is see if we can get everything on one side and again Factor so we've just subtracted now some textbooks say that's great that's perfectly fine just leave it and you can I think that's okay if you need to go a little bit further you can Factor the r and if you see it we really do have that that two two things two equations that we could get out of this R equals 0 and this equals Z this would give us that that really non Circle sort of a point uh the radius is zero just going to give you that point along with this thing there so we could get that uh the other thing that we could do from here if you choose to do this or if you're allowed to do this you can solve for R explicitly a lot of times we like to do that so if you divide both sides by cosine s thet you could leave it like this unless you really like identities then you can you can separate that cosine squ what if you wrote this as cosine time cosine well then you have 4 sin thet over cosine Theta time cosine thet it's still cosine squ yeah this is cool because sin Theta over cosine Theta is tangent and 1 over cosine Theta is SEC Theta there's just a number of ways you can go about getting something different because of all the identities that we do have in this so I hope that makes sense ultimately honestly if as soon as we did this we converted it from rectangular into Polar that's really all that it takes simplifying from there is as a matter of how far you want to go um what's expected of you I would say minimally you would do this or divide by R if you're allowed to do that this is okay divide both sides is a little bit better use identities that's really up to you some people say that's perfectly fine because it's already in signs and cosines and we're more comfortable with those anyway for graphing so that's that's really to you um what I wouldn't do is just start dividing both sides by R if you're not explicitly told that zero is uh that R equals 0 is not allowed so I'd be I'd be very careful with that let's try a couple more so how about 2 X Y = 1 again I'm not seeing any x^2 or Y x^2 + y^2 I can't get that but every time that we can't do that just replace your x's and your y's with what they are equal to here so R cosine Theta and R sin thet so here we get 2 x is our cosine thet Y is R sin Theta equal 1 if we multiply through we're going to get an R squ remember this isn't a distribution concept you don't have to foil or anything there's no addition there's no subtraction you're just multiplying all of these factors and because we have R * R you can get R 2 that does leave us with cosine Theta sin thet = one let's go a little bit further notice there is no R over here you cannot divide by R if you do you actually lose a solution R equals z um if if it's allowed and so be cautious of that when you end up dividing by by that R you do technically have to write R equals z somewhere in there to show that you have that solution um but for here we can't do that anyway however something that we can I hope you see this if we reorder this and put the two here and the and cosine reversed so just reassociate it that is an identity and occasionally see these pop up and they're pretty nice if you have an identity in there use it that's fine this is the double angle for sign so 2 sin Theta cosine is s of 2 th I normally write the identity next that we're using but this is the identity that's exactly what it is so we get R 2 sin 2 Thal 1 a lot of times you can just leave it like this if you're required to solve for R it would take a little bit more work you'd have to divide and explicitly solve but most of the time you're okay writing that um the reason is because this does not even create a a function for R um much like y^2 would not create a function in terms of Y this would give you two outputs for every input so I'd feel comfortable just leaving that let's go into the next one so x - 3 qu^ 2 + y^2 = 9 how in the world do we deal with that I don't see anything well think about what would would happen instead of just putting in R cosine Theta for x and R sin Theta for y what would happen if were to distribute that would you end up getting at x^2 + y^2 if you do then distribute that a lot of the times we distribute first before we substitute just to make sure that we collect all of our X squ and Y squ to make them r s so I'm going to choose to distribute that that will be x^2 - 6X + 9 now we have a couple things going on firstly our nines are going to cancel If I subtract nine from both sides we're going to get zero for those constants also I'm seeing X2 and a y^2 I'm going to group those once we have grouped them every time you see X2 + y^ S replace it with r s when you're converting from rectangular to Polar that's a great thing to do so this is R 2 however this x can't be paired up like that with any other y's we don't have any other things to pair it up with anyway it's not being squared so we have to replace that x with r cosine Theta and we see something that's that's pretty common when you have these RS we saw that already you can factor that um if you added 6 R cosine Theta on both sides you could divide by it as long as you remember that you're removing a solution there um so we we want to be very careful when we're doing that so we end up getting R = 6 cosine Theta you do have this solution of Ral 0 so be cautious of that if it's not allowed you can discount it and that's just fine this is really the one that we're looking for anyway so that that's the good one um a lot of textbooks will let you leave it like this if you want to keep going this is fine there's a lot of different options really um what do I prefer it kind of kind of depends on what we're doing with it if we're graphing it that'd be a lot easier I'll tell you that we'd have a point at the center though if R is allowed to be zero so we'd have to be cautious of that uh also sometimes this is included in there somewhere so that is something where textbooks don't even care about this because it's often times included what is this anyway well this is a circle how do you know it's a circle that's a circle shifted to the right three units with a radius of three if you're familiar with your conic sections that there is a circle in rectangular coordinates that has a radius of three shifted to the right three that circle is going to come back and hit the origin that's exactly what that's giving you and so this is included there in fact if you take a look at Pi / 2 or 3 pi/ 2 you're going to hit that zero and graphically those would be the same so let's go ahead and come back with just a couple more examples and then we done okay these really will be quick I promise this time this one time um why I'm giving these to you is because you're going to find that for a lot of things like normal conic sections rectangular looks confusing and polar is nice but for a lot of rectangularly driven functions like constants like a vertical line or a horizontal line or a diagonal line like that one with the slope of square three often times they they're about the same or maybe rectangulars easier that's really easy to graph so so x = 3 is a vertical line at x = 3 y = 7 is a horizontal line at y = 7 y = > 3x is a diagonal line through the origin with a slope of theun of three can we convert them to Polar yes I'm going to show you how um sometimes that's valuable if we need to but a lot of times it kind of depends on what you're doing with it we won't want to just convert to polar equations just because if it's already kind of nice to deal with so if you have to and you don't have an x^2 + y^2 you just have X and Y convert the X with r cosine thet try to solve for R if you can so if we divide both sides by cosine Theta we end up getting R = 3 1 cosine thet is see thet now which one's nicer to graph probably that but understand this these will give you these same things so if you graph this and you graph this and superimpose the two coordinate systems so XY plane and the polar plane they're going to give you the same exact vertical line it's going to be the same um but hopefully that makes sense that some are easier depending on the context that you're that you're dealing with these in um so with lines and things like that with normal functions rectangular is nice conic sections circles ellipses these are nicer let's try yal 7 I don't see X I don't see a y^ I don't see them together all I see is a y let's replace it with r sin th and if we realize that 1/ sin thet is cose Theta this is 7 cose thet so a horizontal line of yal 7 can be graphed with a polar equation of Ral 7 cose Theta which one's nicer again that that one is if you're just going for the graph that's probably nicer but we can convert it all right let's try the last one y = < TK 3x this one's a little tricky but it's kind of fun I hope you appreciate it check this out hopefully it blows your mind what if we divided both sides by X do you remember that tangent Theta is y/x we can replace that so if we divide both sides by by X we get tangent = 3 so wait a second if tangent thet equal theun 3A is tangent inverse of thek 3 what's that mean tangent inverse of the 3 says what angle gives you out the y / x coordinates of < 3 over 1 or 32 over2 if you're looking at the unit circle that's going to be let's see pi over 3 th equal pi3 now get this that's a diagonal line what's a diagonal line do a diagonal line maintains the same slope or the same angle in relation to to that xaxis that is the angle so all this is saying is you have an equation theal 3 just go to the angle it's going to be all the points along that exact angle and that would create a diagonal line going through the origin just like that says I hope it makes sense I hope you're seeing it kind of these just for fun so that we could see how vertical horizontal and diagonal lines look in polar equations that one's actually not too bad at all kind of shows you the angle at which you draw that line so I hope I've explained it well enough what you're looking for when to use the appropriate thing and how and when you can simplify especially factoring r or if you're allowed to divide by R if R equals z is not allowed as a solution if it is then you have to show it hopefully makes sense next video we're going to come back and I'm going to talk about how to convert from polar equations back to rectangular have a great day 

Transcript for: How to Convert From Polar Equations to Rectangular Equations (Precalculus - Trigonometry 40)
hey there we're going to talk about one more thing before we start graphing some of these polar equations we're going to talk about how to convert from polar equations into rectangular sometimes it's very valuable to get a better picture of what we're dealing with when we're not too familiar with this sometimes it's nice because they're easier and rectangular sometimes they're not but we want to practice to be prepared when they are so here's the deal this is the same exact thing that we're dealing with from the last video we have x squared plus y squared equals r squared we have x equals r cosine theta and y equals r sine theta we're just going to be going in the reverse order if you remember from the last video every time we saw x squared plus y squared we replace this with r squared every time we saw x or y by themselves we replaced it with the appropriate r cosine theta for x or r sine theta for y now we're going backwards whenever we see r squared we can replace that with x squared plus y squared or r cosine theta with x or sine theta with y that's really the three things that we can do to replace polar coordinates with rectangular coordinates we're just replacing the pieces individually there's also one additional helpful hint that you need to know we can always multiply both sides of a polar equation by r that's really helpful especially when we take a look at something like the first couple examples when we look at r cosine theta i don't see an r squared i don't see an r cosine theta i don't see r sine theta i see r equals cosine theta if i subtract it doesn't help if i divide it doesn't help this is really not very doable right now for us so what's allowed is we can multiply both sides of this equation by r now do you see what's going to help us with that if we multiply both sides by r on the left hand side we get r squared on the right hand side we get r cosine theta now this is super nice because we see right here hey r squared is equal to x squared plus y squared whenever we saw x over y squared we were able to replace it with r squared now the reverse is true when you see r squared we can certainly replace that with x squared plus y squared and we've just converted this piece of our polar equation into something that's rectangular now r cosine theta that is x so we can replace that piece with x this is oftentimes a really good first thing to do is if you don't see any sort of r squared or any r cosine r sine theta we we can multiply both sides of that equation by r and ultimately get an r squared at least somewhere and typically in either an x or y or both so that's something that's very nice now we're practically done you can subtract x on both sides if you'd like to get this equal to zero that's okay you could factor but it doesn't make it necessarily any any better so this is actually fine for us we've once we've done this we've converted from polar equation into rectangular equation okay let's move on so we have r equals sine theta plus one i do not see r squared i do not see r sine theta all i see is an r on one side a sine theta plus one the other notice how we're missing a couple pieces we either want that we want that to be r squared we want that to be r sine theta we're missing r let's multiply both sides by r however when you do that don't forget that you have to multiply an entire side by something so when we multiply this side by r we really are multiplying that whole side by r it will have to distribute so that's r squared here no problem but r sine theta plus r we're going to have to deal with that r on the left hand side oh we see it we see x squared plus y squared it's wrapped up in r squared but the pythagorean theorem says that this is x squared plus y squared likewise our trigonometry says that we have r sine theta equals y now the plus r how in the world are we going to deal with a plus r we don't want to go multiplying both sides by r again because we're just going to get r here and r there and that's going to be very annoying so what do you do you can use this to solve for r but how would we do it well if r squared equals x squared plus y squared what if we just take a square root of both sides keep r positive like we're used to doing then r would equal the square root of x squared plus y squared so that's something that we can do when we run into a bind if you've exhausted all of your r squareds all of your your sines and cosines our sine are cosines with x's and y's and you still have a r hanging out solve that for r and then you can replace it so if r squared is x squared plus y squared then of course r is the square root of that that's really it besides moving terms around we're done there's not a whole lot of simplifying we can do we're just about there now which one looks better this rectangular equation or the original polar probably the polar probably easier to deal with as well let's move on to the next one so r squared equals cosine theta the first temptation might be to replace that with x squared plus y squared and we're going to however notice that we're missing something over here we're missing that r so so what do you do do you replace this with x squared plus y squared or do you multiply both sides by r there are two options here number one i'm i'm going to multiply both sides by r but what i'm not gonna do i'm not gonna make this r cubed i'm gonna leave this as r squared times r and the reason why is i'm gonna be able to replace the r squared with x squared plus y squared but i'll replace the r next to it with that piece and that's kind of nice so on the left hand side i'm seeing my r squared times my r i don't want to do r cubed for the reasons i just said on the right hand side though i multiplied by r so the right hand side would be nice because r cosine theta is exactly x so i'm going to replace that we're going to convert it right now from polar into rectangular r cosine theta is x r squared is x squared plus y squared now because we're multiplying by something else you have to have parentheses r is just hey we've done that the square root of x squared plus y squared now that might look a little nasty but keep in mind that these are exponents we really have x squared plus y squared to the first power if you remember square roots x squared plus y squared to the one-half power because we can combine these common bases by adding exponents we have two halves plus one half that's three halves that is about as good as i want to make that there's not a whole lot of other simplification that we can do now i did say you had two options what if you didn't see that what if you didn't want to multiply both sides by by r could you get the same thing yes you can but you deal with the denominator so what if i do this a different way and say leonard you told me every time i see r squared to replace it with x squared plus y squared yeah and i actually did that what if i replace it now it's not really a big deal this would be x squared plus y squared what the world are you going to do with that the same logic applies to what we did with our r r squared was x squared plus y squared so r we could take a square root x is r cosine theta so what's cosine theta well it's x over r oh yeah i can solve for cosine theta that's actually just the trigonometric identity for a unit circle so x over r so could you replace cosine theta with x over r yeah of course they're equivalent now that's all well and good for the x but do you notice that this still has a polar piece to it it's about the r you have to take care of that how we can do it that's where that comes in again so in using this the reason why a lot of people don't like to do that is because you get this r on a denominator and you have this square root because x over r you cannot leave that r that's still polar you need all rectangular so we'd have to go and say hey the same way we replace r with square root of x squared plus y squared we're going to do that here as well we'll replace that with the square root of x squared plus y squared and lastly that's an equation but we really don't like denominators especially with square roots let's multiply both sides by the square root of x squared plus y squared if we do we get precisely the same thing we had right there it will work out to exactly the same expression does it matter which one you use no not really as long as you're doing valid operations using valid identities that we've already determined you're going to be fine the one thing that you can do here without worrying about it is multiplying both sides of your equation by r that's good that's okay it allows you to do other things with this so i hope you're seeing that i hope it makes sense we're going to come back with just like two more examples and then be done let's continue with these three they're kind of tricky and then we'll do two easier ones really so let's take a look at r equals sine theta over cosine squared theta what in the world are we going to do with that sometimes it helps to see if there's an identity within there so before we start multiplying things by r if it looks really really crazy i don't know what to do with that let's let's start to see if we can do that so maybe i'm going to write this as sine theta over cosine theta times cosine theta now why would we want to do that well because i'm seeing sine over cosine looks like tangent and tangent is y over x now with the one over cosine theta i don't like fractions with things in the denominator like cosine theta or r so constants are okay but let's get rid of that let's multiply both sides by cosine theta why i'm doing that is i want to avoid multiplying by r right now because there's not a great place to put it an r squared be great here but not necessarily over here so i want to get rid of those fractions before i do that on the left hand side we're going to get r cosine theta that's a beautiful thing on the right hand side we get tangent theta now remember about tangent theta tangent theta is by definition by the identity y over x r cosine theta well that is x if we multiply both sides by x we're going to get x squared equals y or just y equals x squared so this whole thing that whole thing works out to be just a basic parabola interesting so i give to you hopefully find that interesting are there other ways to go about it yeah there are there are if you if you saw this right from the beginning if you multiply both sides by r cosine squared theta equals sine theta now you can multiply both sides by r that'd be fantastic because you'll get r squared equals r sine theta instead of replacing which is why i gave you the first way instead of replacing that with x squared plus y squared which is what i see a lot of please think through this if this is r squared times cosine squared theta then this is r cosine theta quantity squared means this is x squared you don't have to go through all that mess don't replace just these little p t pieces replace this after you've really factored it shown this as something to the second power this is x squared equals that's y and then you're done either way works i just wanted to give you options for that let's talk about the next one so r equals 3 cosecant theta when you see those those functions those reciprocal functions change them so because cosecant theta is one over sine theta we can write this as three over sine theta now we're going to go through the same process let's multiply both sides by sine theta before you start multiplying by r get rid of those fractions typically that works really well so we get r sine theta equals three you're done no multiplying by r no nothing r sine theta is y so we get this horizontal line at 3. that's exactly what that is telling you there what if it had been what r equals 3 secant theta that would in one over cosine multiply by cosine you would have got a vertical line at three so cosecant would relate to a horizontal line secant would relate to a vertical line because of the x and the y relationships that we we've learned for sine and cosine and cosecant secant okay last one r equals sine theta cosine squared theta now we don't have any fractions so we there's nothing get rid of and we're really lacking a lot here i see no r sine theta r cosine theta i see no r squared well wait a second if i can multiply both sides of the equation by r can i multiply it by more than that can i multiply it by as many r's as it would take to create y x and x maybe i multiply this by three r's or r cubed on the left hand side we're going to get r to the fourth power on the right hand side yeah i have r cubed but remember why we did it what we want to do is we want to create y and x how do i do that well i want to make sure that i have an r next to a sine an r next to a cosine or an r squared next to a cosine squared and use exactly what we've done here so i'm trying to create x and y because that's what sine and cosine are trying to give me they just don't have enough r's to do it so i'm making that happen for it so i'm going to do r sine theta that's used up one of my r's i still have r squared left if you wanted to write that as cosine times cosine and put an r for each one that's perfectly appropriate as well on the left hand side i'm also thinking ahead i don't have anything that says r to the fourth but i do have something that says r to the second so what if i wrote this as r squared squared the r sine theta looks really nice that's y this looks a little bit funny so i'm going to make this r times cosine theta quantity squared that's x squared this r squared says hey r squared whenever you see that is x squared plus y squared quantity squared on the right hand side this is y this is x squared and if we take a square root of both sides then what we end up getting is a square root is going to cancel the power 2. you're going to get x squared plus y squared on the right hand side yeah the square root will cancel out that power too but not the y's so remember with with these one-half powers these square roots you can distribute across multiplication and division because of that we'll get x but we have to keep the square root of y that's about as good as we can make that so i know that we're very quick hopefully that makes sense though on on how we deal with some of these more difficult polar equations that don't look readily doable or readily convertible into rectangular we're really looking for not not a trick but getting rid of fractions is oftentimes very helpful whether you do it first or whether you see an identity which i've showed you both ways to solve that that's fine you can have the same thing here change those reciprocal functions into trig functions right away typically right away so that you can see what's really going on then we get rid of fractions and some identities are right there for us which is very nice otherwise if you don't see anything happening right away and you you see missing pieces like hey sign usually needs an r i know i can multiply just give it enough r's to satisfy what it wants to give in the first place which is y's and x's so hopefully i've walked you through those we're coming back with just a few more examples they will be quick and then we'll be done okay last two so first one r equals two i'm giving this example even though it looks pretty easy and it's not too bad to illustrate what this is because we're about to move on to graphing these please think about what r equals 2 actually means if you had a radius of 2 no matter what the angle was based on some pole some origin what would it create it would create a circle with a radius of two now notice what we're going to get out of this we're going to convert this to rectangular for sure because right now it's in polar it's in terms of r and theta but when we convert it it's going to be exactly the same form of an equation for a conic section that we call a circle now how would you do it well because r is equal to 2 i don't see r squared i don't even see a sine or cosine anywhere we could multiply both sides by r but it might be nice to square both sides if we do on the left hand side we get r squared on the right hand side we get 4 but now we see r squared r squared is x squared plus y squared let's substitute that if x if x squared plus y squared equals 4 that is a circle centered at the origin it's not shifted left it's not shifted right it's not just shifted up or down it has a radius of the square root of that number this is a circle centered at the origin with a radius of the square root of four or two exactly what that says now which one's nicer depends on what you're doing really if you're used to rectangular coordinates and rectangular equations that's easier but like physically like looking at this physically that's an easier equation it's just it's a constant if the radius is a constant that's a circle it's exactly what circle is something with a constant radius nothing that's changing okay last one that looks a little crazy because we have this denominator so a couple things that we're going to do number one thing that we're going to do is we're going to get rid of that fraction in doing so we cancel out our denominator here and we have to distribute that's r minus r cosine theta equals 4. now what in the world do we do here the first thing you might see is maybe i should multiply both sides by r if we do that you're going to get an r squared here and that would be fantastic but notice what else you get you'll get an r here that would be tough to deal with because you'd have to use a square root of x squared plus y squared you'd also lose your x because this is just x right now and that's very nice so sometimes the apparent right choice is not a good one if it starts making your equation explode so watch out for that if you're going along and you're man this is this is getting this is getting worse and worse this is not good at all what in the world am i doing wrong you might have you might have made a mistake go back and see if you can do something else so do i want to multiply both sides by r no not really because i lose my x and i make that much much more difficult instead i'm going to keep my 4 change this to an x because r cosine theta is x and i'm just going to deal with r as the square root i would have to have used it anyway here but it would have created a complete mess in other places so let's take that and make it the square root of x squared plus y squared this is just x equal to 4. now can we do a couple other things yeah we certainly can if we add x to both sides we could square it both sides so adding x if we have isolated a square root we can square both sides and distribute that and that gives us some like terms to combine in fact you can move everything to the left-hand side of your equation if you really want to if we subtract x squared our x squareds are gone subtract 8x you're going to get minus 8x and minus 16. y squared minus 8x minus 16 equals zero that's fine for our rectangular equation so we've converted from polar to rectangular now there's a few different ways you can write it we could actually have left it y squared equals 8x plus 16. that can be appropriate you can solve this for x actually so dividing by 8 1 8y squared minus 2 while this is not a function in terms of y this would be a function in terms of x it's actually a type two parabola so it is a conic section which one's easier to deal with here or there kind of depends on your preference really are you better at rectangular are you better at polar i'm just trying to get you comfortable with both i hope that explained it well enough that you can convert between a polar to rectangular by doing basically the exact opposite what we did in the last video using using things appropriately making sure that yes we can multiply both sides of an equation by r but if it starts exploding that's not the right thing to do and then being able to simplify some of these so i hope you've enjoyed it i hope it's made sense given just a few examples to illustrate how to convert from polar equations into rectangular have a great day 

Transcript for: How to Graph Basic Polar Equations (Precalculus - Trigonometry 41)
welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about how to graph some of these polar equations that we've been working with um it'll it'll be basic in this video kind of more brief as much as i can make it i'm just really what they mean getting used to looking at this and kind of seeing what happens by transforming these into rectangular equations for now just so that we can get a picture that we're more used to in that way i intend to make it so that when you look at that you can see that's a circle with a radius of three you go how are they going to do that because it kind of tells you that but getting these into rectangular equations can make it clearer for now in the next video we're going to go a lot deeper we'll talk about symmetry how to use symmetry to graph some fairly advanced polar equations and really get some cool pictures out of it that would be a lot more difficult to graph with rectangular equations so for now these basic ones might be a little bit nicer rectangular we'll get a picture what they are we'll graph that picture and get more used to what these things are as polar so in order to do that there's some kind of identities that we are used to that we're going to be using and they're they're right here on the board we really need to be pretty familiar that x squared plus y squared equals r squared it's the pythagorean theorem or pythagorean identity when you apply it to right triangle trigonometry we need to be really clear that r cosine theta is x and the reason why that is is because cosine theta is x over r so x is our cosine theta y is our sine theta because sine theta is y over r and tangent theta is x over y and we can use all those things we will use all those things and we're going to jump right into it let's take a look at our first polar equation r equals 3. we're going to get a picture what this looks like by changing this into rectangular coordinates that is something that you can do oftentimes to get a really clear picture is with some basic equations change them into rectangular there's some things we can do in order to do that one thing we can do is if r equals 3 we really like seeing r squared if you don't have any cosines or sines flying around we really like to see r squareds in our equations we can do things like multiply both sides by r we can do things like square both sides so if r equals 3 let's square both sides and get r squared equals 9. now that we have that because r squared equals x squared plus y squared we can immediately translate this into a rectangular equation that's something that we can do to get used to polar equations a little bit more is translate these into rectangular something we're used to because r squared is x squared plus y squared that lets us say x squared plus y squared equals nine now what in the world is that if you've ever seen conic sections which i've taught before in our intermediate algebra uh portion of this this video series is x squared plus y squared is a circle if x squared plus y squared equals r squared this is x squared plus y squared is a circle with a radius squared this is the square of the radius so our radius would be three this is a circle circle centered at the origin notice there's no shifting there's no addition no subtraction no parentheses within that that next to our x or next to our y being squared this is not shifted it's a circle with a center of the origin and a radius of three so how do we draw that if we have a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 3 our center would be right here and a radius of 3 would go up down left and right 3 we're just getting a circle so maybe now we can see that if you were to take that original polar equation think about what r is r is the distance from the pole to a point and you say okay where's the theta there is no theta which means that for any theta ever your r is just going to be three the distance from the pole to whatever graph you're doing whatever function you're getting is three well that's a circle if we keep this distance from the pole to our function at three regardless of what our our theta is regardless what our angle is it says for any angle you have this distance from the pole to your graph of three you're certainly going to get a circle that's exactly what that says it just really says your radius is three from the pole that r is constant you're going to get a circle out of that i hope it makes sense i hope that when when you're seeing this as x squared plus y squared it's a little more clear kind of solidifying a thought of that is a circle just with a radius of 3. what if we don't have a constant radius like we had before what if we have a constant angle a constant theta saying you will always have this angle of pi over 4. maybe start thinking about what that means if your angle is always pi over 4 from our polar axis always like this what would that do regardless of what the r is says r can be anything positive negative you're just going to hold this angle true what that what is that going to give you now we're going to translate this into rectangular equation so that we can see this a little more clearly but how would we do it well the only thing that really we can do here is take a look at tangent maybe we can take tangent of both sides of our equation generally that's what we do with with theta because there's a way to translate tangent theta into something rectangular very very nicely so let's take tangent of both sides tangent of pi over four is really nice tangent of pi over four is just one but tangent of theta is something that we should recognize tangent of theta is y over x so let's translate that tangent both sides cool tangent pi over 4 1 tangent theta is y over x and we've just translated this into a rectangular equation if we multiply both sides by x we just get y equals x now now put this together ask you to remember something ask you really think about this for a second if you held this angle at pi over 4 it says here's your angle of pi over 4 basically 45 degrees and regardless of your r i don't care what that is you're going to keep that angle so r can be anything but it's got to be on that angle that's going to give you a diagonal line look at your rectangular equation y equals x is your diagonal line you go through 1 1 2 2 3 3 negative 5 negative 5. you're just getting diagonal line right through that origin this is y equals x it's also the graph of the line where theta is pi over four anytime you see this angle being held constant you are going to get one of those diagonal lines it says regardless of what your r is positive negative it'd be somewhere along this angle this ray in both directions let's move on to r sine theta equals two so this might be a little harder to see hopefully you've seen that hey if your r is constant that's just a radius you're going to get a circle centered at the origin center at the pole if your angle is constant you're just going to get a diagonal line going through the pole why well because this is holding that angle constant the whole time regardless of what your r is you're going to get that diagonal line that's a little more challenging to see so let's translate this into a rectangular equation let's look at r sine theta and see what that actually means here so r sine theta says that's y we can translate this right now into rectangular equation by saying r sine theta is y that was really nice we're really familiar with y equals 2 y equals 2 is a horizontal line constant at 2. well that's exactly what that is but notice in terms of why it's constant like the y variable would be held constant regardless of what x is but in terms of your polar equation both r and theta would have to change to get the points on that line so for this point right here your angle would be pi over 2 your r would be 2 but for this point over here your angle would be well something different and your r would change as well both of those things change and what this should tell you is that there's benefits depending on what we're dealing with if we have a circle it's really nice just to hold our r constant and say that's in a polar equation that's really easy if we have a diagonal line it's either way you're fine you can have y equals x it's pretty easy to graph you can also say let's just hold our angle constant and we're going to get every point along the angle as soon as we start getting constants in terms of rectangular equations they're a little bit easier to deal with so y equals 2 that's really nice it just holds your y constant you're getting a horizontal line if we do have this in terms of polar it's a little more challenging because both your angle and your r have to change to get the points on that line for for rectangular only your y has to stay the same and your x has to be anything you can hold that y constant okay last one r cosine theta equals negative three we're taking a look over here maybe it's a little bit nicer change this into rectangular get a picture of this r cosine theta is x let's change this to x equals negative 3. for constants in terms of x and y rectangular equations are a lot nicer because we have to change both the angle and the r to get this vertical line at negative three for circles for even diagonal lines things that are held constant in terms of angles or in terms of circles it's easier for polar equations to represent that so for us we got this x equals negative 3 we know that's a vertical line where x is held constant regardless of what the y is y can be anything you're just going to hold this at x equals negative three um that's exactly what this is telling you but in terms of polar equations both your angle and your r would have to change in order to get the points on that vertical line you'd have to have an angle changing and r getting shorter and shorter and shorter and shorter until that point and then longer and longer and longer until all the rest of those points hope it's making sense i hope that you you really understand what's going on with these basic basic polar equations translating them to rectangular can help us get a picture of what they are but the only thing i really want you to come away with right now is that uh four circles with a constant radius for angles that are held constant sometimes polar can be quite nice to look at makes it a little bit easier for y's being held constant for x is being held constant for those those constant lines in rectangular equations those are a little bit nicer c because they're a little harder to find with two changing variables in polar equations all right let's try two more so we're going to translate these into rectangular equations so we can get a better picture of it without having to understand exactly what that means as a polar equation just yet now in the next video that's going to be a little bit taxing to do a little bit too hard to translate into something usable for a rectangular equation and so we're going to learn how to graph these with with symmetry but that's the next video for right now we're just going to get a real handle on it so let's take a look at r equals 4 sine theta now one thing i really want you to grasp because sine is related to y this is going to somehow be affecting the y-axis and we're going to see that we're going to see that this is going to be a shift up on the y-axis this is going to be a shift left on the x-axis why because cosine has to do with x and y has to do with sine in fact positive is going to be a shift up negative is going to be a shift left that's going to bear out as we work with this but i want that in your head so what in the world we're going to do to translate this into a rectangular equation we've kind of already done that in previous videos but there's a few things that we can do such as we really like getting r squares we really like getting r sine theta because r squared you can change into x squared plus y squared and r sine theta we can change that into y so it's appropriate to be able to to multiply both sides by r so let's do that multiply both sides by r we're going to get r squared and 4 r sine theta now with the r squared that's nice we got x squared plus y squared directly from that on the right hand side r sine theta is equal to y now in order to really use this there's a couple things that we have to do number one thing is we've got to get this all on one side and make it look like the circle that it is make it look like generally a conic section that we get if we're going to translate this into rectangular equations so we're going to subtract 4y now while that helps us a little bit get things organized it doesn't really show us what exactly is going on you see this isn't a perfect picture of a circle yet in order to get there you really have to have all the stuff with x's being squared and all the stuff with y's being squared which means you might have to complete the square i forgot how to do that firstly i've got videos on that you can look back and figure out how to complete the square but secondly it's not that bad for here and we're going to be completing the square with each variable that needs it now our x this is all the x's that are up there everything's being squared but this y is really screwing us up so we're going to complete the square with the y variables if you don't remember how to do that i'm going to give you a real crash course on it basically we're trying to com make this be factorable as a perfect square if you remember all about like diamond problem or the the creating this three term um polynomial that you can factor as a perfect square this would act as your middle term so we'd think y squared minus 4y plus nothing there's nothing there we want to add something here to make this perfectly factorable so we're going to do that if that's negative four that would act like your middle term we're looking for two numbers that add to negative four and have the same signs because we're trying to make a perfect square like y minus some number y minus some number that's the same number so that we can make it y minus that number squared well in that case it's really just half of that number it's going to be negative 2. now what's this last term this last term is whatever these numbers multiply to so positive 4 in this case what all this says is that we're missing positive 4. if positive 4 were up there then this would be perfectly factorable so we're going to do that we're just going to force this thing to add 4. now that's a problem though you see if you just add 4 into an equation it's no longer equal to the other side you have one of two things that you can do you can either subtract four use this to factor and have a negative four or you can add four to both sides and thereby keep this equal so that's what we're going to choose to do in this case because we really like having our x's and y's on one side and everything that's going to become a radius a constant on the other side so we've said hey let's complete the square with the y's that way we can get all of our y stuff to the second power it'll be easier to identify a shift that way in order to do it we say that acts like a middle term and that's missing something all right if that's a middle term these two numbers would have to add to it and if i want to keep it a perfect square i need to have them be the same but they also multiply to this last term so this is the number that's missing so we add it so taking a look just at this piece we're going to add 4 to this side for the reason we just explained we're going to add 4 to this side to keep it equal you can't just add 4 to one side of an equation without doing it to the other side so we're adding 4 to both sides this part is now perfectly factorable we just saw that we saw that yeah if i if i add 4 in there this is going to create this possibility for us to factor it as y minus 2 squared on the right hand side 0 plus 4 is 4 and we have this x squared out front this is what we're looking for to identify really conic sections is all the things with x being squared all the things that had y's being squared now what in the world is this this is a circle that's been shifted but notice where it's being shifted i really need to remember transformations right now to understand that everything inside of parentheses shifts opposite of what you want it to do along with that stuff next to x's affects x stuff and stuff next to y affects y stuff so like x plus or minus some number is going to be a horizontal shift inside of parentheses y plus or minus number is going to be vertical shift it's along the y that's what the y is telling you stuff next to y affects the y stuff next to x affects the x once you have in parenthesis but it's opposite of what you want it to be so this minus 2 says i'm going to shift along the y axis but it's going to be opposite of what your brain probably wants to think this is not a downshift this is an upshift along the y-axis of two units it is a circle you have x squared you have y squared and that's r squared it's going to be the square of your radius the radius here is two so if we're going to shift up 2 then the center of our circle which this is is at 2. if it has a radius of 2 which that's what that says we're just going to draw a circle shift it up two units and call it good that's what this is telling us it's saying your x has not though the center of the circle has not shifted along the x it's still right at x equals zero it has shifted up remember it's opposite up on the y-axis two units no problem has a radius of the square root of that number which is two and that's exactly what we've shown so that's what this represents r equals four sine theta says this is a circle shifted up two units with a radius of two along the y because sine represent is related to our y of those two units all right last one we're going to do something very similar i just want to show you what a shift along the axis looks like so r equals negative 2 cosine theta it doesn't look all that great but we can change this into rectangular by multiplying multiplying both sides by r that way we'll get an r squared on the left hand side we'll get an r cosine theta on the right because r squared is x squared plus y squared we can translate this side into rectangular really nicely on the right hand side we've got negative 2 and r cosine theta is x we're going to do something very similar to the last example and we're going to get everything on one side and use completing the square to get our x's as something squared that way it represents a circle better so we've got x squared plus 2 x e plus y squared equals 0. everything in terms of y is being squared already so we don't have to worry about that but this x is kind of messing us up we really need all of our x's in parentheses being squared to identify a circle what that means is we've got to do that completing the square so we're going to take a look just at the x's here if that's a middle term of some uncompleted polynomial that has to be a perfect square then i would get a positive two here the numbers that would have to be the same that add up to that two are both positive one would have to multiply to this missing number right there which would be one so we're missing one get that if i put a one right there then this would have a one this would factor perfectly as x plus one squared that's exactly what we're trying to do but in order to add that one if i want to complete that square hence completing the square if i'm missing the one and i need to add it in here i can't just do it to one side doesn't make sense i would have to do to both sides of an equation to keep it equal so on the right hand side 0 plus 1 is just 1. but on the left hand side i've now completed this as a perfect square trinomial so x squared plus two x plus one here's the two here's the one those are the same number that cause it to factor that would be x plus one quantity squared i already had the y squared but now everything in terms of x is in parentheses being squared everything in terms of y is well you could think of parentheses being squared and we have a constant on the other side this is a circle but identify what's going on firstly maybe identify the radius so x squared stuff plus y squared stuff equals the radius squared the radius is the square root of that number the square root of one is one so we got a radius of 1. now think about where this is shifting there's no numbers in parentheses next to the y so this is not shifting up it's not shifting down there is numbers next to the x in parentheses being squared that means we're shifting left or right however everything in parentheses with transformations is opposite of the sign so even though this one is next to the x saying you're shifting along the x it's not right one it's the left one i hope you can see a lot of students make that mistake it's super easy to make a mistake but this is a shift left one unit next to x along the x opposite of the sign shifted left one unit and now we use our radius our radius is one so from that center that we just shifted from the origin we're just going to draw a circle with a radius one and that's really all there is to it so we've been able to change our polar equations into rectangular get a better picture and that's that's really possible with these basic ones we can change all of them and get a decent idea about what it looks like constant r would be a circle with centered at zero with just a radius of whatever that r is constant theta is just a diagonal line with whatever angle related to the polar axis when we start to change when we start having to change both the r and and cosine thetas into things we generally get circles that are shifted and our rectangular equations will show that it's just a little more work past these things it is actually easier to leave them as polar equations and use symmetry so in the next video i'm going to talk about that i'll show you why it's a little bit harder to to deal with rectangular equations it starts getting pretty nasty but then when we deal with polar and symmetry and what exactly happens with sine and cosine involving symmetry like even in oddness it becomes a little bit easier so we'll talk about that graphing some more advanced polar equations without having to change them into rectangular next time you 

Transcript for: How to Graph Advanced Polar Equations with Symmetry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 42)
hey there welcome to another video the last video in this entire series yes feels good right kind of done moving on a little maybe sad i don't know a little bit a little bit sad i could do more trigonometry like this don't worry you will because in calculus a ton of trigonometry but this is important uh because we're going to talk about symmetry as it involves polar equations you see there's some equations like that one that when you translate them into rectangular they don't work so well and they look really really bad very hard to deal with and you can try go ahead and try to change that into rectangular equations you'll see what i mean you'll see how there's a couple hiccups what am i supposed to do with that it's not a circle it's definitely not a circle and not an ellipse not any of these conic sections we're used to and so that that's quite difficult so what do you do you leave it in polar and you learn symmetry so here's the idea behind the following four examples if these are too hard to change to rectangular we're going to leave them we're going to learn about symmetry and then plug in some points to deal with a smaller section and use symmetry to kind of mirror it so here's how symmetry works for polar equations if you're theta and negative theta if you plug in negative theta and it gives you the same exact equation that you started with so basically it's it acts like an even function if that's the case then you're going to have symmetry in your graph and it's going to be symmetric about the polar axis or the x-axis now think about why that would happen if you have a positive angle and a negative angle and it gives you out the same exact points you're going to be mirrored across this polar axis it's going to give you the same exact values that's like the x-axis so we're going to check that first if you plug in negative sorry pi minus theta into your equation and it gives you the same exact thing as you started with you're going to have symmetry about pi over 2. now hopefully that makes sense here's pi over 2. like this y-axis pi is 180 degrees zero is over here your polar axis if pi minus your angle is the same thing as your angle then you're going to get symmetry across this mirror image across the y axis you'll have that very similar to what we did with um with the double solution for the side uh side side angle for for sine how that would give us these two solutions because we had 180 minus theta matching up with our theta with sine that's exactly what this is talking about lastly if you can change just the value of your r the sine of your r and it gives you the same exact answers what you start with same exact equation then you're symmetric about the pole why because if your pole is here and r and negative r give you the same exact result you're going to be symmetric about that pole it's going to mirror image across that 180 degrees should be identical so this is the order of business for us really check to see if you could change it into rectangular easily normally when you have stuff added or subtracted it's not easy and it won't give you anything very nice so we can check that but then go through all of our symmetry so we're going to try it we're going to try every one of these i'll walk you through it very nicely after you've checked symmetry see what works see what doesn't work and it will limit the points that you have to plug in so then i'll show you how to plug in certain values like negative pi over 2 negative pi over 3 negative pi over 4 negative pi over 6 0 pi over 6 pi over 4 pi over 3 pi over 2 get a series of points and then plug them in plot them and use your symmetry to mirror image so we're going to start there how about r equals 1 minus sine theta man going to rectangular equations as possible but it won't give us anything nice because of that if you multiply both sides by r that would be easy that'd be y that would be easier the x squared plus y squared that would not be easy that would be r you'd have a square root of x squared plus y squared it's not nice to deal with so we're going to avoid that what we're not going to avoid is checking symmetry so how we start with checking symmetry is really just just with this checking almost an evenness and oddness sort of idea take your theta and plug in negative theta just see what happens so i'm going to replace my theta with negative theta if this works out to be exactly the same equation i started with we will have symmetry about the x-axis or the polar axis if not then we probably won't now get this we probably won't this is not a guarantee if it doesn't work it's not guaranteeing that you don't have symmetry but you just can't use it because you're not sure it's inconclusive if it does work we guarantee that we will have symmetry though so that's nice now i hope you remember about sine sine is an odd function so sine of negative theta equals negative sine of theta which one's the even function cosine is so if we had cosine of negative theta it would give us positive cosine of positive theta so for us we go okay 1 minus sine of negative theta sine of negative theta is negative sine theta it's going to change that sign so we take a look at it we've simplified it is this exactly the same equation that i started with no so this is probably not symmetric about the polar axis think x-axis probably not symmetric about the polar or x-axis so then we move on we deal with all three symmetries to make our lives as easy as humanly possible so how about pi minus theta you're gonna have to use some identities here we're gonna see that right now so i'm going to take r and leave our alone 1 minus sine this says replace replace your theta with pi minus theta and see what happens remember if we simplify this and get exactly what we started with we will for sure have symmetry about pi over 2 axis or the y axis so let's let's deal with that how in the world you simplify that when you don't know your theta this is where all those sum and difference formulas i taught you come into play so sine of pi minus theta we would think all right let's see sine of pi minus theta maybe have the formula sheet out is sine of the first one cosine of the second one minus cosine the first one sine of the second one but please remember that this is all in parentheses because this gives us this so this is 1 minus all of that stuff so uh sine of pi oh my gosh sine of pi is the y coordinate at pi that's going to be zero so this whole thing is gone pi of zero is zero sorry sine of pi is zero zero times cosine i don't care is zero minus cosine pi is negative one sine of theta is sine of theta so minus negative 1 sine theta now there's a lot of negatives going on but this says opposite of negative 1 is positive 1 1 minus positive 1 sine theta is 1 minus sine theta that's exactly what we started with which means that if this works you are going to have symmetry about that vertical axis the pi over 2 or the y axis okay last one to check take r and make it negative if positive r equals negative r when you change the sign of r um and it does and you get the exact exactly the same things you started with you'll have symmetry about the origin or the pole so let's do that all that's required is we take this r and change its sign now let's solve for r so divide everything by negative one now this is clearly not what we started with the signs are all opposite which means we probably don't have symmetry about the pole so after we've done that we don't really have any better way to go about it than plotting some points so why do we use symmetry in the first place so you wouldn't have to plot all of the points so you wouldn't have to plot pi over six pi equals zero pi over six pi over four pi over three pi over two uh two pi over three three pi over four 5 pi over 6 then pi and then all of this quadrant and then all of this quadrant you see here's what we learned while we don't probably don't have symmetry about our x-axis or the polar axis and we probably don't have symmetry about our pole we do have symmetry about the y-axis or about the pi over two axis so if we find all of these values we can mirror them and we'll have all of these values that's what the symmetry does so we really only need to find values from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. that's what we're going to do right now if we find this half we'll mirror it and find this f that's what that says you have symmetry about the y-axis so just find one side you could do this side for sure and mirror it here but these are generally easier so find the right side flip it and you'll get the left side because it's our only symmetry that's the only way we can limit the points that we have to plug in right now so we're going to take and plug in negative pi over 2 negative pi over 3 and all of these very common values and get those coordinates so we're about to get going on it remember that the polar coordinates are r comma theta so we're going to plug in these angles negative pi over 2 but they will be the second coordinate how we plug them in is no different we're going to take these values we're going to plug them into our equation we're going to see what happens so i'll do a couple with you and then i'll write down some of the other ones that i'm getting but here's the thought process if this is an angle and it's this angle right here then if i plug in that angle it will give me a distance from the pole so let's do that plug in negative pi over two sine of negative pi over two is negative one negative one so one minus negative one is two what that means is that along this angle of negative pi over two you're going to get an r of 2. can you plot that heck yeah so at negative pi over 2 you're going to get an ro2 that's going to give you this point we plotted lots of these things negative pi over 2 is your angle distance of 2 from the origin or the pole you're going to have a point right there that's our very first point so we're going to plot all of those how about negative pi over 3 sine of negative pi over 3 is negative square root 3 over 2. 1 minus negative square root 3 over 2 is like 1 plus square root 3 over 2. let's see um square root 3 over 2 is like 0.87 so this is positive 1.87 it's 1.866 something something but one thing right now please don't confuse positive values with negative y values this is r theta so what this says is go to an angle of negative pi over 3 got it then along that ray you're going out positive 1.87 so this is 2 1.87 be a little shorter probably right about here let's do negative pi over 4. sine of negative pi over 4 is let's see negative square root 2 over 2. 1 minus negative square root 2 over 2 is 1 plus square root 2 over 2 that's about 2.41 square no it's not point seven let's see square root of two is uh one point four one half of that is point four five point seven five ish so let's say positive 1.7 somehow i forgot negative pi over 6. so that's slightly closer to that pole let's plug in negative pi over six sine of negative pi over six is negative one-half so one minus negative one-half that's one plus one half that's three halves or one point five that's a little bit closer to that pole about zero remember we're plugging in angles here that would be an angle of zero that's on the polar axis so let's take zero let's plug it in sine of zero is zero one minus zero is one so at an angle of zero the distance from your pole is one that's what r theta is telling you now for positive angles with pi over six sine of pi over six is one half one minus one half is one half hopefully it's clear now we do not have symmetry across this this polar axis and that's because we're subtracting sine and sine is not symmetric about about that the sines of the y values are opposite so we don't have that symmetry let's try pi over four uh sine of pi over four if we're going to plug that in sine of pi over four square root 2 over 2 that's uh 0.707 1 minus that is like point now close to 0.3 but like 0.29 it's getting pretty close to that pole how about pi over three sine of pi pi over three is square root three over two that's point eight seven ish so one minus point eight seven is about point one three that's really close and then finally we're almost done pi over two sine of pi over two remember this is what we're doing plugging our angles into there to get our r that's our distance from the pole sine of pi over two is one one minus one one is zero so that says at an angle of pi over two you are at that pole so if we graph this don't graph with straight lines graph a nice smooth curve it's actually a really pretty graph so we have plotted all of those points by taking some some really common values negative pi over 2 negative pi over 3. all of these values from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 getting our r's from there and these all say at a certain angle this is how far away you are from the pole so we've shown that now we're going to apply a smooth curve but that's only half of it you see because we know about this symmetry we get to avoid plugging in all of these values which actually would take quite a long time um i did in my head i know but like this would take a little while so because we know symmetry just draw a mirror image you can draw all of these other values and actually put the points down uh most most of the time i wouldn't do that i would just kind of sketch it and make sure it's it's symmetrical that's about as good as i can do what that's called is called a cardioid so r equals 1 minus sine theta gives you something called a cardioid why because it kind of looks like a heart i hope it makes sense i hope that you're understanding the idea of that's real hard to look at as a rectangular equation it's not good so we're going to leave it in polar but that requires a few things from us it requires us to check symmetry to use symmetry if it does work and plug in some values that take advantage of that symmetry allows you to save work not make more work because otherwise you'd have to plug in all of these values around a unit circle it's very challenging we don't want to do that so identify symmetry limit what you have to plug in plug in known values on a unit circle make it easy on yourself to do the math and then mirror image those across the symmetry that you've identified okay let's try another one so we've got r equals 1 plus 2 cosine theta we're looking at this thinking rectangular equation nah not so much it's going to be really hard to do without that absolutely be pretty easy to do we have r squared equals 2 r cosine theta if we multiply both sides by r uh give us some sort of a circle not not too bad that not so much so we're going to check symmetry plug in some points and then graph it with our symmetry the first one we always check is almost an evenness idea plug in negative theta and see what happens now cosine's an even function so cosine of negative theta gives you cosine of positive theta so cosine negative theta cosine positive theta the same thing that means i can change my argument without changing my function so because cosine's even opposite inputs give you equal outputs this is still the same thing as 1 plus 2 cosine of positive theta due to the evenness of cosine now that's exactly what we got here what that says is that this function will be symmetric about the polar axis or about the x-axis we're going to try other symmetry we're going to try symmetry about the y axis or the pi over 2 axis so we're going to plug this this pi minus theta in use a sum or difference formula and then simplify so 1 plus 2 cosine pi minus theta we need the sum or difference formula for cosine the difference formula for cosine says cosine of the first cosine of the second plus sine of the first sine of the second but remember this 2 would be multiplied by all of this so let's take a look cosine of pi that's negative 1 so this would be negative cosine theta sine of pi is 0. so this whole thing disappears we get r equals one plus two remember this is negative one negative cosine theta if we simplify just a bit r equals one minus two cosine theta while that's close that is not exactly what we have here so this is probably not symmetric about that that pi over 2 or the y axis how about the negative r you know sometimes we can just look at it and think if that's negative these signs would both change that's not going to help me at all that's not going to be symmetric so this is not going to be symmetric about the the pole or the origin so dividing both sides by negative 1 that's not going to work so this is probably not symmetric about the pole after that we're just going to plug in some values but notice what happened because we know we're symmetric about this polar or the x-axis think x-axis we really only need to know these important values from 0 to pi and then we'll be able to mirror them so we're going to plug in 0 pi over 6 pi over 4 pi over 3 pi over 2 2 pi over 3 3 pi over 4 5 pi over 6 and pi you can get away with doing just some of these uh if you're careful so sometimes i i just omit doing pi over 4 and 3 pi over 4 because these values do enough for me so you can do that but to get the best picture possible plug in all the ones on the unit circle okay so let's get started remember what we're doing we're plugging in angles figuring out r from our function that's what it tells us that r in terms of theta says you can plug in theta and figure out r what that gives you is an ordered pair r comma theta says go along that angle that far whatever you figure out so let's plug in zero cosine of zero is one two times one is two two plus one is three this says go to an angle of zero and then go from the pole three units along the angle okay now we're going to plug in pi over six cosine of pi over six is square root three over two 2 times square root 3 over 2 is just square root 3. square root 3 is about 1.73 so 1 plus 1.73 is about 2.7 or 2.73 so this says along that angle go to the angle of pi over 6 and go out 2.7 units or thereabout pi over 4 cosine of pi over 4 right here is going to be square root 2 over 2. square root 2 over 2 times 2 is just square root 2. that's 1.4 1.41 1 plus 1.41 is like 2.41 so this says along that angle pi over 4 you're going to go out 2.4 pi over 3 cosine of pi over 3 is one half two times one half is one and one plus one gives you two so along this angle of pi over three we're gonna go up from the pole from the origin two units now we're gonna jump to pi over two so when we plug in pi over two cosine of pi over two that's zero two times zero is zero but one plus zero is one so along this angle of pi over two it says go to pi over two you're going to go up one unit along that ray from the pole now 2 pi over 3. so when we plug in 2 pi over 3 cosine of 2 pi over 3 is negative one half 2 times negative one half is negative one one minus one is zero so if i plug in two pi over three i'm gonna get zero there's where things get interesting so at two pi over three i get zero so along this ray two pi over three i'm gonna get right at the origin okay let's try 3 pi over 4. cosine of 3 pi over 4 is negative square root 2 over 2 times 2 that's going to give you negative square root of 2. it's negative 1.41 1 plus negative 1.41 is negative 0.41 we go how in the world we graph negative 0.41 remember these are polar coordinates says go to your angle 3 pi over 4 negative r would say go along this ray in the opposite direction of 0.4 how about 5 pi over 6 same thing is going to happen here cosine of 5 pi over 6 is negative square root 3 over 2. uh 2 times that is negative square root of 3 that's negative 1.7 1 plus negative 1.7 is negative 0.7 so we get negative 0.7 what that means is that we would go to 5 pi over 6 that's this ray right here negative r though says don't go along that rate go along the opposite one from it negative 0.7 in this case is along this part 0.7 units so we've done that last one let's plug in pi cosine of pi is negative one two times negative one is negative two one minus two is negative one so what this says polar coordinates go to pi all the way to here instead of going along the ray 1 go in the opposite direction that was right there now this is kind of weird because we we sort of cross over this axis of symmetry so be smart about it we're going to plot the curve first we're going to graph the curve first that we've got so it's a nice smooth curve but then we're going to use our symmetry our symmetry says remember we're symmetric about this axis but in both cases the stuff above goes below the stuff below goes above so we're just going to mirror image this thing i've done my best to mirror image that of course you could plug in the values but it can get a little confusing what this is called is a lemison with an inner loop so that's the inner loop that we have right there i'm hoping it makes sense we're going to try one more symmetry to make sure that you get it and then an example to wrap everything up let's keep right on going so we've got r equals 2 cosine 2 theta we might think about rectangular equations but that makes it pretty difficult because that would change into one of our double angle formulas and get a little bit hairy so we don't really want to do that instead let's take a look at our symmetry and we're going to find some very interesting things about this we'll start with plugging in negative theta and see what happens here so r would equal 2 cosine of negative 2 theta so negative theta would create negative 2 theta cosine's still even though so opposite inputs give you equal outputs that means we can change the sign of our argument without changing the sign of our function so cosine negative 2 theta is exactly the same thing as cosine of positive 2 theta and that means we're going to have symmetry about this polar axis or the x-axis if you want to think about that way now we're going to try plugging in pi minus theta use a difference um sum or difference formula and figure out what happens and we end up getting 2 cosine 2 pi minus 2 theta now before we get all crazy about now i got to use some sort of formula here generally you do like if we didn't have that too you probably would but i want you to notice something this is the same thing as negative 2 theta plus 2 pi what's the period of cosine though the period is 2 pi do you remember that you can add or subtract 2 pi from cosine or sine and get exactly the same value what that means is that 2 pi if i subtract that out of here it's going to give me exactly the same thing as cosine of negative 2 theta so let's subtract the 2 pi so whether you have two pi in there or subtract it out it's going to give you the same value such as let's see cosine of zero or cosine of zero plus two pi or cosine of zero plus four pi is going to be the same exact thing we can subtract 2 pi and b just fine now how about cosine of negative 2 theta again it's an even function so opposite inputs give you equal outputs this is the same as 2 cosine 2 theta but that's exactly what we started with which means not only do we have symmetry across the polar axis we also have symmetry across the pi over 2 axis or the y axis now let's say something that's got to make sense if you have symmetry across the x axis and you have symmetry across the y axis you will definitely have symmetry about the origin and the same thing happens here if you have symmetry about the polar axis and you have symmetry about the pi over 2 axis you are going to have symmetry about the the pole and you don't have to check it yes so what are we going to find well this is great if we have symmetry this way we only have to check this side of our unit circle but if we have symmetry this way we only have to check this side of our unit circle so really we just have to check the first quadrant that's it what are these here for well because we're going to get some negative r's and this is a little bit nice to use if you have negative r's you have these already so we're going to check just the first quadrant so we're going to plug in some angles we're going to figure out the r or the distance from the pole along those angles and we'll be able to plot this and then use all of our symmetry so let's plug in 0 2 times 0 zero cosine of zero is one two times one is two so what this says is that along the angle of zero you're going to go two units plug in pi over six uh 2 times pi over 6 is actually pi over 3. whoa that's going to be a little different we get the sum of these it's going to act like bigger angles that's where our negatives are going to come from so 2 times pi over 6 is pi over 3. cosine of pi over 3 is one-half two times one-half is one so along pi over six we would go out one unit let's go to pi over four two times pi over four well let's see that would be pi over two cosine of pi over two that's zero two times zero is zero this says go along pi over four but you're not going along it you're going zero from it so you are at the pole let's check out pi over three two times pi over three is two pi over three cosine of two pi over three is negative one half two times negative one half is negative one so this says go to your angle go to pi over three got it instead of going positive one in the direction of your angle go in the opposite direction of your angle so one unit in the opposite direction of your angle and now pi over 2. so cosine so 2 times pi over 2 is just pi cosine of pi is negative 1 and 2 times negative 1 is negative 2. so this says go to pi over 2 instead of going along the positive ray go along the opposite go down here to negative 2. so we're going to craft this but then we're going to use symmetry use all the symmetry that you have this is symmetric about the x-axis so what would that mean this would reflect here this would reflect here but you're also symmetric about the y-axis this reflects here this reflects here and this reflects here you get what's called a rose so this is what we call a rose in in polar equations so it's kind of nice using that symmetry you just make it all symmetrical these with the with itself across the y-axis and the x-axis or the pi over two axis and the polar axis and the pole and we would get a pretty nice shape out of that it's not perfect but did my best hopefully hopefully you're enjoying it and you're seeing the usefulness before we get to the last example i'm gonna i'd like for you to do it on your own the idea is check your symmetry first it limits what you actually have to plug in then plug in the least amount of points you possibly can usually it's two quadrants we got lucky here we got one quadrant um and then use your symmetry to mirror that that graph so we'll come back with one more example all right last one i gotta show you one that's symmetric throughout the pole i ruined it but you're gonna see why it is in just a second uh let's go ahead and do this we're gonna just not even worry about our rectangular equations uh from this because it'd be it'd be pretty crazy especially that 2 theta going on so let's check symmetry first thing we always check plug in negative theta evaluate that see if it's the same so if we're going to evaluate then r squared equals 4 sine of negative 2 theta and most of the time when you get used to this you can do them in your head just by the nature of what sine and cosine do so if you think i'm going to change the sign in an odd function it's going to change the sign of my function so this would be negative 4 sine 2 theta because sines odd opposite inputs give you opposite outputs change the sign of your argument change the sign of your function and what that means is this is probably not symmetric about the polar axis let's try the next one let's try um pi minus theta we're going to evaluate that and we get something very similar to the last example that we have 2 pi minus 2 theta sine's period is 2 pi means you can add 2 pi or subtract and just remove that entire thing and get the same result so we can subtract 2 pi from this from the argument and get the same exact output for sine which means we can eliminate that piece but if we do it actually brings us back to right here which we already know the result and that's clearly not what we started with so this is probably not symmetric about the pi over two axis either now what about negative r i regret it but if you evaluate negative r then negative r would be squared now it doesn't affect the right hand side at all but negative r squared is the same thing as r squared this is symmetric about the pole since we have symmetry about the pole we need to check two quadrants two consecutive quadrants doesn't really matter which ones you choose but if we check these two quadrants we can use symmetry to find these two quadrants if we check these two quadrants we use symmetry to find these two quadrants so you just need to check two of them i'm going to choose to check from zero to pi because those are easiest for me to plug in so let's go ahead and start start doing it remember these are polar coordinates you're plugging in angles and finding out distances from the pole and then we can plot those so an angle of zero if we evaluate that two times zero is zero sine of zero is zero four times zero is zero the square root that's a big deal the square root of zero is zero so this says at an angle of zero you are at the pole now let's plug in pi over six if we evaluate pi over six two times pi over six is pi over three sine of pi over three is square root three over 2 and 4 times that is 2 times square root 3 so 2 square root 3. let's see that's 1.7 times 2 about 2.8 but but notice something this would be r squared equals 2.8 how would you find r you take a square root but in doing so when you take a square root you have to do a plus and minus that is precisely why this is symmetric about the pole i need you to see it if you go to pi over 6 you can get plus or minus the square root of 2.8 i worked on the calculator i got about plus or minus 1.9 so here's what this says man get it get the relationship with symmetry about the pole this is go to your angle pi over six here's pi over six you're going to go out about 1.9 there's about 1.9 and negative 1.9 so here's pi over 6 positive 1.9 and negative 1.9 that right there is what is going to give you symmetry about that pole is because you have plus and minus because you go both positively and negatively could you have just found the positive and counted on symmetry to found the negative yes you totally could have done that as well let's try pi over 4. uh 2 times pi over 4 is pi over 2 sine of pi over 2 is 1. let's see if 1 times 4 is 4 r squared would equal 4 r equals plus or minus 2 the square root of 4 plus or minus 2. so here at pi over 4 this is you're going to go out to along the ray and out to in the opposite direction of that ray so here's pi over 2 go out 2 units and negative two units that's causing the symmetry about the pole let's do pi over three so two times pi over three is two pi over three sine of two pi over three let's see sine of two pi over three is square root three over two four times square root three over two is two square root of three so r squared equals two square root three r therefore would be plus or minus the square root of that that's exactly what we got here by the way so plus or minus 2 the square root of 2 square root of 3 is what we get that's again about plus or minus 1.9 so we do the same thing along pi over 3 here we go along pi over 3 go out 1.9 and in the opposite direction of pi over 3 go out 1.9 so negative 1.9 puts you in the on that ray in the opposite direction now how about pi over 2 if we evaluate pi over 2 2 times pi over 2 is pi sine of pi is 0. so 4 times 0 is 0 r squared is 0 square root of 0 is still 0. so we're going to get 0. now we already have zero that's okay let's try the next ones when you see something interesting happen try two pi over three when we evaluate two pi over three even though two pi over three is right here two times two pi over three is four pi over 3. now sine of 4 pi over 3 1 2 3 4 is negative please get this sine of 4 pi over 3 is negative square root 3 over 2. 4 times negative square root 3 over 2 is going to give you negative 2 square root 3. but look what you have if you have r squared equals negative 2 square root 3. so so again that's let's see four pi over three sine of four pi over three is negative square root of three over two four times that is negative two square root three if r squared equals negative two square root 3 take a square root what's going to happen you take a square root of this thing you're going to have a negative inside of a square root that's an imaginary number this can't happen here that's going to be imaginary here these are all imaginary because sine of those values 2 times let's see 2 times 3 pi over 4 that's going to give you 3 pi over 2. sine of 3 pi over 2 is negative square root r squared equal to negative square root of a negative is imaginary same thing 5 pi over 6 multiply by 2 that'd be 5 pi over 3. sine of 5 by 3 is negative r squared equals to a negative square root would give you imaginary number same thing with pi let's see 2 times pi would be 2 pi sine of 2 pi would give you 0 so i mean that gives you 0 but you have you already have 0 so no matter what you do with these you're going to get imaginary numbers these are non points for you which is why this graph is only going to exist in two quadrants one and three one because the values of sine are positive and square roots of positive make sense three because we know it's symmetric about the pole and we get those negative negative r for those angles 2 and 4 do not exist why because sine right there was was negative for those values and when you reflected them it doesn't make sense to reflect imaginary number does it make sense to plot an imaginary number on our polar coordinates so we just really have this graph it's called a lemnos gate so kind of interesting i hope that it makes sense i hope especially you understand that when you plug these in and it gives you a negative and r squared equals a negative the square root of a negative number is imaginary and we cannot plot that on our polar coordinate system the way we have it designed so i hope that this has made sense i really hope that you understand about the symmetry it's kind of fun it's you i think it's fine useful and it will allow you to graph some of these polar equations without translating too rectangular and having a very hard time doing it so find your symmetry limit the amount of points you plug in then use your symmetry hope it makes sense i hope you've enjoyed this video i hope you've enjoyed this series have a great day
