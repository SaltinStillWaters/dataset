Transcript for: The Plan for Differential Equations (Differential Equations 1)
Hey so welcome back now if you watch the update the August 2018 update you heard that I'm filming differential equations I'm really excited about it I've been waiting a long time to do this now who's going to do it years later after I finished all of my other videos to support it but I know you'd need it and so we're taking a break from some of the lower-level stuff and we're gonna get onto differential equations and it's gonna happen soon so I want to be specific on what you can expect so that I'm I don't want you expecting something I'm not able to give as I mentioned in that that update I'm doing this on my own time so it's I'm not filming this in front of any students which means I'm doing this after hours I'm kind of dropping some classes so that I can do this for you guys so with that being said it's going to take a little bit longer than a semester to film I'm starting in mid September at posting videos and what you can expect is at least one video a day on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays I'm going to keep that up until we're finished now the good news is that because I'm not constricted by time this is going to be a very very in-depth course so we're gonna do a tremendous amount of examples like crazy lots of examples because I want you to get the picture of what's going on well I might not be doing all the proofs some of them frankly above the level of the class and it's it wouldn't help you understand it I will absolutely make sure that you do understand what is going on why we're doing it and where we're going like I always do so that's what you can expect another thing that I want to say is just a word of encouragement when you start DIF with equations the first part of it you're going to put in the world as this because it's it's kind of intimidating frankly when you look at it you go wow there's a lot of word problems yeah there are it's that's a good thing because it shows you where we're actually using the math that you learned in all of calculus which is fantastic but it can be intimidating let me give you a word of encouragement if you're here and you take a calc 1 count 2 at least that and if you take a calculate that's awesome you're gonna be fine you're gonna understand stop follow the videos stick with me and you will do okay that it's not all that bad it just seems bad when you started okay so I'll make it understandable for you don't let let all the the textbook jargon and everyone else tell you that you can't do it you can certainly do it okay put your mind to it stick with it and put in the time and you can do this so that's gonna be awesome we're gonna have a great time it's gonna be a lot of fun it will be different because I'm not filming it in front of any students I'm gonna talk directly to the camera there won't be any distractions but there also won't be as many questions so there is a double-edged sword I think it's gonna go really well I really don't have any other alternatives so this is what you're gonna get from me I hope that that satisfies you I hope that you'll watch the video stick with them and I really hope that you make this stuff understandable for you thanks again for watching support me on patreon and visit me on Facebook if you would all right I'll see you soon you 

Transcript for: Introduction to Differential Equations (Differential Equations 2)
well here we are the first video on differential equations and it's just an introduction because right now you're you're sitting there trying to wonder if you can learn differential equations you're either in a class or you're doing on your own and that's fine but it's kind of the first question is what are we actually doing so I'm gonna take some time to explain what in the world difference of equations is all about what the goals are what you should be looking for what they're based on after that the next video I'm just gonna show you how to check to see whether an equation is actually a solution of a differential differential equation so what the differential equation tries to do number one we're trying to model some real-life situation a real life change that's the goal here so that means there's a lot of word problems yeah because we're trying to actually do stuff now the problem is is that there's a balance you see in real life and you know this because you've experienced something that you've tried to do mathematically like wow there's there's lots of different stuff going on and that's the same problem that we run into in differential equations is that the more variables you add the harder it is to do the math so there's definitely a balance between a mathematical model that perfectly represents your situation and the ability to actually do that mathematical model so sometimes we we omit even though it doesn't seem right we omit some of the situation so that we can actually do the math and the models work pretty good are they perfect not always no but that's why we're always refining our techniques we're always learning more math so that we can further represent this model we're to scratch them a service and that's what differential equation starts with is scratching the surface on how to represent real life change with math that's number one so we're trying to do number two is what a differential equation actually is so what these things do is they relate a derivative in an equation so that's a differential equation if you have an equation with derivatives in them you're dealing with differential equations if you've taken calc 1 on top calc 2 and calc 3 even you have dealt with differential equations they were very basic but anytime you do an integral you can assume that you're dealing with a differential equation that's one of the techniques to solve them as a matter of fact we do lots of integrals well its derivatives represent things that are changing and then that's that's what we're trying to deal with in our difference of equations so derivatives represent change and since the goal is represent real life change we're going to be dealing with derivatives anytime we're dealing with a changing thing so like velocity or acceleration or population change as a respect to time these things are always changing and we can represent them fairly well with a different difference of equations hope you're getting this so far we're not necessarily focused on numbers anymore solutions that's not our number one thing to start with because the solution to a differential equation is actually an equation itself imagine this you have an equation with a derivative of something well the derivative is a derivative of some function or looking for that function and then we can use that function to do other things but the primary goal is find the function for this derivative that you have in your equation that that's the idea that we're trying to do so in a differential equation just to recap this stuff we're dealing with real life change change means we have derivatives a derivative comes from some function find the function that's a solution to a differential equation but when we find those solutions they're usually this infinite family of equations so remember when you do an integral and you teach you probably yell at you every time you forgot the little I know I would yell at you for every time you're going o plus C like what's the big deal with a plus C that plus C represents a family in infinite family of equations that when you take a derivative of it it gives you that solution or it gives you the equation that you started with well that's the same thing we have going on here if you have an equation with derivatives in them and you find the solution so this this equation that you if you take a derivative of it it's gonna give you this thing that you have in your differential equation well if you put a plus C on that you have this infinite family of equations and so we basically deal with the same arbitrary constant idea that you didn't calc two and three and even calc one put a little bit the entire class you do an integral plus C you do you find the solution to a differential equation you're going to have an arbitrary constant in fact on the skipped down here in fact the order which is just the highest derivative that you have in your differential equation so a first derivative order one second derivatives in there you get order two third derivative gotta order three it as your order goes up the number of arbitrary constants also goes up so if you have a second order differential equation so a second derivative in there you're going to have two arbitrary constants if you have just a first derivative you're going to have one arbitrary constant so call it C if you have two of them it call it a and B that's that's what's gonna happen here as your order goes up as the highest derivative increases so if you have a first derivative or a second derivative third degree of derivative you're arbitrary constants are going to increase you think of it think about why per second okay just just think through this if you need to this is the simplest case if you need to undo a first derivative with an integral you're gonna get a plus C let's say you had a second derivative okay undo that second derivative by an integral that makes the first derivative but you have a plus C now do it again well that plus C is gonna get a variable tacked on it with your next integral and then another plus C you're going to get two arbitrary constants that's what happens here so that's what I mean by or and then that's what I mean here by as the ordered increases arbitrary constants go up to so we talked a little bit about how solutions are an infinite family of equations that's a plus C idea if you're given an initial condition so like hey Y of Y of 0 equals 5 then we can start using that in our equation the solution this family of equations and I will give you a specific constant that's the way we narrow down our solutions from this general solution which is a family with like plus seeds or stuff into a very specific or particular solution it just requires an initial condition the so let's let's recap a little bit our goals modern way let's change change means derivative the derivatives in the equation differential equation that's it that's the whole idea here well we're not necessarily focused on finding numbers as solutions because what we know about derivatives is their front functions were trying to find the equation so the equations become our solutions functions become our solutions every time you find one it's gonna have a plus C in it it's going to be a family of curves that work in this differential equation as the order goes up number of so like second derivative third derivative fourth derivative the number of constants also goes up that should make sense we talk about the integral thing you get a plus C do it again you get a C and let's call it X and then another different plus C more arbitrary constants if you have an initial condition then you can narrow down your general solution to get a particular solution it says how all these curves are solutions but if they have to go through this one point there's only one quickly does that and that's how we narrow down the general solution into the particular so the family into one particular solution so we're looking for last thing I want to talk to you about right now is ordinary differential equations versus partial order differential equations ordinary doesn't mean commonplace what it means is that all of the difference of equations in ordinary differential equations are based on the fact that we will have one independent variable usually X it's not the case where we have two independent variables like the calc three partial derivative sort of thing where you count them as two independent variables that would be partial order differential equation if that's less later alright so right now we're focused on having equations in these equations that have derivatives differential equations the primary functions are all based on one independent variable usually X sometimes it's T for time that's what we're doing so all this stuff hopefully makes sense is where we're going now I know I haven't explained everything about it well we're going to start very simply in the next video we're going to talk about is how to check just check whether an equation is a solution to a differential equation or it's not so this hopefully makes sense where we're becoming from real-life situations derivatives are changing things so we're gonna have them in that equation and then we have a family because the integral idea of plus C as your order goes up more plus C's if you will and we can restrict that family to one particular solution if you have an initial condition alright check out the next video because right now we're going to start plugging in equations to see if they're actually solutions see you next time you 

Transcript for: Checking Solutions in Differential Equations (Differential Equations 3)
here we go our first lesson on differential equations that involves some actual math here and we're going to start very simply we're going to start by checking whether or not a solu well an equation is a solution to a differential equation remember that differential equations involve derivatives and our Solutions are equations themselves usually y equals a function of X that's typically what we have here so if Solutions are equations well let's just take some derivatives and plug them in that's really about all there is to it is we're going to take some derivatives we're going to plug them in now if you watch the introduction to differential equations what I'm planning on doing here I'm going to do a lot of examples if you get it after the first couple examples fine just go on to the next video that's okay I I mean you're not going to hurt my feelings here um my job is to make sure well my goal is to make sure that you're understanding it if that's accomplished in the first couple examples great I would encourage you to watch them I think you'll get something out of them I usually go um up in the uh the difficulty of the problems as we get going but sometimes it just clicks so that's fine so let's start with the very first one we have y Prime which is the first derivative of y + 2 y = 0 we see immediately we've got a differential equation it's an equation it's got a derivative in it that's it this happens to be a first order differential equation because we only have a first derivative in that now it's also asking us check to see whether that guy is a solution to our differential equation all we have to do is match up the derivatives to fit them in here so what we're going to be looking at is this Y is this y we're going to take this we're going to plug it into that y but we also want the first derivative so take as many derivatives as is necessary to match up the function you're given to the differential equation that you have if you have a third order fifth order something crazy you got to take five derivatives or three derivatives respectively uh count respectively so match up the number of the derivatives plug them in see if it works that's how you check Solutions in differential equations I'm going to show you right now so this differential equ equion has a first derivative we're given a function that we're checking let's find a first derivative it says plug in the original function that you're checking anyway so remember that we have things like product rule uh we have things like quotient rule we have things like chain rule that you need to be aware of so I'm going to be doing the derivatives pretty fast I'm not going to show you all the calculus one sort of derivatives this is going to be a little quicker than that kind of counting that you understand those derivatives so here all we got is a chain rule so the first derivative of y remember we get e -2X back but we got a chain rule in there so we're going to have that -2 coming out front being multiplied by that three now we just plug these things in so we're going to take the original function put it here for y we're going to take the first derivative of the function put it for the first derivative of the function so our first derivative this -6 e -2X and then we have two times our original function that we were checking in the first place and if we put this all together it should equal zero we're just making a substitution and sure enough you could see it -6 e -2x + 6 e 2x = 0 this is satisfied we now know that that right there is a solution to that differential equation that's all there is to it uh you match up the derivatives plug them into your differential equation and go for it now I mentioned in the last video that the higher you go in order for a differential equation the more arbitrary constants you have but also the more possibility for different solutions you have as well so right now you see something funny like hey here's a second order that's y Prime second order differential equation and it says here's a y sub one and a y sub 2 what that's asking you is hey is this a valid solution check it is this also a valid solution check it it's kind of the way in math as as Math teachers can give you two problems for once twer so you had to do twice the work you have to check both of them so let's go go ahead walk through it I'm going to do y sub 1 first we'll do y sub 2 next now because we don't have a first derivative we don't have to plug anything in for that but we do have a second derivative so we're going to have to find both derivatives so we can even do this problem so y sub 1 Prime is 3 e 3x of course because we have that chain rule going on and then we do it again how we get that 3 * 3 is 9 e 3x you got to plug it in so we're going to plug in the second derivative for our second derivative the original function for original function it's immediately clear that it works so that's the idea with checking these Solutions in a differential equation let's do it with this y two I'm going to do it off to the other side the first derivative much like what we just did and he might even be able to see it like right now you go well yeah I mean if I if I plug in my second derivative remember this is our differential equation we're checking these in the these Solutions potential Solutions in if I plug in my second derivative on the left and I plug in my original function on the right it's immediately clear that both of these are solutions to that differential equation you know if you want you probably should be trying some of these if you've watched my how to study for math I know it's in the TTP videos it's like the very first one those are Universal guys so if um if you want some study tools on how to study for math one of them is really try the problems without me so if you want to take some time right now see if you can do at least Y sub one y sub 2 has a product rule so pause the video try these things out see if these are solutions to this second order differential equation give it a try I'm going to start with Y sub one right now so I know that with a first derivative and a second derivative I'm going to be taking y sub1 Prime and then y sub1 double Prime so two derivatives here and if we plug those into our differential equation that we're checking to see whether this is a solution or not it's very straightforward not much really happens here we just have plug in in the second derivative plus 4 * the first derivative plus 4 times the original function itself which is right here before we did anything to it and that needs to equal zero if this is actually a solution to that differential equation if we look at it well we have 4 e -2X we have 4 e2x that makes 8 - 8 e -2X this is going to work this is definitely a solution to that differential equation for sure hopefully you got the same thing I did that's the goal now the next one next one's a lot trickier because we have this product rule going on so even though you really don't want to do it you're going to have to do the product rule to be able to check whether that is a solution to this and you got to do it a couple times because we have a second derivative in there so let's start with the first derivative so first derivative the way I learned the way I taught it is derivative of the first times a second plus the first times D the derivative of the second so D of the first time the second plus the first times der of the second now what I mean by first and second if you forgotten this is functions of X anytime you have two functions that include X's you have to and they're multiplied together you have to do a product rule there's no other way around it so the derivative of the first function of X the derivative of this x is one plus so der of the first times the second function of X plus the first which is x times the derivative of the second so we leave the X alone we take the derivative of e2x remember we have a chain rule in there so you're going to get back the e to the -2X but the derivative of that -2X is -2 so that's our first derivative we're going to clean that up right now but that's going to be plugged in right here when we check this in just a moment so let's go ahead and take a second derivative when we take that second derivative if we clean this up a bit this is e the- 2X and then minus 2x e the2x if we um kind of multiply those those that coefficient times that variable X and now we do the second derivative so this first part's pretty easy don't make up stuff that's harder I mean this is just a subtraction we know that we can separate derivatives by addition subtraction so just take the derivative of e -2X but here we have a choice you can choose to think of the first function of X as -2X or you can think of it as 2x if you're going to think of it as 2x then you need to do a minus and you need to have a bracket because that minus sign will distribute so be very very careful on that I'm going to do it this way so I'm going to have this minus sign I'm going to completely ignore that the derivative of the first function is two plus 2X times the derivative of the second function which is e2x some of you might have thought well why aren't you just pulling out the the two here too well you could I I just forgot so either way it doesn't really matter you're going to get back the same thing so derivative of this guy no problem just chain roll here we get our product rule I left the negative out I kept the two in 2x gives us 2 e2x then we keep our 2x the Der of e2x is -2 e2x and then clean it out so we have this minus 2 e2x already minus another two because we distributed that and then we're going to get a plus this and that would give us a minus so 2 * -2 is4 but we're Distributing that which is where we get that plus from so if you're getting a lot of sign errors you're probably not doing this whole bracket thing you're probably missing your site so be careful on that one we can combine the first two terms and it looks like we're about good to go on that thing we're going to go ahead and plug that in to our differential equation we're going to see if this is true so second derivative comes first we're going to plug in this exact guy plus four times the first derivative that's way up here plus four times our original function remember we're checking y sub 2 and we are really hoping that's equal to zero otherwise we're going to think that we did some mistake up there so once we start simplifying all of this stuff the second derivative we have we plugged it in four we got a four first derivative we found our first D we plugged it in hopefully we didn't make any sign errors or anything like that our original function we've checked our original function it's right oh and I did make a mistake good thing I checked that hopeing you guys caught it before I did that would have been a major problem so we had a four and I I just didn't even see the X so the X has to be there four time x e to -2X now we can simplify and see what we're doing we always want to check our work there's a lot going on I did I made a mistake mistake but we fixed it because I checked my work so let's distribute these and let's see what's really happening let's see well this kind of nice those are gone there's 4X e -2X there's another 4 so that makes POS 8X e 2x - 8X e 2x that equals Zer so both of these end up being solutions to that differential equation I'm going to put a couple on the board right now erase the rest of it I would strongly encourage you to try the next two that I put up there for all right hopefully you've tried that or at least started it I'm going to get going on it I'm going to leave a lot of space because I don't know how long this is going to take us let's start with Y sub 1 let's check to see whether that's a solution of that differential equation it's a second order it's got a second derivative up there it also has a first derivative and the original function so we're going to start start with Y sub1 we're going to take two derivatives we're just going to plug it in so I'm going to do that now so the first derivative of y sub1 maybe I'll move this guy over [Music] [Applause] here first derivative no nothing special here I madean a derivative of natural log of x but derivative of x is 1 Dera of L and X is 1x now we take a second der derivative of one is zero but we got to be a little careful on this guy remember that this is really 1 - X1 so we're going to multiply by the exponent that's positive one we'll subtract one from the exponent and we get positive 1x2 those are the things we're going to have to plug into our differential equation let's do it now so we start with x^2 and then we see we're going to put this y Prime the second derivative which we already figured out is 1x^2 then we have x times the first derivative well that's that's this minus y well we know that Y is the original function you darn well better use some parenthesis here because we're subtracting the whole function that means we're subtracting all of this stuff and our signs are going to change and a lot of this process is just simplification doing the derivatives correctly and simplifying which is where all our correct answerers going to come from is are kind of U being really intentional about getting these this simplification correct and not rushing our way through it so x^2 * 1x2 that's 1 if we distribute we get x -1 - x + Ln X = Ln X and all of this stuff cancels and we see for sure that y y sub 1 is certainly a solution to that differential equation let's try y sub 2 again we're going to start by hopefully you know it we're going to start by taking derivatives man we got to make sure we fulfill all those derivatives up there so this will be a little bit more involved because our first term doesn't disappear like it did on y sub one with Y sub 2 on the other hand we get this let's see x to the -1 will bring down the1 that'll be x to the -2 - 1X and we sort of see this cycle that we we just did we're just going to extend it one more time here so uh -1 * x^ -2 we' bring down that -2 that's positive2 over x to the 3r + 1 x^2 for the same exact reason that we did it right there get the same exact thing so this is what we're going to be plugging in to our differential equations we're going to start with X2 again times our second derivative that's this whole piece right there then we see that we have x times the first derivative so we have our X we have our first derivative then we're going to subtract off our original function that's our y sub 2 I hope you're seeing how important those parentheses are you really need them otherwise your signs are going to be all out of whack that's going to equal lnx let's see if this actually works a lot of simplification here but we can manage that if we take x^2 and multiply that through we're going to get 2x hopefully you see it + 1 x^2 and X2 gone minus this is going to give us 1 /x and again we're going to get a minus1 then we just have to dist should be the sign and really hope that we're going to get this at the end well let's look at our ones first the ones are gone there's a plus one there's a minus one but then we have 2x - 1X - 1X well that's 2x - 2x that's zero so all of this is gone and we certainly satisfy Ln xal lnx so we know that both of these equations were solutions to our second order differential equation I want to make sure at this point that you're understanding um what Solutions are solutions are equations so these happen to be particular solutions to this they don't have that uh F that plus C that family of Curves you could easily add a plus c to either of those and uh and the differential equation would work but um these are these are these are particular here so all it takes us to do to check these Solutions is take the appropriate number of derivatives plug it in see if it works I have one more it's a little bit more advanced um I'm going to write that on the board we're going to get to it in just a minute okay so let's get started now we have a second order differential equation we have two equations that we're going to check as Solutions I am only going to do this one this is practically identical but I would encourage you to do it on your own see if you can go through those steps again one of the techniques here is don't follow your notes uh if you don't know what you're doing follow notes but once you've made it past that like after you've done these last four or five examples you really should be able to take that do exactly what's required get the right answer see if that's a solution or not it's going to be identical to the process we're doing I'm not going to waste our time to do that one so I'm just going to focus on this uh one of the reasons why we even do this is is really to get you prepped for the the level of derivatives or just remembering that hey you know we have natural log we have cosine we have S we have product rules we have chain rules we co rules all that stuff so getting us back back on track with all these derivatives and later on with all the integrals that you're going to have to master in order to even do differential equations it's not out of your realm we just have to remember it so let's go ahead let's take two derivatives of this guy and let's see what we're dealing with so y sub one and we're going to take a derivative on that and what's the first thing you see man there's a lot going on we have X we have a trig function and inside that trig function we have another X I know that a lot of you if you're not really used to it anymore want to think of this as three different functions multiplied together they're not there's only two different functions of X right now there's X and then there's cosine of Ln X so the Ln X is inside that cosine we treat that as one function this is a chain rule as opposed to a product rule be careful this is the product rule so we're going to take the derivative of the first gives us one times a second we leave that completely alone plus the first times the derivative of the second now here's where our chain rule comes in the derivative of cosine L and X is take the derivative of the first thing leave the inside thing alone and then multiply by the derivative of the inside thing that's the appropriate derivative product rule first * the second plus the first * the derivative of the second that's sin Ln x * 1X as the derivative of Ln X let's clean up a couple things about it I'm noticing that we have x * 1X those are gone and now we have to take a second derivative well we basically just have this piece in two different places I me we have cosine and sign watch your negative there on the cosine um which I didn't dang it watch your negative on the derivative of cosine and you should be fine good thing I checked that one so derivative the first that's X leave that alone the derivative of cosine is negative sign so we're going to get minus sin lnx * 1X for the chain rule good thing I caught that that would have messed everything up so we do it again derivative of cosine is negative sign we leave the lnx alone but we multiply by the derivative of Ln X to get 1/x by the chain rule next the derivative of is positive cosine of what whatever that function is we take the derivative of the inside function as per the chain rule that's pretty much it now we can Factor some things out if you want to we could factor out a negative one overx if you like we can leave it there if you want it really doesn't matter uh so these things aren't going to affect us super much let's plug them in and let's see what we have so I'm going to be plugging in sin Ln XX minus cosine Ln x/x for the second derivative I'm going to plug in this for the first derivative we plug in this for original function and let's see what happens so there's our second derivative minus our first derivative plus 2 * our original function that needs to equal zero to satisfy that that's an actual solution that differenti of equation let's see what goes on here here it looks like we're going to distribute this and get minus sin l x sin l xus x cosine L and x and here we'll distribute and get x's on both the cosine L and x and sin L and x and then here this has an X sin l x it's looking pretty good we just have to make sure for well let's see if I got my signs right I distribute this I get rid of 1x but I have a minus I distribute this I get rid of 1x but I have a minus I distribute this I have x cosine and I distribute oh I get a plus watch my minus minus plus and then I get this plus 2X cosine Ln X so if I'm looking at everything that's going on here here's a plus X sin Ln x mies with a minus here's the minus here's the plus we got that here's -1x cosine - 2 so that makes - 2x cosine Ln X and plus 2X cosine Ln X all of these are gone we get 0 equals 0 and that satisfies that this is in fact a solution to our second order differential equation try that with that one same exact routine but give it a try for yourself I hope that this has made sense it's very straightforward right now you should have a fundamental idea about what a differential equation is it's just an equation with derivatives we know that our solution our equations themselves and if we take the appropriate derivatives plug them into our differenti of equation it has to satisfy if it's going to be a solution work on those things and I'll be back with another video on how we start finding um some different types of solutions for these or how we we look at it a little differently so I'll see you for the next video 

Transcript for: Introduction to Initial Value Problems (Differential Equations 4)
now's our chance to start solving some differential equations with initial values so if you remember differential equations have derivatives in them we're going to have an equation that is a solution that equation generally usually typically has a c in it it's a family of equations that works as a solution or a family of solutions now if we want a specific or a particular solution we need an initial value I'm going to show you how to start using that so another thing at this time some of you might be wondering how how how do they get how do they get that where where do you get that that that's like the rest of this course on how to find that okay right now is we kind of start at the back end and go what do you what do you how do you check it we're start with checking it how do you find a particular solution we need initial value so I'm going to show you how to do those things and then after that we start the techniques on how to find the actual solution from the differential equation it's not that bad uh but we have to know what to do with it once we get there so let's start with this there there's really three steps on how to how to find some particular solutions to a differential equation step one find if you can your solution if it's given to you that just means you need to verify it so verify that this actually works there if not then none of this actually matters so verify that this works there next you're going to be given an initial condition so this starting spot use that to solve for C and then once you have all you have to do is replace the C right there so I'm going to show you how to do that on like six examples the first three I'm going to do completely for you the next three I would like to do for you to do on your own practice this stuff they're a little bit more advanced but you should have the hang of it by the time you finish these three so step number one let's verify it let's make sure that in this first order differential equation this is actually a solution what that does remember the last video we have to take the derivative thankfully only one of them and plug it in to see if it works so if we take the first derivative C is a constant it doesn't have any x's in it so it's just a number that means that we don't have a product rule here all we have to do is keep the C do this chain rule derivative of 2x is 2 just multiply in the front you're good to go now let's plug this in we're going to take our first derivative we'll see if that's equal to two times our original function yeah that's like immediately apparent that those are those are equal so we know for sure that that's an actual solution we've just verified that that's a solution to that differential equation step number two once you have verified that solve for C this is how you solve for C so we're going to take and plug in and Y of 0al 3 now what that means is that y of 0 what's y of 0 well y of the independent variable x equals this number so replace x with that number replace y with that number and see what happens so I'm going to start you off here let's replace X even shows us what this is it says if you put in 0 for X well it's going to be equal to 3 so if you put in 0 for X it's going to be equal to three that's what that means replace the X with this number replace the Y with this number that's exactly what that means to do and that's that allow us to solve for C we replace all the X's with zero and all the Y's with three C = 13 now man we're almost done all we got to do is replace the C in our original equation our solution equation that we verified with whatever C you found so we are going to have y = 1/3 e 2x let's walk through some terminology just to make sure you know what what's going on okay that's a differential equation it's a first order differential equation this is a solution because we verified it we know that that's a solution it's a general solution because it's got that arbitrary constant in there so this is a family of Curves every single value of C is going to satisfy that it's crazy what we're looking for is now that we know that this is a solution well what's the solution what's that curve that goes through that point is that a point yeah that's the point 03 so notice if you have a family of Curves Let's uh they look like this because they're exponentials if you have a family of curves or like this if that c is negative all those exponentials well then if you have all that what's the one of them that goes through three zero and that's what we're asking oh this one that goes through that point 3 comma 0 that's what we're doing differential equation solution to a differential equation a family of solutions a general solution here if we have an initial condition initial value problem that limits it that says you need to find the one of them that goes through that specific point and that's what we do we solve for C and now we have a particular solution to that first order differential equation that's got to make sense before you go any further that's got to make sense let's try this one so this says a we got a first order differential equation this one's different because it's got an X in it don't let that worry you all you're going to do is the same exact thing find the first derivative plug it in plug in the original um to make sure that it actually works so verify it and then use your initial condition to solve for C so we're finding the first derivative to use here just to verify it this is going to be reused in our equation that we're checking right now so the first derivative chain rule gives us C thex + 1 this goes to Zer we're going to check this with the original in our differential equation to verify that this works so on the left hand side we're taking our first derivative what we just found equal x minus our original equation that we just took the derivative of and we're going to simplify this to see if what they've given us is actually a solution it doesn't make sense to start plugging in initial values if that's not a solution because then you'd say oh this is a this is not a particular solution of that differential equation that is a waste of time so we're going to make sure this works if we distribute that that minus we get X's are gone these are gone 1al 1 we nailed it that is a solution to that first order differential equation now what we have to do is just solve for C so we're done with the differential equation part we're not even looking at that anymore we've we've determined that this is in fact a general solution to it it's got an arbitrary constant we only need one arbitrary constant with that it's a first order one arbitary constant all we have to do now is now that we verified it plug this initial condition in and solve for C so I'm going to rewrite what we're doing here our solution our general solution is this our initial condition we know that's a general solution the initial condition or the point that we need our solution to go through we have to have it satisfy that it's going to give us a a specific C all these are different curves they they look like a whole stream of Curves on a graph but only one of those is going to go through that point the C value is what gives us that one curve that goes that one point x is going to become hopefully you see it X is going to become zero Y is going to become 10 and we're going to solve for C so Y is 10 when X is zero usually these work out pretty nice e to the negative 0 who cares e z that's one uh C * 1 is C plus 0 - 1 if we add that one over Cal 11 let's just replace that and then we're done so our particular solution the the solution that satisfies our initial condition from our family of Curves here for General solution to our differential equation is YX needs to be 11 e x + x minus one that's the idea I hope that's making sense all right let's try one more together before I give you like three more to do on your own um and then I'll of course go through them with you so we do the same same exact process let's find the first derivative let's plug these both in to verify and then let's let's use our initial condition to solve for C so first comes the verification we need to take the first derivative to satisfy our differential equation the derivative of Ln of x + C is 1/ X+ C * the derivative of x plus C that's a chain rule since the derivative of x plus a constant is just one whenever constants go to zero we just get 1/x plus C let's plug that stuff in so we're gonna have e to the Ln X+ C that's e to the y y = Ln X+ C time the first derivative of y we just found that and that's got to equal one well if you remember identities e to Ln that sort of idea those are inverse functions those are an exponential and logarithm are always inverses if they have the same base that's all gone we're going to get X plus c and x + C * 1x + C that's certainly going to equal one so we know that that's a solution of that differential equation now we're going to use our initial condition so I'm going to rewrite it so we have our general solution it's got a c in there plug in your initial condition when X is z y is also zero so 0 has to equal Ln of 0 + C 0 has to equal Ln of 0 + C we have 0 for y we've get Zer for X that looks weird so 0 equal Ln C Let's do an exponential on both sides or just think about it what value of C does there need to be there in order for Ln equal Z Ln of what equals z we go one yeah C's going to be one if you need the exponential e to 0al C do a e on both sides or think about the inverse of Ln it's an exponential e 0al c c has to be one which means now we go back and we just replace our arbitrary constant with something that's not arbitrary anymore something that's particular something that says hey you're going through that point you don't need an arbitrary constant you have a specific constant that's going to let you go through that specific point that initial condition and that constant is one that's the way that we do it verify solve for C then just rewrite it I'm going to erace the board I'm going to put three more on the board for you I would really encourage you to try them see if you can verify Sol for C rewrite it's not that hard but the process of is important because we're always doing these two things when dealing with initial value problems uh later on the verified part well you're not going to verify anymore in a little while you're going to be actually solving this you go oh I solved it now solve for C now rewrite it that's the way it works so now that you have the hang of bit try these three problems yeah they're a little bit more more intimidating there there's there's more stuff going on but don't don't worry about it see if you can verify first take the appropriate derivative plug it in see that it works and then use the initial value problem some of you are probably thinking but I I trust you I I'm kind of yeah that's just just true I can just see it why don't I just plug that in there and find C you can do that you can do you can find c that way it's just good practice to verify it to make sure it actually works because if it doesn't work then that's irrelevant so try it even though we're it seems like we're kind of wasting time because you're like well that if they're telling me that's a solution they're not they're saying verify that it is first um trust me that's a lot easier than finding that yourself so finding that with the techniques later on take a lot more time so verifying is way quicker than actually finding a solution for yourself U so take the time to do it verify it's actually a solution then solve for C and then rewrite it so I'm going to start right now hopefully you'll take the time to do that on your own step number one we're going to find derivatives for everything because they're all first order differential equations that's kind of nice now what we're noticing here though is there's got to be a product rule when you're finding that first derivative here's a function of X here's a function that has X in it we're going to have a product rule so derivative of the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second now the derivative of the second derivative of constant that's zero so that it's not one it's not it's zero this gone the derivative of Ln X is 1x so that's what we're going to be plugging in here let's go ahead and do that so when we verify this we're going to take our first derivative put it here take our original function put it here and just see if it works notice how that's x s and notice how this is going to distribute to all of this this is all the first derivative it needs to be in Brackets let's distribute see what happens if we distribute this we're going to get 3 x Cub times some nasty stuff that we don't really want to look at plus X cubed but here when we distribute we get min -3 x cubed nasty stuff that looks exactly like the other nasty stuff I like that equals x cub and we can see just on some observation here that this and this are gone X Cub = XB and we we win so we know that this right here is a General solution to that differential equation now now it's appropriate to find C it might seem pedantic it might seem like a waste of time I know it would have when I first took it to think like well it's going to be a solution but it's important to verify that so when we plug in we know that when X is one Y is 17 well so 17 = 1 1 cubed is 1 Ln of 1 is z we just talked about a little while ago 0 + C is C so c equal 17 that's it now all we got to do is replace that with 17 and we're done we've taken a general solution with an initial condition and found a particular solution to that differential equation that's it okay next up we're going to take the first derivative to make sure that we verify that this is actually a solution here wow that's crazy do you remember the derivative of tangent hope you do derivative of tangent secant squar but then we have a chain rule involved in that so SEC squ of the original stuff times the derivative of the inside stuff the derivative of this this is 3x^2 + 0 dtive constant 0 so this is 3x2 and we're going to put that in front of secant s of this stuff so we would get secant squ leave the inside alone times the derivative of the inside that's 3x^2 that's it now plug that in 3x^2 2 x + Cal on the right hand side we have some more things going on here we're going to have let's see 3x2 so that's good we have Y 2 Y 2 so all of this squared so tangent squared why because that's y so y s take this stuff and square it Tang s of x + C + 1 that that that doesn't look the same well we have to remember some of our identities so some trig identities are that that works so see X = Tang x + 1 what that means is that this right here is really SEC s x that plus one disappears because of our identity which means that these things are identically the same this is 2 XB + C this is 2 x + C by that identity that I just showed you so that verifies that this is a solution to that first order differential equation now it's on us to find C and then rewrite our original solution as a particular solution so let's do it we got y of Z is one that means that every time x is zero Y is going to equal 1 so 1al tangent of 0 Cub + C okay what value what's it take what's C got to be for tangent of that value to equal one I'm thinking got to be Pi 4 so C is pi 4 because tangent of Pi 4 is 1 now we rewrite so we're here remember I rewrote it I always rewrite them I verify then I solve for C I always rewrite and then I at the end I just replac the C so that is a particular solution notice how solving for C gets rid of our arbitrary constant we're good to go that's what we're talking about that's a particular solution if you have it man I'm really going to just beg you to try that one on your own I'm going to erace a little bit give you some time to pause the video try it if you haven't already so here we are let's take our derivative let's plug it in let's verify first let's solve for C second let's rewrite it last again we have that product rule going on there's a function of x times another function of X the derivative of the first the derivative X plus C is 1 1 * cosine X and then we're going to take the first function X plus c times the derivative of the second well the derivative of cosine X is negative sinx so I'm going to put minus derivative of the first * the second plus the first * the derivative of the second which gives us that minus there so that's our first derivative thankfully we don't have to take a second derivative we just have to plug that in so if we do that it says take the first derivative that's all of the stuff we just did plus okay so this is our first derivative we're done with that plus take y That's your original multiply by tangent X and that should yeld cosine X and again this doesn't look quite right well nothing cancels Leonard what in the world are you doing to me here you need some identities because tangent is sin x over cosine X well the cosin are gone we're going to get cosine x minus x c x plus C sin x plus x + C sin x those cosiness are gone because that's part of tangent so if we get rid of those we get cosine equals cosine and that's all you have to do that that's verifying it's it's not fancy Dancy just making sure that when you plug in the derivative in the original function that you actually have a solution there it's a waste of time to do that do anything else if you haven't checked that now now that we've done that we're done with that differential equation we have our solution we know that that's it that's our general solution we just need to find C we can always do that with our initial condition we know that when X is pi that Y is zero oops when X is pi I guess I should replace all the X do you remember what cosine of pi is so s of Pi is 0 cosine 0 is one cos Pi is 1 so C is pi we can rewrite our our general solution with our C we get a particular solution to our differential equation I hope this is making sense that's about as much as I want to show you on how to how to find um particular Solutions given some initial conditions some initial value problems is what they they typically call those there's one more it's kind of a weird one sort of for fun sometimes you'll be asked to do something like um find all the values of a certain variable that make this a solution and we're going to try one of those right now I think the only reason why I'm doing this is because sometimes you get weird stuff you're not used to it you just don't know where to start not that it's really hard it's just you don't know where to start so how in the world do we find all the values of r that make this a solution of that well just follow the process that we just did okay um find derivative plug the stuff in and then you will eventually be able to solve for R I'm going to show you with one of them the rest of them are very similar if you have questions to ask of you like this let's find the second derivative the first derivative remember the chain rule the second derivative gives us R squar so first derivative we get the e to the RX back but the derivative of RX is R do that again we're just going to get r s plug that stuff in so 4 * the seconda equals the first derivative I'm sorry I'm I misspoke there 4 * the second equals the original function right but those are never zero right e to any any power is never never zero so we can divide both sides by e to the RX not worry about dividing by zero these are gone and if we divide we're going to get 4 R2 equal 1 but wait a minute couldn't we just um I do it a number of different ways I suppose could we divide by four take a square root by ways you could subtract the one difference of squares I don't care how you do it what we've just determined is that the only values of R which give us solutions to that differential equation are when R is 1 12 or negative one2 so hopefully you see what I mean by just just follow the the differential equation find the derivatives plug it in eventually the stuff is going to disappear you'll be able to solve for R these are the values that make that a solution of that differential equation man I hope that makes sense to you um so now we should have a pretty good idea about what it takes to solve for a particular solution it takes an initial value problem for a given solution so you have to have the solution first you have to find it or it's going to be given to you you verify it so you find it or verify it plug in the initial value it's going to give you a particular next time we're going to talk about a specific application of this so see you for the next video when we talk about some time rates of change 

Transcript for: Introduction to Time Rate of Change (Differential Equations 5)
welcome back one very important application of differential equations is the manner in which some quantity changes over time well that's that's really we're talking about right is derivatives are our rates of change and we live in time and so things are always changing something really dorky within the time and these are always changing as time goes forward well that's a time rate of change so a time rate of change it really is a look at how some quantity is changing as time changes one of them man biggest things we can talk about the population so populations are always in a state of change populations of bacteria popular human populations about insect populations where you want to talk about populations are almost always changing so we're gonna take just a brief look at how this works I know this is introduction we're gonna get really heavy into this in about 25 more videos okay so we'll get really deep into rates of change in population increase in decrease as it relates to time with death rates and birth rates and all of that wait I was just a brief look at it so here's what we can we can do so the first thing we're gonna do is if we have like key population and T time I want to talk about where these differential equations are even coming from so let's say that we want to determine the rate at which our population is increasing or decreasing not just a population because that's just a census you just count all the people you got it but how it's changing that's important that that's planning that's what's going to happen the feature are we increasing or decreasing how much are we increasing what's it look like so if we want to think about the rate of change of our population as it relates to time well that's a derivative isn't it the way that our population is changing as it relates to time is a derivative of the population function with respect to time so we want to look at that that right there that's a first derivative if I do that that's a differential equation I have nothing over there yeah a minute but that's a derivative of population with respect to time the way that populations changing with respect to time we need to get it in your head that a derivative is a rate of change we need to get in your head that differential equations deal with rates of change so that's why they deal with derivatives is they're looking at the way over how to model these huge math problems based on changing things that wouldn't would say this is the way the population is changing or the rate of increase or decrease of the population with respect to time so according to how time is progressing now it's been studied a lot that typically a lot of times most of the time populations are proportional as sorry let me rephrase the way a population changes the way that increase increases or decreases is proportional to the population itself so the more people you have sometimes the faster the population increases the fewer the people the slower it increases usually makes sense we're gonna for a very simple case we're gonna assume that the way the population changes the rate of change of the population with respect to time is proportional to the population itself when we deal with proportionalities if you want to look back at out direct variation inverse variation that would be like intermediate algebra level whenever we say varies directly or varies inversely we have a K this constant of variation same thing here so our population varies or the rate of change of our population with respect to time is proportional to the population that's some basic stuff that we've had so this is well it might look like where's that coming from it's it's not coming out of nowhere it's saying hey that's the way our population is changing and it's proportional to the population that's it now we've got to be able to solve that I'm gonna how much eat I'm gonna give you this solution because ever talk to you how to find the equation that would work here there's some techniques you're gonna get in the next few videos that show you how to do stuff like this right now everything's been given to you that's okay we're just learning what this stuff means essentially so what where we're at right now is that so now a differential equation look it's got a derivative what's it what's that you mean well this is the rate of change of our population as time goes on how what's it equal to well we understand that the rate of change of a population is proportional to the population itself so that's where that case come in in constant of variation it's a constant so I'm going to give you the general solution of this so our solution notice how this is a derivative of the population so our our population function is going to be our general solution here let's verify that it works remember that this could easily be written as T prime so I know used like Y prime Y double prime before now we're kind of switching over into the more light in his notation of dp/dt derivative population with respect to time I'm gonna use that pretty much throughout the course where I can I prefer it it's more expressive especially when dealing with times for me so let's verify that this right here is actually a solution to that first order first through the differential equation it's kind of derivative in it it's an equation let's see if it actually works so we're going to just like everything else we've done in the previous videos we're going to take the first derivative the derivative of the population with respect to time is well let's see that's a constant there's no product rule this is a chain rule so we have public became first we get back the function times the derivative of our exponent which is just K this is with respect to time let's plug it in so we're gonna put our first derivative we're first derivative goes equals K times the original function what I just gave you are so the thing I'm proposing is our solution and they're exactly the same what that means is that just like before in the last couple videos we did that is in fact a solution to that differential equation this is a general or family of solutions to that differential equation well what's it gonna take to find scene oh yeah we need an initial value so when we're doing this number one or showing we're showing that this is actually solution that we're verifying that number two we're going to solve for C we're going to use it so we're going to use our initial value problem and then we're going to utilize it so let's practice that so step one was coming up with this or that's given to you or understand that rates of change or proportional population a red change population is proportional to the population okay this you're kind of cheating right now I'm giving it to you I will show you how to find that later so given this we verify that that's actually true and now we need something more we need something to find that C to actually use it because if you haven't recognized right now we have two constants that's that that's a bad thing that's because we can't use anything here I tell you how about plug in five years you go okay five but there's nothing there and there's nothing there so you get C to the 5k and there's nothing for you we need to find out what C is we find out what K is so those are those two pieces are found by two different values usually a starting amount and how much you have after some time has passed we need two points here one for the C one for the K the initial value is almost always how you find the C so let me say this how about we start with a thousand buddies that's a lot of money so a thousand buddies at t equals zero we got a thousand bunnies in other words since that's a population function and it's based on T the population at time zero equals a thousand is that looking familiar if you watch the last video is that looking from that hope it's looking familiar because that's an initial value problem that says hey when T is zero population 2000 okie-dokie we can we can do that when T is zero populations a thousand notice we are done with the differential equation all we had to do was verify that's a solution now in future lessons we will be solving this for a solution then using it right now we just verify and you're done you're done with it all you're gonna do now is utilize it so I know but that's our general solution I further know that that's our initial condition let's plug it in it should let us solve for C initial values are what is used to solve for your arbitrary constant the C the proportional constant or the the constant of variation or constant of proportionality that's found by the next piece so differential equation solve it or it's given to you cool verify now we solve for C look if this says whenever T is 0 our population is 1,000 can you see why it's really helpful to have an initial value like T is 0 because at T equals 0 where you start that's important if T wasn't zero you'd still have a K here and you still have a need as some number that's not zero that wouldn't give you one that wouldn't let you solve for C so it's really important and why initial values are helping us solve for C especially in this case is that it zeros out the exponent and e to the zero power is 1 so 1,000 equals C times 1 or C equals 1,000 you man I hope this looks familiar to you like from your calculus 2 days where you'd have something exactly like that and they would say yeah well this is a piece of 0 e to the KT well here's some piece of zero coming from what that's that's the initial population but why are they getting that there for right here because the initial population of population at time 0 the population of time 0 is going to be exactly equal to C that's where that comes from so we know though we found T sorry that we found C is a thousand notice how that works for what I just talked about that's the initial population a thousand monies how do we know that well that's what we start with and we plug in time equals zero that's we start with a thousand bunnies and that's it now well we gotta find the K to really make this useful so we need something else let's say that the population of bunnies tripled in one year's time you know put that in numbers the population trips so what's the population if it tripled be 3000 population tripled in one year's time so T stands for years P at one equals 1,000 after one year we had 3000 because the population triple we can use this now so after we found C we can use this now to find our K our constant of variation so let's plug that in so this says that anytime T is 1 our piece can be 3000 three thousand three thousand one thousand stays he stays the K we're looking for T is 1 because that's after one year does it make sense to you that the first step we should do is goodbye and we'll get three it's triple it should be three hundred percent increases triple e to the K so now we're gonna have to solve for K and remember your logarithms memory your natural log this is 2 and natural log on both sides so k equals Ln 3 and we plug that back in to what we already had 1,000 a to the KT becomes 1000 E to the LM 3 times T because our Kahless natural log of 3 so let's go ahead and let's let's find out let's use this to find the population in a little while time so if you want a little recap we start with the difference of the places we solve it somehow or it's given to us we verify immediately verified after that we know we have a general solution it's going to take two pieces of information one is going to be well an initial population so at time 0 how much did you start with that's going to solve for C for you next we'll need what happens in a little while time so some definable amount of time like 1 year 2 years 1 month 1 minute whatever it is plug that in and it's going to let you find your K how we can use this for practically anything how many buddies are going to be around in 3 a half years probably probably a lot so let's find P of 3 point 5 one more thing you might want to do just to make this not as obnoxious here you can do some mathematical razzle-dazzle with that if you have Ln of 3t and exponent remember I'm gonna do a little little sub note here remember that X to the M times n is X to the M to the N you know what's that doing e to the ln 3 times T is e to the Ln 3 to the T power but because you have E and Ln composed on one another you have inverses in the composition these are gone you're gonna get 3 so you can rewrite a lot of these by just doing well this is going to be one of gravity 1000 times 3 to the T that makes things a lot more concise what where'd that come from well you have a multiplication of exponents that's an excellent race to an exponent e to the Ln 3 is just 3 so you have 3 to the team try it both ways if you'd like see if it actually works I'm just I'm begging you right now just he's still multiply those of you 3,000 bacon ok just bacon that breaks court operations excellence before multiplication you'll notice I have 3.5 sylheti because I want to see where it comes from now if I want to find out how many bunnies we got in 3.5 years just plug in 3.5 for that team oh my gosh if you did that yourself three to the 3.5 I hope I did my math right three and 3.5 is big times a thousand I have forty six thousand seven hundred sixty-six rabbits or there abouts if my math was ready to be quick but that's buddies in three years they're bunnies they guess they do stuff anyway so race to change that that's what differential equations are in the first place so these are just with respect to time populations things that grow over time that's that's what a time rate of change is it's a differential equation that's specifically geared towards time as the independent variable done exactly the same way as far as verifying done exactly the same way as far as you need an initial condition to find a particular solution in this case they eliminate your arbitrary constant that's exactly what we were doing last video the K part of it you need something else for that so you need where are you in a finite amount of time that will let you solve for K after you have used your initial condition use that first then once you've found the constant arbitrary constant and the constant of variation your K you can use for lots of things how many bunnies you're gonna have three and a half years lots of bunnies or your dog cute or whatever else you have how much you can have in 20 years if this holds up now later on we're gonna talk about stuff like a limiting factor on population there's there's a carrying capacity we don't just get to multiply forever and expect that the same areas gonna sit to sustain this population of bodies so there's going to be birth rates and death rates this would be the case if none of the bunnies died but we know that bunnies do die and more bunnies are born and things like that so we're gonna have some more robust examples later on this is just get your feet wet understand difference with collisions as they relate to time I hope that makes sense I hope that you guys stick around for the next ones we're gonna start learning how to actually solve some differential equations from scratch without being given the solution next time thanks for watching you 

Transcript for: Solving Basic Differential Equations with Integration (Differential Equations 6)
welcome to another video this one's kind of exciting because now we finally get to start solving differential equations on our own the path speed video is only really done is kind of identified what they are how they kind of relate real-life things and then how to check whether an equation is a solution but I never told you where the solutions came from we're gonna start right now and we're gonna start with the most basic of differential equations if you remember a differential equation is just an equation has a derivative of some function in the equation and some other some other junk sometimes the function itself sometimes second derivatives all sorts of things floating together our idea is to solve by finding the equation that satisfies the difference of the equation so and then that's generally the family of curves we're going to talk about that right now so the most basic case that we can have in difference of equations is when we have a differential equation with a derivative and just a function of X so this is a differential equation that's your derivative a derivative of Y with respect to X or independent variable equals some function of X and here's the key with no lies so no to know Y itself no function of Y I know first derivative know second derivative just the derivative isolated on one side and a function of X on the other side if you have this situation for if you can make this situation you manipulate your problem a little bit these are the most basic types of differential equations in fact pretty much all of calculus 2 is based on this idea so every time you did a an integral in difference within calculus 2 you were kind of treating it like a differential equation in a sense because that's exactly how we solve it if you just have a derivative of the function you're trying to find and it's people to some function of X and otherwise in there well then we know a little something about derivatives we know that if we do an integral and integral will undo a derivative and that's how these most basic differential equations are solved let's show you a little bit of math behind it and then we're gonna I'll show you what that these can be done that way so we have a derivative equals function of expertise the riveting function of X no iess derivative function of X no wise derivative function of X no Wiese same thing for the last two driven up on one side function of X on the other side with no why's know why primes no no double life second derivatives just an isolated derivative and a function of X so what I mean by why integrals work so well for this we're gonna see some funny math if you remember where a derivative comes from it's this idea that Y is changing as X is changing and this this distance that you're changing it's really really little calculus one teaches us that that limit of get really really really really really really really close to something else is this idea of a limit well these come from a delta Y and a delta X and the way that you start with with your derivatives is that Delta X is actually on the other side from a Delta Y because of that idea we can move this around it looks really weird but we can actually write this worse dy ever we could write that as dy equals f of X DX we can treat them like they're separable like that DeWine that DX are just pieces that we move around they come from the fact that we have the Delta X Delta Y in our limit we take the limit as as well do you know what we take is we take that limit and the the Delta X's get really really really really little we call that the differential so we're going to talk about different differential forms of differential equations much later but we need to know that we can move around dy the exits we can separate those things now because we have this idea of an equation whatever you want to an equation as long as you do to both sides we can actually take an integral of both sides so if you take an integral of dy well think of that as 1 dy take an integral of 1 dy n cdy Specter what you're gonna get why take an integral of f of X remember this has no y so this is solely based on X which is why this works why it's so simple why chemicals work is because you're able to separate the dy and the DX on the right on the left hand side integral of dy gives you Y on the right hand side integral of f of X because that has no lies in it because it has no second derivatives first derivatives nothing nothing like that this is typically if it's even if it's possible it's a basic integral of f of X so straight out account to and I've chosen some probs up here that's going to help you remember some of the techniques about calculus too so we're gonna have some integration by parts substitution some tricks and stuff like that just to give our brains wrapped around it this is more practice than anything because that is very basic that is if you have a derivative and a function of X with no Y's separate the DX into an integral that's that's practically and if you get that you're gonna be fine so let's let's do it the integral of f of X well you get some antiderivative there well what you're also going to get you remember this because you're teaching Yeley every time they didn't do it you get a plus seems and a lot of time talking about that plus seen we talked about how that plus C creates this general solution it's an arbitrary constant and it creates a family of curves each of which is going to satisfy this if you take a derivative of this right here you're going to get the derivative of Y with respect to X is equal to well the derivative of antiderivative obviously but then the constant that's a constant is going to go to 0 it's going to give you back that for any choice of C that we have that's a constant that's the arbitrary constant idea this is a family of curves and what's interesting about this is that what these create are this family of curves that are in a sense parallel parallel and then they don't intersect think about this for a minute let's see if you add that on to the end of a function all it creates is this vertical shift up or down on the y-axis it's not moving so not living - right it's just shifting it around same exact curve it's just one right and think of a parabola one right on top of another right on top of another right on top of another they're never going to intersect so we're going to talk a little bit about this after we do these problems just to get practice about the difference between a general solution this and the difference if you have one initial value because what's gonna happen I'll preview I don't like suspense in math you need to know what's gonna happen if you have derivative filling to dimensionalize take an integral both sides you're going to get a Y and you're gonna get an antiderivative of the right-hand side user whatever technique you can from calc 1 or calc 2 what you end up getting is a family of curves we call that family of curves the general solution it's got an arbitrary concept could be any number whatever but it is constant if we want to narrow it down here's the the key for a particular solution if we want to narrow it down we need just one point why do we need just one point well to think about this if these are all parallel curves in a sense that they don't intersect then only one of them is going to go through any one distinct point because if they don't intersect they never share any common points think about that so if I give you a point say hey I want the one who goes to this there's only gonna be one curve that satisfies that in this type of a difference in the equation of this type of the solution that's what narrows down our family of curves into a particular to say here's all of our parallel curves I want the one that goes through that point okay that's going to create one particular solution so we're gonna do that just a little bit so let's start with doing some examples I'm gonna erase the board we should have this idea down the idea is if you have a derivative equal to a function of X no lies in it we're just going to move our DX and do an integral that's it make sure you get a plus C that's your general solution so we're gonna do these five examples on the board again that there's our different techniques and then it's the sewing practice and then I'm gonna start putting up those initial conditions all right so here we go so I've rewritten the problems the same ones we had in the board just a minute ago let's go ahead and go through all the the ideas of we can still take integrals there's some taken have played five different techniques up here for you so that we're just kind of getting our brains wrapped around it and then we'll talk about the initial conditions so let's make sure that they fit before we do every one of them in every case we have a derivative of Y with respect to X equal to a function of what we're taking the derivative Y with respect to so here's the derivative of Y there's an independent variable and this is a function in just the independent variable that isn't necessary for this technique to work if you have any wise floating around over here if you have any second derivatives or other derivatives in there this is not the right technique to use we're going to deal with a lot of different techniques but this is a very very basic one you get a derivative on one side function of X or the function of independent variable on the other side that's it so what we're going to do number case is we're going to move that DX you don't you don't really have to there there is a way to think about it if you wanted to right now take an integral with a DX on both sides but then understand that because that comes with a delta X idea it's getting closer to that Delta X changes exit getting closer to zero but never becomes zero it's okay to cancel that out so you can actually do that most people do not do that so most people think about this as well that's a little bit weird to think of the math is kind of kind of funny on that but if we do just move the DX which is possible then we can take the idea of an integral on both sides so this idea that hey just take an integral on both sides okay and if we do that on the left hand side it's really nice because you just have the integral of dy or the integral of 1 dy it really dy it's going to give you back about Y function that you're looking for a differential equation on the right hand side this is where all of your work is gonna come in with this technique you still need to know how to do to do integrals you still need to know some basic substitution techniques or your table of integrals it's really helpful here at this point in your math careers I now know who your teacher is or even if you even have a teacher if you just learn this for fun or whatever may be a part of your job or relearning it because you've been out of school for a while that's fine but most most instructors most professors really don't care super much about seeing the hardcore work on your techniques of integration they can't understand the idea so whether you're finding the answer from a table of integration or you're crunching it all out doesn't matter it really smoke for most of us it really doesn't matter the idea behind it's more important so on some of these you go man that that's a that's a substitution yeah you're right that looks like 10 inverse because table of integration sure that looks like well whatever that's going to be because of table integration or trig so it doesn't really matter anymore so use what's easiest to you to get the job done for integrals this one you could use a u substitution and do u equals X minus 2 but because the derivative of that X minus 2 is just 1 man we can just treat this like it's one variable and just do the integral like we normally would so imagine this is just u we would add 1 to the exponent that's 3 divided by the new exponent so 1/3 bunch of crap in here squared the the derivative of this is 1 which is why it works otherwise we would start dividing by the derivative there and the biggest part about it what we're just talking about is this is going to create a family of curves by that plus C these are all parallel none of them intercept if you start adding different values of C they're all stacked right on top of one another and it's a family of curves each of which satisfies our original differential equation but you kind of messed up there I want to write that back so you see what we started with because it says this here's a function that if you take a derivative of it the derivative of this function is going to be that and that's true that's the solution to a differential equation let's do the next one so on the next one we still have a derivative equals a function of X no lies no nothing pretty basic so we're going to do two things so we're gonna move the DX over we're gonna take an integral I like to show this in two steps and most of the time you really don't have to so if you move this over you go okay that's a dy equals x square root of x plus nine DX and you go that's let's do an integral of both sides we just put that right out front that's fine if you that now on the left hand side this is this is great this is just gonna be Y on the right hand side we'll have to have something else this looks like au sub to me so if I take this as my U then D u equals 2x DX I've shown several techniques throughout the 14 years I've been teaching this stuff about how to do this with basic calculus so whether you're of my school where you like to solve for DX and then substitute in cancel the X's or whether you what most will do is they will just solve for the pieces that show up here so the twos not in those pieces move the two then replace the X and the DX with just that little piece so here's our square root of you will call that u to the one-half we know that X DX is de over two so when we do our integral we've got this hey let's add one to the exponent that's going to give us three-halves over three-halves but we had this one half four right here well that's going to be one of these chains are gone we have y equals one-third let's put our you back in there x squared plus nine but analysis to the three halves power and then once C is ultimately extremely important for us without that plus C an initial value can't be used because there's nothing there's nothing to plug in to test that that well to find out what that value of C would be so if you don't have a plus C how you gonna find that doesn't make sense so you have to add the also can you check your work obviously we should be able to check our work here if you take a derivative well three halves times one-third that's gonna be that that one half thing a little house that one happen disappeared three half times one third gives you one-half x squared plus nine is gonna stay to the one half power but then the derivative and the inside is 2x the one-half and that two are gone you're left with an X square root or a one-half power x squared plus nine and a plus T would disappear also so that does work that's a general solution you check you with the derivative okay next one this one looks a little bit hard at first to Alex I don't see a use of your right you don't but don't forget that there's a lot of techniques and calculus to if we just isolate that D wide and we take our integral after that we had a function a derivative of y equal a function of X we do our integrals on the left hand side the integral of dy is just Y on the right hand side ten tens a constant it has no bearing on the immigration just pull it out or leave it on numerator if you want to or leave it on on the outside is it's a matter it's a constant if we're gonna get ten but right now with that x squared plus one yeah you could use a trig soap but if it's one of those basic things it's kind of been drilled in your head oh man something over x squared plus one that's that's in a table here what would I do well it's ten inverse so if you have the table of integration or you've memorized some of this stuff don't be afraid to use that we do need a plus C on the back and if we take a derivative of that we do know that this the derivative of this is that thing so we're good to go next one well this is a little bit trickier you could use a table of integration for this we notice that it's a derivative it's equal to a function of X without Y's in there that's great if we separate out that DX gotta be a little bit more concise we notice that we can take an integral really nicely the integral of dy again is y on the right hand side the well that's that isn't a table of integration so if you want to look that up that's fine but if you don't remember it or if you just want practice like I do right now you could do it a trick set so we look at this and go that looks like a triangle okay that big triangle it's a square root the the math and side looks like a relationship between the sides of a right triangle I always set up my triangles exactly the same same orientation every single time now many of you if you didn't take me or you watch my videos go you can watch them right now it's in calculus too it's trig sub I want to say this in Chapter seven but I can't remember right now i I don't memorize this stuff what I do I've never memorized it what I do is I think through what would these sides have to be on a right triangle if you're subtracting then you're subtracting a smaller side from a bigger one and that's got to be the hypotenuse so one must be the hypotenuse x has to be another leg then so you're doing Pythagorean theorem you'd have a square root of one squared minus x squared is going to give you this side so this whole piece is going to be the side of this right triangle then the square root of this is a side and the square root of this is a side what we want to do is find the hypotenuse first because you're subtracting that's got to be bigger than that otherwise you would have a negative instead of a square root it wouldn't represent a right triangle so that has to be the hypotenuse this is going to be a leg somewhere because you're it the way the math looks is you take the hypotenuse minus another side that's going to be one of these legs so what we want to do is create a relationship where we have the hypotenuse correct but then we also have this idea where we don't want a square root inside of one of these three trig functions sine tangent or secant so right now I know that sine looks pretty good if I put an X right there but put an X there sine is x over 1 that's pretty nice this last side isn't used in any of the tricks up it's used to get back your X's at the very end so okay you know what in this relationship sine of theta equals x over 1 now if we're going to do us a substitution like that we need to know that because X is our independent variable we're dealing with the DX you need a DX substitution also that comes from a derivative here so sine theta equals x then take a derivative of both sides cosine theta equals DX that less a substitute so we've already done integral of dy its Y on the right hand side we still have an immigrant we still have a 1 you still have a square root we still have 1 over that square root we have 1 minus x is sine so we have this sine squared theta inside but DX I kind of forgot something here that I need is mimic Mitch it is when you do a derivative of sine theta equals x you're going to get cosine theta but I forgot my D theta now if that makes sense to you I'm going to show you something here if that makes sense to you like oh yeah it makes sense that D theta and DX are on opposite sides then what I showed you the very beginning should also make sense that you can move the DX because could you solve this for D theta DX yeah you could and you have a derivative of theta with respect to X it's the same exact idea it's just a little bit different a little bit different in how we structure the problem but not the ideas are the same so we had the X now we have this cosine theta D theta the reason why we use tange and sine and secant is because on that right triangle there's identities kind of built-in if you use the the sine the tangent of the secant they've worked out really nice for instance one minus sine squared theta is cosine squared theta so this guy this is cosine squared theta square root of cosine squared theta is cosine theta these are gone all we're going to have is y equals an integral of D theta or 1 D theta y equals theta let's see how in the world am I going to do that that's what our substitutions for if sine theta equals x then theta by definition has to equal sine inverse of X so what we have his wife will sign inverse of X plus C which is nice now the last one sometimes you run into stuff that you have a practice in a long time I'm gonna kind of repeat the idea these are old concept we've used them but if you've had calc 3 if you don't do a whole lot of this this last one in calc 3 sometimes you forget or you just it's not coming to mind so if you have something that you know you should be able to do with integral and you go well it doesn't look like when I've taken integral both sides a substitution right it's not it doesn't look like a trig so you definitely not it doesn't look like anything that is easy for us maybe you're dealing with the integration by parts and that's what we have here for integration two parts to use some people use limpid a way to think about through what you would take as your you what you would take is your V what you want is for the derivative to make it to become easier and for the integral of what's left over to be possible so when you're dealing with integration by parts one of the first things I'll do is I'll look at this and say I need one of these things that are connected by multiplication become you I mean that you'd be something I can take a derivative of and generally becomes easier typically I also need the integral of whatever's left over to be possible and to not get worse you don't want that to get worse on you otherwise if you pick the wrong thing you'll tell really quick cuz your problem will start to explode oh man that looks way worse let me keep going at it don't keep going at it you probably made the wrong choice so what I'm looking at this I need to I know this is why on the right hand side I need to pick one of these pieces that things are connected by a product here to be you and the rest of its going to become V so the way I always thought the way that I have talked to you if you watched it I will pick you as X I cover that up so ok X is gone V is in whatever is left over so be is everything else if we actually do that integral you don't need a plus C here if you did a plus C you and wrap that up later on with a larger plus C you don't need to leave it right there so we know that y equals u times B U is X B is negative e to the negative X you do that integral you're going to get the it's like a basic u sub u would be negative x the derivative that is negative 1 so you have a negative floating in there that's going to come out right there so if u times B is negative from here x times e to the negative x so u times V minus the integral of VDU which means you need to use the D u comes from your substitution for u so u equals x d u equals in this case DX so we pick something that the derivative generally gets easier the rest of it should be an integral that's possible we integrate and we derive so we have u times V got that minus the integral of VDU kind of flip-flopping here that's the first part negative x e to the negative x minus this right here's that integral well the integral of e to the negative x is negative e to the negative x but we have a negative floating out front so we're going to get positive a negative so minus is that minus this becomes actually positive e to the negative x and then we do with less now we can start factoring out if you want to factor out a negative e to the negative x this thing looks pretty good that way and what we have is a general solution in every one of these cases we've started with a derivative equals a function of X with no wise and out of it like ten times but it's important you get that in your head those are the basic the basic is if it is made of a word the most basic differential equations they're done with integrals move the DX integral so you have to move the DX but integrate with DX on both sides take an integral on both sides on the left hand side you're just going to get Y the solution what you're looking for in the first place on the right hand side you should have an integral that is possible don't have to be easy they can be quite difficult most of the time in a section like in a textbook through textbook right now they'll give you a lot of different techniques like I did so I gave you some basic ones some substitution some trig sounds stuff some tables and then some integration by parts to get used to that just for us to practice so what we've done though what's important for you guys to grasp right now is that all of these solutions are general solutions they all have a plus C they're all creating this I'm just to pretend they're all parabolas I know they're not but we create this family of curves it's infinite if you add plus C it's just a vertical shift so you could have like plus one point zero zero zero zero one plus one point zero zero zero zero two plus one point zero zero zero zero zero I'd love to comma zero is three and you could have these things you stacked right on top of one another the key point here is that none of them all of them are parallel none of them charity points what that means is that if we give one point so well I I want to go through I'll go through this that point right there there's only going to be one curve in the entire family that does that it's going to be one particular solution out of the general solution one particular curve out of the family of curves so let's do that let's all mint these problems with just some initial values right now so the first one let's suppose that given our differential equation we have our general solution we know it's a plus C it's a family of curves but I want the one curve that goes to the point 2 comma 1 2 comma 1 would look like that Y of 2 equals 1 X would be to the corresponding Y value would be 1 that's a point 2 comma 1 so this is asking for the curve that goes through the point 2 comma lines all that same if you remember from a couple videos ago we started thinking about particular solutions we solved for some C's it's the same exact stuff in fact it's basically the same lesson it's just now you have one technique to be able to find the solution before we verified it and then we plugged in to solve for C now we just have to solve proceed because we've already found it ourselves so we replace X with 2 Y with 1 it's going to solve for C we plug that back in in our case here if X is 2 2 minus 2 0 0 cubed is 0 1/3 times 0 0 plus C is C and we know that that's 1 so C equals 1 and then all we do is rewrite that that's no longer a general solution that's a particular solution that says that this is the one curve that satisfies that differential equation but also gives to that one point you see the difference I hope you see the difference in that that this is a particular it's no longer you can plug in anything you want to get different curve to satisfy this differential equation it's there's now 1 and that plus C is all it takes to save this the one curve going to that point that's kind of cool next one let's suppose that we have the fact that we need to go through the point negative 4 comma 0 all right we've already done the entire integral but down here right at the very bottom we know that Y is 0 when X is negative 4 let's see 16 16 plus 9 25 to the 3 next power when you do like 3 halves power that happens the square root so how I always do this I don't take 25 to the third power and then take a square root that's crazy what I do is I take 25 square root power I get 5 and then a cubit since 125 so 125 over 3 if I subtract it on both sides we get a really awkward scene again 25 square roots 5 cubed 125 over 3 subtract both sides we now know C is negative 125 over 3 that's when it shouldn't be too bad let's suppose it on the next example this derivative equals 10 over x squared plus 1 that we need to go through the origin Y of 0 equals 0 Y is 0 when x is 0 ten inverse of 0 man do you remember what that is tan inverse of 0 so if I do what angle tan versus zero equals theta so tan of theta equals zero do the inverse then we think that's the sine over cosine of sine zero at zero so let's just pick zero so tangent of zero gives us zero so tan inverse of 0 is also 0 that's once you think you're good stuff C is zero so our original solution here has a plus C of 0 that's it ok second last one let's suppose on this we got to go through the point zero zero again we do the same thing cyan versus zero is still going to be zero so we would have no plus C here as well let's say that's a kind of same exact example listed last one last one is kind of interesting we wanted them to the point zero one so if we go through the point zero one that says that Y is 1 when X is zero be careful on the little math it sucks so much to know how to do all this stuff and then make a little air down here that's gonna be kicking yourself I hate that so let's really be careful 0 plus 1 is obviously 1 but e to the negative 0 make sure to make any sense but e to the 0 is still 1 so you have 1 times 1 but it's negative so C is not zero here this is one equals negative one plus C you add that wonderful side C is 2 so we get a particular solution from our family of curves that goes through that particular point 0 comma 1 I hope this is making sense to you long story made sure how we deal with this is if you have a derivative that's equal to a function of X with no lies try an integral now usually work pretty nicely and then that's a general curve general family of curves you have this plus C it's parallel families here if you want to go through one point that's called an initial condition and there's only one Curtis satisfies that a particular curve a particular solution so if you want if you yeah what a good idea would be is to try some of these right now before we go into the next video make sure you understand this concept because we're gonna kick it up a notch and start talking about how well acceleration and velocity are derivatives that are related to one another to to the position we're gonna start talking about how to do that so get this stuff down so the next step makes sense hopefully you got it I'll see you for the next video you 

Transcript for: Differential Equations with Velocity and Acceleration (Differential Equations 7)
hey there let's get going another idea actually an extension what we just did in the last video so now that we've talked about the most basic differential equations and how to find a solution to them through integration let's go step further what if we had a second-order differential equation so something with the second derivative could we do the same idea here's a second derivative of some function y equal to a function of X with no variable Y in them so what we're going to learn this lesson is that this is possible if we just have X's over here we can just do two integrations so back-to-back to get to our function y that works really well we're going to find out that works really well with acceleration velocity and position because the derivative of position is velocity and the second derivative position is acceleration so we can model a lot of those situations with something very practical very simple like we've had here let's see how it works and then we're going to do just a few examples again our feet wet and then next video I'm gonna crush some examples I'm gonna just have so many it's gonna be a really long video and watch it just for the the sake of man it's gonna help you not only learn this stuff but get a real real good feel for what's going on in differential equations as far as positions concerned so we'll do some cool examples in the next video right now though we have a second derivative equal to a function of X let's start by taking an integral like we we did in the last section and let's see what happens if we take and integrate both sides what we're gonna end up getting is a first derivative of Y with respect to x equals well some integral of that function of X so we've integrated both sides we have a first derivative equal to the integral if you integrate both sides we haven't done anything with this side yet well let's think about it what we would end up getting is some sort of an antiderivative with a plus C we talked about that last section that when we do an integral we have a plus C that's a family of curves here's the second part I was talking about I kind of just glossed over in the last video but well over the last few videos if you have a second order differential equation sure an integral is gonna work you're gonna do plus C but what if we have to take another integral so if we do this again take an integral both sides what starts happening is that we have this integral of G of X plus C that this is a integral of an antiderivative already but because we've been separate integrals by addition and subtraction we also have the integral of this constant that we just found so we have a second derivative we take an integral we get a first derivative equals some integral some antiderivative the antiderivative can have a plus C if we do another integral this plus C gets integrated which means that that plus C I'm going to leave this by the way as an integral of G of X because I don't have a more capital letter than capital T so this would be a stand for the antiderivative but if I integrate that plus C that we just got we are going to get AC with an X on it so we have that arbitrary constant but now we're tacking on an X and we're going to get another constant out of it so when we integrate twice we get two arbitrary constants and if you remember from one of the first videos every time you have a higher order of differential equation you're going to get another arbitrary constant for this reason so we have a second order you can expect two arbitrary constants what that means practically for us if this is the first one and this is the second one if you want a particular solution this is still a general fan of family of curves general solution is still family of curves but if you want a particular solution you can't do it with just one initial value anymore there's two arbitrary constants you'll need two pieces of information such as let's say that you you want to find out the position of something well you'll need an initial position you'll also need an initial velocity if you start with acceleration acceleration is a second derivative so if I start undoing a second derivative I'm gonna get first derivative velocity I'll need an initial velocity or find that plus C by undo that with an integral I get the original position function I'm going to need that initial velocity for the first derivative ever sorry for the first derivative but after the first integration but I'll need an initial position for the position function to satisfy the two arbitrary constants so let me let me recap this a little bit there's a lot of words in a short amount of time can we do the same idea the second derivative of course if we have a second derivative equal to some function of X and in differential equations start integrating every time you integrate though you're going to be 2 plus C so we have to integrate twice we end up getting two different plus C's Y you just integrate the first arbitrary constant again that gives you a CX and then you tack on a plus C to that what I was saying about the initial conditions here is that right here would be your first right that's yeah let's say right here right here would be your first different first first-order difference equation it has a plus C and it would require an initial condition to satisfy that to solve ax plus C when we do it again we'll need a different initial condition to soften that plus C so link two of them so we're gonna do right now is we're gonna look at look at some acceleration velocity and position functions so if X is a position with respect to time so our position is given as a function of of time well then our velocity is just a first derivative so if X is our position with respect to time then our velocity is simply the derivative of X with respect to time that that's what velocity as velocity as held position is changing oh my gosh that makes sense in differential equation velocity is how position X is position it's changing with respect to time how it's moving that that's basically it so we have this ya velocity is the first derivative the strength of time of our position or if you want to make it a little different velocity is the first derivative that that should make sense we've seen that before well if velocity is the way that position is changing acceleration is the way that velocity is changing so acceleration is the rate of change of velocity that means it's a derivative of velocity so acceleration is a derivative of velocity with respect to time position with respect to time let's call it a function of T this is given us our where our position is how our position is changing the rate of change of our position is called velocity that's kind of the first derivative the rate of change of velocity is called acceleration it's got to be the first derivative of velocity or a second derivative of position position is a function of time velocity is the first derivative acceleration is the second derivative it's kind of plain simple we've seen that before but now we're going to use it a little bit more than maybe you have in the past let's start with the start deceleration and let's see just just what happens so if acceleration is constant so we're going to assume that it is for this case if acceleration is constant the derivative of velocity with respect to time would be acceleration so the rate of change of velocity is acceleration let's go ahead let's do this part right here let's let's see how to give some some different functions by just doing some integrals if the derivative of velocity with respect to time the rate of change of velocity times is equal to acceleration and we integrate both sides with respect to time do do you see I hope that hope that you see do you see that if this is a constant right here that's a constant we can do exactly the same thing we did in last video that last lesson and we can separate that DT over if it's not a constant yeah baby question I give it a little water it's not a constant well then it's a function of T and you can still do it so a velocity if the derivative lost their strength time that's acceleration is a function of time you still do this it's just not as simple and we'll do some of those samples in just a minute I won't leave you hanging but if acceleration is a constant this is very easy we just move our our DT over we take an integral we get a velocity is acceleration times time do you see it that's a constant if that's a constant all you got to do is say oh that's like three three et would be already enrolled but we give this 1 plus C I'm gonna put C 1 because I know that dealing with second derivatives like acceleration we're gonna get to seas in order to solve this though so if we have the velocity I'm going to put a respect with velocity of time here if we have that in order to solve that see one we see someone we need an initial condition in other words we need the initial velocity to solve this this is what I was preface seeing when I was talking about this stuff so we have these these two arbitrary constants that we're gonna have in order to find out a particular solution you're gonna need two pieces of information so I'm gonna go through this one more time because it's crucial that you understand what's going on we have position the first derivative is velocity the second derivative the acceleration if we start with acceleration we can work backwards just like we did here here the second derivative treat this like acceleration we took an integral okay that's now velocity but that velocity has a plus C you need the initial velocity very good at plus C initial because we need to know what the velocity was at time zero Y times zero times zero so that it cancels out all the t's so that we can actually solve for C that's most of the time what we absolutely have to have so when we say this we need a an initial velocity we need the velocity at time zero most of the time we call this a V Sub Zero just treat that like initial velocity that would be the velocity at starting time so whenever you started looking at the situation that's how fast it was going so you know you launch a rocket off the top of a building and then it fizzled out the initial velocity is important to us what was how fast was it going we started setting up learn modeling the situation well if we have that notice what it takes notice what that is there is important it says the velocity at time zero is V sub 0 the velocity at time zero so whatever a is constant at time zero that's gonna go away plus c1 equals the initial velocity let's say like 20 feet per second or 50 or negative 33% you throwing it down towards earth that that's important for us to find that so when we're given a second derivative like acceleration is yes we can get to a first derivative with an integral but you're gonna need an arbitrary where you're going to need a piece of information to get rid of that arbitrary constant you're going to need an initial value which we have let's say that's initial value is the V of 0 equals V sub 0 the initial velocity well and just like before in last video c1 would equal the initial velocity this is interesting so our velocity our velocity is equal to just think logically about it it should make sense our velocity is equal to how fast you're starting plus how much accelerations of making it with respect to time how is it increasing speed or decreasing speed once it howls of doing that that that should make sense we can start somewhere and then you're adding subtracting velocity to that and so the acceleration is how that velocity is changing so we started with the second derivative acceleration we undid it with an integral now we have a first derivative of position if we just do one more integral so velocity is the first derivative of position if we just do one more integral position is the integral of velocity so velocity is the first derivative of position therefore if we integrate with velocity we are in a position back here for a second so let's do that so our position is going to equal the integral of whatever we just found is our velocity that's right here so notice what happens initial velocity is a constant so that's like a starting speed velocity that's a starting velocity so it's not going to be based on any variable T we assumed a was a constant but even if it wasn't you can still do this because it's going to be based on to you as well so our position function is we do have to integrate that T we do get a tack on T here and then we're gonna get another constant this is what I was talking about in order to get rid of your arbitrary constants you did an initial value for initial condition for each one of them so we need an initial velocity when we dealt with a velocity we're gonna need an initial position when we deal with position so we start integrating acceleration you get velocity to get rid of that arbitrary constant you're gonna need an issue velocity we didn't read that again we get position to get rid of that new arbitrary constant we're gonna need initial position so we're gonna have to have that somewhere by the same logic you're gonna know where you start so at time zero where are you how high are you above the ground weird how far are you from a starting point point or ending point so the position at time zero let's call it X sub zero let's plug that in and again by the way I mentioned before but it's really to have that zero here because that zero is going to zero out all of your times I forgot something I hope you see it look right now if you didn't if you know if you don't see it I miss something here is a big deal it's a real big deal because I screwed it up this looks good and one add one to that power one you get to get 1/2 I forgot the T I said it I just was talking too much I'm didn't do it that zero is important because it's going to zero out the Tim T's and allow you to solve for C sub two so the position at time zero is X sub zero all that's gone and we get that C sub two equals next sub zero if we put this back together now we have an initial position based on whatever acceleration we were given now what I'm really hoping is it this looks familiar to you I'm gonna do a short recap is to make sure we're on the same page and then I'll start talking about why that should look familiar so blessed last lesson we had this idea that if you have a first derivative and you have a function of X on one side or a function of an independent variable the independent variable on one side you can just integrate you can also do that with second derivatives you just have to integrate twice but when you do that you get one two arbitrary constants those two arbitrary constants require one two initial conditions to get both of them let's say solve or to find both of them so when we're dealing with acceleration velocity and position which is modeled really well by this we take an integral to get from acceleration to velocity we need initial velocity to get rid of a plus C we take another integral to go from full city to position the initial position to get rid of that second plus seen C sub two now the reason why I say that should look familiar is because you see this all the time in classes like an intermediate algebra where you teach you go to a hey you're looking at people below and you also water-balloon because it's that person I am how long is it going to take to hit the ground or stuff like that and you go well that looks like that looks like this why is it look like that well the real story would be you're standing on top of a 225 foot building what's your initial position oh my gosh your initial position is 225 feet above the ground plus 225 that's where that comes from you throw the water balloon down at 20 feet per second your initial velocity is thrown down at 23 per second what in the world is this from where's the negative 16 acceleration on this planet is negative 32 feet per second squared it's going stuff drops in negative 32 feet per second squared one half of that is negative 16 so where this comes from is actually differential equations so where you where we got all those really weird formulas and intermediate algebra with stuff like that so can you can you go straight from here plug it in here and get something usable yes if your acceleration is constant if your generation is not constant then you basically have to go through this whole process take the integral of acceleration it's gonna be based on T it's not gonna be a problem don't worry about it take any integral of acceleration it's a function find the initial velocity plug it in do it again find the position find the initial position the position function find initial position should plug it in you're done so it's not all that bad but if you have constant acceleration like we have right here this is acceleration is negative 20 could you go through the whole thing and just like we did yeah you could could you just plug in here yeah he could and of course I'm me I'm show you both ways so I want to show you that if your acceleration is constant this is really really usable for you if it's not we go through the same process so it's useful for you to see it both ways let's start with acceleration I'm gonna walk through all this one time for you to make sure you get our velocity velocity is equal to the integral of acceleration because of that the derivative of velocity with space times acceleration so if we want to find velocity itself we would integrate both sides and that's exactly what we're getting that from so we're just we're just thinking backwards if we integrate that well we have a specific acceleration don't we it's it's it's some function of time in this case of the constant function says you're just going to integrate negative 20 so acceleration is the first derivative of the velocity if we integrate acceleration therefore we get velocity when we do that integral we get negative 20 t-shirt but we get an arbitrary constant this is where the initial velocity has to come in you've got to know where you start so this is going to be given by V sub 0 alot if it's not given by V sub 0 it's going to be given by something like the velocity at time 0 is negative 15 this is saying the same exact things no different that always allows us to solve for c1 never see someone that that's really cool so the velocity at time 0 is negative 15 the time is 0 is when you start can you see that darn near every single time you were just going to get plus C equals initial velocity with this situation it's gonna happen every time so if we modify this I'm going to race everything but this is all I really need you to see it the very end then we get that our velocity function is negative 20 minus 15 but wait there's more we also know that the first derivative of position is velocity well what that means is that if we move our D team we take an integral all we have to do is integrate velocity and we're going to find our position function that's great let's do it so our position function is equal to the integral of velocity we know velocity the velocity is given by this negative 20 t minus 15 DT when we integrate that we're going to give let's see negative 20 T just add 1/2 that be negative 10 T squared minus 15 T we're integrating we're always adding a T to those those constants but we're gonna get another arbitrary constant this is where the initial position has to come in this is yeah you're going to know where you start to figure out what that plus C is but it's almost always 99% I'm just going to be that it's gonna be the number it's gonna be 5 so if X of 0 is 5 or X of 0 equals 5 it says our position is 5 5 feet high or if you're dealing with when your time is 0 that's 0 and that's 0 can you see that almost every time I hope you can see that almost every time that see one's gonna be fine if your T's gonna be gone you're just gonna get that initial position and if we rewrite this we get negative 10 T squared minus 15 T plus 5 now check this out could you just look here take this stuff put it there and get that the answers yes if if your acceleration is constant if it's not constant and you can't do that so if you have non constant acceleration you have to basically go through the whole process I'm gonna show you in just a minute I'll give you three examples we'll go through them go from kind of easier to harder none of them are very hard as long as you know how to integrate let's do but check it out if you plug in your acceleration of negative 20 half of negative 20 is negative 10 T squared velocity initial velocity of -15 okay - 15 initial position 500 plus y it's the same same thing if acceleration is constant I'm gonna race the board I'm going to come back with those three examples and walk through them and see how to do this from scratch if you don't have constant acceleration again if you don't have constant acceleration you can't just plug in play with this stuff we have to we typically have to integrate twice it's not hard you just need to make sure that for every arbitrary constant you're given or that you get you are also given an initial condition so you'll be initial velocity and you'll need an initial position all right so I've got three examples up here we're gonna walk through all three of them these are the wind accelerations not constant obviously we have some T's we're so is given to us so we're gonna have acceleration changing as far as time is concerned that's fine it doesn't make things all that harder it's just that you generally can't just plug this into that last equation I gave you but it gives are the same acceleration is the derivative of velocity or the second derivative of position so we're just gonna be taking two integrals the first integral is going to give us velocity plug in your initial velocity the second integral is going to give you a position plug in your in this missile position and there with these two pieces information you're able to get rid of those two arbitrary constants let's go through them let's give them a try that's about it so first thing we know that acceleration is the first derivative of velocity so if we want to find velocity we're gonna integrate acceleration so when we integrate 2 T plus 1 begin T squared plus T plus c1 this is where initial velocity comes in you got to make sure that you know that at time 0 we have negative 7 remember when I said that almost always this c1 is going to end up being initial velocity when you integrate one time so acceleration of velocity be looking out for that is going to be here now that we have this initially this this velocity function we know that velocity is the first derivative of position let's just integrate velocity and then get our position function so when we do that we get 1/3 T cubed minus 1/2 T squared minus 70 but then we have our second arbitrary constant again you're you're given an initial position you have to be able to find this c1 that initial position is on time 0 that means that every place you have a teen if you have a polynomial you're gonna get zeros so zero zero zero your c1 is going to be four so then your position is 4 when your time is zero so all that's left is C 1 C sub 1 so we get our position function by 1/3 T cubed plus 1/2 degree of n plus 1/2 T squared minus 17 in this case plus 4 remember we're doing these are differential equations this right now is a particular solution that satisfies both of these conditions that's what at 18 both conditions to find that particular solution now it's kind of cool let's do a couple more so next example we have our acceleration is is depending on one over the square root of t plus 4th where we're given acceleration let's find velocity by a first derivative since we can write that the square root of t plus boards on the denominator that's in its a 1/2 power on the denominator so this can be rewritten as t plus 4 to the negative 1/2 power why we're doing that we're going to a substitution here in just a minute U is going to equal T plus 4 I mentioned last time if you really need to do u equals T plus 4 that's fine and do D u equals DT that's that's cool but for stuff that doesn't have any constants coming out from that derivative or coefficients or anything like that you really don't absolutely need to just cover this up pretend that's you when we get you to the positive one path over 1/2 so if you think about that like ok that's you then because this D u equals DT it's a direct substitution we just cover up and think that we go ok this would be U to the one half T plus 4 and 1/2 over 1/2 that's going to give us 2 but we are going to get a plus C 1 well thankfully we're given an initial velocity we can plug that in right now don't wait don't wait till later don't integrate right now and get a C 1 T and plug both in that's you can do that but it's a lot easier just to go step by step so we know that at time 0 our initial velocity is negative 1 so our initial velocity here negative 1 when time is 0 now we're gonna run into a case where our seat 1 is not just our initial velocity anymore and that's that's fine it is if you have basic polynomials like we had before like I was talking about in the previous little examples that we did but then we started getting there some things like like this one where we go okay well this this doesn't zero out here we have a composition of functions when we started a lot of times in that it's not a basic polynomial your C one isn't going to do that matricide when it is you're good to go but then we start doing with some more advanced stuff and you gotta plug in your initial velocity to find your c sub 1 so 4 plus 0 is 4 square root of that is 2 2 times 2 gives us 4 so our C 1 is negative 5 let's rewrite that so we're gonna have 2 times T plus 4 the 1/2 minus 5 let's keep on going so we have that minus 5 in there all we got to do now we got we got our velocity function let's take another integral let's go from velocity to position just so now we have a minus 5 at the very end that's upon position is the integral velocity because velocity is the first derivative of position and if we do this correctly we should begin same idea you can do a you sub that's fine but if you just ignore that the derivative of this is one you're it's a direct substitution with D U and DT so we're gonna pretend that's you we would get you to the add one to that you three-halves we still have a two hanging on divided by our new exponent is three-halves minus 5t we're integrating that v plus our second arbitrary constant and we do a little bit of manipulation here those twos don't cancel they becomes four thirds now we get to look at our initial position that's all what's it what it's going to take to get rid of that second arbitrary constant it says that we're at time zero or at position one or one unit away from wherever we started so I'm going up here so one is what we get when our time is zero well let's think through this so this is for the square root of 4 is 2 to the third power is 8 8 times 4 is 32 or 3 that's nasty minus 0 plus C 2 so if we subtract that from both sides what negative 20 negative 29 over 3 this is 3rd 3 thirds minus 30 2/3 native 29 thirds if we put that all that together we have our position function now now remember what we're trying to do what differential equations does it gets back to the original function that when you take a derivative of it it gives you bilasa t and when you take a second derivative it gives you acceleration and it satisfies these two conditions that's what you're doing if you haven't done it already I would really encourage you to pause the video right now just try that one see if you can do it see if you can remember how to do integrals of signs and things like that it's not beyond you you can certainly do it be careful of that little substitution right there dividing by 5 but you can certainly do that I would strongly encourage you to pause right now make sure that you can do that and that stuff I unfortunately need to continue so hopefully you got this down let's work on that so we have acceleration again we're going to take two integrals here one to get back velocity the second one to get back position we just have to plug in our initial conditions as we go so we know maybe it kind of quick velocity is going to be the integral of acceleration if we do that we keep that 50 that's a constant the integral of sine is negative cosine so remember that the derivative of sine is cosine integral of sine is negative cosine so we're gonna get negative from that integral of sine being negative cosine we have a 50 will have a cosine of 5t but we would have au sub in here your little you then probably going right down it is 5t the derivative is d u equals 5 dt or d u over 5 equals DT you're going to be dividing by 5 and we need an arbitrary constant now let's simplify it just a little bit and we're ready for initial velocity which says that at time of 0 we have negative 10 cosine 0 just as there is 1 so this is negative 10 equals negative 10 plus c1 well therefore binghamton equals main temple c1 c1 0 it's nice so our velocity function changes to right here just note C 1 is 0 and less thing we now have our velocity that's great let's just do one more integral we get back to our position and then that will solve our differential equation and let us have a function that has this as an acceleration function and meets both of those initial conditions so position is integral of velocity we got that down let's just do one more integral the integral of cosine is sine so we're going to keep the negative 10 we're going to get a positive sign and then we're going to get that 5t but we'll be divided by the derivative again now we get another constant let's simplify it at this point I hope you know what I'm doing I'm not just trying to crush you with examples of I'm trying to give you different hey do you remember how to do these integrals problems so I'm sort of trying to review with you if for those of you needed as we're learning this material because frankly these are all three of the same exact half the problem you do integral like a number get again very good but remembering sine cosine some little substitutions things like that's important so we now have our position function but we need an initial position to get rid of that arbitrary constant we know that at x 0 we have x equals 8 well 5 times zero is zero sine of zero is zero 2 times zero or native 2 times zero is zero C 2 is 8 put this all back together we get a really nice position function where if you took the derivative of this it is going to be that if you take the derivative of this it is going to be that and if you plug in these numbers it satisfies both of these these equations so they'll all fly straight backwards these equations satisfy both those initial conditions that's what we're dealing with here just a small application of how we deal with some of these differential equations involving acceleration velocity and position again it's it's it's all about at this point can you get a derivative on one side first second third whatever and a function of X on the other if you have that start integrating it just so happens though that for every higher order of derivative you have you need another initial condition so for first-order you know one initial condition second order to third or extrapolating there I hope that's making sense to you next time what we're gonna do actually do a ton of examples about cars skidding and jumping on plans of different gravity and how this stuff plays out on some I don't know life examples so you get some word problems under a belt to make sure that we're understanding it so I'll see you for the next video you 

Transcript for: Problem Solving with Velocity and Acceleration (Differential Equations 8)
all right as promised we're gonna do a lot of examples right now they're just for practice you really already have a lot of the ideas down about differential equations and solving them with the most basic technique we have which is integration I get rid of plus C but now putting it in practice sometimes can be a little intimidating so I'm gonna do ten examples we're new ten word problems that come from a variety of textbooks or that I've kind of changed a little bit to fit our situation they're gonna go from the easiest to the hardest if you're if you're getting this don't be afraid to skip a couple going to the last ones those are the most difficult ones but if you stick through it and stick with me here I think they'll help you make a lot of sense out of this just the way that you approach of the way you think about them is important otherwise even though the math isn't all that hard it's stuck on the simple stuff but what is it even talking about so we're gonna go through about ten of them let's start right now so let's say you're you're sit on the ground and you decide for some reason just to shoot a slingshot right above you and then hopefully move because you're not idiot and you don't want to eat in the face with a slingshot because that hurts ask me how I know um so anyway you know that your slingshot shoots this ol projectile upward so positive at forty nine meters per second what's the maximum height you're going to get out of that assuming that you're on the ground well we need a little bit more information than that so we know what planet we're on now we're gonna certainly assume that we're on planet earth here so assuming that we know that acceleration is constant when we're talking about things flying acceleration is negative 9.8 meters per second or negative 32 feet per second squared and on each of those cases well then look at your problem or do you want the feet or meters since we're dealing with meters we're gonna take acceleration as a constant negative 9.8 meters per second squared also we're assuming that we're sitting on the ground so if we're on the ground so we kind of launched it maybe you're a little hole on your you launch it so it's leaving the slingshot at zero feet those are two really important these is information that we need to have to solve our problem here but it's stuff that you're inferring we're on planet Earth acceleration of gravity is negative 9.8 meters per second squared reason meter shouldn't start with meters and you're on the ground let's say that your height is zero let's start this from the last couple videos we know that acceleration is the second derivative of position we're going to start taking integrals so integral of acceleration in all these cases you're going to start with acceleration so keep that in mind every time accelerations first take an integral of that so if we integrate our constant acceleration we're going to get our velocity is 1/8 of 9.8 T plus c1 now we have an initial velocity we know that this projectile in our slingshot 49 meters per second that's something we can use at time zero we're going 49 so our velocity is 49 when our time is zero and that lets us solve for c1 just like before so we augment our equation with this that's negative 9.8 T plus 49 that's our velocity function now starts thinking ok well wait a second what's our what's our maximum height how in the world we're gonna find that do we need position to find that we do but think about what happens when you shoot stuff up in the air if you've ever done this if you shoot some of the air it's gonna have positive velocity and then it's going well it's going to have a positive position and it's going to reach a maximum height so you come back down have to use that word it's going to have a positive velocity and a negative velocity so it's going to come up it's going to come down at the top its velocity is zero so if we want to find the maximum height that's a height that's attained by this then we set this equal to zero it's gonna give us the time that we reached its max so so again if that made sense to you you shoot something up it's gonna have a positive velocity it's gonna stall out for the briefest of moments so you have a negative velocity at the very very top our velocity is zero so think critical points this is first derivative critical points that equals zero same sort of idea if we solve this ad 9.80 to both sides divide by 9.8 we get five so five seconds what that means to us is that our velocity is going to be zero after five seconds that's exactly what you get here's velocity here zero five seconds so we're going to reach the max the maximum distance away after five seconds now that's important information but we need a position function to plug that into to figure out what our max height is if we integrate this one more time we're going to have that position so our position function when we integrate this is going to be negative 4.19 squared so we add 1/2 X 1/2 plus 49 T plus c2 well in order to figure out our max height we need to figure out our initial position now we were still on the ground so we're assuming our height is 0 at time 0 so our C sub 2 is just gonna be it's gonna be 0 obviously we're still on the ground so our position function how far away we are with respect to our time here is negative 4 point 9 T squared plus 49 T plus 0 there's nothing there so here's our idea we start with the acceleration we inferred that we're dealing with the earth so we have negative 9.8 meters per second meters squared meters because we're given a unit of meters we do an integral we find velocity that's needs an initial velocity to figure out our C sub 1 which we have but then we think about how a maximum height is going to be obtained when our velocity is 0 when our velocity is 0 so that's five seconds away from when we shot it so shoot one two three four five ridge of the peak comes back down so when we integrate one more time we have our position we use our initial position to get our equation and now we can say oh hey our position our maximum diffs distance away happens after five seconds let's just plug in five so our position after five seconds we know that's the maximum distance away let's just click by them I've worked it out maybe you can work it on your own it's around 120 two point five meters so we sit on the ground we shoot a slingshot it has 49 meters per second as an initial velocity from a height of zero it's going to take five seconds to reach the peak here's our position function and we plug in those five seconds that's the peak that's how far away it is I hope that makes sense so let's keep on going to the next one we're gonna drop a brick obviously that's what you do when you're 400 feet up you just drop bricks off love you kind of fun to watch the women like you Center candies drop it watch I've done that with as a little kid see how long it takes to hit the ground well let's figure that out without having to drop the brick because you're probably not next to a canyon so if we are going to drop a brick from a height with 400 feet when is it going to hit the ground and what speed will it the ground at well we'll plan our way on probably on earth so let's pick acceleration to be constant and let's look at our units our units are given in two feet so I don't want to be using negative 9.8 I want to be using negative 32 because that's a feet and we're gonna be dealing with feet per second our initial velocity what we're dropping it so we're not throwing it we're not throwing it up let's assume that our initial velocity is zero these are all logical inferences we can make but are very important we also know that we're 400 feet up we're dropping the brake so our initial position is 400 this is basically how I try to start every single one of these problems I figure out what we know from the word problem that we're given so we know R on earth negative 9.8 if we're dealing with meters native 32 if we're dealing with the feet look for an initial velocity a lot of times it's given to you or if you're just dropping something you can assume that's zero so it's starting at zero from the moment you drop it at zero and then it's going to increase speed downward what speed is it going to hit well we're going to answer that later and then our initial is 400 feet up we can infer that from the problem let's get started let's do an integral of acceleration to give us our velocity so we know we're gonna get negative 32 T plus C we'll understand basic integration here but we do know in an interval asti we're dropping it's not starting with a throw or a downer up so we know that at time 0 we have a velocity of 0 hopefully you can see that your c1 is just going to be 0 at time equals 0 so that's gone we get 0 c1 is 0 so let's rewrite this our velocity function is just negative 32 T that's cool now that we have our velocity well that it's not really it is asking us for a speed when it hits the ground but we need to know a time that it's the ground for us to find our speed so it's sort of backwards of this problem here we need to find a position after a certain amount of time when the velocity was 0 when it reaches peak here we need to find the position first to figure out how long it's going to take to hit the ground there before we get backtrack and plug in the speed so it's a slightly different problem which is why we're doing it even though it seems similar let's find the position position is an integral of velocity so we're just going to integrate and but we do know our initial position at time of 0 we're at 400 feet so c2 is 400 we have a position function now let's answer the two questions so we start with 400 feet the initial position we dropped it velocity is 0 and we start it raishin work planet Earth native 32 feet per second squared because we are dealing with feet we did integral to get velocity we had miserable I say 0 c10 did another integral to get position we have c2 is 400 that's our initial position and now we think when is it going to hit the ground what's the T when our position is zero so if we start from 400 feet up the ground is at 0 so when when we get the ground it's going to be a height of 0 we need to solve 14 when our height is 0 so variety of ways you can do it you try to factor you can add 16 T squared divided by 16 take a square root that's what either to do so if we do that at 16 T squared to both sides divide by 16 then take a square root you don't need the negative we're dealing with time real-life time doesn't go backwards it would be kind of cool if you threw bricks moving back in time but that's that's not the case unfortunately the only time is the one dimension that you can't go backwards on it's called regrets no regrets so here we're going to divide by 16 take a square root we just get the square root of 400 over 16 if I did my math right that looks like it's is that also 5 probably 16 would be 25 okay so 5 just let you know not everything and cool happens after 5 seconds I know looks that way it doesn't so 5 seconds is what it's gonna take for this break to hit the ground so we're at 400 feet we just drop it we don't throw it we don't throw it we just drop it initial velocity is 0 it's going to hit the ground after 5 seconds so we answered question 1 when does it hit the ground 5 seconds after we drop it how fast is it going what's the speed having velocity function right there it's just negative 32 times whatever time you want so when it's hitting the ground it's at five seconds after we've dropped it so if we want to figure out the speed when it's hitting the ground it's the speed after five seconds exactly speed has the idea of being signless so even though the velocity would be negative whatever that's going to be looks like 160 so negative 160 feet per second a speed is the absolute value of velocity so the speed is 160 feet per second of course we know it's dropping so it'd be negative as far as velocity but positive for 160 so that's the idea with pretty much all of these try to find out the information that you can for from the problem don't make stuff up though okay find the information that you can infer use the appropriate units for acceleration do an integral see if you have an initial velocity see what question are asking are they asking for a maximum or when a maximum height that occurs or a maximum height you're gonna want to find out what the velocity is zero are they asking when it hits the ground you're going to want to find out when the position is zero and then typically we go one of two directions fill in a velocity first to find a position or find a position first to fill out a velocity I'm gonna put a few more up there we have like eight more problems to do so hang on that will be right back so our next two examples let's talk about a car cars going 100 kilometers an hour or 60 miles an hour that's this is the same thing there it breaks at a constant deceleration of ten meters per second squared how far is your car going to go one thing that's really important and where a lot of people just get mixed up or don't know why their numbers are coming out match your units that's a big deal for examples like this so if something's in kilometers per hour yet you have an acceleration of meters per second your going to want to find m/s m/s^2 year 1 5 m/s so km/h in munich ii don't really go together really really nice unless you convert one of them we typically convert the kilometres two hours to muse per second so let's convert this down to the acceleration units of meter that's million square meters per seconds can work great for us so 100 kilometers per hour remember you want units to cancel so put your hour as a cross a fraction numerator denominator cross a fraction 1 hour is the same thing as 60 minutes 1 minute the same as 60 seconds so if we get this at least will have kilometers per second well we also know that there's a thousand meters in a kilometer and if we do that we river kilometers we're gonna have meters as the unit on top seconds in the you on the bottom so basically multiply a hundred times a thousand divided by 60 squared and we're going to be it looks like I got twenty seven point eight meters per second so our car or whatever we're doing is going 100 kilometers per hour that's twenty seven point eight meters per second and then we slam on the brakes and we're going to assume that we have a constant deceleration of 9.8 meters per second squared a deceleration is negative acceleration so it's like falling to the earth or something we're not accelerating or decelerating so our acceleration is a constant negative ten me per second squared let's see if we can move with that elevate and our position what's our initial position well we're looking for how far do you go how far you go from what well call where you start breaking zero call that your initial position if we're only concerned with how far we're traveling from that point let's assume that when we start breaking word at some place in the ground we call zero we're going to measure from that spot so our initial position is just zero let's see what we can do start by taking an integral of acceleration we know that velocity is an integral of a lot of acceleration so in our case our velocity is negative 10 T plus c1 we also know that we have an initial velocity it's going to let us get rid of the arbitrary constant when our time is zero our velocity is twenty seven point eight meters per second that's going to be zero so c1 equals twenty seven point eight meters per second no problem let's let's put that back in there so for our velocity function is now negative ten T plus twenty seven point eight that's looking good so far now we're also looking for how far we go before we stop remember from like five minutes ago I said that a lot of times we when we want to find a maximum height what we do is we find out when the velocity is zero well if we want to find out how far we are traveling we're going to want to find out when our velocity is zero so we're gonna find that out first when's our velocity zero then find our position and then plug in that time to figure out how far we're going you see our position is never going to be zero again we started at zero we're going past it so it's not appropriate to solve for position first and set it equal to zero that does nothing you're gonna get at the time is zero that it isn't yeah okay we know we were zero we just went past that and started braking what we're concerned about is winds the velocity zero when have we stopped moving because if we find out when that it then we found our position function we can plug in that time and figure out how much distance has been traversed that's the idea so let's figure out when we hit a velocity of 0 so when velocity is zero that's up well that's when our velocity is zero looks like if we add 10 T divided by 10 we just get to about 2.8 seconds so again we knew our deceleration that's what that said constant deceleration we know that if we change this to meters per second it can work a lot better so we find our integral of acceleration gives us velocity but we're concerned with how far we're going before when we stop well we need to when we stop to find out how far we're going when we stop we stop when the velocity is zero that's after two point seven eight seconds now when we find our position function and we plug in to point seven eight seconds we'll find the distance that it takes us to stop of the vehicle I hope that's making sense sometimes you have to figure out something first in here to figure out the position that you want so let's go let's find our position now position is an integral of velocity so in our case we're gonna have this negative 5t squared plus 27 point BT plus c2 now we have an initial position we said that we're going long and we're gonna we're going to stop at this one point in the road so that's our time zero and that's our position zero and how far we go from there we're just measuring that distance how far how long it takes us to get there is a ton that we just found it says it's gonna take us to point seven eight seconds to go from hundred kilometers an hour or 27 20 meters per second to zero that's how how much time is going to pass but as far as our positions concern we know our initial position was zero so we can just make that zero you can think about it zero goes here zero goes here your c2 is going to be zero serve acceleration or deceleration it's negative take an integral use our initial velocity to figure out our arbitrary constant and then if we want to find out a maximum distance of travel that's usually done by setting your velocity equal to zero finding a time it takes you to stop and then plugging that time into the position that you find later so now we can plug in two point seven eight you plug it in here I did it you can check it on your own I get about thirty eight point six meters so we slam on a race we have constant deceleration and it's going to take us to point seven eight seconds of stop and as as that that two point seven eight seconds passes we're gonna have gone thirty eight point six meters so is this important information to know well of course of course it is it's important if you want to judge health how well you can stop how well your vehicle stops with it's a car truck or anything as a matter or a plane even so we'll want to know what our initial velocity is we'll want to know what our deceleration is we'll want to know all these things now we talked a little bit of at the beginning of this course about modeling and how there's a big trade-off between a perfect representation of a situation and ease of doing the math this is a very stripped down we don't have coefficients of friction in here we don't have wind resistance we're kind of stripping this way way way down but this is how we start okay the next one let's assume you got a paintball gun because I love paintball and so you're gonna kind of impress your friends don't do this because wind-resistant mess all this up but if you just be stood on 20 meter high building age go check this out guys and then you count say yeah once you're gonna it's gonna hit the top of the building up this far so after like how do you say time channel up and it's gonna go right by me and then get the crowd to be awesome it's so cool you're probably getting nailing right in the face it's gonna face before so let's assume that you do that though cuz you're a daredevil and you want to live on the edge building this 20 meter side and you shoot your paintball gun at 300 meters per second that's about right that's about 300 feet per second well our units match up that looks good so 20 meters hundred meter per second we're gonna find our maximum height think about right now your maximum height is going to be the height when your velocity is zero so we're gonna do the same kind of thing here we're gonna find out when our velocity is zero okay that's gonna give us the time when we achieve our are pink our maximum we're gonna plug that into the position when it's going to be at the top of the building once we find our position we'll set it equal to the height of the top of the building that's 20 solve for the time and when it hits the ground so we'll set this equal to zero and figure out the time when we get the ground so same idea like to figure out our Maxima here we're gonna have to find the velocity of when the velocity equals 0 first let's start with our acceleration if we're on planet earth our acceleration is we don't want to be using the feet that's that's not the idea here we're using meters so negative 9.8 our initial velocity we have 1 we're shooting this upward so we're up here on this little edge we're going and you're gonna be right here you're gonna go whoa move your head out of the way it's gonna hit the ground and go spike at least that's what you want so our initial velocity is 100 positive 100 because you're shooting this up meters per second our initial position you're at the top of the building so you're 20 meters up positive that's what we really need let's go ahead and let's do an integral of acceleration to give yourself some velocity now that we have that initial velocity we know that we are initial velocity is 100 meters per second so let's plug that in if we are going 100 meters per second at a time of zero our c1 is our initial velocity I told you that with polynomials with constants it's really easy because your seat one is 99% of times it's time it's going to be your initial velocity and your set your c2 is going to be your initial position so our velocity function here is negative 9.8 T plus 100 now we want to find out what the map height is maximum height occurs when our velocity is zero stop the stalls out falls back down so we want to know that so when our velocity is zero is the time it takes for us to achieve our maximum well that's gonna be let's see add 9.80 divide 100 by 9.8 looks like we get about ten point two seconds so we know it's going to take ten point two seconds for us to shoot this little paint ball up and it achieved its max its peak value that's going to be important when they find out our position so let's keep on going our position function ball it's just an integral of whatever little philosophy you just found so we're gonna have negative nine point eighty we add one to the X 1/2 is negative four point ninety squared plus 100 T plus c2 now I just mentioned this but that was a polynomial and when you're dealing with polynomials you're integrating you're just kind of manipulating the coefficients and the variant of the x one of your variables so when you plug in zero they're all going to disappear that means your C two is going to be your initial position our C two is going to be three now that gives us something that we can work with so there's three questions that we're gonna answer right now the first question is well what's the max what's our peak message since we were smart about it we knew that the maximum height is achieved when you change from a positive velocity to a negative velocity that's when a velocity is zero think critical point think first derivative since we're dealing with that happens at when two seconds so if we want to find out what our maximum height is what work a maximum position away is going to be it happens after ten point two seconds just plug in ten point two so max plugin ten point two I'm going to assume that you can do that take this number plug it in here and you should get looks like I got five hundred thirty point two meters now the next questions are win questions when is it going to hit the top of the vert wall pass the top of the building and when is it going to hit the ground those are position ideas but solving for time so when is it going to reach the top of the building again that's a when is the position going to be 20 when is it going to equal to height the building so let's call this number two and three for number two all we really want to know is when what's the time when our position is 20 if you see this man you're asking here's my position function though the time it takes to be at positions we want a position of 20 meters she'll subtract the 20 from both sides you can factor out your T so I'm going to let you do that you should be able to do that your own at least at this level subtract 20 from both sides factor out T you'll have time is 0 obviously when you start you're inside the building or time is factored like this set both was equal to 0 so x of 0 VI advisability or just take 100 divided by 4.9 and you're going to get the time that it takes to reach the top of that building I got that it's twenty point four one six now when does it hit the ground things hit the ground when their height is zero so here's our height or height our position and here's the time it takes to get to that position for number three we want our height to be zero use the quadratic formula use difference completing the squares I don't think any factor can it's not easy I think you have to have a quadratic formula so when I did that I got twenty point six one seconds so just point two seconds after you have stability so we're setting up with the knowledge that we can infer from the problems we're making sure our units match up that's important so so translate if you have to do conversions make sure you use an appropriate acceleration of gravity if you're dealing with that so you're given meters use negative f-18 give it two feet use feet per second then what we're doing is figuring out if we want to find a max height maximum how far we travel typically it's set the velocity equal to zero solve for time plug it in later if it's a when when we hit the ground when we reach a certain spot how far we go like braking braking why's that that's deal with position and that's using the law at the time or when your velocity equals zero in that in that position function or say in a position function equal to some value again we have a few more examples all right there's no - so your stay on the top of a building and you want to show all your friend just how movie where day you are she's gonna watermelon that's what WM is you're gonna toss some water that's right throw this thing so you stand up there throw up the watermelon at ten meters per second and it's gonna go up to come down it's gonna splat mmm waste a good watermelon but it probably would be pretty cool to see so you throw a watermelon up on the top of this building at ten meters per second it's gonna hit the ground at sixty meters per second the question is how tall is the building let's start with what we know so thing right now if you haven't done this think right now think about what you know can you put up an initial position can you put up an initial velocity can you put up acceleration can you do the right units let's start with the acceleration right now in your mind you should be thinking I'm doing with negative 9.8 because we're on earth Seward Lee that's one place we know there are buildings and this thing is going to be dropping so negative 9.8 meters per second so we're maximum units as meters per second squared or our meters per second initial velocity it's given to us we know that we're throwing this up now positive negative is important if we had taken this watermelon thrower down we'd have negative 60 meters per second certainly sorry negative 10 meters per second now we're we know that were throwing this up at negative a positive 10 meters per second initial position do you have that do you have an initial position well I hope I mean if we did our problem would be the answer because if we had an initial position we would know how tall the building is we don't know that so we're literally looking for our initial position something we don't know well dealing with what we we do know let's start with plugging all this stuff in oh you know what I think it did this wrong I think I told you just right now that we're throwing the watermelon up I did I put a negative on here on my note so let's assume we're throwing it so had we been throwing this thing up into the air I've misread my own bones my problem here if we thrown this up into the air we would have positive ten meters per second that's away from the ground so if our ground is our zero level that would be away from that so positive now it's we're not doing that we're taking it and we're throwing it to how many throws of watermelons that'd be any way I can do they just throw it down so we're gonna throw this down at ten meters per second so that's negative 10 meters per second let's start with this let's start with our acceleration let's see if we can use your initial velocity come over the velocity equation here well we know that our initial velocity is negative 10 can hopefully you can see that our RC one's gonna be negative 10 at a time of zero we have negative 10 so our velocity function is negative 9.8 t minus 10 now here's an interesting thought we don't we can't really care about the maximum height here how far it's out what we care about is how tall the building is well if we have how tall the building is and we're throwing something down from the top of it we know the time we can find the time it takes to go from where you threw it to where you hit the ground furthermore we know that we can think around 60 meters shame that's a velocity so if we hit the ground at 60 meters per second we can find the time it takes to hit sorry to achieve that speed or that velocity if we can find that the time it takes to achieve that velocity that velocity is is when we hit the ground and that time would be the exact same amount of time it takes first or third watermelon down there so we start with our acceleration we do an integral to find velocity we use our initial sure but this time of when we hit 60 meters per second it's precisely the time it takes for that watermelon to hit the ground so let's set this equal to 60 the velocity when we hit the ground and software time the time it takes to achieve that velocity when we hit the ground so since our velocity is downward you need to make sure that this 60 meters per second one is same the ground is not positive in something else you know it's the velocity is is making our position go downward it's a negative velocity so negative 60 equals negative nine point eighteen minus ten let's go ahead let's add ten divided by negative nine point eight five point one five point one seconds so here's what that means what that means is it is going to take five point one seconds for our watermelon to reach a velocity of negative 60 meters per second now we know that when it reaches the velocity of negative 60 meter second it's hitting the ground so that's the time it takes to hit the ground let's go ahead and find the position function and then backtrack if we know it takes five point one seconds in the ground we should be able to use that to figure out our our building or the height of our building so integral lower velocity yet we don't know we don't know an initial velocity what we know is that it takes five point one seconds to hit the ground so if it takes five point one seconds for us at the ground let's plug in a five point one for our time and it's put hitting the ground or a position of zero for our position so zero is achieved the zero position is achieved when we have five point one seconds so time that is as going on that will let us off that's in two so we know that a position of five point one seconds is zero that's what we know let's use that so zero so after five point one seconds point if we square five point one x negative forty four point nine multiply five point one times ten subtracted C sub two is going to equal one hundred seventy eight point four meters so do you want to look back at your position function C sub two is one hundred seventy eight point four but we know that's initial position so if you just want to find out time of zero okay sure plug in time of zero here you get to get C - C sub two is one or so maybe point four meters that's how tall this building is so you sit on top of this building up down to watermelon negative 10 meters per second it's been at the ground at sixty meters per second we use that fact to find a time when it achieves 60 meters per second downward we went backwards from position plugged in of the fact that's hitting the ground that's zero at five point one seconds that's time and that let us solve for C sub 2 which is our initial position that's kind of cool so we know how tall that building is now okay next one let's suppose you're in the truck and you're traveling 60 miles an hour so that's I'm gonna do the conversion for you right now that's 88 feet per second so we're going 88 feet per second and you start to slide under constant deceleration so you press on the brakes you're on some sort of service that may be the slippery or you just loose traction you start to the skin let's assume that we're constantly constant deceleration and you skate a total of 176 feet you could modify this problem and say okay you applied to brakes and a 2q 176 under 76 feet to actually stop that's fine there's lots of different ways to think about this how much time did it take for you to stop and what is the deceleration this is a weird problem this is where things start to get a little bit trickier because you're not given that acceleration or deceleration you're given that it's constant what you don't know what that is we're gonna try and solve for that so the first thing we're going to start with is how much we know so like what what do we know here well we know that acceleration is constant let's call it C sub one the next thing we know let's assume that our initial position is zero we just we start at zero because we're trying to figure out from that point we slid 176 feet let's just assume that we start at zero now the next thing well we don't we don't actually have a oh we did we do have an if it wasn't our initial velocity is 88 feet per second from that point so we're treating that as positive we're going away from our zero spot we're not going towards it we're going away from it so that's that's gonna be positive think about sliding upward if you will so our initial velocity is 88 feet per second so we thought about we go okay we have constant deceleration we don't know what that is it's part of a question we know that we slid 176 feet from somewhere so that was a total distance assume that we start at zero that's when we applied our brakes and we know that will right when we apply our brakes we're going 88 feet per second hope this is all making sense to you right now now let's slow down a bit and let's work from this cuz this really gets a lot of people so the constant I gonna find that well we're gonna have to make it to the very end before we find that so you're gonna have a c1 loading on pretty much the whole problem let's just start taking integrals so we know that our velocity is going to be the integral of our acceleration whatever that is in this case the constant is just C sub one so whatever that constant is we add a T to it and then we would get another constant Foxy's of - all right well we do have an intro velocity don't we so initial velocity is 88 feet per second that occurs at time zero so when we first start a situation we're going 88 feet per second at time 0 88 so 80 per second at time zero that actually lets us solve for our second arbitrary constant that's kind of cool so even though we don't know c1 we can still use our knowledge to figure out the initial velocity or at least put that into our problem so our velocity right now this C sub 1 T plus bu so good ok now one thing I'm going to show you show you what to do here is is this we're going to want to figure out the time it takes for bus to stop so in all the problems that we have done so far where it says how far have you skinned well we found out the time when we hit a velocity of zero now this is a how far you have skid problem or still going to want to find the time when our velocity is zero so this is going to look a little weird to you but we have a velocity function we're gonna want to find out how much time it took for us to skip okay that translates to you speed 176 feet how to find out how much time it took you to do that but when you end there your velocity should be zero you should have stopped at the end of your skin you stopped there so we want to find the time when our velocity is zero same idea in Reverse before we said okay what's the time it took you to date of loss is zero this much time and now go backwards a little later and use that in your position function now we're kind of a little different this is saying you slid 176 feet great alright that's a position idea how much time does it take you to get there well that's gonna happen when your velocity it's zero still so when the velocity is zero let's solve for the time so time is our win if we subtract 88 and divided by C sub 1 whenever we find C sub 1 we're gonna be able to find out the time that we skid for or decelerate for or came to a stop in so we're gonna find that later but this is important we they understand that the time it's gonna take us for for us to accomplish this slide is 88 divided by whatever that see what happens to B now let's continue so we're gonna take our velocity we're gonna find our position just like we did before we said the how what's the the maximum peak here well we found the time it took velocity wise and we plug that in that's the same thing we're going to do we're going to find our position function we found the time it takes for us to slide this we're going to plug that in it's gonna be a little strange but this is the idea behind it is that we're finding the time it takes to do something plug it into the position but now this time we actually have the position so we will work backwards so let's do one more integral if we start integrating our velocity we'll find our position and we know that our position function this would be well C sub 1 over 2 T squared take 1 at 1/2 then we've already used up a c2 even though we found it you really shouldn't put c2 again you see 3 we're in position I'm gonna pause right here because it's at this point students sometimes they go whoa what are you doing let's just go a little bit slowly let's think through this here's what's going on you're in the vehicle it doesn't matter what it is you you're going 88 feet per second or 60 miles an hour you hit the brake you slide or you stop in 176 feet so we know that the end of 176 feet our velocity is zero and you're assuming your acceleration is constant deceleration is constant we start there we know that our position we're gonna think of that as 0 because 176 feet from that spot to stop cool then our position initially is 0 we're also traveling 88 feet per second in a direction away from that so that's a positive velocity if we start taking an integral yeah we don't know what c1 is but we do know that at the end of our of our slide our velocity should be zero so it doesn't matter what this is our velocity is zero at the end of it that's going to be this time so this equals C sub 1 T plus 88 if we solve for T I don't know C 1 but when I find it out I'm gonna be able to plug it in and figure out how long it took me to slide or to complete that skid so we keep on going they just don't know C one yet yes but we do know that when we take an integral of velocity and we get our position we have a C 1 in there we also have an initial position that lets us solve for C sub 3 our last constant so we know that if I plug in 0 for T this is gone notice this is I don't care what C 1 is this is gone that's 0 this is gone that's gone we get C sub 3 equals 0 C 3 is 0 that's c3p0 c-3po c-3po I just have to throw it in there that's going to be 0 plus a 0 this is our position function based on whatever our acceleration is now here's the magic part about it sure we didn't know acceleration we did know initial position we did know initial velocity we're able to use that to find C sub 2 that was our initial velocity and C sub 3 that's our initial position but we do know one more thing we knew that the time it takes us for for us to complete the skin the time for us to take that then it takes to get from a velocity of 88 to velocity of 0 so when our velocity is 0 is 88 over C sub 1 but we have one more piece of information when that happens we will have slid 176 feet our position will be 176 when our team is 88 over C 1 we can use that to solve for C 1 so X of 88 over C 1 is 176 feet after this time we'll have gone that far it's gonna look bad oh man she goes for my real students he would stop we were 20 minutes ago when I did this did you notice like the small mistake I made there's a while back it didn't it didn't affect any of this stuff but it will mount I expected and I did not show that so that movie negative negative negative I hope you can attention to those little things that when I do this this math I make mistakes I don't ever really edit them out so every mistake I make you guys see but that's why I'm constantly checking so I'm always going back and always sign what's my cell what's my sign here and I noticed it looked a little funny and then I remembered that I subtracted but I did it in my head too fast and you will do that too it happen happens to me too can happen to you too you do the math to faster off by sign it's typically what happens when you're doing your head so I subtracted 88 divided by sequent one I should see someone that should be negative I have negative here none of this should have changed that didn't change but when I plug it in I have a negative and a negative so again you get us back on track here I know that it takes us that much time to stop this is how far we've gone when we stopped let's just plug in how how much time this progress or a trip that's taking place well if we Square C sub 1 and we have C sub 1 here then what this works out to be I'll have to erase this stuff will have 176 equals C sub 1 or 2 times negative 88 squared oh man well I don't have that down what I have down is if I take 88 I square it and I divide by 2 we get 3872 so I'm squaring negative 88 through a big number / - it's going to be 3072 over c1 squared this is going to get rid of that so you can have C sub 1 on the bottom - I guess I've been evading squared it's 77 44 I wish you said 1 so 77 44 divided by 2 should be that number let's take this this multiplied together is minus 77 44 and you have a common denominator now C sub 1 that's pretty cool so 176 equals make one fraction negative 388 72 over C sub 1 with fractions like this we can just invert these two things and we did negative 22 we have just answered the second question so we are decelerating at negative 22 negative 22 feet per second squared that's pretty cool if we plug it into this we get how long it takes the skin so after all this is said and done you've had a way to the very very very end before you think about C 1 C sub 1 was our deceleration we're decelerating at negative 22 feet per second squared we plug this into their time it took us 4 seconds to slide I hope this is making sense I have a few more problems I'll come back in just a second hope you're ready for another two examples so let's let's go on this one we're on certain planet and we're gonna use this for both of these these examples here and we drop a rock because that's obviously what you do on strange planets you just drop rocks and so we're dropping a rock from 20 feet and we know that it takes two seconds to hit the how long we've taken 200 feet and what speed wouldn't be going when he hits the ground so let's start with what we know now we're a different planet so we can't assume that gravity is negative 32 feet per second squared but we hopefully can sue it's constant now we also know that we're dropping the rock not throwing the rock or not to run it up or down so our initial velocity is also zero hopefully you're catching this this is important to get down finally we have two other pieces of information information not only are we dropping the rock from 20 feet so our initial position is 20 feet for our setup here it also takes 2 seconds to hit the ground so it takes 2 seconds to have a position of 0 those are two pieces of information so constantly sure Foss Israel obviously initial position is 20 feet but we also know that after 2 seconds so our position after 2 seconds is 0 when we drop the rock for 20 feet that's a big deal let's see where we can go from there we're going to start with acceleration like always we're going to integrate to get velocity we'll see if we can use our initial velocity to get rid of arbitrary constant we'll integrate again for position and we'll see what happens with this whole setup we're still gonna have a cease of one in there are ideas here in C sub 1 so our velocity is going to be the integral of our acceleration velocity therefore just going to be C sub 1 T plus C sub 2 we get e actually yeah C sub 2 that's fine now we know our initial velocity is 0 so when time is 0 we have a velocity of 0 you should be able to see the C sub 2 is 0 right now so our velocity function is simply C sub 1 T that's pretty easy now let's find our position a position function is always an integral of velocity so that's going to give us 1/2 C sub 1 T squared plus C sub real already used up C sub 2 it can use that again so add 1 to the exponent divided and then add your other constant so our position function C 1 over 2 T squared plus C 3 but we have an initial position we know that we start from 20 so we can go ahead and find our C sub 3 here so at time of 0 that 0 is this whole thing out we have 20 feet well we need that now comes the last piece and the piece that lets us solve for our C so once or our acceleration we know that it takes 2 seconds for us to drop to 20 feet where we start to a height of 0 so 2 seconds and gives us a height of 0 that's big so we know that X is 0 when T is 2 from a height of 20 feet so all this is now working together well if we just do a little bit of math on this we know that 0 would equal that's 4 divided by 2 is 2 2 C 1 plus 20 subtract the 20 divided by 2 C 1 equals negative 10 let's plug that back into our position function so now that we plug it back in here right where we start a red right where we just left off we'd have negative 10 over 2 that's negative 5t squared plus 1 this would be the position function if we started from a height of 20 feet now what we're concerned about is how long would it take for us to hit the ground if we start from a height of 200 feet this isn't change our acceleration is constant that's what that says sorry celebration is negative 10 feet per second squared on this planet so when we get there it's like this this particular planet our acceleration our acceleration here the effective gravity is negative 10 feet per second squared we're going to use that over there so keep that in mind our position function is of course half that T squared plus 20 now we want to find 200 feet well it's going to change isn't that gonna change no we're dropping the rock is a velocity gonna change no which is the position so from 200 feet the only thing that changes here is that we tack is 0-1 because now we're dropping the rock from 200 feet so let's go ahead and find out when we would hit the ground hitting the ground is a height of 0 that's after T seconds so zero would equal negative 5t squared plus 200 iPad 5 T squared divided by 5 you're going to get the square root of 40 or 2 root n again we don't take negatives you know go back in time view on strange minutes so we have to root 10 seconds that's how long it's going to take for us to drop this rock from 200 feet and hit the ground how fast it's going what its speed is well we're gonna need a velocity function for that fortunately we have one it's sorry back up here so velocity is C sub 1 times how much time you're taking well we know C sub 1 is negative 10 so if we just plug that back in velocity is negative 10 T we got C sub 1 that's negative 10 T if we plug in our time velocity of 2 root 10 seconds that's about looks like 63 to 40% of its life so we did no acceleration we knew it was constant but we're still don't look it down here the key I'm doing these things is find out where you can use all of your information and if you don't know acceleration you're always looking to figure out where that that's coming from typically you have to make it all the way down to a position function so that thing hangs on all through velocity all through position figure out your arbitrary constants with initial velocities and the initial positions if you can but then all the way down here when we finally get to use our position function when we know something else about it you know to two seconds to hit the ground well that that's a solve for C sub one then we can backtrack then we can say okay I now know C sub 1 let's plug it into my position now I can use it to figure out how long it's going to take for me to hit the ground from a different height 200 feet okay it's gonna take square root of 40 or 2 root 10 seconds then I can save a backtrack even further our velocity is a I know my C sub 1 our velocity is negative 10 T whatever that is we now know that that's 2 to 10 seconds it's going to be 2 10 seconds for us to drop from 200 feet to 0 and we're gonna be doing 60 3.25 feet per second when we hit the ground on this particular planet I hope that makes sense there's a lot going on here but I'm hoping that's becoming easier I'm hoping you're understanding okay this isn't such a big deal I can wait till later and then figure out you some information that I'm given somewhere to figure out what that cut that constant acceleration is and then we're good to go so let's assume that you can throw a rock 144 feet upwards on earth that's a long way how high could you throw it on this planet this obviously has less gravity because our gravity is negative 32 feet per second squared this is negative 10 feet per second squared that's what that C one was remember where it came from that's our acceleration here so let's write that down I know that our acceleration is negative 10 feet per second squared as far as our plan concerns Ricky that the back of our down one but the similar level but what we really need to know is on our planet what's your initial velocity that's the only thing we really need to know because well we know how high it goes on our planet that we're gonna backtrack the initial velocity we know our acceleration on our planet we know the acceleration on other planet we so we know acceleration of Earth we know acceleration of gravity on the other planet what we don't know is the initial velocity you see if you throw a rock on earth or you throw a rocket but I say let's assume as hard you can so as hard as you can here or as hard as you can on the planet you should have the same initial velocity but the way that acceleration is going to affect it it's different so you're still in stand on the ground you're still throwing the rock so here's what we're going to do the idea behind this problem is use what you know about earth to figure out an initial velocity take that initial velocity modify once you know about this planet so this planet this is acceleration on its planet you don't have to figure that out again you are going to have a initial starting point of zero not twenty so you get the ground but you're also going to have an initial velocity so all we need to do is augment this with initial velocity and lack of any other height and we're gonna be fine let's figure out this initial velocity that you can throw your rock that starts with on earth so on earth your acceleration is negative 32 feet per second squared I hope that at this point you're really okay with why we're using feet per second we're dealing with the situation our initial velocity that's what they're looking for our initial position you're assuming you're on the ground so we're gonna assume your height is is negative EE just throwing up there we're so you're on the ground level there so let's start with our integrals we know that velocity is an integral of acceleration the initial velocity laughs man we just we don't know but we do know something we know that at the maximum height of 144 feet what's our velocity v bosse to be zero so maybe we write this down at the maximum height at 144 feet velocity equals zero when's that happen and 144 feet our velocity is going to equal zero our velocity is going to equal zero so when we get down to it our C sub one is negative 32 T that's cool so we're going to be able to use that a little bit later so we know that our velocity is negative 32 T plus c1 at 144 feet we've reached our max our velocity will be zero at that that height that we can use to say hey C sub 1 is the name 32 feet now we can't it is positive 32 T we can't really plug that in here it's going to give us zero yeah it is because that's that's our starting philosophy that that's that's what that says like if you plug that in right now you'd have your starting velocity of zero so let's go on let's do our position so take an integral of velocity we always get our position from that and this is going to be negative 16t squared that started looking pretty familiar plus C 1 T plus C 2 another arbitrary constant but this one we do know we do know our initial starting spot we're on the we're throwing this up so we're assuming that our height is zero here so if T equals zero we get a height of zero zero zero zero C sub two is going to be zero here's what else we know this is where this comes in at 144 feet with a velocity of zero we have C sub 1 equals 32 T so if we put our position on height of 144 we can substitute C sub 1 equals 32 teen let's do that now so height of 144 feet when does that occur so how long does it take for that to happen C sub 1 is 32 T what do you do it different I wonder if you could solve that for T and find C sub want that you could I'll do it different way in just a minute so this is all going to give you a 16 T squared and we do that that's got to be three so you can backtrack now so you know that you achieve your maximum height of 144 feet in 3 seconds since you had this solved for C sub 1 that's 32 times T plug your 3 in you know that C sub 1 is 90 solicit 96 96 feet per second C sub 1 is 96 feet per second so C sub 1 remember 1 C supplement C sub 1 is also your initial velocity so we know right now that on this situation if you were gonna throw a rock 144 feet in the air from starting spot at 0 you had an initial velocity of 96 feet per second that's pretty cool it's gonna take you 3 seconds for you to throw the rock 1 2 3 reaches 144 the velocity is now 0 you had to have launched it at 96 feet per second does that make sense to you I hope that makes sense to you so we're using our knowledge of Earth's gravity we know that we don't have an initial velocity that's literally the only thing we're looking for we have an initial position we take our integral we know that at 144 feet our velocity is 0 well you can solve for C sub 1 cool we did so we have C sub 1 is 32 T we wait we wait for a position like just like before we know that our position of 144 feet allows us to substitute in season 1 equals 32 T then we're able to solve for 83 seconds takes 3 seconds for us to region 144 feet and our initial velocity in 1916 per second I mentioned also that you probably could use it 'we think you can so if we solve for T so add 32 T on one side and then divide by 32 right down here from this spot you should be able to plug in C sub 1 over 32 and C sub 1 over 32 as your teeth and so what that would give us here's C sub 1 squared here C sub 1 squared here's 32 times 32 and here's 32 so let's see okay we'll do it that way all right see if you get 96 I'm guessing you probably do in fact you probably believe in right now say once 96 divided by 32 so that would be 3 times 6 that's two yay yep so this would be if you plug in 96 here just to check to make sure it works if you plug in 96 here here here you get negative 144 plus 288 that's 144 so it does work and if you if you proceed to do it from here you'll get C sub 1 equals 96 so either way I've done it this way and then in the past it's just the numbers working they're harder to deal with so I showed you two ways here take one of them doesn't matter which one you do you're going to get either T equals 3 first and then backtrack 96 or using this method with solving for T this will give you C sub 1 equals 96 either way you've just found your initial velocity you're throwing that rock up there at 96 feet per second now let's go on to the different planner so knowing that we have 96 feet per seconds all we really need our initial velocity is 96 feet per second just notice what we ended with over here we know that the position function for this new planet whatever it is it's just negative 5t squared plus whatever your initial velocity is t plus whatever your position is x sub 0 but we know that we know that if you're throwing something up on the ground this is zero and we just found that so our position function we just augment this we know that the acceleration is based on negative 10 feet per second squared so we plug it into a positions negative 5 cut in half plus 96 T now that we know our initial velocity that's that's pretty neat so we move on and we see how high could you throw that on that planet well what's your velocity once your velocity on that planet come back over here our velocity is right here so our velocity is just C sub 1 T well I guess it's it's not we have to augment that don't wait plus your 96 feet per second so you could do that you can also be smart about it and say let her do velocity is always the first derivative of position take negative 10 T plus 96 oh my gosh it actually works when will you hit a maximum height you hit it when your velocity is zero so if we set our velocity equal to zero we're gonna figure out when we achieve that maximum height velocity 0 equals negative 10 plus 96 add 10 T divided by 10 to get nine point six seconds so we are going to hit our maximum height after nine point six seconds here look at meters earth was three seconds three seconds we didn't mention light that's why I did it that way first so you see the time difference why the difference gravity is much less here so on earth you go one two three you've just if the people here you throw the same exact hardness whatever you get nine point six seconds that's his peak this is gonna be much higher so yeah we had initial velocity we came back over here we said this is what our this order acceleration is let's see where I lost it this is where acceleration is this is what our position is from a height of 20 feet let's let's make a difference let's make it from zero feet okay well there's there's no initial position that it's going it's the height of zero we also have an initial velocity of 96 look we can come back here and say hey initial velocity is 96 not zero anymore that changes our initial position that changes our velocity functions but now we say how high does something go well it's going to reach a height when its velocity is zero that's nine point six seconds plug this back into your position and we get about 460 million now I'm really hoping this is making sense I'm hoping that you understand that once you have acceleration you're good to go you just do some intervals once you have initial velocity you're even better so you can solve a lot of these things by just understanding how the formulas work and if you need to change initial velocity v just added that's okay or just add it with a team here for your position so try it I would try these again make sure you're going through these a couple of times I think that's about it yeah I think that's about all we do I said ten we went through nine the rest of them are very very similar I don't wanna really waste your time I was going through him go man these are these are really really the same so the main idea is for all of these these examples are start with your acceleration and take an integral that's going to give you velocity plus a constant use your initial velocity to change that arbitrary constant take another integral position use your initial position to modify that position function if you can do that that's a straight board example if you have an acceleration that you don't know you are going to have to find the position function typically to solve that if you want to find the maximum height find out when the velocity is zero however long that takes is however long it takes to preview to achieve that maximum height we use that a lot once you find an initial velocity or if you need to find the initial velocity somewhere so like like this you can go ahead and modify the the formulas that you have from other other situations to make that work for you so that's about it we've done a ton of examples I'm tired you're probably tired of watching me do this stuff but I hope they were useful for you I know we over an hour doing this and that's a lot of examples but because these can take them in different shapes and forms I wanted to give you that the abundance of just hardcore math worked out so I hope it helped it did please let me know that that was that was helpful I appreciate it you guys have a have a good day and hopefully your stay is going well and I'm gonna come back with slope fields in the wall you 

Transcript for: Introduction to Slope Fields (Differential Equations 9)
hey we're almost done exploring what differential equations are and what the solutions look like we're almost done with that and we're gonna get moving on in the next few videos here like after three or four videos from now on the process of solving differential equations like what techniques we have and then we're gonna explore how to use those in applications and then some ideas of some different ways to solve them but for right now one idea that I want to share with you is is this idea of slope fields what if so field is why we might have some fields and this kind of breaking the pattern in our heads that we have to have an exact solution all the time in real life because that's not true so a lot of differential equations use approximations because there aren't any good techniques to solve some of these things we're going to come up against that's one of the ideas of slope field so in this video what I want to get at is what a slope field is how a slope field can help us identify a solution even if we can't explicitly define it and that's important so here's a slope field we'll go through a problem a solution ID in the process of how we're gonna go about it so here's the problem lots of times differential equations can be solved if they have this dependent variable Y in them you look at it over there's nothing we have it's not separable we'll talk about separable it's not linear talk about linear it's not exact it's not a substitution we can make it's not homogeneous well I don't understand those things so you're not supposed to right now but we're gonna get to those techniques of solving differential equations as we move forward so don't worry about it but the point right now is that sometimes we come across these difference of equations that have Y in them that we're not gonna be able to do anything with and you look at you go I there's nothing I can do so whatwhat's this possible solution to that that's what is so field and some other techniques helped us with so here's an example the derivative of Y with respect to X so a differential equation has a first derivative a first order differential equation as x squared plus 2y squared let me go that's got a Y in it there's nothing that we that's gonna help us to solve that and I there's nothing to do so sometimes you run into that in differential equations where there's nothing that we can do to get an exact answer an exact general solution or even a particular solution that's going to fit that so one solution to our problem is we can oftentimes approximate solutions and that works with for some practical purposes and a lot of people in math did when they get here they don't like that I don't like it I still don't really like it there's not a solution you know when we have linear equations you solve it and you get one answer or you get no solution or infinite solutions but we get an answer and there's a process to doing that well with the difference of the equation sometimes there's not and so we have to get kind of used to this idea that not all the time do we get the answer that we're looking for by a process that's outlined like step one step two step three it doesn't exist in some cases so we have these techniques to approximate and it works in real life really well so we say well this this well we can't find an actual solution we can approximate it it's gonna work just fine for us and if you remember we talked about that a few videos ago where we said that that these approximations are good enough that these approximations are something that that we can model life on and when we get to advance in our equations we can't solve them anyway so we have this trade-off if we start limiting variables well then we were not perfectly representing our situation but if we perfectly represent our situation then we can't solve it so sometimes in making an equation better we limit our ability to solve it and that's where approximations can come in and help us and say well I can't particularly solve this but it's good enough for the the real-life application of trying to represent so here's your idea so so again sometimes you can't solve it with the techniques I'm going to teach you here's a solution we have approximation so here's the idea on how to get that approximation one idea is called a slope field so here's an idea does if we know that first derivatives represent slopes but we know that a derivative is a rate of change a first derivative represents a slope of a function that we're dealing with so first derivatives represent slopes so if we have a first derivative a derivative of Y with respect to X derivative of the dependent variable and with respect to the independent variable if we have that solved for some function that has both X's and Y's in it what that means is we have a formula to find the slope that's kind of cool this represents the slope so if this is the first derivative this is the slope that's our formula so our first derivative our slope is represented by this formula with X's and Y's that's me so this means that we have a formula to find our slope more specifically this represent slope so the first rib to represent slope so we have a form of the final slope at any point at any point that we want to Y well why does it work well if this is our slope and it's based on X's and Y's points have an X into y it's going to x coordinate y coordinate by just plugging it into the function and that should be pretty straightforward to us if a first derivative means slope and this slope equals some function of x and y given any point both x and y we can plug that point into this function and find a slope at that point provided that it's continuous at that that point so provided that we were not an endpoint provided that we don't have a gap or a hole or it's not defined so that that's important we'll get into uniqueness and existence a little bit later two videos from now so short recap wrongs done I'm going to get to two examples to show you what slope fields are and they take a while to create they're not hard a lot of people use computer to do this or a calculator I'm not gonna be showing you that of course my ideas here are to get you to understand the concept not just to be able to do it but to understand what's going on and I like to do that by hand when I go through this so slope fields problem not we can't solve them all solution maybe we can approximate and one idea is hey if derivatives represent slopes and you have a differential equation with the derivative in it and we can solve it for a function of x and y then we have a formula to find slope at any point this is slope that's the formula just plug in the point to our function and you're gonna find the slope at whatever point x1 you just plug in so here's our process what we're gonna do is is we're gonna look at this we're gonna make a whole bunch of little lines that represent slopes at points on the XY plane it's not as hard as you might think you're gonna have this tons of slopes but there's a pattern to that I'm going to show you so make the graph so XY plane that has a lot of lines to represent little soaps so they look like unit vectors almost without the arrow fifty bad calc 3 and you have you had vectors so you see those little unit vectors all over the place they really look like that without the arrows at points on XY they just give a direction that your line is going well that's what slope does right it gives the rate of change at any point on a on a function and so our idea is if we make this graph of a whole bunch of little lines that say hey at this point the function should be going like this well then we can put all of that together and given a specific point in initial condition then we can find an approximate curve whose slopes fit that fit that feel at every point slopes fit and what we mean by that is it is this so here's the general idea in finishing vague because we haven't had any examples but here's the idea you're gonna take this function this differential equation that represents slope slope is a first derivative and you're gonna take every point on the XY plane and that sounds hard take every point and plug it in and say well at this point I get this slope at this point I get this look at this point I get this little and you're gonna make this huge XY plane there's gonna be slopes everywhere these little lines that represent direction at every point the slope can be given at any point just by plugging it in so with the whole XY plane we could potentially plug in every point carefully and every point but like the point three comma four point negative one comma two zero zero we can find the slope for any of those points where we have a defined function so where it's continuous where it's differentiable we can find the slope of so we're gonna do that we're going to take the whole XY plane we take every point on it that we can find then we're gonna find the slope at those points it's gonna look crazy we have all these little directions all these little slopes on this on this of this plane then if I give a specific point well we can say there's this is the way the curve has to go or has to travel to make it through that point and to fit all of these slopes so given a point or an initial condition that's what we're talking about then we can start approximating a curve so here's what you need to know about these slope fields that we're going to create when we create a slope field so all these slopes on the plane it's a general solution it says that this is everything that could happen they sort how all the curves would have to look to go through these these slopes to make sure that we're fitting the slope at every single if you want one specific herb in particular solution like we studied before you need an initial condition you need a point to go through so long story made short sometimes stuff don't work we need approximations one way is to find the slope at every point put it on a graph and then that represents your general solution that represents all the curves that would have such slopes that would have such slopes then what we do is we say if we want a specific one you just need a point and that will limit the curve so we'll find a particular solution that fits on our slope field that also goes through that point and at every point along that curve or fitting the slopes that's the idea well what I want to do now is show you two examples on how to create them and then all of this is going to make a lot more sense because as we go through they'll be explaining hey remember how this makes slope and remember how we need a point and now we can go ahead and see a specific curve so I'm gonna do that we'll do just two examples and I'll walk you through how to do that so let's get started on our example we're gonna build a slope field from scratch so no computers no calculators because I want to understand what's going on here they'll do it for you and I'm sure that you're gonna use it in whatever class you're in go and get a computer and that's the great way to build slope fields when you have some difficult differential equations so here's our problem again sometimes these things aren't solvable I'm not saying this one's not I'm saying I'm giving it easy example here so we can see what a slope field does so whether there's a technique or not to solve that explicitly I don't care right now what I want is your idea of slope fields to be built near it so you sure you understand how they work so here's our point if that right there means a slope then that's the formula for the slope so at every single point that we have X comma Y we can find the slope at that point of our general solution whatever curve is gonna fit this so our slope the first derivative is just X plus y that means that if we have our Y values and our X values we can make a table for slope really easily all we do is we have to add up our X plus or Y value so say take the x value + / it's going to give you the slope we're gonna make a table up like that it looks like it's gonna take a long time but there's a lot of good patterns here so we're going to I'm going to show you how to find the patterns I'm going to show you how to write it really quickly then we're gonna take our slopes over and put them on our XY plane and that will create a so field we'll talk about in just a minute now you can do this however you want I prefer to put my Y values of top of my X values on the side you can do it differently if you'd like to but the point is try to find a pattern and then and utilize that pattern so if you want to start here you can I might start looking for something like well if I'm if I'm adding up some numbers here I know that negative 4 plus 4 it's going to give me 0 are you seeing that 4 for my X plus negative fourth Y it's going to give me zero but so is 3 plus negative 3 and 2 plus negative 2 and 1 plus negative 1 and 0 plus 0 and negative 1 plus 1 and they did so all this diagonal is zeros the X values for the Y values negative 4 when you add them to find the slope which goes in this this field begin zeros all the way along that diagonal check you really want to but negative 4 plus 4 is going to 0 we can get the whole way now their pattern is gonna continue diagonally for this whole rest of it so if you find your first diagonal all you need to do is find one number and all these are gonna be the same so 3 plus negative 4 X plus y 3 plus negative 4 is negative 1 maybe try it for a couple of them so for these simple ones we get these nice diagonals do they all we're gonna bet no but a lot of them do and so we're gonna try that so negative 2 plus negative 3 is negative 1 also you probably could make patterns this way so 0 negative 1 that's probably negative 2 that's probably negative 3 that's probably negative 4 that's probably negative 5 we're excited way to make sure enough negative 4 plus negative 4 is negative 8 now we're going to continue our patterns all these my diagonals right now we've already got half of our slope field done that's pretty nice so if you're gonna have to do this by hand most of the time you can find some nice patterns if you can't use your computer now you this is just to give you an idea with a slope I'm not gonna explore that with you you can use a computer calculator to plug that in usually every single textbook that's out there has some sort of a graphing utility you can watch so through they're not bad check them out for yourself but this this is just to get the idea a little slope field does in your head same thing works here so if this is negative 1 0 that's probably one let's just check real quick 4 plus negative 3 that's one that's probably 2 it is so now what we've done we've taken this thing this differential equation which has a first derivative in it which means slope and we have a formula to find it we just plug in every single point for this finite graph that we have so it's it's limited but you could extend it as suppose and we find the slope by just adding the X and the y coordinates that's for this specific differential equation now we take all of these slopes and for point by point we're gonna put just a little line on this graph to represent the slope at this point it looks like a unit vector without the air isn't you giving you the direction that's what slope does gives you the instantaneous rate of change or the direction that the curve is going at that point what that's gonna do is fill out this entire XY plane with all these sort of slopes that represent your general solution all the curves that would fit these slopes so we'll get to that right now okay so now that we have this filled out all of our slopes at every point that we really need on the XY plane well we're going to put those little lines and every one of these points I tried to do this the first time without the the grid that's really hard it's gonna get all disorganized so make yourself a grid or did some seventh-grade paper some graphing paper that way you know every single one of those intersections of your X and your Y that's where you're gonna put your little line so when we do this the slope field what's happening is that at every single cross section of an X to the Y we now have a coarse fine slope so we just have to go along I'm gonna use my diagonals I'm going to start at four negative or I'm gonna make a diagonal so four negative four x equals 4 and y equals negative 4 x equals 4 y equals negative 4 I have a slope of 0 so if there's a particular solution that hits that point it is going to have a slope of 0 at that point is going to be flat so it's probably going to be like a relative Max or relative min it's gonna bounce somehow it's gonna do that now because you have these diagonals just follow your pattern at 3 on the x and negative 3 on the Y or Y on the X and negative 3 on the Y we're also going to the slope of 0 and we are gonna have that every one of these intersections hopefully you can verify by looking here that yeah you know what at negative 1 on the x and 1 on the line that you'd want to X 1 the Y of slope is 0 and a negative 2 to negative 3 3 and negative 4 for those all have a slope of 0 that's how slope field works and we're gonna take some time and just fill this out maybe you can do it as undo it if you've drawn this if not just follow along that's ok I have another one in just a minute that you can do in your own if you'd like so be careful it's kind of easy to get these confused especially confusing your X with Y or Y so I pause from for just a minute every time I start a new diagonal and I make absolutely sure that I have the right starting slope for whatever point I'm on so I'm gonna go and do 4 on the X negative 3 on the Y I'm going to put a positive slope of 1 so 4 on the X negative 3 in 1 for X negative 3 on the Y and that's gotta have a slope of 1 now I'm gonna see how that pattern works so the next one 3 on the X negative 2 on the wire 3 on the X negative 2 on the Y I'm gonna try to give that the same slope all the way up and drawing that agree it makes it infinitely easier but infinitely but a lot easier okay let's keep on going also if we can we can use this pattern down here so as we're going on the x equals or vertical lines so going up the Y's our slope goes from zero to one - two - three - four - five - six - seven - eight here's what that means this is a slope of zero one two three four five six seven eighths can be really steep so as we climb along our Y for a given x value our slope is increasing so you could do that - there's about a slope of two so I'm gonna continue that diagonal I have a slope of three four five six seven and eight and you're approximating here um so you're Schultz are gonna get really really steep by the end of it so that's stuff zero-one I followed it to I followed it I know this is going to be three zero one two three it looks pretty close here's going to be four so at 4 on the X and 0 on the y I better have said before on the X 0 why I've got a so before the next I should have the slope of five I'm going up on that x-value and my slope is increasing then 6 then 7 then 8 Malaysian hired novel so fuchsia this is looking like what this means is that every single one of our curves that fit on here at every point would have to have that slow so what how how many curves are there an infinite many that's why this represents a general solution so all of the solutions that we could possibly have would have to fit on these these this plane and have these slopes at their specific points that's some saying earlier that if you want to find a particular solution one curve you need to start with a point so we fill this out and then I'm gonna give you a point let me let me finish the rest of this and then we'll we'll go through and give you a particular initial condition to find a particular solution so let's finish the rest of our pattern at 3 on the X and negative 4 on the y we're gonna exit for the why I need episode with negative 1 at 2:00 on the X and negative 4 on the y so 2 on the x and negative 4 or why I need a silver negative to make sure that - 9 X negative 4 so to only acts negative 1 Y so by negative 2 then they get the 3 negative 4 negative 5 negative 6 negative 7 and negative 8 just like we have shown here about like that and we're approxima and going fairly quickly so let me recap it for you in just a bit some things we can't solve this this we can probably with another technique but we can find the slope at every point that so those so field does it says all of our X's overwise find the slope and every combination of points and then our coordinates for points then we put it on what's called a slope feel an XY plane now this is a picture of a general solution so this is every possible curve that would work for that differential equation it's gonna bid on here somehow and this is the way that they would look so to find a particular solution well you need to you need to have a point so let me show you a couple of things that we can do if we had a point like 0 0 say that we wanted to have the particular solution one curve that had an initial condition of y equal at Y of 0 equals 0 that would go through the point 0 for X 0 for y that's right here so if we're gonna have to go through that point remember what I said about every single point along this curve would have to have these slopes well we're backtracking now we're saying what if I need a curve that goes to that point well it's gonna still have to fit this look at that how this is this would have to fit along these slopes so if I'm going through that point yeah right here we're gonna have a change from decreasing to increasing we're gonna have a local minimum for this particular curve so right at that point we know that after that all my suits are climbing they're all positive they're all climbing before that all my soaps are negative they're all they're all falling is because that's right so this has to really be approximate by something that goes along increases look how this is gonna have this slope here goes further it's gonna have this slope it's gonna end with a fairly steep slope that has to look something like that to fit that slope field so once we are given a specific point in initial condition the rest of this flows along with their slope field now before that I know that that slope is zero it's gonna make it's going to dictate that we have this this change from decreasing to increasing and this line this line is all negative one right here like this is this later one slope says hey you're you've gotta follow that it's like an asymptote so before that we're going to have to somehow if it is and we probably looks something like that so general solution that's the whole thing this represents all possible solutions particular solution you just need a point and then follow your so field let's try a couple more how about how about negative 2 - so why I'm negative 2 equals negative 2 that gives us a point negative 2 comma negative 2 so let's go to that let's go to that point negative 2 negative 2 that's right here now we're not going to be hitting this asymptote because look how our slopes go I know that afterwards I'm I'm getting more and more negative with my slopes I have to look something like that before I'm just going to follow this up I'm going to follow my slopes I'm just going to make sure that I'm hitting I'm eating those slopes at though at the right the right slope for wherever I'm falling on my slope field so this was let's see a slope of negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 negative 4 so this would be negative 1 negative 2 so slope between negative 2 and negative 3 right there that's about how that particular solution work I hope this is making sense you I hope you're seeing the idea that the general solution has all these different slopes for a particularly at a point and just follow the slopes before and after that let's do one more of my y equal Y of 4 equals 1 so when we go to this point 4 comma 1 all it's saying is make sure that when you're when you get here at 4 comma 1 you're lying or your curve that you're gonna draw it's going to fit all the slopes before and after that so after that we have a slope of let's see 1 2 3 4 x over 5 we're going to have do this all that and it's going to be an increasing slope after that but before remember that we have this asymptote thing I'm trying to fit between my slopes here I know that from here to here I go a slope of 0 to 1 so I'm trying to make that pretty cool between there then somewhere in here I'm changing from this positive to a negative slope as I going backward so I'm going to hit a slope of 0 and then I have this asymptote that I got it and that gives us our particular solution that would have to go for that point it's pretty cool because we can model these approximations without doing any real hardcore math we know that our particular solution has to fit these slopes this little one so field tells you since it's got a figure now one more question what if I wanted to go through a point like 1 comma negative 2 1 comma negative 2 I am on that slope of negative 1 I'm not changing as I'm going down that so on this particular point before and after it we're just traveling along that asymptote and what that does it says yeah your if your slope is negative 1 as you move down that you're not changing you this is the slope is negative 1 I know we're going to show on specific points here but every point between here would also have a slope of negative 1 you can't get off of that that's the asymptote you're gonna eventually be on that the whole entire time so that's about it that that's how slope feels work we take this differential equation that we may or may not be able to solve and if we need to approximate it so if you don't have a technique to solve it we can create this field that has a whole bunch of slopes at different points then we just have to find the particular solution that goes through a point and fits that sub field so what you're getting when you do a so field is the general solution that's why their slopes everywhere you go well there's not one curve that goes through all of those of course is it won't even be a function to get a specific one particular function you need a particular point then we can match up from that point fit all the slopes before and after that so just notice that on the previous example I know we're only doing one today takes just take a long time and there's nothing different about any of these things that you do so this follow the same exact process just notice that how given that if you have a point a particular solution it gives you a unique solution to that differential equation all the paths through the slope field are our solutions to differential into that particular differential differential equation so all of all the different curves you can draw so every single one of them would be a particular solution of that differential equation put them all together you have the general solution I hope that makes sense to you the keys here are that we're approximating for things that we can't really solve so that's that's that's the idea practice a couple of them some simple ones by hand and then start using your computer or your calculator your graphing calculator to do harder ones I want to see for the next video where we'll do a couple more actual slope fields but I want to put them into practice I want to show you some real-life examples that way this isn't just really super Drive so see if next time for using some fields to solve some actual applications you 

Transcript for: Applications of Slope Fields (Differential Equations 10)
so now that we have a feel about what slope fields are let's try to use them in an application a little bit more realistic than just drawing slopes everywhere and figure out what curve goes through it this will give you an idea of what goes on in some real-life problems using differential equations so again let's start off with some sort of application let's if it's tough about slope fields and we'll get this this picture what's really going on with our situation so a lot of times in some of the simplified word problems you're used to we neglect things like wind resistance which isn't really realistic if you jump out of like let's say a helicopter before you jump on a helicopter okay so go don't jump up because it's spinning but let's say you jump out of the helicopter well you're gonna fall now that makes sense that if you if you jump downward you're gonna fall faster and if you just kind of fall out you're gonna fall slower but when you think about how wind resistance works if we just had gravity and and no wind resistance yeah we pick up velocity until we smash them to the ground or pull the parachute but if we have wind resistance as our gravity is pulling us down at a constant acceleration our velocity is increasing yeah but our acceleration is not we're falling down well we're picking up velocity and as we pick up that velocity we encounter more air resistance wind resistance we encounter this this force upward of the wind holding us up or pushing us up so gravity's going this way but the air resistance is actually a counter force pushing us up and it depends on on your velocity so as it turns out if we have how our velocity is changing that's acceleration remember that the way that velocity is changing the rate of change of our velocity with respect to time that's acceleration well in previous examples like simplified versions we would just do this and we go yeah we're accelerating from gravity wind resistance but we do have resistance so if we look at the way that velocity is changing perspective time our acceleration it is the acceleration of gravity - so that's downward so acceleration to gravity let's consider that gravity is pulling us down air resistance is opposite of that so our air resistance is some proportional constant like K but it's proportional to our velocity so the constant proportionality is K that's some sort of a number that's based on whatever the object is that's falling so we have a larger body or something would be encountered more air resistance than like an arrow or a bullet or something and but it is proportional to velocity so the faster you are going the more air resistance you encountered we know that right out because if we're standing still you're not feeling any resistance but if you were running twenty miles an hour that'd be really fast you would feel a lot of wind against you or if you stick your hand out of a moving car then you're gonna feel that that wind against your hand so the and the faster you go the more wind that you feel well then that's pushing us upwards as a force that's acting upwards so in real life our acceleration the rate of change of velocity respective time is yes gravity gravitational constant but - the air resistance I hope that makes sense to you so G is that gravity and it's the constant of acceleration for gravity k is the this this idea of you have a proportionality of air resistance so now and that would be objects specific so whatever you are throwing out or dumping out or jumping out that that K is gonna change you know what object you or considering their resistance for so here's the idea and this is what I really want to get get out of this if you just consider the gravitational acceleration so 32 feet per second squared and so every second that you're going you're increasing your velocity or 32 feet per second well if you don't consider air resistance yeah we pick up velocity until we smash into the ground but if we have air resistance something pushing up against us at some point check this out at some point G will equal K times V somewhere along this line this is going to equal this look that's a constant that's not changing we're on earth it's always the same gravity yeah it does change as we get away from the earth but not not by much so that's constant if that's a constant and we hold that constant and this increases as velocity goes up so so you dump something out of the helicopter it's gonna pick up speed as it picks up speed it gets more and more and more air resistance against it so the way our velocity is changing our acceleration is constant but this is growing as time goes on that's growing at some point these two things will be equal well if you subtract to equal things what do you get you get zero so at some point our acceleration the way that our velocity is changing will be zero it means our velocity won't be changing any more let me explain that one more time so you throw something out your velocity is going to change that's acceleration how your loss is changing so the rate of change of velocity with respect to time your acceleration is G minus air resistance so right at the beginning you just have G but your velocity starts going up you're going to gain air resistance so that's pushing against your acceleration that's pushing against your the body and it's going to slow your acceleration if that's constant and that's growing your acceleration diminishes to the point where at some point you're getting zero acceleration that doesn't mean your velocity zero that means though that your velocity is not changing so at some point you're going to hit a terminal velocity or some people call that a limiting velocity for speed related type problems we're going to hit that and we're going to see that in our slope field so without any specific techniques on how to solve these things we can come up with a slope field to describe the situation so one last time yeah we're jumping out yes the way the loss of change spec times called acceleration gravity is a constant but the the proportionality of your air resistance is is it's proportional to well your air resistance is proportional to plus the faster you go the more wind pushes against you at some point you're going to reach this where the way that air resistance is forcing up is equal to how gravity is pulling down that's going to that's going to be your limiting velocity so when that happens it's gonna be your limiting velocity and we're gonna check that out so let's say let's explore one so let's say that this is our situation we're gonna jump out of a helicopter and that right there that's gravity that's 32 feet per second squared we have found somehow the constant of variation or how we're proportional is this constant of 1.6 times whatever velocity you're traveling that's gonna be how our wind resistance is affecting us let's say this is us jump down so if we have a first order differential equation we know that this means slope so first derivative means so that means our slope is 32 minus one point six V the where's-where's fatigue remember that velocity is already a function of time so velocity is changing with respect to time the T is wrapped up in that that's our dependent variable but T's in there somehow so all we really need is velocity what that means is this is going to be weird but as our time goes on these numbers are not going to change there's no place to even plug in T ve already has all the t's in it so I hope you've got to do is go plug in zero if we plug in zero for our V and here's all of our T's plug in zero you're gonna get 32 and that's not going to change our T doesn't affect that our velocity is already already has those it's already bunch of T it already has those T's in effect that plug into five what we get if we plug in five we get 24 so 32 minus one point six times five if we plug in 10 well that's 32 minus 16 so we need 16 all the way down if we plug in 15 32 minus 1 point 6 times 15 gives us 8 if we plug in 20 we're gonna get 0 this is what you're looking for and if you continue this this is negative 8 and negative 16 you know if you were watching for the this slope field video the one right before this we had diagonals that weren't changing that happens a lot when you have like X is plus or minus wise this when they're your x I did a variable on here you're going to get these verticals that aren't changing happens and I know that you can plug in 40 and do 30 minus 1.6 times 40 and get these these same exact numbers I'm getting so let's make all this makes sense before we do our slope field and look at what's going to happen on the on our graph so we know that in real life we get air resistance that means that when you jump out you're going to reach some sort of limiting velocity at some point your air resistance is going to meet up with acceleration of gravity if you're jumping high enough and don't get the ground first or or polar parachute or something they're gonna be equal that means that you're not going to be changing your velocity after that you had this zero change as zero acceleration means that you will have a constant constant velocity at that point so this is what that does this says if you jump out it used fall so your initial velocity is zero you're not jumping downwards you're in a helicopter right so you're probably not gonna jump up because there's a blade that would be a negative initial velocity so if you jump down with negative five you're gonna probably hit the propeller you don't want to do that so this would be jumping downward so if we jump out at zero so just fall well initially we're going to be going this 30 - oh well let me let me say that and say this is they will see this on our arm picture we're going to be increasing our velocity at this 32 feet per second if we jump out of five does it make sense that if you jump out going downward you're going to immediately encountered air resistance immediately that means that your rate of change of velocity is going to be slower you've already jumped out at five feet per second so the rate at which you're changing is a little bit slower now let's say you jump out of ten you're jumping downward at ten feet per second already the reign of changing to be slower you've encountered that air resistance immediately here you did it that's why we're Exelero that's why our velocity is changing faster here no here no here a little bit little bit slower now what about 20 and 20 if you jump downward at 20 feet per second right from the get go out of this helicopter your rate of change isn't going to be anything at all you've encountered just enough air resistance to meet up with your gravity so this is weird and we're gonna see it on the picture but if you jumped out of this helicopter at 23 per second you're not gonna feel your velocity increase or decrease you will have immediately met your limiting velocity that's wild now let's say that you jump out faster than that let's say that you jumped down wow I just really wanna get on a helicopter and you're jumping down at 25 feet per second you're actually going to slow down so if you're jumping faster than your limiting velocity air resistance is pushing up more than gravity he's pulling you down should kind of slow down that that's the same principle like when you when you shoot if you shot a gun downward so it's at some point your guns going so fast that it's a it's meeting so much air resistance that gravity's not gonna overcome that your air resistance is pushing up more than gravity's pulling that down you have an initial velocity there that's so fast it's counting so much air resistance it's going to slow that bullet down even though you shouldn't downward that's what's happening here so you jumped out at forty feet per second downwards that really pushing it you're gonna encounter so much air resistance that that's pushing you up more than the gravity is pulling you down that's weird but that's what this is gonna play on us so long story made real short we have air resistance it's proportional to your velocity and we can show the picture of it really kind of nicely this point where we have a zero change that is called your limiting velocity or terminal velocity or when we talk about population will get like this population limiting factor layer carrying capacity something that limits how much we can grow if you're below that you're going to increase if you're above that you're gonna decrease until you find this leveling spot this limit so let's put these slows remember these are all slopes how our velocity is changing is right here let's put them on our graph let's see what happens again we made the grid it's a lot easier to use so because our time isn't affected well our time is affecting our our velocity but it's wrapped up in the velocity itself so four times zero one two three four we're gonna have these these intersections of time and velocity so zero zero right down here we have a slope of 32 but that's really steep I'm not gonna really build it draw that as not a vertical line that's gonna be darn near a vertical line 32 rise over run but also at so here's our velocity so 0 5 10 15 20 years of times 1 through 6 so at 0 0 we got 32 at equals one and velocity zero we also have thirty-two at T equals two and velocity zero will get 32 so all along this velocity of zero we have a slope with 32 this is acts like a diagonal notice not bad no but this does not change darn your vertical lines now as we bump it up to five our velocity goes to five feet per second then our slope starts to two not starts to decrease from 32 and we talked about why that was so you jump out with an initial velocity you immediately encountered air resistance which means your velocity can't change as drastically as it did if you jump down at zero at zero you have no air resistance for a little while that means that you're going to increase velocity faster because you're it's only gravity that's affecting you as you increase speed you start encountering air resistance so the way your velocity is changing can't be as drastic is if you didn't have air resistance so the more air resistance you have the less that your acceleration of gravity can take over here we get 24 so all along this level we have 24 at 10:00 we have 16 at 15 mm 8 at 20 we have zero and that is just as that should be striking to be like oh well hobby obviously if our spokes are really no matter where where our soaps are gonna increase we're gonna go uh we're gonna level out right here so if we and this is what is saying to you as we're looking our soap field that's this isn't this is important because if models real-life concepts really really well that's what so people to do that's how we want to use them if you jump out at any velocity up to twenty feet per second going downward you're going to increase your velocity gravity is going to overcome your air resistance until you reach that point and then you're gonna level out if you jump out faster than twenty feet per second down so let's see 25 you get negative eight at thirty we have negative sixteen so in mirrors this and putting this all together our slope field gives us how are our velocity is changing with respect to time if we jump out or fall out or are putting an initial velocity that's slower than 20 feet per second this is all saying that yeah you're going to increase until you reach that level if you jump out that faster so going down we're jumping downward at faster than 20 feet per second you're actually going to slow down here gravity is overcoming your air resistance until you hit 20 here air resistance is overcoming your gravity so this would be bigger than gravity that's what you're slowing down what we what's gonna happen though is that these two things are gonna level out in real life your air resistance and your gravity are going to come to some sort of equilibrium an equilibrium solution that's what this is the the solution where if you started at 20 so 20 feet per second you jump out you're jumping down route 23 per second you are not gonna feel a change so it's not gonna feel like you're increasing speed it's not gonna feel like you're decreasing speed check out slower than that it's gonna feel like you're speeding up because gravity's pulling you faster than your air resistance when you start to a point to that that level of 20 feet per second where we even out here if you're jumping faster than that so jump me down we're faster than that you're going to feel like you are slowing down your slope is negative here you're gonna be decreasing your velocity until you reach that equilibrium until you reach that limiting velocity in that weird it's kind of cool so right here this this 20 that right there is our limiting velocity no matter what happens whether you jump out whether you're pushed out jump downward whatever you're going to reach that velocity given enough time so let's kind of interesting we'll figure out how much time you really need again you're not going to jump up so don't have a negative velocity not gonna jump upward because of the helicopter idea so our limit is this 20 feet per second so let's say that we let's say that we jump down at 0 so so we start here so remember from our our slope fields that we had an initial condition and starting spot of 0 0 so at x 0 we're not traveling any we're just jumping down when I choking downward let's see how fast we actually come up to that that 20 feet per second so starting starting here remember that slope fields that they've got to find this curve that matches these slopes so we're starting really steep when we get to this level we better have a slope of positive 24 so when we hit 5 we gotta have a slope of 24 when we hit 10 we've gotta have a son of 16 then 8 then 0 this right here looks like it's about seventeen and a half or something so we reach 17 and a half feet per second after only two seconds so we go from 0 to 17.5 feet per second in 1/2 that's like well what is that that's a good percentage of 23 per second when we if you divide that so do set about 70 and a half divided by 20 that's a percentage of that limiting velocity that you reach after two seconds so you can find out how long it's going to take you to reach a certain percentage of 20 now theoretically do you ever reach 20 it's an asymptote so technically no or theoretically no but that's the limit so you're going to get to that point get closer and closer and closer but but you're never going to exceed that that velocity you can only limit to it wild now let's say you jumped out it at 40 same thing happens in Reverse you're gonna slow down until you reach your limiting velocity I hope this is making sense to you it's very interesting the way that works in real life because at some point when you really do think about it gravity and air resistance if you're jumping up faster than gravity slow down you're jumping up slower than gravity you're gonna speed up but that air resistance is forcing you backwards so when you're when you're when you're self when you're jumping up so fast air is just this is overcoming gravity when jumping out so slow gravity's overcoming air resistance but some what they mean that's what we're talking about with an equal image solution you jumped out of twenty that can feel change faster slurring that you're gonna reach that limiting velocity we're gonna do one more example about population will talk about limiting population or carrying combat capacity so hang on for that one I'd like to walk you through one more example about population we're gonna do this very quickly the idea is exactly the same I just want to show you how slope can do some funny things in the middle of this this problem to show you that on the slope field and to talk about something called carrying capacity so so when we look at this we have the way that that a population is changing with respect to time now again we don't have a T up here but the population itself is a function of time and so the way that population is changed or you think of it the acceleration of population that's kind of weird but how fast is the population growing or decreasing well that's given by this for a certain population with TB months now because we don't have a team in here our slope is still equal this here is the slope of the population the way the populations change with respect to time is still equal to this but there's no T involved the P hat is a function of time already so it's it's involved in that population well if we want to go ahead and do a slope field our slope is given by this function of P a function of T with our dependent variable P in there let's just start plugging in initial populations so what if we started zero well okay 0-0 these are all going to be zero do you see that it's not gonna change as far as what time we have we're gonna have zero this whole way down same thing happens for all this I'm just going to be one number if we start with ten our slope would be point two all the way down if we start with twenty point three three would be our slope start with thirty point for our slope start with forty point for to move your so let's start with fifty point 0.38 and usse know something funny kind of happening so our slope is increasing and then it starts decreasing again that's a very interesting than 60 would be point two seven 75 would be zero you're looking for that and then 80 would be negative point one two here's what this is saying this would be all the way down for all of these remember my goal in teaching you this not just how to do it understanding what's going on if this is the way that the population is changing what this says is that if you start with these populations here's what is going to happen if you start with a population of zero are you gonna see any growth probably not there's nothing to grow if you start with a population of ten whatever this population size is you're going to immediately start seeing a population increase twenty increase thirty increase faster for to increase faster and that should make sense right because if you have more things to reproduce the population should be growing faster to a point because our natural resources aren't limitless which means that as we get closer and higher and higher our population is growing but not as fast because we're reaching some sort of factor here at some point we hit what's called in carrying capacity so you start with 75 units of population whatever that is it's not gonna grow it's not gonna fall it's limited if you start with more than that you're gonna actually have a die-off if you put say you've had a really small pond and you just you don't zero fish in no Fisher code you go okay that they don't just spontaneously come about listen make sense if you dump in way too many fish like a billion fish in a really small pond there's not enough resource just a lot of them are going to die so as we start having our population go higher and higher and higher it makes sense that at some point or not you'll be able to grow anymore in fact we're going to start dying off because there's just too much of this population in one spot there's a middle ground that because if you start low and it's gonna grow you start high it's gonna die that's both wrong that's kinda fun then at some point there's this equilibrium solution and that's what that 75 does that's zero right there look positive slopes negative slopes there's got to be a zero that right there that's your carrying capacity that means that no matter whether you start lower than zero or higher you are going to level off you're going to limit yourself to that 75 popular units of population whatever that is and the picture is gonna bear that out so I'm just really quickly but at zero zero we have of course zero and if we had a population start at zero we're gonna zero all the way no matter what if we start up with ten so we're gonna have this part of this is slope with 0.2 so all the way along get a little point to slope and we're going to increase until we get to 40 populations start on initial population of 40 units I'm kind of exaggerating my slope right now so you see what's going on but then once we get to 50 please start to slow down so the most rapid growth that we have is right around start with 40 you start with that much if you have a lot of things or whatever these beans are to reproduce and you but you have enough resources to make it sustainable when we get over that if we start slowing back down then even slower and probably even so I don't have this listed here I'm missing my 70 I don't want to put that out there but even slower 70s point one of you on them to the point where we have zero and above that we have a negative soul so if you're looking at your slope field that looks like this this should be really telling what's going on if you start with a population of zero you are not going to see any growth obviously if you start with just slightly more than that it's going to grow slowly at first but then as our time moves on look how our curve has to flow through this slope field so it seems like well time doesn't matter it does matter but it's just like you're starting at a different level here population wise so if we start at zero and we have no population no matter what our time is we have zero that that is an equilibrium solution but it's not a good one I mean it's like it's like the trivial solution you know yeah it's it's nothing it's like the same you're gonna launch a basket where you launch a rocket from the ground at time zero it's on the ground when's the rocket on the ground and time zero Thanks I meant like after it's all done once it hit the ground so if you start with no population obviously you're not gonna have when I'm at one time but if you start with just higher than that you are gonna flow along this curve you're a mattress slopes up but eventually you're gonna level off if you start higher you just gain quicker but you're gonna level off if you start lower yeah my team may take you a long time to finally reach that because you don't have as many many reproducing items if you start way higher what you're actually gonna drop this is like what the last example your gravity to overcome in your air resistance or your air resistance overcoming your gravity this is the same thing your level of food is overcoming your population which means you can grow or your populations overcoming your level of fitness called food which means your population is going to decrease you'll have enough so that's the way that these slope fields work they're looking for the 0 that 0 is typically your carrying capacity or your limiting velocity for speed problems or your equilibrium solution if you start with that so if we started with 75 units of population you wouldn't change if you started with let's say 10 at time 0 make sure you're hitting these slopes as you're moving forward we travel along but eventually we are in love allowed so how you can figure out things like how fast would it take you to hit 90 percent of your or 75 percent of your your limiting capacity or the two thirds or whatever and just look for where you reach let's say 60 a level of 60 that happens when do I hit a level of 60 let's go if I start at 10 if I start at 10 units population well that would mean that I did right around the 60 months or so they said 48 15 somewhere 48 60 months so the whole idea of soap fields one last time as last we're gonna really talk about it so fields model hopefully some realistic examples that you can't or maybe aren't able to solve with different equations right now or maybe even ever what they do is they consider a first derivative to be the slope which we have they say that's the formula for your slope no problem I can just plug in some points I got it then it's gonna give you a slope at every point the whole picture is your general solution so every possible curve would happen fit these slopes so this is your general solution it tells us a lot about situations though if you just look at the slopes it goes about that's your that's your limiting factor right there so if you start with the population 75 you ain't gonna grow if you jump out of the helicopter 20 feet per second year I'm not gonna fall any faster so they tell us a lot about a situation just by looking at it to get a specific curve you need a starting point so you could say I'm going through this point and then you can find a particular solution that's how all initial conditions work any way this condition gives us a particular solution a lot of times we can see what's our trends in in gaining or losing and how that would really affect our real life situation so I'm I'm hopeful that this is making sense to you I'm hoping that you see the the niceness about this that you can approximate solutions without actually having to do anything with the problem that's pretty cool computers do this really well and what's nice about it is remember that whole talk about how we have this trade-off between perfectly modeling the situation and doing the math behind it well if you've got computers you can kind of do both you can perfectly model situation and then do a slope field and it will show you a lot of trends in it I'll show you limiting capacities are limiting limiting factors or carrying capacities or limiting velocities and include more variables even though United will solve it and that's that's pretty neat so I hope this makes sense I hope that right now you're able to take a slope from a difference of the equation make up a table to get yourself a slope field and interpret what's going on look at how slowly we go we start low or how quickly we decline if we start high look and think about how that would make sense in a real life event with low populations we'd grow slowly but as we get more and more population we start living ourselves because of resources to a point where we're going to level off just enough resources to support us but not grow any more you start too high there's not enough resources to support and we would decline population that's what so feels about is interpreting real-life situations so next time what we're going to talk about is how to determine when we're when we're gonna have solutions or not so so fields one way to deal with it when we don't have a solution but now we're going to start determining when we do have solutions and when we can expect a unique one so we'll talk about that and then after that we start dealing with solving techniques it just gave me fun you 

Transcript for: Watch Before Diff Eq 11
hey everybody in the subsequent video I make an omission and I shouldn't have it in my mind I did it when I was filming it but I watched it back and it's not gonna make a whole lot of sense or it's gonna be very deceiving if you don't listen to what I'm about to tell you so we're going to talk about existence and uniqueness of solutions to differential equations at initial values and what I'm going to say many times in this video is that continuity does not exist at endpoints that is not true continuity of a function can exist at an end point if we consider one side of limits so when you're watching this video and I make those statements here's what I mean I don't say it and that is my fault but here's what I mean what I mean is that when we consider these points that were checking an initial value a point we need to consider continuity on an open interval around that point and that's due to differentiability since we're talking about differential equations so when I say that continuity does not exist at an endpoint here's what I meant to say here's what I mean to say here's what I've never made clear in the video and so I'm telling you right now so when I get there I say continuity does not exist the endpoint what I mean is if the initial value that we are checking happens at the endpoint of an interval of continuity if there's an endpoint there's not enough room for an open interval and neighborhood to be around it so this is then there's my mistake it did not make that very clear in the video so I'm telling you right now when I say that continuity doesn't exist at an endpoint what I mean is considering the initial value that we're checking that initial value cannot be an endpoint because there's not enough of a neighborhood to consider continuity so for this for this particular video continuity needs to be an open idea I say that many times but I never tell you it's only for this idea it's only for checking whether we have continuity around a point a neighborhood of a initial value that we are checking so one more time in the video you were about to watch I say many times company when you can't exist at an endpoint not true for functions in general but for the purposes of this video what we need this for continuity to be an open interval we need an open interval of continuity around the point we're checking and that means that for intervals of continuity if that point we're checking is at an endpoint we can't create that open interval so I hope that makes it clear again I apologize if the next part of the video just doesn't make sense come back and watch this again because continuity can exist endpoints with one-sided limits but for the purposes of differentiability and for the purposes of checking for existence and uniqueness we must have an open interval of continuity around the initial value that we're checking but what that means is that we cannot cannot let that initial value occur at an endpoint and that's what I mean by continuity does not exist at an endpoint is if that point that we're checking is an endpoint then we don't have an open interval of continuity around it I hope that makes sense enjoy the video and let me know if you get it 

Transcript for: Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions (Differential Equations 11)
last video before we get on to techniques of solving differential equations which is gonna be rad 16 awesome me a lot of fun and we we have a lot of techniques so this this last one is just showing when you're gonna have solutions to a differential equation and when those solutions are gonna be unique so it's just a little subsection here it's important but after this we really don't go through and do a lot of it so I want to just kind of it explain it to you on where it's coming from it is important sometimes classes just glossed right over this so let's talk a little bit about when you're gonna even have solutions what those solutions mean and when they're gonna be unique so let's talk more about differential equations when we talk about solutions we're almost always talking about solutions through a point and if you remember back to our slope our slope fields slope fields represented a general solution and they were important we like general solutions but when we talk about specific solutions we're talking about those solutions through a point it took a specific initial value of a point for us to determine what what that one curve was that we wanted that went through that point and they gave us a specific particular solution on that slope field I hope you remember that you didn't watch the video go back and watch so field so solutions to differential equations are most often considered at points that gives us specific things we can work with otherwise we're left with this broad idea which does give us information about our scenario but it doesn't allow us to zoom in on one specific case so we did I talked about slope fields how we need at that point for a particular solution so there are going to be three cases for us to have solution or well three cases that can happen when we consider solutions to a differential equation at a point case number one there's no solution so in case number one if we have a differential equation and we're looking for a solution at a specific point it might not exist there's cases for that no here's what that does mean that doesn't mean that differential equation has no solution that's not true if you look at the slope field like we have been studying solutions to differential equation there's a whole lot of solutions to that differential equation it just depends on what point you want to pick for us to get in particular so where a differential equation might have tons of solutions there might not be a particular solution through one point there's a difference there so a differential equation can have lots and lots and lots of solutions just none that go through a certain point that's important number two it could have infinitely many solutions through that point so case one got a differential equation you got a point there's just nothing to go through the point no solutions go to the point or you can have a differential equation got lots of solutions you pick a point and there's infinitely many that go through there sometimes it happens of the equilibrium solutions so in tons are infinitely many solutions to that differential equation that happened to go through that point that happens to case three is the one that we really want to grab ahold of and see when this happens so case three you have a difference of the equation you have a particular violence or an initial condition a point and we find one unique solution to that differential equation in the neighborhood of that point we're going to talk a lot so this is this first part of this videos a lot of me talking explaining what the neighborhood means why we need the neighborhood what continuity has to do with it why that means differentiability since we're dealing with derivatives what that has to do with being a unique solution in a neighborhood around that so a little recap before we get into it first thing the differential equations are these equations that have derivatives we know that we are going to consider solutions to be at points that get lets us go from a general to a particular solution remember so fields that's what we need to get that particular there's three cases case one you could have a differential equation that just doesn't have a particular solution that goes the point you are suggesting that's case one even though other points have solutions that's fine that one point does not yield a particular solution that's case one case two you could have a difference of equation where you can Center a specific point and infinitely many go through there it's not unique case three is what we really like to Zone in on whether we have one unique solution to a differential equation at let's just say at a point but really when it comes down to is in a neighborhood around that point here's why here's why we need that so we'll talk more about this as we get on to our cases over here when we have existence and when we have uniqueness but for a curve to be continuous I'm just throwing this right now so that you understand where it company comes about for a curve to be continuous at a point that's really hard to say that you have a curve continuous at a point if you don't consider a little bit before that point and a little bit after that point that's called a neighborhood so if you have a point on a graph I say is that is that point continuous that doesn't make any sense because you need to know if there's points before that and points after that so you know if there's a little bit of the function that leads up to that point and a little bit of function after that point to say at that point we had some before it was not an endpoint and we had some after it was not an endpoint the big thing here is that continuity isn't really exaggerated or really emphasize that continuity is an open idea it's a that's as important as if it says for occurred to be continuous we need a little bit ahead and a little bit behind that point for an open interval to exist for us to get to it and leave it that excludes this idea of endpoints and that's what this is saying it sounds really like funky like a neighborhood but for one unique solution with the case of one unique solution to a difference of equation it's in a neighborhood of that point because that that point itself must be contained something it's continuous for us to have differentiability since we're talking about derivatives we need differential something to be differentiable and for that to exist we have to have continuity you have to be able to get there and leave there for us to say there's one to one unique slope at that point you remember that from calculus one this is it right here I'm gonna get to it later I'll refresh it when we get there but at every point before that one you can say hey there's one specific slope to this curve at that point but as soon as you get here an endpoint you go well we can draw infinitely many slopes through that through that one point if we consider the points before like in one side limit yes we can go ahead and say yeah well since this but at that point itself if you don't have any where you're going from going to you can't talk about that being continuous and for that reason we can't give it a this idea of being different differentiable at that point without the preceding ones like a one side limit and it needs we need this continuity for our cases of existence and uniqueness to be there so long sermon goes for when we're looking at unique solutions so one solution that happens to be unique we're looking at continuity we're looking at a neighborhood were saying you need to be able to get there and leave there for company exists and therefore for these two things to take place so one of the things we're talking about for a differential equation let's say we got a derivative of Y with respect to X that's equal to a function of x and y and in the neutral value so we got a differential equation like we know love we have an initial value okay that's a point we consider solutions to be at points here's what's going to happen if our function so we just look at this if that's continuous around the point that we are checking so around our initial condition you can't just say this this function is continuous for everything it might be it might be continuous for all points but specifically rezoning on solutions around a particular point an initial condition so if our functions continuous around that point or more specifically around the open interval the x-value that gives us that point this says specifically around the x-value that's given us the point so if we have a function that's continuous around that x-value so here's the the big thing the only thing you really need to remember is your x value for whatever that point is cannot be an endpoint for the interval that you're continuous on it cannot be an endpoint no endpoints are allowed continuity is an open idea continuity says you need a little bit ahead and a little bit behind whatever point you're checking so whatever x value that gives you that point you look at that x value and you say is that at an endpoint of where my continuity starts or ends if it is you're not continuous there if it is that's failing this okay that's not okay so if our functions continuous around that point an open interval so a is not an endpoint of continuity then at least one solution exists on that open interval that's cooled so we know that we have existence now I didn't say anything about being unique it said that if your function is continuous around the point so open interval a or whatever this value is is not on an endpoint of continuity that's the only thing you really need to remember here then you have at least one solution if f of X Y so if our function is not continuous for open interval so either you have that that point so x equals a might be like creating zero on the denominator of fraction or negative inside of the square root or at an endpoint of continuity I'll show you some in just a minute then a solution is not guaranteed to the differential equation at that point remember early remember that we can have a differential equation with lots of solutions at lots other points but at this point doesn't have one that's what that's what we're saying so if your function is continuous around an open interval so that x equals a so a isn't a zero on a denominator it's not a negative inside of a longer than or zero and a longer that's not a negative square root and it's not at the endpoint of an interval of continuity then we can guarantee there's a solution but if it's not so if this function is not continuous for an open interval then we cannot guarantee a solution a differential equation at that point again no end points x equals a cannot at the endpoint of the interval of continuity that would be like this this functions all the way continuous a really good fantastic style continuous and then we get here oh crap well if that is the point that we are checking and we're saying does this differential equation have a solution through that point we would need to be continuous in an open interval around the x value that gives us that this remember open I didn't get there leave there if that's not the case then we cannot guarantee that a solution exists for that difference equation at that point we've failed to be continuous I'm sorry we failed to yea be continuous on an open interval at that point the endpoint fails us can't have an employment so that's that guarantees that we have at least one solution now that means that were in one of these two right where one of those two cases if we've simply satisfied that the second thing would be uniqueness now in order to do a uniqueness for a difference equation or solution to a differential equation through a point you need to be able to take a partial derivative if you're not familiar with that I've explained that in calculus 3 you can go it's not hard and I can explain here we're going through it but basically it just considered all the X's to be constants so if you had X Y and you take a derivative it would not be a product rule you would just take the derivative and treat X like 3 or something so it's not hard super easy if this is also continuous around that point so if the partial derivative of your function with respect to Y is also continuous around that point an open interval around the x value that gives that point then the solution to that differential equation around that point so in that neighborhood of that that x value that gives that point is unique one more time all the way through we're looking at the net points there's three cases we really want the last one to be the case that we're looking at so here's it has to happen but the function has to be continuous around that point you're checking it's got to be continuous in the neighborhood x equals a cannot be a point of discontinuity and it cannot be an endpoint of an interval continuity that's it it's all you really need that statement listen to that a couple times back guarantees the solution exists at least one for the solution to be unique you do the same check just with a partial derivative with respective line so you take the partial derivative with respect to Y just make sure that it's still continuous around that point so x equals a does not create a discontinuity for you and it's not at the endpoint of an interval of continuity and if those two things are met then you have one solution that's unique to that differential equation in the neighborhood at that point do your continuity that that's it that's that's it sounds a lot worse than it is the main things are that you got different equations at points check these check continuity check the continuity of the partial derivative just make sure that x equals a is not at an endpoint or isn't creating a discontinuity for you and you're good to go so we're gonna go through several examples they're all very very quick they're not hard things to do I'll show you that and then we'll move on let's get started some example shall we so again all we're doing here we're not solving we're not solving we're not so we don't any techniques for that yet what we're doing right now is is just checking to see whether is solutions even gonna exist to the differential differential equation at that point that's given so we're checking to see existence and if there's existence then we check to see if there the solution that exists is unique or not so let's try that so a differential equation dy/dx equals 2x squared y squared and we're checking to see whether that differential equation has a solution and whether the solutions UV at the point that's given by Y of 1 equals negative 1 first thing I always like to do I like to point out so X is 1 and Y is negative 1 that's important X value or Y value we'll talk about why that's important just a bit so the first thing we do just stitch and it's not that hard to check for just existence well we're gonna do is we're gonna look at just the function so the function of that we're looking at is this part on the right hand side so you solve your your difference equation for dy over DX and that right there is your function we want to make sure that that function is continuous at the point that we are checking or more specifically around the x-value that gives us the point that we're checking now if you remember about discontinuities you remember there's really only three places that we had got worried about for discontinuities they are denominators on so fractions that have variables on them or the denominator could equal zero we don't have any fractions or square roots fourth roots sixth roots even roots where we could have negatives inside we don't have any radicals or logarithms where you have a 0 or negatives you're having logarithms in fact that's that looks a lot like a polynomial sort of a derivative function and so we know what those are continuous everywhere there's not a value of X or Y that you can plug in there that's going to create a problem for you so that function is continuous everywhere since it is continuous everywhere it's gotta be continuous around x equals 1 remember we're always checking around the x value we're looking at that so hey is that is that continuous we can check the Y value tube with the ideas on the X so we check our point we're going hey is it continuous around that that point you could plug it in if you want it works just fine there's nothing wrong with this there's no discontinuities anywhere that's continuous everywhere specifically around our point that we're checking so that's continuous everywhere and that everywhere includes our point the neighborhood around that point then we've just shown we've proven that that differential equation is going to have at least one solution that goes through that point I hope that makes sense to you now we're going to check to see whether that solution is unique so we go further so this is part one part one said that's continuous around that point everywhere includes that point part two says now take the partial derivative of that function with respect to Y if we do that you need to get in the habit of partial derivatives pretty pretty quick when it treats all X variables as constants so you're not taking a derivative of that there's no product rule here don't worry about that all we're doing is saying hey just pretend that's a constant move that two in front so we'd be multiplying it 4x squared Y so just take the derivative of the Y component here and match it again through the product and we do the same exact thing it does that have square root as well no does it have fractions no no variables on the denominator does it have logarithms no it's continuous everywhere so those two things combined the first one says this functions continuous and the neighborhood that point that means that we have a solution that it would at least we have one solution to that difference of equation through that point this says furthermore now that our partial derivative of F with respect to Y is also continuous this is continuous from this point this is also continuous from this point not only does a solution exist that's one what the solution is unique that's two so these two parts together say that that differential equation has one unique solution in the neighborhood of that point one unique solution to that differential equation in the neighborhood at that point let's keep on going so no tooth we now have differential equation equal dy/dx equals x times ln y the first student we're going to do or going to look at the point our point is 1 comma 1 so x equals 1 y equals 1 we're going to make sure that when we check continuity we're continuous around that point even if other discontinuities exist i don't care i'm care that we're continuous in the neighborhood an open interval around that point so our function i always write out the function our function is x ln y and when we think about that we think that well that's continuous everywhere for x there's not problem with our X's but our Y's have to be positive here you can't have a logarithm with zero or negative so all right this is going to be continuous as long as our Y's are positive no zeros no negatives look at our point there's two things we check for two things you check for number one is our is our x value okay yeah X's there's no problem edges though is our Y value okay what I mean by that is is it falling inside the open interval here what that means is it couldn't have been an endpoint so 0 would have been a problem but is this Y value in this interval of continuity yeah sure the open interval of 0 to infinity 1 falls in there so two things we check for does our X work yes those are Y fall in the open interval of continuity it's business continuous for y is greater than 0 yeah that falls in that open interval that's awesome that's what we want so this statement right here says that we have at least one solution to this differential equation in the neighborhood of that point now we check the part derivative partial derivatives leave X's alone treat them as constant and takes a derivative of the function of one derivative Ln Y is 1 over Y so let's think about where this is continuous this is continuous for any X X is not a problem here but Y we just need to know that Y can't be 0 so this is continuous for y doesn't equal 0 so all this really comes down to is look at your function look at where it's continuous what problems you have make sure your point is literally inside that not an endpoint inside the interval continuity that guarantees existence now take the partial derivative do the same exact thing look at where this is continuous this is continuous for anything where we don't have 0 y is not 0 so we've fallen this interval of continuity as well so this continuity says existence this continuity says the existence is also unique so there's one unique solution here as well I hope you're picking that up that's important it's important to understand that when we're checking this all our chickens come Duty you just need to make sure that the point you're checking which it makes sense with why we're checking points you can't just say continuous everywhere all the time when this is not continuous everywhere this is not continuous everywhere which is why we look for specific points to say whether a differential equation has a solution or not it's based on continuity around that point so we look at continuity we just make sure that our X values and our Y values for those points don't cause any problems they're not they're not in the areas of discontinuity and they're not at the endpoints for continuity if there's one thing I can stress no endpoints allowed that's not ok so do the next two so you're going to get the habit of doing this really quickly you go okay our function XY is a cube root of Y cube roots of Y are continuous everywhere zero is not a problem negatives are not a problem positives are not a problem so that's continuous everywhere the point we're checking is x equals zero y -1 there's not even an x value I can't even plug in X's that's fine don't worry about it this is if this is continuous everywhere then we're clearly continuous in the neighborhood at that point that's great what this says is that this guarantees that we are going to have a solution lots of weird curly even when we take the partial derivative there's only wise up there so we'd have Y to the 1/3 power if we do the derivative of that we get one over three Y to the 2/3 power well that's continuous everywhere ever let's continuous everywhere except where y equals zero so now look at our point X was zero I don't care about the extras not even X's up here is a continuous in the interval of y equals 1 or around y equals 1 yes 1 is not equal to 0 there's an open interval that surrounds 1 for which we continuous so we're not going all the way to 0 like you can think but it's open for just past 0 continuous from 0 to infinity absolutely it's also continuous or negative infinity to 0 the only place it's not continuous is when y equals 0 so if this falls in these open intervals you're good together as long as we are not at an endpoint that means that we're satisfying the second Artemis so this was continuous everywhere but that falls in everywhere this is continuous for why doesn't equal zero this is why doesn't equal zero as long as our point falls in that interval we are rock solid so not only does a solution exist it's also unique so we have one unique solution now this is the same exact problem obviously but we have a different point I want to I want you to see how this works so first part would be exactly the same we still have the same exact function of x and y it's a cube root of Y we still have the point over here but it's a different point at 0 0 this is still continuous everywhere no matter where there were zero or not it doesn't matter this is continuous paper what that does that says that this differential equation has at least one solution through that point you need to get that a solution does exist now we check uniqueness obviously the same thing and obviously same continuity this function is only continuous on this open interval it is not continuous at y equals zero so it's that's an interval of discontinuity so we already know that a solution exists but when we check in the neighborhood of this point well let's check to see whether that solution is unique you know there's at least one let's see if it's a unique we plug in zero zero or we look at the continuity or we consider this this interval around zero zero like oh well no that zero would be an endpoint we cannot be continuous at influence or another way to consider it is that zero right there that zero for y literally causes a discontinuity if you have a value that's causing a discontinuity you're obviously not continuous there so this fails uniqueness so we have and we it feels unique is we have more than one solution so we have at least one solution here but it's not necessarily we can't guarantee uniqueness [Music] so we're checking look at the function seeing whether we're continuous around that point if we are awesome at least one solution if we if we take the partial derivative and we're still continuous around that point then that solution is unique let's try the next one so where the world is that continuous it's think about that there's one that you really should focus in on it's this one because this will throw you for a loop if you're not paying attention so where are square roots okay where are square roots continuous well they're continuous as long as the inside is not negative so as long as inside zero or more I'm gonna make a mistake here on purpose I want you to watch very carefully there's the mistake that's a mistake right there the insides got to be positive we know how to do domain right we know that square roots have to have a radicand the inside part that's always positive we know it's got to be greater than or equal to zero but for continuity to happen you can't have the equals part equals always means a bracket it means closed so don't be closed-minded man just be open-minded all right so we can't have that was the board so when we have this we think the insides gonna be positive but it's continuous on the open interval where Y minus sorry X minus y it's got to be strictly greater than zero if we allow it to be equal that's literally the endpoint we cannot allow endpoints getting negative five six thousand times we can't allow influence go a little further that means X has to be greater than Y add Y to both sides so we need a point where X is literally greater than Y look at your point now our point is 2 point 2 is X greater than Y no if we allow the equals to say well what about zero that's fine as soon as you do that you now have an end point of continuity and that is breaking the law for continuity you cannot have that so because this two this two two because that crew that is the end point of our continuity that doesn't even go together you can't have any points for continuity so because that's where this function even starts to work it's an endpoint you cannot allow that so when we say this is continuous for X minus y is greater than zero or dis including that endpoint then X would have to be greater than Y does your point fit back does your point fit in your continuity answer's no the X is equal to Y the X is not greater than Y therefore we cannot guarantee existence if we can't guarantee the existence we certainly can't guarantee uniqueness and you can see that if you really want to so if we do the the partial derivative we're gonna run into the same exact situation so if we look at this we have a one half target chain rule going on here so one half inside to the negative one half times the derivative of the inside well the derivative of this with respect to Y that's a constant I'm good as zero times negative 1 that's the same situation we can't even allow zeros here at all but this would say this is only continuous where X is greater than Y that would be the interval of continuity not don't get a confuse an interval of where it exists your domain this would exist for the point at the point - - it is the the function would exist there at - - but not continuous there why would you check a point if it didn't even exist and they sense so obviously this point exists on this function you would just get zero you have an input of 2 - you have zero fine but when we check for continuity we're not continuous on that entire interval we're continuous on the open interval not the closed interval you must not include two importance so we can't guarantee existence we also can't guarantee that that's unique that makes sense because we don't even know there is a solution now let's try the next one so maybe you can try this if you haven't already give that a try positive video see if you can do that same exact thing same exact continuity but now we look back at a point we think that the point 2 1 that's your x value that's your Y value does that point fit in continuity so all of this stuff comes down to check the continuity to define the continuity it must be open no equal signs gotta have open intervals here you can have to be open and then check to see if that point is on your open interval if it is good just make sure that it fits your continuity so we know this is continuous for X is greater than Y not exists yes that exists when x equals y but continuous for the open interval of X just slightly bigger than Y if X is bigger than Y that's fitting our model for continuity and that's guaranteeing that this particular differential equation has a solution at least one solution in the neighborhood of that point look at the comparison here we mentioned earlier but this is the first time we really see it we can have the same exact differential equation one of which is guaranteed to have a solution at a point and one of which is it is not at a different point so that's why we always consider solutions to differential equations at points where that existence and we were talking about uniqueness so let's see if this is unique using the same thing here well if this is continuous around our point that we know there are solutions unique and when we look at it we say well this has to this is continuous where X is written white and same exact thing we can't even allowed like equals for existence here we literally meet because we have to zero in the denominator that would be a problem so we literally need X to be greater than Y X is greater than Y so we have one unique solution I'm going to put three more on the board in just a moment and I would suggest you try them on your own if you can the idea is check the original just make sure that whatever you've defined for your continuity first that's accurate and second that your point fits it secondly take into a partial derivative and do exactly the same thing don't include endpoints if your point you're checking is at an end point of continuity that is not too long you cannot have an end point for continuity so let me go do those three other problems and then we'll call it good so I'm giving you three more island after I show you what to do on the first thing I would really recommend you try all three on your own if you can there's one thing these look a little weird to you if they do look weird remember that when we're checking our continuity you have to have it over the form dy over DX equals some function XY so these two don't fit so when you get something like that the first thing I'd like you to do just divide both sides by water get rid of that Y so that's multiplied you'd have to have dy over DX equals x minus 1 divided by the line that's the function you should check and then you'll you'll be a lot easier so yeah that's kind of discontinuous at y equals zero whatever same thing would happen here so I would highly recommend you pause the video give these three of trying to the best you can to do two things find the function like we've done see where it's discontinuous and where it is continuous and see if the point satisfies that you must not have endpoints this must not create an any point for your continuity they can't do that then you take a partial derivative and do exactly the same thing so I'm gonna get going on it but you should pause the video and try to begin so for us we've already determined that that's the differential equation we are checking to see whether that has a solution at that particular point so I always make sure I'm setting up the problem correctly dy over DX equals some function x and y I'm also always writing down my point the point is zero one so I'm going to check to see where this is continuous this is continuous for any x value X is not a problem you're plugging anything you'll be fine but the Y is a problem Y cannot be 0 if it helps you to see the open interval actually write out the open interval so we write out negative infinity to 0 and then again from 0 to infinity as long as this Y value so X is good any X's so we could also write to UM need a little lazy we could write down continuous for any X so X would be all real numbers and continuous for why that doesn't equal 0 here's your interval for that so all we're checking is is this somewhere in this open interval it certainly is so this guarantees that this differential equation has at least one solution around that point then we take the partial derivative of F with respect to Y well what that gives us is this is you can do it several different ways but this would be like X minus 1 times y to the negative 1 power you want to take the derivative that this actually constantly three or something we'd have negative let's call it three y to the negative two so that would give us negative x plus one over Y square that's what that would give us and now we take continuity for this as well well nothing's really changed has it X can be all real numbers so this is continuous for all X values it's continuous for y as long as Y is not zero and you can do exactly the same interval in either case we see that yeah it's insane check continuity so this function is continuous around that point this partial derivative is also continuous around that point so this is guaranteed us uniqueness for msre existence and uniqueness so this is one there will exist one unique solution to that differential equation around that point because we check continuity for role of the function and the parts of it are you kidding that I hope you're getting this the second one let's look at how it changes same exact thing we would solve for our dy over DX we know that our partial derivative would be exactly the same as what we just had and now we're checking our point not zero one but one zero well when you check that if you see it automatically this is continuous for y does not equal zero if y equals zero you can show a problem that Y is causing the discontinuity you're done so this does not guarantee us that the solution exists same thing happens here this can't be continuous if Y is zero our Y is zero and say it's not continuous so we've failed continuity in both the existence and the uniqueness so we can't guarantee existence and we certainly can't guarantee is just uniqueness I hope that's that's making sense as well last one fairly straightforward we have our differential equation we've got our point zero zero all that it takes us to do is check our function now 1 plus y squared you can't have a zero in the logarithm you also can have negatives but one plus y squared can't ever equal zero and it can't ever equal a negative so this is continuous everywhere continuous everywhere it includes the point that we're checking now the partial partial derivative well a logarithm says you do one over the inside times the derivative of the inside by the chain rule the derivative of the inside is 2y 1 goes to 0 y squared goes to Y so our partial derivative is that now because our 1 1 plus y squared can't ever equal zero we don't have any discontinuities here either you can't ever add one plus a positive and get zero doesn't make sense so this is continuous everywhere as well and for that reason it's continuous around that point rather neighborhood at that point so function itself continuous around the point partial derivative continues another point again we get one unique solution I hope that makes sense I hope now that we fleshed out the idea it's not that big of a deal to you we're really just checking continuity around the point that you're given taking partial derivative do the same thing if you have both then you have existence and uniqueness if you have existence it doesn't guarantee uniqueness you get a check the partial as well okay that that's about it now next video we started getting on into how to solve differential equations you 

Transcript for: Separable Differential Equations (Differential Equations 12)
exciting times exciting times we finally get to learn our first technique on how to solve some differential equations and it's gonna be awesome so when we deal with differential equations we have learned a lot about what they're about we've learned about slope fields on kind of how to solve them at least an approximation we've learned a lot of things about differential equations but we haven't learned really how to solve them the only thing we really know is that if we have some very basic differential equations an integral can undo a derivative and so an integral can solve some very basic differential equations for us no problem now we're going to learn about this technique that is it's the most fundamental it's the one that you try to use as often as possible because it's the most straightforward so there's lots of techniques on how to solve differential equations for ordinary differential equation first-order differential equations like we're dealing with so there's things like separable differential equations that we're going to talk about today there's homogeneous differential equations there are Bernoulli if you can make a Bernoulli substitution there's a substitution technique for differential equations there there's some other ones as well that we'll explore so my point is that we're gonna get in in the next several videos on lots of different techniques and at the very end I'm gonna wrap up and say hey here's how you should approach these differential equations here's what you should be looking for maybe maybe try this first technique and then after that see if you can make it to this and then see if you can make it to this and I'll give you a list of a thought process on how we would go about it the first one that we should try like all the time if we can and it's it's pretty easy to see when we can use it and when we can't is if we have a form of a different equation that is separable where we could separate the variables and the first about five minutes of this video I'm gonna explain exactly what we're doing why it works and what we're looking for so we need to remember that integrals can solve differential equations because a differential equation is basically this equation with the derivative in it and if I can get it in a proper form I can just integrate both sides and find my parent function or the the anti-derivative so that's what the integrals do is they find that so we can do that so here's our idea if we can if we can write our difference of equation where we can group all of our let's call it Y stuff all of our functions with Y in it and the dy on one side and all of our junk with constants and X's and the DX on the other side so you're wait wait a minute I thought we had dy DX we do but those differentials we can put this in what's called differential form and well similar to differential form we can split up that dy M DX we can treat it like the fraction that it is it comes from that if you remember it like back in way a long time ago in calc one I have a video on actually where we talk about how you can really sort of separate that dy DX because of how it's created when we first create the derivative we we put a dy and DX together and we can actually pull it apart and it works for us mathematically and that's pretty awesome I will show you another way to think about it if you really need to that's okay too so I'll show you two ways to approach this but the plan is if we know integrals under derivatives let's try to put all of our Y stuff and dy on one side X stuff and DX on the other side and then when we integrate we'll integrate one side hey we got a dy oh my gosh that matches up an integral with all the life stuff and then we have another integral with DX oh and that matches up with all the X stuff and we can just take two integrals and then if possible we can solve for y explicitly and that's what we're talking about here group your life stuff and dy on one side group your X stuff and DX on the other side and then integrate both sides what we do to one side in an equation we've got to do to the other so that's why we're integrating both sides the reason why we have y's and dy on one side is so that when you integrate dy your variables match up we have X's and DX that way when you integrate the other side your variables match up that's the plan this works for any sort of differential equation where you can solve for the dy/dx and then this thing is a product what Wyatt Wyatt product well if we want to separate our variables and have the ability to do an integral we need the X's and Y's to somehow be multiplied together that way we can easily divide or multiply or move our our X parts and our Y parts are factors to one side of the other and separate if we have stuff added and subtracted we either have to be able to factor that which we're going to get in our second or less problem which we have a factor that to create this product or we have to have some other technique like linear there's linear differential equations it's another technique we're gonna use figure out how to have solved linear differential equations so a little bit of a recap I said about five minutes I don't know if I've made it that long but the idea is we've got differential equations if you can write it as dy/dx your derivative equal to a function XY where your stuff is multiplied then we can separate multiplied or divided then we can separate our variables we put our Y's on one side with dy our X's on the other side with DX we integrate and we try to solve for y so a couple notes one thing is we're going to really help you keep all of your I'm gonna call them constants they're really coefficients because we're multiplying so keep your coefficients your constants all of that stuff the numbers keep it on your next side the y side it gets a lot more difficult to solve if you've moved your constant coefficients to your Y side so keep your constants on your x ID we're trying to solve for y so that that would save us some work if we keep our constants on our x side secondly if you can when you do your integrals you're going to have a Y function somewhere you're gonna have an X function somewhere try to solve for that Y explicitly sometimes it's not possible a lot of times it is with separable equations so we're gonna I'm going to show you that we are going to do just an absolute job of examples here but I think like twelve example eleven twelve examples if you are getting the point after the first two and you want to just go and try stuff that's fine of what I'm trying to do here is for the yoo-hoo man it's been a while since you take Cal - or even count three and you're like I don't remember how to do partial fractions whatever look like I don't remember how to use integration cable or trig sub or substitutions even or integration by parts I don't think we have one of those but if you're not if you're not familiar with that stuff that's okay that that's what this is for okay I'm gonna do like eleven examples to make sure that our integrals our integration techniques are still there if you're fine with that man skip through a few that's okay I mean I don't care if you watch the whole video or not I want you to learn it so the basis of separable differential equations our very first technique is if you have a product can write it as a product factor it so that's a product get your wife stepped on one side with dy next up another and integrate that's it I'm going to show you a couple of them I want you to hang on for the first two and then if it's making sense cool if it is making sense to you and you don't need any more skip to the last example please in this video and at least watch these singular solutions though very less one talks about a singular solution and you need to you need to understand that this technique while awesome sometimes doesn't give us these things called singular solutions a solution that doesn't show up by just integrating so check that out so let's give it a try let's see how this stuff works so we're gonna do two that look very very similar they're slightly different and the point is that that slight difference causes us to get a nearly completely different type of a solution here so let's look at this first differential equation we have a derivative and rather badly meant that doesn't doesn't look like that let's make it look like that so sometimes in our differential equations we have to do some work just to make it fit our model of being able to separator variables this model of I want a derivative that's equal to a product a product of some X stuff and a function of x times some Y step a function of Y well I'm going to look at it like that there's a function of X negative 2x and there's a function of Y just Y so we are going to move our variables what we're gonna do because we have a dy on the numerator of this this fraction here this dy DX and DX on the denominator we are going to want to move our Y variables to the left hand side of our equation by multiplication or division obviously we're going to have a product over here so it's going to have to be multiplication or division to move our stuff and we're gonna move this DX to the right hand side might seem a little weird but we have done this since calc 1 it's it's rare that we do but you can separate that fraction so if we divide both sides by Y I'm gonna be getting 1 over Y dy DX equals negative 2x notice how I'm fine I'm moving my wife share of room in my Y my dy I'm keeping my constants my coefficient it really is what that is constant factors on the right hand side on my excited now one last thing we're gonna do before we integrate that DX needs to be on your x side so if we do that multiply both sides by DX this gives us something that we can integrate on both sides so that Mel and the fundamental ideas of solving equations is you can do a homestay that you want as long as you do it to both sides so if we say well I want to perform operation while we've never performed operations on equations and on both sides shouldn't do you do a logarithm on both sides you take both sides as an exponent like Exponential's we do lots of operations on both sides and integrals is an even derivatives with implicit differentiation you take derivatives on both sides integrals is another one that we can do this operation on both sides so if we integrate on both sides we have this idea of I'm integrating 1 over Y dy oh my gosh the variables match up that's awesome that's a very easy integral on the right hand side integral of negative 2 X DX that's an even easier integral then the variables match up so I told you that I would show you this I'm sure this one that if you don't like this here's kind of the root of this this idea - you can think of it this way it's a little weird but if you kept it like this some people don't like the idea that you are integrating with respect to two different things here they well this is why that's that's X so you're not really doing the same thing if you think about it this way well what if I integrated one side of the X and integrated the other side DX these DX's actually do cancel out from the root of where they came from on the the definition what a derivative is we have those like like Delta X in a limit so where that comes from you can actually remove my shown in a video in calc 1 but that's that's possible so if you want to think about it that way like hey you are integrating with respect to X on both sides it's just that this X and X go away and you have the dy so you integrate with respect to Y think about it that way if you want to I don't care the point is that both these this actually does work we can separate the dy DX and integrate both sides and mathematically that's a nice tool for us to be able to rely on so let's use it if we integrate and again most of this this video is about integration techniques the idea of really basic move your wise move tricks it is dy/dx group them and then then integrate so we need to remember that things like the integral of 1 over Y dy is natural log absolute value of y on the right hand side and when we integrate this negative 2x you can pull your negative 2 out as a consonant so a coefficient can move out in front and we integrate or you think about just the negative if you want to this should be negative x squared so when we integrate that we get this negative x squared if you want to do the derivative real quick but you know - its tipping negative 2x that's great importantly like really important you're always going to get a plus C now it should be in your head right now it will wait a minute I'm doing an integral on both sides when I get a plus C on both sides the answer is yeah you could make that argument but because you get a constant on both sides it's plus C on both sides you could you could add or subtract one of them to the other and you get this other arbitrary constant so we really only need it on one side we choose the X side because we're trying to solve for y I hope that makes sense so make it fit separable equations if you can separable differential equations separating the variables so make it look like a product get your X's on one side with a DX I waited to the motek get your X's on one side with a DX your Y's on the other side with a dy integrate both sides and try to solve for y you only need one plus C because if you had two plus C's like minus 2 and plus 3 you could group them on one side you could just add or subtract one constant to the other and remember we're talking arbitrary constants so it doesn't matter what it is is creating this general solution for you remember general solutions the general solution is this family of curves that has an arbitrary constant in it but says you could plug in any number and it would still work so it doesn't matter that we have a plus seat here in here we would just subtract or add an arbitrary constant and group it on one side now I'm gonna be so weird I'm gonna call this C sub 1 because what's going to happen is in our process of solving for y we're going to start and multiplying that number whatever that is time times other numbers and we're going to take it as an exponent on e in just a little bit because we've got a natural log so I'm gonna call it C sub 1 for a little bit and this is a man I don't remember when it was I think it was calculus 2 that we started talking about this one the first few videos there's a section on simple simple differential equations separation of variables idea where we have an arbitrary constant now that constant when you multiply it by another number like a factor it's still a constant and if you take it to an exponent on e it's still a constant so we're gonna allow that to happen at the very end we're gonna say hey this thing right here that looks really nasty that's just a constant so we're gonna leave that for just a bit as we work through our examples it's gonna happen like every example we do and then the end we're gonna say this thing that's got the c1 in it that's still a constant we're gonna call it the arbitrary constant I hope that makes sense just just watch out for it so let's go through the process of solving this for y we need to solve explicitly if we can and we can so what I'm doesn't actually work with them well we're gonna we're gonna take e on not matagi but like we're gonna put an e on both sides and treat both of these as an exponent so Ln absolute value y equals negative x squared plus C we know that the exponential that is the inverse of this is e so you can show it this way you really don't need to go all that in-depth and show that you can just say man yeah Y absolute value of y is going to equal e to the other side so raise both sides to the exponent as an exponent on e these are a composition of inverse functions they're always going to cancel out that's going to leave you absolute value why most people don't even write this most people go directly from here to here that's what most people do think of it yeah this is a base of e e to the other side equals argument and that's how this these logarithms work now I was mentioning to you a little bit before that we're gonna have C sub 1 as an exponent on something else and then we're gonna have it multiplied by another number or another positive or negative and so here's that here's how that works if you want to solve for y you need to get rid absolute value and this doesn't look all so good over here so here's some ideas that commonly come up in solving for y explicitly a lot of times if you have e to an exponent where there's a plus or minus do you remember that when you have a plus or a minus in your exponent it came from common basis being multiplied if you have common bases being multiplied what you do with exponents is always one operational level below what you see so if you see multiplication that involves exponents what you do with your excellence is once it wants one below multiplication addition what's one below division subtraction so when we see that what we're gonna do is imagine that if we have addition in our exponents we could actually write this and this common bases it's going it's going backwards if you had common bases you add exponents if we have adding exponents we have common bases that are multiplied together so that's what's going on notice how we have either 2 C 1 e to the c1 Latian gentleman it's still a constant if you take e to that C whatever it is any number in the world its Billy because the domain is anything you're still gonna get a constant out of it now the idea of absolute value this also happens a lot let's move this around for justice idea the idea of absolute value do you remember the definition the definition of an absolute value says you get X if X is positive and maybe x is negative x if X is negative that way we always get a positive out of it if that's a negative number you say well I multiply my negative it's good and I'll be in positive it's not absolute value works what that means is that whatever we have here we can always change this to absolutely the absolute value of y equals plus or minus whatever Y is so that's that's something we can only doing that absolute value kind of nice if that happened to be positive we keep the positive have to be negative we keep a negative and a negative times negative would give us the positive why we're doing all this and why we call that C sub one because if you're stealing any but who cares because about that right now I want you to think about that because you have this number e 2.7 something blah blah blah forever natural number you're gonna raise that to a constant you this is still a constant right here and it's based on whatever that is in fact you could get back the first constant by plugging something else in but you're also gonna have either positive or negative the point is this whole expression is still a constant doesn't matter what it is you know it's an arbitrary constant whatever that is the derivative of that is going to satisfy our original differential equation remember what we're trying to do we kind of get lost and some of this or start crunching numbers you're not really thinking about what we're doing if we're to find any function so that when you take a derivative of it it's going to satisfy this which is really cool and any arbitrary constant is going to work we're creating a general solution here we don't have an initial value so we can't find a particular solution that's going to come later in another video next video I'll talk about particular solutions so what we do what we often do and we don't even really identify it sometimes we should every time is we say let's let it see this arbitrary constant equal that constant there and when we solve for awhile that that's why a lot of times on your homework when you're going through it or your practice you know ma'am my answer doesn't look anything like what they're doing it's it might be if you're not making a fundamental sake integral mistake sign errors like that it might be that they're moving around they're calm and adjusting for it and taking that whole garbage out at the end and saying that's still a constant let's call it a constant so that's the reason why we write the C sub one so that later on when we do multiply it when you do take it as an exponent we do it with the plus or minus in front of the positive in front of it we can call the whole thing a constant at the end I wish I could ask if that makes sense but I hope that it does this is salt explicitly for why this is the general solution to that difference of equation that's pretty cool we had our first date made the next one's really really similar I'm not going to show you a lot of like the options basically most most everybody does it this this way we separate the Y dy the X is DX and we integrate we take that but that's okay so let's give it a try of course we need to write this in this form if we can at all possible man separable equations are really nice and separate our variables out let's write this as a product of function of X and a function of y equal to our derivative or first derivative if at all possible that allows us to move things these these factors by multiplication division so we're going to group are wise and dy on one side our X's and the X's on other most of the time we don't show a lot of work between there we understand that yeah you're dividing both sides by Y square that's going to give you 1 over Y squared MFD why we're keeping our constants and our X's on one side and multiplying by DX then that allows us to take an integral on both sides which is really cool idea and look at the difference look what that Y squared does for us instead of having 1 over Y and yielding this Ln of absolute lie that the absolute value of y that's not what's happening we really have an integral of why to the negative 2 power dy so we have a completely different answer we're not going to have an e to anything on this on the right hand side sure we got the same exact stuff going on so remember on the right hand side that's where our constants are gonna lie that's where a + C is going to lie which is an arbitrary constant we're gonna have this negative x squared plus c1 I'm gonna write the plus c1 just in case I've multiplied by any other number this in case I take you to an exponent this can be a little bit more easy to it for us to show that we're changing or changing that to another constant if we don't have to move to change it we're just gonna race the +1 and call it the arbitrary constant on the left hand side we've got why don't they into so do you remember those we we add 1 to the exponent divided by the new exponent so add 1/2 the negative 1 or we can think of this as negative 1 over Y let's multiply by negative thank you this is positive y equals positive x squared minus c1 so right now if you're if you did this problem on your own and you checked I don't know if this came out of a book or not but if you checked in the back of your book they said well they have they have x squared I'm sorry I made a mistake it's thinking about the next thing it was saying 1 over Y they've got x squared plus C you know what maybe they defined C as equal to negative C 1 and that would change that sign if it's barber trade doesn't doesn't matter so that that's not a big sticking point the point is that can you get down to 1 over y equals x squared minus C 1 or plus C a different constant can be the same thing well that's great if you can now we're almost done if we have 1 over y equals x squared minus C 1 then y equals the reciprocal of that so we can you can think of it as multiplying both sides by Y and divided by X square - e1 taking reciprocal and as I was saying just before that right there that is a solution that's a general solution we can either erase the c1 and just take this as y equals 1 over x squared minus C or if you want to keep the C one you can redefine it let's see what Megan if C 1 then you could write this as x squared plus C is it a big deal no it's not even a big deal not to me at least it's still the function that has an arbitrary consonants in the correct form we've solved it explicitly and this function is a general solution why general well it has a plus C in it still so this is a family of curves an infinite number of functions that when you take a derivative a first derivative of it it will satisfy our differential equation with that other stuff in it which is really awesome that's pretty cool we can do that now from scratch if you wanted to look back at the first few videos there were some problems that we could have solved this way there were some some basic basic problems that we could have solved with separable equations so we're going to do a whole lot more if this is making sense to you right now like I really it is try some and if you if you're not familiar on some of the integration techniques then check back in the video again though skip to the last problem where we talk about singular solutions so I'm gonna race this I'm gonna come back in just a minute with some more examples let's give these a try the first one remember what we're trying to do with separable equations here separable differential equations we're trying to see if the function fits the model of could you write it as a dy/dx equals a function of x times a function of y sometimes they're written like that that looks great sometimes they're not but if you divided this you could write it so we're gonna get to that where we we were thinking that but we're not actually showing that particular step so the main idea is can you your why is dy X's the X that's the main idea whether you go through the actual process of writing dy/dx equals a function of x times a function of Y now I'm gonna move the 1 doesn't really matter the idea is can you write it like that if you can great do it that's your first goal first goal in differential equations is if you can get it that way here we can we've got dy/dx equals a function of Y times a function of X that's perfect because we know that we can divide and get the Y's on one side dy X's on the other side DX you're gonna get really used to the old one rule I think one of her why do white happens a lot you're gonna get a lot of element absolute value wise you're gonna get a lot of e to this side whatever integral is and then we're gonna get a lot of that plus or minus e to the c1 equals that see that happens quite a bit with some basic differential equations so we got this down we say all right we grouped our why do you.why we have our function of X DX let's integrate both sides that's great on the left hand side we know that integral this is element absolute value of y it looks pretty good we know what that loves be an example like that before integral of sine X let's remember what that is remember most of this lesson is just repeating some integration techniques and just getting it back in your head because if you can't do this then it doesn't matter that you understand separation of or separable equations here so on the right hand side see the derivative of cosine is negative sine so the integral of sine is negative cosine of X and I might want to just take a moment to just think that through the derivative of cosine gives us a negative sign so the derivative of cosine times negative 1 gives us positive sine X and that's pretty good I'm going to add my plus C I'm going to give it a little 1 because I expect this thing to be changing a little bit later so I've grouped them integrated both sides easy integral had think about this a little bit but we have our plus C only on the right hand side our X side now let's start solving for y explicitly sort our calculus is pretty much done all we have to do now is a little bit of algebra to see if we can solve for y we know that the base is e so e to the right hand side equals the argument that means Y at least absolute value y equals e to the negative cosine of X plus c1 and we go through this process a lot we know that absolute value of y is going to equal if we separate this I'm going to move my factors this is e to the C sub 1 times e to the negative cosine X we know that anytime exponents are added together they came from a product of common bases I just move the e to the C sub 1 first we also just explored what absolute value is absolute value takes a positive when the the expression is positive and a negative expression is negative which means we can write y equals positive or negative now the fact that's never going to be negative because we have this e to some power this might be a little redundant on some cases we can do it anyway this really matter as far as a long-run but sometimes e to e to anything is not going to give you this this negative so that we're going to redefine we're going to call that C so sometimes we show this off to the side and we say let's let this I would show that if I were you but sometimes that's not showing so if you're wondering where that garbage goes they're wrapping this whole thing up and calling it the arbitrary constant so that's our solution that's the general solution of that differential equation which is pretty nice let's try the next one so the next one doesn't really look like like what we it doesn't look like what we had before either where was added but can you imagine if I divide this over here you would get 4y over 1 plus X well since division is can be defined as multiplication and multiplication is division they're the same level of operation this acts like that form all we're really concerned about is can you get your wide on one side by dividing my wife can you get your X's on the other side with with your coefficients that are constant factors I divided by 1 over X with your DX by multiplying by a DX can you do that because if you can then you can integrate both sides if you can't then there will be another another technique for us so we divided by Y keep the dy divided by 1 plus X keep the 4 multiplied by DX and now we're looking great for integrals so left hand side again you're getting really familiar this Ln absolute value of y on the right hand side well we have 4 over 1 plus X now the 4 is a constant so we can pull that out and multiply by whatever the integral is going to be of 1 over 1 plus X so do you remember what the integral of 1 over 1 plus X is if you need a substitution you could do that it's a direct substitution there's not even a coefficient that comes out of that so we would have this whole integral of 1 over u du u another Ln of absolute value whatever that is so this whole side over here comes out 2 Ln absolute value of 1 plus X because they've won over it except off if you're not sure that's not making sense go through the derivative the derivative of natural log of being 1 over inside times the derivative of the inside but then we have that for it's the same thing as what we have right there and we're going to put that plus c1 so next thing just so we recall do you remember that with any coefficient in front of the natural log that acts as an exponent so before we touch this with with any sort of e to that power we're going to move this and create an exponent so let's keep on going now because we have a natural log of something that cannot possibly be negative but it's whatever whatever this is we're going to get that to the positive we don't even need that absolute value there so we're going to take this e to the left side to the right right hand side so absolute value y equals 1 plus X to the fourth power plus C sub 1 and E is 2 all that stuff that wrote that a little funny to rewrite that so e to the other side equals our argument of natural and natural logarithm so that's kind of nice now let's do the same same thing we did before let's do absolute value of y equals e to the C sub 1 times e to the 1 plus X to the fourth power you know what I'm in a mistake I hope you saw the mistake I kind of went a little too quick here maybe we're only good but I forgot something here and I really need to see when we do this this whole removing the longer than by using of exponential I forgot about that Ln so that's true but then when we separate this when we have the absolute value of y equals e to the C sub 1 times e to the Ln 1 plus X to the fourth power well now you have a composition of inverse functions these things are going to be completely gone so we have the absolute value of y we have the e to the C sub 1 but because you had 80 to the Ln of an argument right there we've got this 1 plus X to the 4th power that can't be negative so we're whatever that absolute value would be we're taking the 4th power can be negative this plus or minus can be wrapped up in the needs in the c1 and now we can call that whole argument that's our general solution of that differential equation sorry about that I completely forgot the ln hopefully you don't do the same mistake so walking back through sometimes they don't look like what we want them to look like as far as these separable equations but we can always see if we can do it let's move our X's to one side keep our concept why is it low side and then keep our dy over DX integrate and then start moving these these coefficients if you can for Ln so we move that up we recognize that hey there's two L ends they should both disappear when I'm doing an exponential with them so absolute value y equals e to this sure we have a c1 let's separate that out e to the C sub 1 times e to the that's where it elements go away so this whole thing disappears we have a composition of inverse functions we'd have 1 plus X to the fourth power we're gonna take away our absolute value if I call that positive or negative and map gives our general solution with an arbitrary constant C so the next one works very similar if you haven't done so already pause the video see if you can just write it in the right form if you get stuck on integration that's what this video is for is practicing integrals but see if you can do that so we have X's here we got a dy/dx viy factors over here we need to move this to the left this to the right and our da test all the way so we divide both sides by the square root of 1 over Y squared 1 minus y squared and we keep our dy and we divide both sides by 2 squared of X and we multiply by DX so we've divided both sides by square root of 1 minus y squared cap dirty water we've divided by two square of X we've moved our BX now we're ready to integrate hopefully you got the same thing or at least thought about it and said yes that makes sense to me let's look at that one I want to do that that's easier it's stupid right the insight so on the right hand side we've got an integral of 1/2 X to the negative 1/2 we can do all of our integrals with exponents of sang exactly we add 1 to the exponent and divide by the new exponent 1/2 and whatever gone plus C sub 1 so that would give us just this square root of x let's see some one we've added one to our exponent what happened / new exponent why not we already had a 1/2 it gone and now we just have square X plus c1 on the left hand side there there's two ways that you should approach this number one way if you're allowed to or if you remember it or if you have it or you used it before man your table of integrals that's why they're in most every differential equation textbook because of the back or the front you go yeah you're gonna use this a lot so these are things that are very common that when they come up here's what our answer is that's that's fine this this class shouldn't just be a repeat of calculus to where you learn all your integration techniques I'm showing it to you as a courtesy and thank goodness that we have lots of time you're my class so you are my students I'm gonna I'm taking the extra time to make sure you know it if you if you don't if you do know it right use your table integration if you don't and you prefer me to forget it or you're not allowed to for some odd reason do tricks up you can do it tweak so on on this and either case you get sine inverse you know maybe you've memorized that so we get this whole sine inverse of Y and dropping that down sine inverse of y equals the square root of x plus c1 remember that with inverse trig functions if sine inverse of y equals something that y equals sine of that something I'm gonna drop the c1 we don't have to change that that constant at all that's an arbitrary constant and that is a general solution to a differential equation so we're always trying to group XS the X's on one side for you on this side why is dy is on the other side integrating both sides and then doing our very best to do two things number one don't forget a bunch of constant always plus C making sure that we if we can simplify that so it looks nicer as a maybe larger or different form of an arbitrary constant and solving for y explicitly we have several more examples I hope this is making sense to you if it's if it's not if you're not quite getting it our integrals it might be time to go back and watch some count two videos about how integration works I'm trying my best to explain it quickly but we're also looking at the form of differential equations here we've got a few more on the board let's go through them make sure that we're understanding what's going on again there's some techniques here that you might have forgotten about integration so first one this this is really close to fitting our form we see a product on one hand side on one side of the right hand side we got our derivative on the other side but it's all wrapping that one third power so sometimes all it is is a matter of distributing that exponent across multiplication division that's fine we know that exponent rules work one lovable level we have so you can distribute exponents across multiplication and division but not two levels down not addition subtraction so we're gonna take the cube root or the 1/3 power of 64 not bad that's 4 we're also going to have X to the 1/3 power and Y to the 1/3 power and now we see that yeah that's that's a that's some factors that are by together we can move our why we can keep our coefficient of four and we can keep our X and move our DX let's go ahead let's write it as something that we can integrate so one over Y to the 1/3 power looks pretty good we're going to keep our dy right hand side we're going to keep our 4 we're gonna keep our X to the 1/3 and we're gonna have our DX we just multiply on both sides to get that now we're able to integrate so let's try it on the right hand side that's pretty nice our coefficient of horse stays remember with our exponents we add 1 and divide by our new exponent and we're gonna have a plus C we're gonna call plus C one sort of expecting that we're gonna change that later on the left-hand side well this is the integral of Y to the negative 1/3 DUI so Y to the let's add one that's positive 2/3 divided by 2/3 on the right hand side our fours are gone so we and we can move our 3 to our numerators so we're gonna get three X to the 4/3 plus c1 now a couple options you can move this first and just get three halves Y and divide everything by two thirds or well multiply everything by two-thirds or you can multiply by two-thirds now so either one of those is it's absolutely fine so if we do that we multiply by two-thirds then we're going to get just Y to the 2/3 on the right-hand side when we distribute that our threes are gone we're gonna get 2x to the 4/3 plus 2/3 c1 we're gonna wrap all of this stuff up and we're going to say let's just let that become our arbitrary constant that way it's a little bit cleaner so if we have Y to the 2/3 then essentially we can raise both sides to the 3 halves power so if we do that raise both sides to the 3 halves power exponents raise two exponents multiply one level below exponents raising two exponents multiplication that's what we do with our exponents this is completely gone on the right hand side we raised all of this to the three halves powers well and we get y equals this 2 X to the 4/3 looking good plus a big arbitrary constant and then this is just raised to the 3 halves power so we've grouped our X's grouped or Y's we had to distribute an expo of this fine and then we do an integration and then the hardest part of all this stuff is just solving for y but that's like the the most challenging part is just doing that so make sure that we're doing a right make sure that we're not making little little teeny errors and hopefully I didn't making the Milot any errors on that so let's go on the next one that looks good already so this is a differential equation we have this function of X this function of Y it's multiplied together it's really solid let's move our wise it's move our X's try that now do it on your own if you can oh group my YS dy group my X's DX take an integral on both sides try that if you have it well that was easy now on the right hand side that's a piece of cake that's gonna be x squared plus c1 no problem on the left hand side don't overthink this stuff okay do it don't try to make it harder than it is is what I'm saying so when we have this one over secant yd Y they're struggling to figure out what that is think about one one over secant white really means one over secant well let's see secant is one over cosine so if we have one over secant that's just cosine this would be integral of cosine y dy equals integral of 2x DX and I gives us something really nicely integrate the integral of cosine well the derivative of sine gives us cosine so the integral of cosine gives aspects sine of Y on the right hand side we have x squared plus c1 is expected let's just call it C there's nothing fancy when we're going to solve for y here with an inverse if sine of y equals x squared plus C then y equals sine inverse of the same and we're good that's our general solution it's got a real nice plus C in there now this harness is you might have thought it's just a matter of recognizing what you're doing with your integrals so separating your variables these separable equations they're not hard as far as the typically the set up they're not bad but the integration techniques might get you on the next one so let's try it if you haven't done right now I would really recommend pause the video see if you can group your Y's on one side with your dy group your exit on the other side with any constant so the coefficients are constants n DX my wives got to move one over why we keep rdy our ex can stay there we have to divide by one over one minus x squared so we get this two over divided that one over Y divided that keep our dy move our DX and now it's time for us to integrate left hand sides really a non-issue we have this absolute value of Ln of absolute value of y we've got it several times before on the right hand side 1 over 2 over 1 minus x squared there's a lot of people who just really really really really want to do like a tree step on this this is not a tree sub it's not going to work out for you there's no square root there it's really hard to represent that we don't want to try it because what you end up getting if you do force this thing to do a trig so I think it's like secant theta d-theta and that's a nasty integral it would it would work but there's an easier way to go around doing it so instead of going about that way let's see if maybe we can revert back to something a little bit nicer like how a partial fractions so let's take a moment and review that so we have 2 over 1 minus x squared if you remember how partial fractions work they rely on your ability to factor into Linear's and irreducible quadratics so what that means is that we can write that as a difference of squares so 1 minus X and 1 plus X and now we do our our partial fractions so partial fractions say for any linear factor that you have on your denominator you're going to create a fraction for that with a constant on the numerator leave the numerators on partial fractions are always one degree less than the denominator so if your denominators are linear your numerators are constants if your denominators are quadratics your numerators are Linear's so like x squared plus one then you get a X plus B or C X plus D or a linear over that so that's how those work we don't get a whole lot of that we get some basic ones like this though a lot so we know that we can split this up somehow as long as we have our same two factors that's a linear I have a constant that's a linear as a constant and they're added together now the whole idea where you go from there is basically just I call it a cover-up method but it's basically just finding a common denominator so we found a common denominator what would happen here you would have to multiply this times 1 plus X you'd have to multiply this times 1 minus X and then if you were to add the fractions your denominators would be the same that means that your numerators would also have to be the same now that all boils down and that's not really explained very often in an account to class where you learn about partial fraction it's not very much explaining so let's do this cover this one up but this here cover that one up with this one there and then just make sure it's equal to 2 why because you're multiplying a times a factor that this needs and B times a factor then this fraction means it's 1 minus X that's creating a common denominator when you add your fractions 2 will be equal to the numerator that you're creating by finding a common denominator if you went and found a common denominator for these two fractions and added the fractions that's your numerator that's the numerator we have they've got to be equal now how we go about solving for a and B there's some nice stuff when you're dealing with just Linear's plug in a number that's going to create these factors as a 0 so for instance I'm going to plug in 1 if x equals 1 that faction that's a reset that factor would be zero if X is 1 this factor goes to nothing 1 minus 1 is 0 that's a 1 cool so we would get 8 was 1 2 divided by 2 is 1 now I plug in negative 1 1 plus negative 1 is 0 but 1 minus negative 1 is 2 which means B is also 1 which is kind of nice it's old moving on from there if we wanted to go ahead and write these fractions out our integral changes a bit we have an integral of 1 over Y dy we've got an integral now of instead of all this stuff we've used some partial fractions the saying that this is now this right here where a is 1 and B is 1 so that's 1 over 1 minus X plus 1 over 1 plus X DX and if we integrate after that let's just you the same thing within tonight oh we've got Alemanni the absolute value of y on the right hand side these are both l ends we had something very similar in one of the first examples where we did hey 1 over 1 plus X that's just Ln of 1 plus X the absolute value Ln of 1 minus X but we have a negative in front of a gcy if you had to do I use some you would get negative DX it's gonna have a negative in front of your Ln right here so we get integral of 1 over 1 minus X that's Ln that's absolute value that's 1 minus X yes but it's gonna make it because the derivative of this inside part if you will is negative 1 plus 1 over 1 plus X well that's Ln absolute a 1 plus X and you all say what do I need after this let's call it c1 we know that we're going to be changing that now before we go any further I'm going to I'm have to move over here someone erase it but before we go any further we need to know some properties or logarithms so stuff like if you aren't adding logarithms together or subtracting logarithms they create a product or a quotient respectively so when we're doing this my maps at a why there's not much we can do but can you think of this as Ln of 1 plus X minus Ln of 1 minus X because if you can then we could write this as Ln of 1 plus X over 1 minus X 2 logarithms add or subtract to create one logarithm with a product or a quotient respectively this is technique subtraction if you have a logarithm - or the law creative create a quotient of F plus c1 now let's see if I don't forget my Ln this time so now that we have this rid we're going to try to solve explicitly for y we're gonna do that e to both sides what we have e to Ln of absolute value y is just absolute value Y e to the Ln absolute value one oh my gosh is getting messy 1 minus X plus c1 let's go piece by piece through it we did eetu both sides that's great this is just absolute value of y e to the right hand side I've shown exactly what that is now you have this whole hey added exponents that's that's these common bases they're being multiplied so absolute value Y it looks good we're gonna get e to the C sub 1 no problem times because additional exponents means that it came from multiplication common bases but we also have a composition of inverse functions here though it was always go away gone so let's do one more thing remember our absolute value we don't want that that's going to equal plus or minus e to the C sub one times now sense that e in Ln if they essentially cancel out man to each other the inverses there we get just this absolute this 1 plus X over 1 minus X let's wrap all of this up in a sea we're done that's our general solution to that differential equation it took a lot of work that's a lot of partial fractions stuff that maybe came out of nowhere for you when you see something and it doesn't fit and you go what how how do I do that try to break it down so we would we would try some basic things we would try l-man a lot but if you're getting something that looks like a trig sub or it looks like something that you want to do for a trick so and it's not fitting maybe think about partial fractions that might give you a hand alright so check it out through a couple more examples a couple more integration techniques making sure you see all that so let's see if we can separate these variables get our wise with dy X's with DX and looks like we can if you were to move this over here you have a product or quotient that's what we're really looking for we don't really want to have to do that we're gonna do a lot of stuff at once so we're gonna divide both sides by 1 plus y squared divide both sides by 1 plus x squared and multiply by that DX you know at this point the this stuff should just be kind of pop and not been in your hand you know yeah I'm getting that if that's great there that's if that's happening that is that's great that's really good that means you understand the idea at this point so that's perfect you might want to just go and try some on your own right now before we go any further and see if you do run into a problem maybe I'm going to cover it on these these techniques also but if you're getting it man I'm proud of you that's excellent you're solving differential equations it's pretty cool so wise got to divide X's got a guy divided we got to get our dy on one side DX on the other side and now we're ready to integrate it let me see that that doesn't really look like anything that we've seen before at least not yet where it's not really a Ln man I really don't want to have to do two partial fractions and it's not partial fractions but just just remember that when we have some simple linear inside of a power oftentimes we can rewrite this and do a very simple use of if bad so they're the same integral twice on the right hand side we have well 1 plus X to the negative 2 power if you called that you you would get U to the negative 1 over negative 1 so negative U to the negative 1 divided by the derivative of that but the derivative this is just 1 so if you equaled 1 plus X then D u equal DX that's just a straightforward substitution that that's excellent we would just get negative U to the negative 1 but then we have 1 plus X being ru and we're gonna have a constant left-hand side is going to behave exactly the same so let's make this a little bit nicer right now it doesn't doesn't look very nice so let's make this over a fraction you go Levin doesn't look nicer either I don't really like the negatives so let's multiply everything by negative now we're gonna have to solve for y so how in the world are we going to do that it wouldn't help here's the thought process so it would help if this were all one fraction because if it were then I could reciprocate both sides and then Y would be on the numerator and all I would have to do is subtract one right now I can't really subtract one so I want some mechanism where I can just reciprocate and reciprocate I can't do it because of that if that wasn't there it'll be easy but I can't do it because of that so let's find a common denominator here let's make one fraction and then we're going to reciprocate so why number one plus y because that's just a constant over one all we really have to do is multiply the numerator denominator by 1 plus s and then when we join that together that gives us something that we can actually reciprocate and that's what we're gonna do right now so let's try it so if we reciprocate this we have one plus wide on the left hand side on the right hand side we flip that fraction over so X plus one or one plus X's on the numerator and one minus C sub 1 1 minus 1 plus X is only denominator so we just reciprocate and then all we've got to do subtract 1 and that's good enough I really I don't really want to to leave this as C 1 so a lot of times lots of times what we're gonna do is we're gonna call this piece that piece with the sign we'll call C equal to negative C 1 that way we get rid of a minus sign and we get rid of that little subscript of 1 so if I call that maybe C 1 then y equals 1 plus X over 1 plus C 1 plus X minus 1 if your signs are wrong like I did everything right dirty letter don't darn the Lenard man it's it's probably something like that so don't worry about it don't get super frustrated if your signs are wrong if it's a if it's revolving around a C they're probably just redefining it it happens a lot that's it it's nasty that that's a horrible looking problem answer but that is a general solution to that differential equation that's kind of cool so let's do this this last one before I give you some other other ones they're a little bit more advanced so we got some wise hey there's already Y's on one side we got some X's they're already on the correct side all we've got to do is move the rest of the wire that's connected by a product on the left-hand side won't you try that see if you can go through it look at the left-hand side to see what you get look at the right-hand side and maybe do that simple integral that you have and see if you can practice that I really hope you're doing that when I suggest it okay give this a try because while watching me do math is super exciting it's not benefiting you if you're not internalizing it so one way that you can get better at this is before I try the problem try the problem if you can do it you don't need to study that problem anymore okay if you can't you need to watch me that's okay you're still learning it but at the end try again see if you can do it after you've learned it so and make sure that you have learned if not try to get and see if you can watch the videos pick up the small piece that you're missing that's that's a good way to study so don't just watch it all the way through well beneficial for a little bit it's not internalizing it and I want you to know it I don't want you to struggle with this stuff when you're in your class or learning it so much that you get mad okay getting mad at math it's never helpful it's like two people who are having a discussion and they start yelling and then at that point no one's listening it's just in your head against wall frustration can't produce perseverance and character sure and it makes you a stronger person by having to go through trials I like learning math that's definitely a trial but make sure that we're actually just using our time wisely so one part of that is not just watching the videos but trying them out make sure you're trying to learn so on the left hand side we've divided by Y to the fourth plus one we've multiplied by DX haven't shown that yet we have a cosine X and then DX hey we're ready we're ready to do an integral so we're going to integrate both sides on the left hand side Y cubed over Y to the fourth plus one whenever your exponents on the numerator are one less than the exponents on the denominator you're talking about au sub and then LM so right and you just have one term so right here we're gonna say hey you is Y to the fourth plus one D u therefore has to be before Y Hugh well that's perfect dy this part matches this part we're going to do a substitution do you want to get rid of this constant right there so do you over 4 equals y cubed dy I've done this many different ways I've shown in lots of ways in the videos this is the one that lots of people prefer you're looking for the piece that's the same and you're gonna replace that whole piece with this stuff so why the fourth plus one we call that u y cube dy that whole piece gets replace with D u over for no problem because we know that we can just do a 1/4 Ln absolute value u we know what that is why the for the plus one let's talk about Y to the fourth plus one is there any possible number you can plug in that's not imaginary that you can take to the fourth power I'd want to get a negative then that absolute values irrelevant so we're gonna drop that now we've just done a whole lot of work all this was a u so let's see what's on the right hand side so integral of cosine X the X side happens to be easy one here that's sine X the derivative of sine X is cosine X so the integral going backwards is let's write the derivative sine X is cosine X or the integral of cosine X is just sine X plus c1 and that's gonna follow us all the way down oh well we definitely want to get rid of that one fourth you do have options let's think about what the better option it would be would you want to create a fourth root on the inside of a logarithm or would you rather just multiply both sides by four since we're trying to get as close to solving for y as possible it's more beneficial to multiply both sides by four and at least remove that fraction so we're going to get this whole Ln Y of the fourth plus one equals four and we just want to write like this for sine X plus C if you do want to distribute then we're gonna replace that for C one with just the arbitrary constant and you can do that on your own this is one that we really we really want to assault start solving that for y so we have to do an exponential on both sides that that's not fun and then we have to subtract one and then we'd have to take a fourth root that's just too much work so this is one of those cases where you're gonna see it left implicitly you're not going to be solving this for for that Y especially since we get the the whole non function issue with the plus and minus will take that 4 through so anyway I hope that's making sense we have like four more to do the last one again is probably pretty important for you to see so don't skip out on the video without watching that okay so two more again I am going to encourage you to try them on your own see if you get stuck if you do that's okay you're still learning it it's probably an immigration technique if you're not getting stuck that's awesome that's to build your confidence you guys shouldn't be really good at this because you're putting in the time you're already watching the videos that's like number one so perfect so as I was rambling you probably hopefully pause the video and did that if not we're gonna get going right now again the idea I'm gonna try to model my thinking here for you is to get it in your head you more times I'm kind of trying to brainwash you and to do it in my way or several equations way here your first order of business is to look for separable equations see if you can make it fit that if you can it's just a matter of integrating and then solve it for y which is nice so here we have everything that's multiplied and divided that's fitting the model of differential equation equals separable equations on our separable variables in the right hand side let's get the Y's on one side let's get the X's on the other side with the DX so that's gotta move so we divide this has to move so we multiply on the right hand side all of our X's can stay that they would need to move there now we've grouped our wise D wise you've grouped our XS d X's it does not look very nice does it well not very nice to me at least but let's go through the process of seen our integral just by writing the integral hopefully a little psychology comes into play and you have some better recollection and oh I'm integrating okay how would I approach something like that substitution no because there's too many terms on the numerator not enough on the denominator your powers don't match up substitution no I came for the same reason too many terms on the numerator power doesn't quite match up here so not a substitution but we also see that we're only divided by one term when you're dividing by one term on a fraction split up that fraction so we're gonna make this 2y cubed over Y to the fifth minus y over y to the fifth that lets us simplify and the same thing happens with X's and we simplify each little fraction and then we can immigrate very easily so left-hand side we're gonna have an integral of 2 y to the negative 2 minus y to the negative 4 power what we're sticking with me on the right-hand side we get an integral of we have to leave this as 1 over X because X is negative 1 of course we don't know how to integrate that with some basic technique it's gonna be a logarithm and right now if you can integrate that so 2y to the native to remember we add one to our Expo and divide by the new exponent add one to our exponent divided by the New Mexico so that's y to the negative third power divided by negative 3 right hand side we've got an Ln absolute value of x we need something looks really bad it's all Mastiffs ID so let's fix it ful first thing well we might want to make these into fractions and see what our common denominator is in the fraction and see if we can change some signs so negative two of a why we got a plus/minus set up one over Y cubed plus one over Y of three Y cubed so that becomes our Plus leave our three move our Y and negative three down becomes a positive exponent on the right hand side Ln absolute value of X I'm gonna get to Scratchy so negative 2 over Y just redoing it plus 1 over 3 y cubed looks good equals Ln has a value of x no problem that's going to be a plus 1 over X plus C I gotta be honest with you that's way too majesty to trying to solve for y just leave it when it's that bad you go how am I gonna do that well you're not because you're gonna start getting stuff like common denominator you'll start getting wise up there even if you reciprocate and you'd have to distribute get everything on one side refactor and hope they get solved for y and take a radical it's it's not it's not gonna happen at least not easily so this is one that you'd be fine just leave it like that I know it doesn't look good but that is a general solution to that differential equation let's try that next one so next one says if we have x squared plus 1 on the left hand side that that's on the wrong side let's move it we don't have an x over here let's leave that there for y I forgot to write it sorry guys I forgot something's kind of important you try to do that in your own e we're able to buy that actually you probably should have been able to because without that tan why you just do the integral of dy and it's just Y so without that you move that and that's gonna be looks like au sub and then take an integral dy you get Y on the right hand side you get something really easy so that's alright if you did that in your own but good job good job you got it now we have something a little bit different obviously so let's leave the Y's where they are remove our X's where they need to be by dividing by X fruitless one and moving our DX now we're ready to integrate both sides so let's take an integral of tangent Y dy and integral of x over X Rho plus 1 DX on the right hand side as I was saying that that's a perfect case for a substitution so we let u equal our denominator the derivative is 2x our variables match up we have a constant which we don't care super much about so when we're doing this we're looking for remember we want this piece to match this side you got a divided by 2 now we can replace that X and DX with D u over 2 we know we're going to place that with just you that's what we call for our substitution so we get our 1/2 that's our de over - we're gonna get an Ln absolute value of you now that you that you as x squared plus 1 so we would normally do Ln of absolute value whatever ru was but because x squared plus 1 can't ever be negative with real numbers we don't need the absolute value anymore we just do x squared plus 1 and then we have a seen on the left hand side so the integral of tangent Y this is one that you're going to want to use your table for so the integral of tangent Y gives you Ln absolute value of secant wide and now we work our way through just like we normally would so let's let's write this down here Ln absolute value secant wide and then try to do the same techniques we've done a couple more times let's move this as a square root let's get rid of that that coefficient that way we can do an excellent on both sides remember that first so kind of putting everything together right now x squared plus one to the one-half power is a square root now I've got an Ln equal to Ln plus 2c ones you remember what happens when we do that e to both sides so to take that both sides as an exponential on e our elements are going to drop but because what I'm really doing is this that's gonna go away that's gonna go away but that right there that plus C one C sub one that's e to the C sub 1 being multiplied by this remember that when we have excellence being added that's a multiplication common basis so I'm still going to have an e to the C sub 1 now we know absolute value well we can take this as if we need to plus or minus e to the C sub 1 times the square root of x squared plus 1 now we bet that's a consonant in that many times so that's going to be just a big C the arbitrary constant so secant line equals some constant square root x squared plus 1 and last step man are less that we're almost done if secant y equals something then y equals secant inverse of that something and we're done that's as good as we can get that's our general solution for that differential equation I'm really hoping that this is making sense to you that you at this point are like yeah I get how to separate my variables I understand that my y's and dy are here my X's and DX is here we're gonna do an integral do lots of different techniques there's lots out there and then do our best so for y when we get really nasty stuff we're probably just gonna leave it if it's reasonable then we solve for y we have two more to do they're not that bad that we're actually gonna get a couple easier ones it's just one special case I need to show you the very end and kind of a you need to pay attention to this when you get it for the next one so we're gonna do those two then call it good two more ones got some fancy-pants math on it and one of them is just something that you need to be aware of that can't happen when you're solving differential equations so first this one when things don't look in anything like what you're trying to make them sometimes they're not but sometimes it requires you to think outside the box so in our case right here you know that doesn't that come on they can't possibly be separable well whatever we're looking for stuff being multiplied how do you get sevens multiplied data stuff that's add subtracted what you want factors oh my gosh to get a factor sometimes some rarely these things are factorable so if you have four terms on the right hand side three terms use a diamond problem four terms maybe thank you my grouping if you factor by grouping on that one we can actually make this into things that are being multiplied that creates factors that creates this function equal stuff that's a product and that means that we can separate your variables so doesn't happen all the time but sometimes you can group it so the first two terms 1 minus x squared we're trying to factor GCF I'm not talking difference of squares here I'm talking about factor and GCF there's nothing besides 1 so we can write 1 1 times 1 minus x squared gives you that back factor by grouping always writes our middle sign between those pairs of terms and then a factor than GCF out of the last two which is y squared this is what you're looking for with a factor by grouping is two big fat terms that have a GCF that you can factor out again so we factor out our 1 minus x squared that leaves us with and the reason why we wrote the 1 so when you remove this by division you still have one that doesn't go away whenever you divide something you can't ever get 0 unless you start with 0 so when we're factoring your terms never disappeared the smallest they can become is 1 so we get 1 minus x squared 1 plus y squared and that's something that we can separate the variable on we can move our Y's on one side X to the other side with the DX and integrate try it I'm gonna go a little quickly on this because we've had a lot of experience with a lot of these differential equations and doing the integration techniques so we're about ready to emigrate use a table whenever you get one over one plus y squared you can do tricks up if you really want to but if all possibly use a table if you memorize that this is a tan inverse on the right hand side will certainly split this up as 1 over x squared minus x squared of x squared which gives us negative x to the negative 1 minus x plus c1 this is we're gonna leave at C we're not going to have to change on this one so if we clean it up just a bit Y would equal if tan inverse of y equals this chunk then y equals tangent itself of this junk that's negative 1 over X minus X plus C that's a really nice way doesn't to solve that but the point of this problem wasn't wasn't this we've done those techniques before it was sometimes you can get stuff to fit even when it looks like it doesn't think about factoring things that make a product for you hmm that's about all I need to know on that one the last one deceivingly simple problem is it's not hard yeah of course we're going to separate our variables so if we divide both sides we get a 1 y squared divided by Y Squared's 1 we get 1 over Y squared dy if we integrate we get the integral of Y to the negative 2 dy equals integral DX which is integral of 1 DX which is just X not a problem on the left hand side we get negative Y to the negative 1 yeah this we write as a fraction if we call it C 1 because we'll have an A up there just a moment so we'll get one or y equals negative X minus c1 if we reciprocate we get one over negative x minus so you want to hope it's making sense then we probably call this thing C and get one over C arbitrary constant minus X that is a general solution that is the general solution a difference equation but I want you to consider something else once you consider this what life is zero you can't get away with zero from here it's impossible because your numerator is 1 there's no way that you're gonna plug in any number and get y equals zero verify that that you can't you can't get it so it's impossible but consider this if you took y equals zero the derivative of Y would still be zero so we'd say hey does that satisfy this remember the very first thing we did was plug in stuff to make sure it worked at our difference equation would say dy DX is zero y squared would be zero squared because Y is zero yes zero equals zero yes that's a solution there are sometimes solutions that do not appear in your general solution it's not even possible to get it there you know still solutions those are called singular solutions so it there they can be very hard to find a lot of times with easy ones you can look at it and go oh yeah if if I imagine something like y equals zero the derivative is still zero and I would satisfy this they're easy to see on basic ones or easier to see but they do happen I just need to make you aware of that that this while awesome doesn't necessarily give you all of the solutions there are some singular ones out there that you'd have to find a different way or kind of reverse engineer that that equation see what you can plug in like guess and check the way through it anyway that is separate that's solving differential equations by separation of variables or separable equations I hope it made sense I hope you're excited to learn some more about this because the next video we're gonna deal with some initial value problems and see about doing this technique with initial values and how to get rid of that general arbitrary sorry the arbitrary constant by using this true value and where to do that so I'll see you for the next video on that you 

Transcript for: Separable Equations with Initial Values (Differential Equations 13)
hey there welcome to another video we're gonna stick with the same exact technique that we just learned this solving differential equations with separation of variables these so these separable equations or we can group Y and dy on one side X in the X on the other side only now we have initial value problems that list of this this video is very straightforward there's nothing more I'm gonna teach you besides the fact that you gotta plug that in to solve for your arbitrary constant the only the thing that I want to say about that is that sometimes it's really beneficial to plug it in as early as possible and sometimes it's not so depend on where the problem is we oftentimes want to plug in our initial value before we solve for y it helps us out occasionally especially when we have exponents so like e to the something so we want to group that either the C call that a constant and plug in our initial value right then so we're gonna explore that for about six examples we'll go through it not a whole lot of fancy stuff here again I'm sort of trying to review these ideas of integrals with you so so many great techniques but mostly when I would go about plugging in that initial value to get rid of arbitrary constants so we're using the same idea of separation of variables acceptable equations and then we're just plugging in because we want to get away from a general solution which has that arbitrary constant to a particular solution this one function that goes through this one point that satisfies that differential equation let's look at a few of them right now so we got a differential equation that's equal to dy DX equals y times e of X so we're noticing first write to that that we have derivative equal to product with X's and Y's that's exactly what we're looking for for separation separable equations so these separation of variables so we're gonna do that we want to group our Y and dy on one side X and DX on others just like that maybe / why leave the atd-x and move our DX over now we can take an integral we know that integrals undo derivatives so we can integrate both sides on the left-hand side we get this a lot this Ln absolute value of Y on the right hand side in the easiest integral or derivative ever thank you we just need the X but we also get an arbitrary constant how often we'll call this C sub 1 because we can change that now here's something you need to know even if we change that C sub 1 because we're about to get an exponential on this even if you get that to be like a plus or minus e to the C sub 1 and you call it C that's okay so sometimes it's beneficial for us to do all of that work and then plug in that initial value let me show you that right now so if we have Ln absolute value y equals all this garbage well we know that in order to get rid of natural log we need a base of e so e to this side will equal absolute value y that would be e to the e to the X plus C 1 that looks really awkward so let's fix just a little bit of it let's take this we know that if exponents are multiplied that they came from sorry if exponents are added they came from bases that are multiplied so absolute value of y equals e to the C sub 1 times e to the e to the X common bases being multiplied gives us X months that are being added I just switched the order also we know that absolute value Y would equal plus or minus e to the C sub 1 times e to the e to the X now I want to show you that this is possible this is why we didn't plug this in earlier we could have taken this initial value plugged it right there and solve for C that would have been fine we would have had 0 for X giving us 1 we would have had to e for our Ln giving us probably you're giving us Ln of 2 e and we can separate that we get Ln of 2 plus Ln of E which gave us 1 subtract 1 from both sides C would equal Ln of 2 you can totally do that and then this would be Ln 2 that would be Ln 2 we'd get e to the Ln 2 oh my gosh e to the Ln 2 is 2 so what we're gonna find out later is that this is going to be 2 you can do exactly the same thing later on so if we call all of this just C let's just call that Big C we've done that many times then y equals C e to the e to the X once you've got there we need to get rid of that that C and so how we go about doing that is by using our initial value we're saying this is a family of curves an infinite family of curves that don't intersect that means that only one of them is going to go through that point so let's find the C that makes that happen why is to e when x is 0 so e to the 0 is 1 which means that we have to e equals C times e let's divide both sides by e C is 2 so y equals to e to the e to the X that right there is no longer a general solution that's a particular solution to the one equation the one solution that goes through that point and still satisfies that differential equation that's what we're looking for now I mentioned to you before I said in words but what if you had gone ahead and plug in this even here I don't know if I would do that probably wait till here but it doesn't doesn't matter watch so if I plug in to e for Y and 0 for x well this right here is a product now Tullius positive so we can drop the absolute value but a product and logarithms can be split up by addition element of e you just compose two inverse functions so what that's going to give you is just one ones are gone if you subtract one from both sides and see 1 would equal an element 2 so look what happens here if we had this let's move all the way down to 2 Heat let's move down here so [Music] if we know that C sub 1 is ln2 it's all positive we don't get worried about the absolute value anymore but e to the element 2 would give us the same exact thing we found here question is which way sees you that's subjective which makes easier for you for me personally I liked wrapping all of this up as a gigantic C and then plug it in my initial value you can do that lots of times sometimes it is beneficial to plug it in earlier so that's really up to you does it really matter no but for some problems one way is a little bit easier so keep that in mind as you're going through this is still the same separate variables integrate but now at some point we're plugging in our initial value and we're going from our general solution to a specific particular solution using that initial value let's try a couple more so next up the first thing we're looking for we have a differential equation we see a big product in their group or Y is dy group or X is DX so 1 over Y squared plus 1 D by looks good on the right hand side 3x squared DX that's fine we know that we're going to integrate as soon as that happens so Y is group with dy x is group of DX on the left hand side user tables you can do a trick so if you really want to but if we're going to to integrate quickly and effectively it often times a difference with ways we're using tables that's tan inverse of y equals integral of 3x squared is X cubed so the derivative X cubed is 3x squared going backwards we get X cubed but we'd have to tack on a constant now this is one of those cases where I would almost certainly plug in my initial value right here because otherwise you'd have to undo a lot of work to solve for the C did you see if you go y equals tangent of x cubed plus C which we're about to do I mean we can sulfur if tan inverse of y equals sort of an expression that y equals tangent of that same expression if we start plugging in numbers here we're gonna have to do a tan inverse anyway do you guys get that so if we start plugging in things now we're gonna have to go backwards from exactly where we're at here so it benefits us to plug in our initial value before we solve for y in this case so you just have to be case-by-case specific is it going to benefit me to plug it in now well no too much work no too much work no too much work after this looked pretty good here it's too much work first to go backwards so at this point tan inverse of y equals x cubed plus C let's plug in our initial value and let's see if we can solve for C so Y is 0 equals 1 says that Y is 1 when x is 0 that's pretty nice because all we have to figure out is how much tan inverse of 1 is and that says what what angle when you take tangent of it gives you 1 so tangent of what angle gives you 1 in the first quadrant if you can well that's gonna be PI over 4 tangent of PI over 4 is 1 so tan inverse of 1 is PI over 4 PI over 4 equals C and now when we plug that back in so we're gonna get that tan inverse of y equals x cubed plus PI over 4 that's a little bit nicer for us to go from that at that point rather than get to y equals a tangent and then have to go backwards behind C anyway so if you find yourself going backwards a lot plug in your initial value sooner if you find yourself doing way too much work to solve for your seat plug in your initial value later in that problem so it really depends on what problem you're on whether you plug in addition value earlier later a lot of times it's plugged in before you solve for y sometimes it's not so tan inverse of y equals some expression that means y equals tangent of expression X cube plus we don't have a + anymore we use that you start our point to say this is this narrows it down instead of a general solution with a + C we have a specific solution that would go through that point and still satisfies our differential equation I hope this is making sense to you that you get that I'm not really teaching you anything new as far as a technique of integrating and or anything like that what I'm teaching you is where you should plug in your initial value and it depends on whether or not you'd have to go backwards what so if you solve only for white go backwards to find your C or not so sometimes it's easier at one way or another let's do this last one I'll give you three more that I would like you to pause and try on your own so here we have a derivative of y with respect to x equals y times cotangent X that looks pretty good because it's a project let's a group our X's DX on the right side our Y is dy on the other side so 1 over Y dy equals cotangent X DX we have an initial value we'll take care of it just a little bit now we're going to integrate on the left hand side we get natural log absolute value I get lots of times on the right hand side you of man cotangent X what in the world is that well let's use our integration tables so instead of reinventing the wheel here the these are all techniques from Cal 2 but we all have them kind of down so I look that up and say ok that's a natural log of sine X and we're gonna get some sort of a constant out of that so natural log of absolute value y equals natural log absolute value sign X plus C let's see what we can do with that now because we have a lot of we would have potentially a lot of work to do to solve for C right now I'm used to the same technique I had here so you're gonna find that plugging in after you wrap up all your e to the C garbage if you have LNS is a technique that we use a lot so I wait on those natural logarithms until I get that that arbitrary constant of C sub 1 and to be like a bigger expression where wrap it up do it into a bigger C and then I'll plug in my my initial value that works for me very well if I don't have that most time I plug it in as soon as possible so now we're kind of narrowing down when do i plug in that initial value well if we have a lot of Exponential's going on where I can start wrapping up a C in a bigger expression that saves me some work saves me going through that expression again if I don't have that well I can sell for plus C as soon as possible and then solve for y with an actual number instead of a seen let's see what I mean here so Ellen F sub n y equals ln f sub-l you sign x plus c1 well we know that we're gonna have erased on both sides so exponential 2 exponent equals argument so e to the Ln absolute value sign X let's see 1 you've done this many times now so I'm gonna separate this into a product of common bases and we know that when you compose two functions that are inverses they eliminate each other they undo each other so I'm going to do two things no absolute value of y I can write this as y equals 4 plus or minus e to the C sub 1 I can also eliminate my en el in and just get sine X next up what would you do here so if we had that we had this like on a test or something would you wrap this up or would you plug in your initial value you plug in your initial value now notice all the work you have to do to get to that see that's that's not very fun if I wait just a moment and say I'm gonna call all this stuff see yeah we'll have to go backwards a little bit but it's a lot easier to see what that Steve is because even here we have a lot of elements going on to unpack all that garbage you have to have Ln of some expression PI over 2 sine is sine of PI over 2 Ln of that now is that a big deal in this case you know they're both PI over 2 is you subtract them you can get what you what you want out of that but here would be a little bit nicer so this says that Y is PI over 2 people C times sine of PI over 2 you need know a sine of PI over 2 is so sine of cosine and sine and I'm sorry sine and cosine of our normal well typical angles are really important to have them having them right so sine of 0 0 cosine of 0 is 1 sine of PI over 2 is 1 cosine PI over 2 is 0 so I know that that's 1 which means that PI over 2 is equal to C that would have been oh that's a lot easier than plugging in first if we plugged in here we can spend a lot of time solving for C but with Exponential's oftentimes it's easiest to wrap up that e to the C sub 1 plus or minus as an arbitrary constant and then right after that plug in your initial value that'll save you some headaches so I know that it's hopefully it's not ambiguous system when you're plugging in right now with Exponential's if you can wrap up the plus C you know you're gonna be able to wrap up the plus C and in something like a seen won't either the C 1 an exponential or a plus and minus that or changing your signs and get rid of constants by wrapping it up into a bigger of arbitrary constant wait to plug in your initial value if you know you're not gonna be able to do that plug it in as soon as possible so that's that's how I approach these problems so here we're almost done all we need to do is write this as y equals PI over 2 sine X done that's it are you getting it are you understanding why I'm plugging in my initial value sometimes soon and sometimes not soon it all has to do with the form of our problem if we're able to wrap up our constant into something larger like that this becomes a bigger see if you will it's best to wait if you're not able to do that it's best to do your initial value sooner we have three more I'm gonna go through pretty quickly but and when I write them on the board I'd like you to pause the video and try them on your own see if you can work your way through think about when you would plug in that initial value okay so if you want a challenge I would say try these three there's some weird stuff going on which is why we're doing them and I'm sure you exactly how to go through and how to approach this sort of a problem but if you'd like to here's the hint some give you the hints and then I'll go through them pretty quickly but I'll be explaining everything for you so first one that can be rid of several separable as a separable equation but you've got to add the X and factor so see if you can factor that this one well that's an exponential with exponent that are subtracted see if you can separate the exponent last one actual essence pretty good so that's what's not not too bad it's already set up pretty well for you so if you want it if you want to challenge see if you can do these ones I'm gonna get started right about now so first first example can we write in a separable equation that's our primary goal right now because well honestly it's the only technique you know but other than that it's the easiest technique that we have it doesn't involve a lot of setup but some of the other techniques do involve so here let's see if we can if we have more than just two big fat tubing terms on one on each side we're going to need to group our terms and see if we can factor so in this case that involves adding Y and see if we can factor out an of course we can we can factor GCF of Y what that's doing with the ideas is you need products right so you need just factors that are multiplied together if you have more than that if you have so that's being added and subtracted you need to be able to factor in order for this technique to work that's looking pretty good we factor out our why'd we get 2 x squared plus 1 now we can leave this divided by X divided by Y and move our DX so we can write this as our variables group together 1 over d / 1 over yd y equals 2x squared plus 1 over X DX now we're ready to take that integral on the left hand side pretty straightforward on the right hand side notice that we can separate this if we separate these fractions we get 2x plus 1 over X DX we separate this we have 2x squared over X is 2x 1 over X is of course 1 or X so when we do our integrals element absolute value Y is pretty good this is just x squared this is Ln absolute value of X and then we get this plus c1 notice what's happening what's happening is I'm going to have e to all this side I'm gonna have an EC 1 I'm gonna have a plus a months I'm gonna wait to plug in my initial value now could you do it now absolutely but it gets a little tricky what you leave in terms of E and what you don't so right now I'm gonna either way you want to go and you'll be fine but I'm gonna wait just a little bit what I'm going to do is understand that exponential undoes logarithms I'm going to have e to the x squared + Ln absolute value of x plus C sub 1 I'm also going to split this up I know that exponents being added came from common bases being multiplied so I'm gonna put my e to the C sub 1 first I'm gonna have multiple we should be multiplied e to the x squared + e to the Ln absolute value of X well that that's great because we can take this absolute value of X which is going to have a plus and minus in it and a plus and minus right here and say let's just wrap all of that up with a plus and minus e to the C 1 we'll have an e to the x squared but e to the Ln X gives us just thanks that's great actually almost done so if we would write this what we're gonna do is we're gonna group all of this and say hey you know what that's still a constant C sub 1 is a constant e to the C sub 1 is a constant whether you have positive or negative you're still gonna have a constant let's call that Big C so y equals C times X e to the x squared I'm just moving my X into the front if you're wondering well what about the absolute value it's wrapped up in that plus and that positive negative so we can wrap both sides absolute value would just give us a positive negative whatever we have there so we wrap that up and now we can plug in our initial value so Y is 1 when X is 1 well what that means C times 1 times e to the first is just C times e if we solve for C we get want to read which changes our our solution here to 1 over e X to the x times e to the x squared you know that that's not what my SLM answer looks like in the back of the book or if this came out of book or if you're doing it on a test or whatever you doing that's not it looks like that's because of this many times if you have a constant with a base that's the same as some other exponential that you have we can rewrite this 1 over e is the same as either than they need 1 we do that if we put in the back it's pretty easy to see that we now have a common basis which is why have you wrote it as me to the negative one to show we have a common basis if we have common basis what do you do there exponents let's see multiplication of home bases we would add our exponents so y equals x e to the x squared minus 1 x squared plus negative 1 is x squared minus 1 that's the way to approach that problem so same ideas may be factored if you have more than just stuff being multiplied you're gonna have the fact to create those products so we factored we move our X's and Y's and the purpose side with dy DX the integral is pretty easy here and then I'm always gonna follow this pattern of if I have an Ln if I know I'm gonna have an exponential over here and it's all raised to an exponent or not just little pieces but all of it and I know I'm gonna get an e to the C sub when I normally get a plus and minus I'm gonna wait to plug in that initial value if not I'm gonna plug it in early let's check out the last unit so this next one looks really tricky one idea here is that if you have to separate your variables then you have to separate any Exponential's that contain both your variables which means if you have 6 e to the 2x times e to the negative Y if exponents are being added or subtracted we can split them up by positive or negative multiplication X those common bases to those exponents could you have also put e to the 2x over e to the Y absolutely that's fine in fact that might be a little bit easier for you to see of the next step so if I've got my X's here and I leave my constants remember that we leave our constants on the x side I'm gonna move this over here so we would have either 1 over e to the negative 1 dy equals 6 e to the 2x DX or if you really think about it that's just e to the Y which would be what you did if you divided by e to the Y here ya but I'm gonna get either why that would probably be an easier way to do it I improved my Y's and dy I've broke my xdx were ready to integrate it's looking really solid I love either the Y it's just going to give you either one on the right hand side six either 2x you you wanna think of the use up here for 2x so ii u equals 2x the derivative would be 2 DX so I'm going to be dividing by 2 but one of the easiest ways that I go through it is I think well what's the regular integral of this and I divide by the derivative of the inside so I'll get my six I'll get my either 2x I'm going to divide by the derivative of that because that's how those of you cells work I'm gonna divide by 2 how am I gonna + C so let's simplify et to the y equals 3 e to the 2x plus c1 now I've already got an exponent here so if I have an exponent here I'm not gonna be getting e to the C sub 1 I'm not gonna wait to plug this in I don't have any Ln s I'm not going to be getting that plus and minus e to the C sub 1 idea I'm gonna plug in my initial value now so I have an exponential but an exponential is not going to yield more Exponential's they would be able to deal bog rhythms which be harder to deal with so if you find yourself like I'm having to go backwards on this Y would be solved for but if I wanted to try and see if you wrapped up in a longer than that that's not created wrapped up an exponential sure you can call that C so as you call already to see also but it's it's just easier to plug it in now so if we plug in 0 for Y and 0 for X we'd have e to the 0 for y 3 times e to the 0 for X plus C sub 1 e to the 0 is 1 e to the 0 is 1 times 3 which means our C sub 1 equals negative 2 so subtract 3 from both sides we get negative 2 now let's plug that back in so we'll take our negative 2 and just change our equation from where we started plugging our initial value to having that constant of negative two so just minus 2 now when we solve for y we're not going to have to backtrack to plug in 4 for that constant you see if e to the y equals this expression over here if we do ln on both sides so e to the Y was this then y equals Ln of that done if you did it another way if you had y equals all this stuff plus c1 you would have to start undoing the logarithm to be able to figure out what that C would actually be now I want to avoid that for you that leads to a lot of mistakes makes it harder makes you students going whether I don't understand you that's why sometimes why it why not others if you know that you're gonna be getting et to something with it c1 wait if you're not it's best to plug it in as soon as possible it's the idea mm-hmm okay last one that we got that one set a pretty straightforward so we have some X's here against and Y's here we're just switching we're gonna make sure that we set this up as function of Y dy equals function of X DX then we integrate now when stuff doesn't look familiar to you or look good changing it so one over cosine squared Y doesn't look that great ago I had that's not on my table well yeah of course on your table because if secant is 1 over cosine one over cosine gives you secant and if 1 over cosine squared is what you have then you're gonna have secant squared so on the left hand side we have an integral of secant squared Y dy it's actually nice on the right-hand side we've got an integral of 1/2 X to the negative 1/2 which we had in the previous video well that is going to give us on the right-hand side we keep up 1/2 we always add to our exponent so it's 1/2 over 1/2 and our 1/2 sargon what's C sub 1 on the left-hand side well that this got nice the integral is secant squared Y dy is just tangent Y the derivative of the tangent Y gives you C and squared so then your old secant squared gives us tangent Y so we know that tangent line equals square root of x plus C sub 1 x to the 1/2 that's all we've got that the square root of x plus c1 now think in your head is this going to give you any exponents e to the c1 stuff like that if the answer's no then plug in your initial value now if the answer is yes then you wait until you wrap it up in that larger arbitrary constant then you plug in your initial value so right now I know that Y of 4 equals PI over 4 that means that Y is PI over 4 when X is 4 so tangent PI over 4 equals square root of 4 plus C sub 1 y becomes PI over 4 X becomes 4 and this is really nice because tangent of PI over 4 is 1 we got that square root of 4 is 2 plus C sub one that says C sub 1 equals negative 1 let's just plug that back in so from where we started plugging in our initial value from right here we have tangent of y equals the square root of x minus 1 if you did it to plug in the initial value now and you solved for y you'd have to be going backwards a lot to figure out what that constant is now if we have tangent of y equals our rushon we know if tangent y equals an expression y equals tan inverse of that expression that's a particular solution to that differential equation that goes through that point that's what we're looking at doing with initial values so not much of a difference besides understanding when to plug in that initial value that hopefully will help you a lot because that's really explained like when do you plug it in soon when you play it later do you plug it in the same place every time no you don't well at least not according to me I textbooks don't really explain that some teachers don't explain that very well like why they're plugging in certain times or places so hopefully that makes sense to the next video we're going to talk about we're going to talk about how we can solve a whole bunch of real-life sort of big problems differential equations with this technique so I'll see you over the next section when we do applications with separable equations by separating our variables every day you 

Transcript for: Applications with Separable Equations (Differential Equations 14)
hey everybody welcome to another video I'm glad you're still watching things for sticking with me so we're gonna talk about applications right now we've discovered one of our basic techniques of solving differential equations is solving them by separating your variable separable equations right now we're gonna discover that man that's got a lot of applications for natural growth and decay so that means exponential growth and decay we'll talk about that a little bit so whenever I talk about differential equations with students and so your teachers probably knew the same thing in less I'm your teacher and then I definitely do the same thing is talk a lot about about a lot about applications because applications are really important for differential equations to see how these things work in real life that's the goal of math is to get it to apply to things otherwise it's fun and studying pure math can be fun but it's we really only confer usefulness in differential equations so with that in mind we're gonna talk a lot about applications of difference of equations as this course goes forward with that being said these things take a while and so I know these videos are a little bit longer than than normal like if I were teaching this in a regular classroom setting I probably wouldn't have enough time to do man we're gonna do ignite examples today on this video so if that's if you don't need all of that you can feel free to skip through some of them if you're just perfect on your applications that's fine but what I'm trying to do here is is do a lot of these applications because we do have the time that way when you get to them if you're a teacher and they probably are it is making you do a lot of applications or showing you some of them that you're you're a little more confident and a lot more competent you see when we're dealing with these application problems well not challenging mathematically to do and we're gonna see that they're not super challenging if you are comfortable with separable equations the problem is is that the setup just the wording of them can be a little funky you know what are they asking here that's the hardest part so I'll show you how to set them up and then we'll go through them I wouldn't say they're particularly the challenging after you set them up like most word problems once you get the equation if you know the technique it's gonna be fine so we'll say that a lot today if you feel comfortable feel free to move on and we'll talk about the another technique of solving differential equations in just a little while in a very next video I'll introduce the concept to you but for right now let's focus on being able to apply these differential equations and specifically the technique of separable equations to some applications so we're going to find out that in real life a lot of natural growth and decay can be modeled by that right there followed by the following so when we talk about natural growth the decay typically we have an exponential growth and an exponential decay so or those things have an exponent where or an exponential where a base is typically e and we're gonna see why that is right now so we'll go ahead and solve that differential equation but what this is saying to you is that hey stuff that grows exponentially now for natural growth and decay it's typically exponential it's modeled on this idea that the rate of growth or decay that's the rate of change the rate of how your population your amount whatever you talk about changing with respect to time is proportional to the amount that there is now that might sound a little funky at first but if you really think about it populations are gonna grow faster if there's more people to reproduce or bacteria or bunnies or whatever so that that's the idea that we're coping with right now is that hey the rate of change of your population or the amount that you have in nature typically the rate of change if it's unimpeded by like lack of food like like that that's gonna grow without bound exponentially so the rate of change of our population is is typically proportional and very simple models to how much there is or case this constant proportionality constant of proportionality or the constant of variation if you dealt with like that in intermediate algebra we just talk about stuff like that so the rate of change of our growth or decay rate of the growth or decay is proportional to the amount that there is that that does kind of need to make sense that yeah the more I have the faster we're gonna grow the less I have the store we're going to grow and with decay kind of the same thing happens with like radioactive decay will see that in similar examples as well so we're just gonna go through some examples and specifically I'm gonna focus on set up how the thought process works how this makes something that's exponential we're gonna see when we saw our very first one that oh yeah that does make exponential growth or decay pretty much every time so we'll look at that right now let's talk about a town that had 25,000 people in 1970 and then in 1980 it had 30,000 people if the population continues to grow exponentially what's the population going to be in 2010 barring any disease barring any people like large groups moving in or out if that's the same population like some set of people to start with what's it gonna be in 2010 now we're gonna start with this why well this is exponential growth or decay and you're gonna see it in just a little bit so let's start with all right let's assume our population growth the rate of change in our population the rate of change of our population with respect to time is proportionate or proportional to the amount of people that there are oh my gosh that's a that's a simple equation I've got a differential equation where I can get my variable hey DP and get the P on one side or DT on the other let's try that so 1 over P DP equals K DT you remember from last couple that we always want to keep our constants on the right hand side on the typically it's the exercise but on the independent variable size we're talking about so this looks a little strange where sometimes our X this X doesn't mean that it's the independent variable it means the amount that T the rate of change with populations over time time is the independent variable your time is the thing that is changing and our populations based on that the amount that we have is based on that so when we're doing our separable equations here we want the population on the left hand side we want time on the right hand side hey that's separate that's awesome now we can integrate so when we integrate both sides we get here it is this is the important reason this is why that II that natural number e shows up in all of these it's why it happens in nature is because or well we discovered this models the nature I suppose a better way say is because when you do this integral right here you're going to get natural log of f sub a theme that's base is e and when we solve that for people kind of get something on well exponent on e that's really kind of cool so natural log of the P we've done this a lot is equal to KT plus let's call it C 1 because we know what's going to happen when we do that e on both sides so take this as an exponent e that constant is going to change we're going to alter that a little bit so let's keep on going here since we have a natural log absolute value P equals some stuff with our independent variable T in there we know that absolute value of P itself is going to equal e to the KT plus C once remember what we do with this remember that if exponents are added we can create multiplication with a common base and switch sides here but this is the same thing common base is being added exponents added exponent means common base is being multiplied and then one more thing that we're gonna do we know that absolute value equals that plus and minus and now we can wrap this whole thing up into this larger if you will it could be smaller but larger arbitrary constant C remember that our population right now so P is our population is based on time so as time moves forward our population is changing that's why it's changing population with respect to time that ready to change the population inspect the time now we know that we can call this whole thing C equals e to the KT this should be very comfortable for you we just spent its ton of time talking about solving separable equations now it's our application time we're gonna go a little further though so now imagine if you would that our population at time zero is let's just call that initial population whatever it is so in this case would be twenty five thousand that's where we started our experiment from or observation from or whatever we're dealing with from we started from that that twenty five thousand let's say that it's just in general because what I'm trying to do for you is show you that these natural growth and decay where the changing population change in amount with respect to time is proportional are always going to be modeled on some sort of an exponential gear and we're seeing that we're seeing that there's a little recap that this is a separable equation we can pull our p on one side we can have the dt and the other when we take our integrals we are going to get an Ln solving that for ki you're going to get an exponential based on e that's really cool that's our base we can separate just like we normally did our exponents we can do our plus or minus we can wrap that up in a arbitrary constant C but now we're gonna get more specific so at time zero we are going to have an initial population whether it's 0 or 5 or 25,000 in this case let's plug that in so let's put this in here so at time 0 we are going to have an initial population that's what that says on population when you plug in 0 is P of 0 well do you see that e to the 0 is going to be 1 so whatever that barber trade constant is that whole thing that only stands for our initial population that's cool so if we rewrite this whole thing we said yeah the population with respect to time equals our arbitrary constant but that arbitrary constant sense we have an initial population here plug in 0 and you're going to get P of T equals your initial population well that means our C right here then we add so put that stuff in there this becomes 0 this is P of T our C since this is 1 is going to equal key of 0 so P of T gives us P of 0 nothing write this in 2 steps only thing easier so C stands for our initial population if we put this back in our original we now know that our population perspective time is no longer see we know that stands for initial population e to the KT no two things here that I want you to just make a note somewhere on your paper or somewhere in your mind that if K is positive we're gonna get exponential growth and if K is negative we're going to exponential decay but all of our problems let's start this way where the way that we're changing with respect to time is proportional there that way I hope you can see that that it's all structured just like that whether we're population or X or half-life or anything we're all going to be based on something like this where when you solve it down we've made this very general none of these numbers are in here anywhere it's just the idea that when you say yeah you know what at time 0 you're gonna have an initial amount well that initial amount that is going to be your C plug in 0 your get C equals your initial amount take your initial amount plug it back in for C and you have something that's very familiar a lot of times in calc 2 you see stuff like this even calc 1 if you did early transcendentals of course my videos aren't that mine are based on late transcendentalist which means that we deal with natural logarithms in calc 2 for us but first before here you see a lot of this in there and some of those word problems that came out of nowhere Newton's law of cooling where's that even come from this idea that the way that something cools is proportional on its temp to the difference between ambient and the temperature of that that body whatever you're checking well if it's proportional if the rate of change is proportional we can do an integral several places to do an integral and we're going to get that exponential very cool now we can do two things so we're going to deal with this pretty much all day today in this video so when we see this we know that it's based on some sort of natural growth and decay where the rate of change is proportional to the amount that you have whatever that means now we typically will do two things step number one is use one piece of information to solve for K and then once you've found K once you found K you can use the other piece of information to answer the question that's being asked so this is pretty much a structure for a lot of these examples let us go through that right now so the first sentence tells us something the first sentence says we had 25,000 people in 1970 well that's going to give us an initial population so in 1970 where a prop was starting our initial population is 25,000 okay that's very and 30,000 in 1980 so since this is based on a population change according to time we need to find out how much time has passed which is really easy from 1970 1980 you know that we had 10 years the past and then how much the population was at that time so that gives us another point of reference here that says that in 10 years or 10 years from when we started so a piece of zero here says at the start of your problem that's 1970 so I know it's not here zero because this time problem wasn't around at Year Zero but in 1970 that's the initial population so let's call that time zero let's call nineteen seven seventy this T equals zero so when our problems started that's why we get the initial population or twenty five thousand here so a population and started the problems twenty five thousand after ten years so nineteen eighty we had 30,000 that gives us enough information to solve for our case so when you're doing this on your own you need an initial population you also need another point of reference you need something after certain amount of time gave you some quantity over here let's plug all of that in so after a certain amount of time so after ten years we have 30,000 people I'm gonna fill the right-hand side and then I'll put that 30,000 we started with 25,000 in 1970 after ten years we had 30,000 starting here we had ten years thirty thousand people we're trying to solve for our case so this is going to use a lot of logarithms we're undoing an exponential because we have that K up there so the first thing we're gonna want to do is divide so 30,000 divided by 25,000 looking at one point two equals e to the 10 K and we're gonna see this pattern a lot where you do a natural logarithm so Ln because we get that base of e and then we're gonna divide by whatever that time is so we're gonna get K equals natural log of this ratio the ending amount divided by our starting amount and so natural log of and divided my starting amount divided my time that's almost always an equal your K and that's about equal to looks like 0.01 eighty two three and it goes forever try not to round that a lot sometimes especially when we're dealing with Exponential's those little little teeny differences in the hundreds and the thousands and sometimes even the ten thousands can make a huge impact on population or if you're checking out like how long ago fourteen the carbon-14 is decaying well that can make a huge difference in your time so try not to round that a lot we're gonna round occasionally and so some of my answers might be different depend on how we're rounding especially if on your calculator you store that number that's probably the best practice in applications trying to round to the very very last step so let's do a little recap just to make sure everything is clicking because for the later examples we're not going to spend all this time doing it so here's the recap of what's going on we have dealt with separable equations now we're talking about some applications of these separable differential equations we know that a lot of natural growth and decay is proportional to the amount that you have well when we start doing are solving differential equations by separable separating our variables here we are going to get exponential every single time and we did that with population as well come up with this we realized that man in solving this that arbitrary constant is actually representing our initial population or initial amount of whatever you're talking about that's pretty cool so when we deal with our application problems and we get down to this far we need to basically know two pieces of information what our starting amount is and how much we have after a certain amount of time the hat will let you solve for K once you solve for K you're basically just augmenting this original formula a lot notice how this right here this required no information for us to do at all we just sent outfits you get down - here we go okay now we can augment this we can augment it with our initial population which we're gonna do right now it's gonna be 25,000 and then whatever K you solved for after you do that there's only one very now you can calculate what our population is at any given time or how long it's going to take you to achieve a certain population and that's really how a lot of these word problems are structured so do your calculus or don't teach calculus I mean it's they cover the same every time plug in your initial population plug in your amount after a certain amount of time find your K take your cave take your initial population and augment that formula then you're required to answer one or two questions what the population is after certain amount of time or what the time is going to need to be to get a certain population that happens almost exclusively so we're going to finish our problem we're almost done erase all of our calculus because we've talked about it at length and then we're going to go through and solve it for whatever question we need to answer here so we know that our population according to time we had a initial population that's 25,000 et to the KT but we now know our K notice how our K is positive our K being positive means that our population is growing oh yeah Hey look here was 25,000 or 30,000 it should be more in 2010 if it was decreed negative we would be decreasing the population so this this fraction if you want mana this is gonna go way back in time for you but you remember how natural log looks remember how natural log is negative before you get to ln 1 @ ln 1 at 0 and after that is positive so that one more time natural logs look like that before your argument is 1 your negative after your argument is 1 your positive so this ratio tells you whether you are increasing or decreasing if this number is bigger than this number obviously you're gonna get more than one so your case can be positive it's showing you that you're growing that's kind of an obvious statement but that's how the math is working if this number is less than this number that means that your initial population has decreased over time well L n is something that's less than one is negative which means that you're going to be having this natural became when we solve for exponential of course we get our inverses are inverses would look like that for growth or that for decay that's already listed that for decay so anyhow has a little bit of explanation about why our K is positive or negative based on whether we are increasing or decreasing over time I hope that makes sense to you now now that we have our problems well our formulas structure for this specific problem when we can answer pretty much anything we want based on these two things whether we're solving for a population given a time or a time given a population in this question we're asking if the population grows exponentially here it is here's the constant that it's growing at find the population in 2010 please don't plug in 2010 because what that's gonna do is take two thousand ten years from where this problem started so if our T equals zero our initial population is based on 1970 our x gotta be based on that also so our T is not 2010 cluttered T is 40 because 2010 is 40 years past when we started the problem in 1970 where ever took our an initial population so 2010 translates to T equals 40 years let's just plug in 40 so the population after 40 years is what this represents we started with 25,000 we know we're going exponentially according to some constant of variation and we've given this 40 years to grow that's exactly what that formula means in plain English once we do that looks like we'll have around 50 1840 living in this talent ask yourself that's making sense you understand that do you understand that even though this says proportional when I take my integrals I'm going to get an exponential based on the fact that if that's the first power I'm always going to get an LM and solving that if you're always going to get it e raises some power do you understand that do you understand that it's going to take two pieces information to solve for your cave in initial population and that that is represented by your see that the same concepts here and you'll need an amount after a time once you get that we solve for K plug those two things in augment this formula and then insult anything you want that you're going to be asked about it let's move on to the next one so a lot of times with these wheels this happens especially in half life you have a not necessarily a specific population that you after sir my time but it says that you've multiplied or you've decreased by a fraction or you have a certain percentage so I'm going to show you how to structure that problem because these are basically the two things that you have so imagine that we've got some bunnies and you know what bunnies do and after six months or after ten months they have increased six-fold that means there's six times as many bunnies as you started with after ten months we're not gonna go through this process of doing the integrals every single time again done that this is all about structuring the problem and understanding what it's asking you so let's go ahead and try to figure out how we can represent this problem in that formula because we know that this is based on population growth we're going to assume that it's based on this natural growth and decay so it's based on this formula here so that we did our whole integration same thing could happen here I just don't want to do it again well we need a couple pieces of information we need where we started we need how much we have after a certain amount of time when you're not given a specific a specific initial population or initial amount that you have you're probably being given a factor sort of problem like hey we increased by a factor of six or we decreased by a factor of 1/2 or we decreased by a factor of 5% what that means is that you kind of have an easier sort of a set up everything's gonna happen at once so if our bunny population increased six-fold that's a 600% increase or multiplied by six give yourself a very easy starting population like one now of course bunnies can't replicate with we're not going to go into the birds and the bees with you but so maybe you don't start with one day you start with a hundred or a thousand or a million or it doesn't matter because the the way that this is set up if we start with 100 bunnies in ten months so T is representing months here in ten months you will have six-fold six times that well what's 6 times 100 600 now you could be asked this question a different way we're doing it you have a six hundred percent growth after ten months or you know six times the amount of bunnies in ten months or if you're decaying you have half the amount of radioactive material in 5,700 four years or you have you want the level of radiation is 100 times which you what is okay so what do we want 1 over 100 for our level of radiation though that's a very common n so that's a sort of we're increasing or decreasing by a factor so a lot of these fall into two camps one you're given specific numbers specific initial populations and one that you're not you're given an increase in six-fold or two times or half the amount that goes into this idea so when you're given this this sort of an idea you need how much factor wise after a certain amount of time now I'm gonna get into the why I used to a number one rather than 600 the very first thing you would do to solve for K notice we can there's only one variable if there's gonna be really easy the first thing you would do is you divide by a hundred so if we divided both sides by 100 you are going to get 6 equals 1 e to the 10 K it doesn't matter how much you start with so think something easy make something like 1 then if you have to cut it in half well there'd be 1/2 if you have to multiply by 6 well there's six it makes things really really nice so I wouldn't even I wouldn't even write six hundred and 100 I would have definitely one write some crazy numbers like I don't know it's seven point two and fourteen point four that that's that's that's crazy what do I do that we know that if we're going to increased six-fold whatever we start with one is going to be multiplied by six that's how the second class of problems is structured hopefully that helps you because otherwise you go I don't I don't know how to where do I start how much do I start with doesn't matter doesn't matter because you're multiplying by six to figure out the amount that you're going to have in ten months that's kind of cool so let's solve it we know that all these are the same thing if they're based on natural growth and decay it's going to be exponential we know that we have an initial amount I know we have a certain amount after a certain amount of time with sulfur K so when we solve for K we'll have Ln of six equals by the way do you know that our case gonna be positive because our pending amounts larger that are started about it's going to be greater than one so natural log of 6 is going to equal 10 K so k equals natural log of 6 over 10 and that's about that's about 0.179 let's admit the problem here so if we have population with respect to time equals in initial population now here's the only only drawback is that if you don't have an actual initial population you really can't answer questions like how much are you gonna have in this amount of time because you don't know where you're starting so so those problems are sure off the table but they're not going to ask you that it's actually things like okay how long did it take to double or how long is it going to take to double or how long is it going to take to reach ten times the amount with those sort of questions we can't answer so we well we don't have an initial population we now can answer certain other questions so we have a our population is based on how much to start with but our constant of variation right now our constant of growth is 0.179 times how many months we have now they could tell you this suppose you started with ten bunnies how much will you have in whatever months you could do that but a lot of times if they're not giving you an initial population because you could have just use that earlier if they're not given an initial population they'll ask you things like how longs it take to double they don't have to but that's very common so we have looked at this we've said hey our populations increasing six-fold in ten months that lets us solve for K that lets us plug that back in now something we can use if I gave you an initial population and a time you can find out how many bunnies they're gonna be in that amount of months in this case for us we'll say how long did it take for the population to double should it be more than ten months or less than ten months well obviously I mean it increased six-fold in ten months to increase twofold or double should be significantly less than ten months and that's what it's asking so once we know that how long did it take to for a population level once we know that it doesn't matter where we start doubling is just going to be twice that amount whether you have one and two or a million and two million or five and ten it doesn't matter you're going to get this ratio of to one and then we can solve for T very nicely we know that we take a natural log so Ln two equals zero one one seven ninety if we divide by that one point one seven nine because at three point seven three point eight seven so these bunnies this population of bunnies based on this information would double in three point eight seven months so in under four months so you know that when you started with whatever this population was that in three point eight seven months you had double the bunnies is that making sense to you guys get in it if you do fantastic you're really grasping if not you might want to go back to what separable equations are see how they're solved every time when you have just a power one right right here see the natural log see that you're going to get an exponential every time because if it's the question is where's that coming from it's not okay right now okay that's coming from just an integral of one over your variable and you're getting Ln of that variable and then you're doing that e on both sides okay so that that's important for that to be okay in your head after that ask yourself do you understand of the two types of two main types of problems we're going to get then we need either an initial population and we need a population after certain amount of time or we need a factor sort of problem increased by six hundred percent or multiplied by six or cut in half after certain amount of time we always solve for our K first and then we use that with typically initial population or some other sort of factor to solve for a time or a time to solve for how much we have we have a lot more examples and I'm going to get back in just a minute let's do our next two examples this next one says and this is very common with this this radiocarbon dating an old femur so they found this old them has one sixth of the 14c or carbon-14 as a modern femur of the same species has what's the age and then they tell you a half-life of carbon-14 is 5,700 years what that means is this every 5,700 years the carbon-14 in this item changes into I think it's carbon-12 and not I can't remember but it depletes itself so it's a radioactive sort of carbon so it's it loses the amount so if they had like a gram of it then after 5,700 years in the half a gram after another 5,700 years there would be a quarter of a gram that is exponential decay that's what's happening here so theoretically you never never lose all of it it just cuts in half every 5,700 years so let's let's figure out how old this is and I want you to ask the question right now just see if you can classify this is this one of those problems where they're giving you a specific starting amount or is this one of the problems were they giving you a factor after a certain amount of time well if you think about it this is the factor after certain amount of time I mean it's literally dealing with half after time that that right there that's a factor sort of a problem now a lot of students running to the mistake here of going well I'm gonna use the one-sixth right off the bat let's talk about why we can't all right so are we going to be using exponential growth and decay of course should our can be positive or negative it should be negative because we're decaying here and specifically because you're starting with one and after a certain amount of time you have half that portion of what you had compared to what you started with is less than one Ln of less than one and zero you're gonna have a negative K here after certain number time so let's talk about why this is not OK so are we using exponential growth and decay of course the amount present after number of years is based on the initial amount and we're gonna have that same formula that we've been dealing with this is not going to give us for all of these examples pretty much we altered a little bit for cooling now which one do we use well in order to figure out your K with a factor sort of a problem like you're increasing by the fact or decreasing by factor in order to figure out your K you need the factor but you also need the time so even if we knew that we were starting with let's say 1 and decreasing tu-160 amount we don't know how long that took us so you can put one here in one sixth year but you don't have that T that's literally what the question is asking how long did it take to go from the full amount to one six the amount based at that so this is down a rabbit trail we can't get out of use something when you're talking about factoring factor sort of problems are you increasing to a factor or decreasing by to a fraction that's a factor use something that gives you both that factor and the time so almost all the time and half-life problems you start with the half-life I'm saying almost because there's there's always an exception I mean they're word problems so there's lots of different cases here but try this first start with your half-life first that will find your K because it's giving you how much you start with a hundred percent how much you have after a certain amount of time a factor of that fifty percent so we can just do after five thousand seven hundred years if we started with 100 percent or one gram or you do a million here we'd have half of that so 50 percent or one half or half a million if I said a million this right here puts our half-life in perspective according to this formula it says after certain amount of time this is your vector that's how to solve for your K once we've done that then we can go back and answer the other questions so let's do it natural log of 1/2 all look at that you got to know this this right here that you have you decreased is going to be your K is negative Ln of a number that's less than one is going to be negative equals 5700 k if you divide by 5700 K is about its nasty negative zero point 1 2 3 zeros 1 2 1 6 0 5 let's say one more time because we saw in the last example of it if if this ratio where you start with 2 where you end with if this number increases your kid is positive because that ratio will be more than 1 ellen:oh more than 1 is positive if the ratio is less than 1 so this amount of decreases well then your Ln is less than 1 and you can have a negative number Ln of native the numbers between 0 & 1 are negative your case gonna be negative since we're dealing with such a long time here this K is really important to write a lot of a lot of numbers are being around it I always say just don't round it store that number in your calculator and use it later so let's othman to our formula so the amount of radioactive material that we're going to have this C 14 is based on the starting amount eetu the now we have a k times however many years no i mentioned also that on these problems the next thing is going to ask you for one of two situations how much you're going to have after certain amount of time or how much time you need to reach a certain amount this is the latter of those two so this is a factor sort of where you had a certain amount left after a certain amount of time or you have a certain amount that you're gaining after certain mount of time and then ask you the next question there's no amount that we have here I don't I don't know what that how much milligrams the head of that but they're asking you well if if the femur has won six of the original amount then what's the time now I can fill that out well that's let's try the trainer here on your own you can that's and that's based on this factor idea so going from a mount to a factor of it so or a fraction of it in this case so increasing by a factors what I mean so six fold to fold twice the amount five times ml or half the amount one-third the amount whatever here we say you know what this bone were it had a hundred percent or one one hundred percent that's the same thing of its c14 when that this organism died it stopped in taking that that that carbon element and then it started losing that so how much it has now is one-sixth the amount and if we solve for T that's saying how long does it take based on this constant of decay exponential decay for a hundred percent of your carbon-14 to be reduced to one six bit amount so that's it's asking that well it's only it's only a fraction of it so how we how we get in that let's do the natural logarithm well we're gonna get negative 0.0001216 o5t and if we divide by that nasty K T is about hey that's a negative number natural logarithm of no vs. and one our negative between 0 & 1 or negative and that's a negative number so when we divide the negative by negative we're gonna get an actual year I'm out here I got around fourteen thousand seven hundred thirty four years so according to the math here if this is all accurate and if the the amount of c14 hasn't altered drastically in the atmosphere for the last forty seven ten years or when if it has altered drastically if it was continuous then this would have happened so we know that the exponential decay would for you guys went decay like this we know that the king would be negative and it sure is because we've had half Ln of one half as negative and then we can use it saying how do we go from this to it before to just a fraction of that or a multiplication factor here so how do we go from 1 to a factor of 1 times 1/6 divided by your K they're done we get about fourteen thousand seven hundred thirty four years next one so we need to give this a drug to a kid to maybe help them with some sort of disorder or help them with something or unnecessary or whatever it may be so the certain drug has to be at this this proportion of forty five milligrams per kilogram so that means the heavy you are the more that your body needs for this to be effective and the lighter you are well the less that you need so obviously we don't really want to over those people but we want it to be effective so we're gonna have to structure this to be effective and we want this to be effective for one hour so as soon as it drops to below forty five milligrams per kilogram of body weight it's gonna stop being as effective as it needs to be does that make sense so we're were at a certain point the amount in drug in your and the body here is not gonna work over that point it works we don't want to go too much because then it's going to work too long so imagine if you had to had necessarily you're necessary in density the person who that's people hundred and you just go I'm just gonna give them a ton of drugs they're gonna be under for a long time maybe forever because there's a half-life to drugs there's just amount of time that passes and the drugs start where they wear off so if the half-life is five hours how long how much drugs do we need to make this effective for this particular weight child so that they wear out for one hour you don't want us randomly give them drugs because either they're not going to be as effective or they're gonna be too effective and have the effect way too long so let's start looking at this as what type of problem it is let's up let's see em firstly if this has a half-life it probably structured on this natural decay let's start with our same sort of effect so how about we have the amount of the drug after time is based on the initial amount that you're giving and it's exponential growth or decay now this is a half-life think about whether that K should be positive or negative it's got a half-life it's decaying so it's dropping that case should be negative and we're gonna see that just a little bit secondly thinking about whether this is an amount idea at first or if it's a sort of a multiplying by a factor idea well let's look this looks like an amount so we need 45 milligrams per kilogram the effective okay how much to begin for a 50 kilogram child so the fix we're after wear off after one hour I see an hour that's a time but I don't have an initial amount I also don't have how much is there after that hour so this is not an initial value problem it's in this initial amount of problem this is a unit have light so the path length of this drug is five hours using a half-life will solve your ok for you so this starts off with a you're multiplying by a factor idea so we start with one you're having one half after five hours do you see how that's working do you see how if you have the full amount Hunter said and you have half of it 50% for one half after five hours the only thing that's left is K those half length problems work like that almost exclusively so start with the half-life idea solve for your K and then go back and try to answer your question let's let's do that now if you haven't done it I would suggest you guys do it of course I'll do it right now so if our half-life is 5 hours I know that from the full amount 100% which is 1 1 and 100 cents same thing we wouldn't have half after 5 hours easy to solve notice how your case gonna be negative element of 1/2 equals 5k man we've got a 10k and a 5k I like running so we have K equals element 1/2 over 5 that's about oh let's see negative it shoots negative element of numbers less than 1 or between 0 and 1 our negative point 1 3 8 6 let's now augment our formula you'll notice that I didn't put an initial note because this questions it's not really asking it's not really asking how much is going to be there after certain amount of time this question is asking this how much do you need to start with in order for this to be gone or two for the this drug to wear off after one hour so this is the third case it's rare that this only using word River it doesn't happen as much as the other ones where you're looking for a starting amount to satisfy how much you're gonna have after certain amount of time so there's really this three cases two of them happened often where you you're asked how long does it take to reach a fraction or factor of a certain amount how much time it takes or given a certain amount of time how much are we gonna have this is the last one doesn't happens off with another two but it says okay you have to have a certain amount after a certain amount of time what do you need to start with and that's what this is asking you well we got to be a little bit smart about figuring that out so we're gonna be solving that we know that we want this drug to be ineffective after one hour so we know that's going to be one that's what this says so we need this to wear out after one hour so after one hour we're gonna have to have a certain amount how much sure to start with you need to figure out what that certain amount is so what this drug is doing I don't know what the drugs actually doing but what this drug is decaying and it says and ineffective that it says that if you are at forty five milligrams per kilogram that is the threshold for effectiveness more than that your effective less than that your ineffective so the bare minimum amount would need to be 45 kilograms for half of 45 milligrams sorry for how many kilograms that body is in this case it's 50 so we multiply 45 times 50 that's the amount of the drug that needs to be in the body at a barest minimum and then right under that so like a second later it's going to start becoming ineffective that is 2250 2250 milligrams think through that again it needs this much per kilogram hey kid weighs that much you're gonna need this much or more to be effective right after that it starts being ineffective so what this question is asking you is I need that amount to be present after one hour so it's a slightly different take on this I need this much I mean this wants to be there after one hour the question is how much do you need to start with and that's a valid that's a great question for the snare because you if you know how much you need after an hour you're gonna want to know how much to give them an hour beforehand and that's a good thing what's the initial amount of that drug that you need to give not particularly hard to solve none of these are really all that hard to solve it's just that the setup can be difficult so in this case it's yeah half left great selfie okay but where do you plug your numbers in well you need 2,250 milligrams of the stroke for it to be effective that's the threshold here and you want that to be in the body after one hours so that it starts wearing off after one hour you said I want this to be my end after one hour of course we're gonna administer more than that because the drug is decreasing over time it's got a half-life to it so if we take 2250 and we divide by this whole side that's gonna give us an amount of the drug I got a brown 2585 so we would administer for this child's weight we would administer 2585 milligrams of whatever this is it's going to start decreasing immediately it's got a half-life of five hours after one hour it will reach the point of 2250 which is exactly the proportion of 45 milligrams two kilograms for this particular body so this this drug is going to start being less effective at that point that's the way that these there's three cases two more very I smoked that before there's really two main ones this is the third one kind of hidden in there but it can really trip you up if you're not paying attention to what's being asked here I hope that would make sense to you and we'll come back with a couple problems in a minute all right back at it let's talk about another one and I want you to try if you can to do it on your own so we have managed to have two of them up here see if you can read through these see if you can figure out if it's a you're multiplying by a factor over a certain amount of time or if you're giving an initial value and you're given a time where you reach another value anyhow see if you can structure these appropriately start with your exponential growth or decay models see if you can find the K first augment your formula and see if you can go through and try it at least on that one this one is Newton's law of cooling and so it's a little different let's show you the derivation of where that comes from but if you've seen it before maybe even started if not it's okay we're gonna start right now on this so something happened and we have this level of cobalt that's dangerous so Cobalts this radioactive element and had a half-life five point two seven years right now the amount of cobalt there is 100 times what it should be and that's not good because you don't want that so when will it be okay well the world we do let's classify it is this a problem where we start with an initial amount or it's just a problem where we have this there's a you're taking it amount times some sort of factor so some sort of multiplication over certain my time most half-lives are the star the ladder so let's start with this exponential growth of decay we have half-life we're going to be decaying we still have an exponential model so with our half-life half-life automatically gives you how much you had to start with how much you have as a spent number times a factor so this multiplication concept over amount of time so we had 100% to start with and this is whatever couple we had and we have a half of it after five point two seven years that lets us sulfur Kate really nice notice that when we have this number smaller than this number your case can be negative so element of one-half equals five point two seven K and so K is element of one-half over 527 and that's about negative zero point one three one let's start changing our formula so now that we have our K we can start answering other questions notice how we can't answer the how much is actually there so we can't go in or would you probably want to go back and measure how much actual cobalt we we have so we know it's radioactive decay we know we're decaying this exponential decay of radioactive element we'd had that half-life we now know our K and now we don't have an initial value but we do have something else right now we know the level is 100 times what it should be now this is weird but we have how much we have now this initial value is 100 times what it should be if our initial value is 100 times what it should be then if it's 100 what we want is one hey yeah what we have now is 100 times what we wanted to be we want it to be a hundred times less or you can think about it this way you hoping you can see this leaving this up here hopefully you can see this if you divide both sides by 100 you say what we have now is one 100% that's not good we want it to be 100 times less than that so 100th of what it should be now do you see these are identical no matter how you think about it we have an amount we want it to be a fact it's that time some sort of number this factor less so this is a factor sort of problem locations half-life and then we don't have an initial value they have to be some sort of a how much you have times a factor gives you how much you need in a certain amount of time we're gonna find that time right now so we had this restriction okay we had our K we know that I need a hundred times less so this is a hundred times what I want it to be let's figure out how long it takes to get there if we do Ln of 1 over 100 of course we're going to get a negative number here which is fine because we're gonna be dividing by a negative number divided by that negative that's about 35 years so whenever this event happened 100 times the level of what we want for COBOL the 35 years later that will be an acceptable level level it's all based on the tip amount that you have time sort of some sort of factor and how long it took to get there okay next one so this has to do with mittens on cooling I spend a little bit more time on this problem the previous ones because this is the first one we had with Newton's law of cooling so I won't show you where that actually comes from in like a kouchi class or even some Calculon classes you might have seen Newton's law of cooling but chances are unless it I don't even know if I did it showed you the derivation of where that comes from you kind of just in that level of the class you kind of just get to this and you go yeah and I wake my hands and then magically we get Newton's law of cooling in there and you go what's the subtraction you go well I mean it's that's the sort of proportional to the difference between ambient and the temperature of the body but we're gonna get a little more specific here because that's the class so let's talk about this so your so the cam right now is 25 degrees Celsius you know I drink that maybe you want to be ice cold mmm good drink soda probably shouldn't it's better cold warm soda nasty so to save energy you're gonna be outside because it's cold outside right it might be cold outside where you are right now it let's say it's zero degrees Celsius so you're gonna take that and put it out there and you're gonna wait and so because you're the type of person that you are like like me it would be very specific you want to drink it when it's five degrees Celsius at that perfect temperature so not where you open and get the ice on it and just like man it's like a soda slushy I hate that but right before that boom so good well you measure the temperature because you're precise as I am and after 20 minutes it's 15 degrees Celsius so you want it perfect so you're going to time how long it's gonna take you to reach five degrees Celsius Newton's law of cooling is pretty cool and what Newton's law of cooling says is that the temperature the rate of change the temperature the rate of change of the temperature based on time is proportional to the difference between the ambient temperature and the temperature of the item you're trying to cool or heat that makes sense I suppose I mean if you had if you had some sort of if you had the soda cans somewhere even colder it's going to get colder faster but if you had it warmer it's gonna be colder slower so the way that something cools or warms is of course dependent on the the surrounding temperature we all know that if you drink coffee if you go out on a warmer day with a cup of coffee it stays nice and hot for a long time if you go out when it's icy cold you kind of chug it down because you're not signing to cold burn your mouth that's really awful but we know that the Weidman we know that the way that things cool or heat depends on the temperature around it and specifically the difference between what the temperature is outside and the temperature of the thing you're putting into it we'll say so how we're going to start this we're going to start with that just this basic idea that from from Newton's law of cooling the rate of change of your temperature with respect to time is proportional that means you get a constant to the ambient temperature minus the temperature of the item so in plain English the rate of change of the temperature of your item the object with respect to time is proportional that's always K times two the difference between the air or the medium that your your items in minus the temperature of your up to your actual object let's go through the calculus and see why we have a subtraction in here let's see why we have the formula we do so is this still a separable equation absolutely a is not variable a your ambient temperature is a constant so if your room is 75 degrees we're going to assume it's 75 degrees for the remaining remainder of this or if it's zero degrees outside we're gonna assume that zero degrees for the life of this this example so that's a constant that is a variable oh my god just that variable let's separate this let's leave our to this constant on the right and let's move this thing to the left let's do an integral you know how to do integrals based on these separable equations that's a natural log because that's our only variable but notice how we have that negative so that's important here so when we do the natural log do it you sub in your head or just think that I'm gonna get natural log of the absolute value of a minus T but I'd be dividing by that negative the derivative that's negative 1 we're gonna get a negative on the right hand side we get the familiar KT plus c1 let's let's start moving around some of our our signs so let's make this negative go away from left hand sides divide by a negative or multiply we have an element you should know what to do now since we have a natural logarithm trying to solve for T here let's take that and put a so absolute value of a minus T equals e to the negative KT minus c1 we also have these exponents are being added you're adding a negative so let's separate that let's get rid of an absolute value what else can we do well that lead to that plus or minus e to the negative see what looks pretty nasty let's just call that an arbitrary constant then let's solve for T because a is not even a variable is your is your ambient temperature the surrounding temperature that you have let's solve for T the temperature of the item that we want now now that we've got that let's see what we can do with our problem so that that's a workable equation we just did our our integrals based on that separating our variables we got down to solving for our temperature and this looks pretty familiar I hope that this looks familiar so when we when you had like a calc 2 level you just saw something like this where you had ambient temperature minus some sort of changing temperature based on the surrounding air and then that's that's pretty neat we're now able to solve for stuff like see here let's see what we have so this is not one of the factor type of problems where you're multiplying something times a factor and you have you have some sort of I had one I now have one half after certain time this is an initial initial value sort of a problem where we start at a temperature source so the can is 25 degrees that's a temperature so the the item that we're talking about to so we can the temperature the soda can is 25 degrees okay to say manager we put outside at 0 degrees our ambient temperature 0 degrees so we can fill out 25 degrees we can fill out ambient temperature and that's how we start at time 0 so do you remember what we need to have for things that are not those factor time problems we need to have an initial value and then we also need to have a value after time so our initial value at time 0 at time 0 we know that the temperature is 25 degrees we know that the ambient doesn't change it's never gonna change is constant at 0 degrees and so we can fill this out and we can solve this for C so if our temperature and time 0 right when you put it out there the temperature the soda can is five degrees so at T of zero so time is zero we have 25 our ambient is zero we have negative Siva we have e to the negative K times zero because that's our first little secondly we put it out there does that make sense I hope that makes sense to you that our temperature McCann's this our ambient temperatures this we don't have our C but we can solve it and with initial values like this your first job is to solve for your C then we use the next piece of information to solve for y or K that's how we did it in the first one what was it one or two examples so if we solve this for C we go okay well 25 equals well this is all one needed C so C equals negative 25 which means that if we plug this back in if we start augmenting this this problem the temperature based on time is equal to our and mint - our arbitrary constant so basically that the negative of our our temperature for initial temperature e to the negative KT let's keep on going well we're certainly negative we got addition we can also put in the ambient right now since that's not changing let's just make that zero it's a really convenient problem because if it wasn't zero of course you'd have a number there so if you put this inside a refrigerator where it wasn't zero degrees Celsius or something you'd have a different situation any harder not really it's just going to be a number right there so not a not a huge issue now now we've used just the initial value of this we knew that it was 25 degrees at time zero we knew the ambient temperature we were able to solve for C now on this on these type of problems is class of problems you need another piece of information you know what the temperature is after certain amount of time why if I know the temperature after certain amount of time I can solve for K let's do that we know that we know that after 20 minutes we're gonna have a temperature of the soda can of 15 degrees Celsius so we'd have 15 degrees Celsius after 20 minutes and we see that we can solve for K here so we divide both sides by 25 so 15 divided by 25 as three-fifths equals e to the negative 20k we're solving for K so do your natural log Ln of three-fifths is going to be negative negative twenty is also negative so you go wait a minute I've thought I thought that we were gonna be decreasing we are because in the formula itself we have that negative K so when you find this K it's positive because when you plug it in it's going to change to negative so that negative isn't showing up here because we already know that this from our formula where you have that negative K in there if your temperature was increasing actually you get a negative K here and then that would become positive so you put the soda can and a microwave I'm not a microwave another to put an oven and say the same temperature why you do that I don't know what would you warm so that whatever so if you did that well then you have this ratio of temperature would be increasing this would be more than one this would be a positive this would be a positive divided by negative the K would be negative but when you plugged it in it would be a positive case showing you growth that's what would happen there for us we have our K is about zero point zero two five five so let's go ahead let's change our let's change our formula that we're working with and then we can finally answer the last question so our temperature with respect to time is based on an initial or sorry an ambient temperature that's zero our initial temperature based on a time of zero but the opposite of that and now we have negative whatever our K was and this asks when will it be at five degrees Celsius so this is the other opportunity for us to answer the question based on initial value initial Italy started him out that we had we did the other one with the bunnies where we said oh well how no I guess that was a little different first example is this one where we said how much will there be in a certain amount of time like bunnies were sort of like that how much will there be in a certain amount of time here and we can find him out this is asking how long it will take to achieve this amount so we put this all together we say okay now after 20 minutes 15 degrees Celsius or soft fur ok cool when will it be 5 degrees Celsius when is a time so how long is it going to take for us to be at 5 let some plug-in that five for the temperature that we wanted to be if we solve for T of course we're going to divide by 25 first Ln on both sides and if we divide by negative zero point zero two five five we get this Ln or 1/5 sure divided by negative sure that makes sense because negative divided by negative is gonna give us a positive time and that's about looks like 63 minutes after 20 minutes is 15 degrees after 63 minutes it's gonna be a 5 degrees that can't wait that long I can't wait that I'd probably put it over ice you know so we can save myself the whole math problem it's really I mean you get the soda like I don't want to do math to show you my soda probably should get nice anyway I hope it's making sense to you I hope you understand the concepts that we're trying to say this there's two main classes of these problems where you have a x factor solver k and then you can answer a variety push it up that already have an initial value use that solve for k and then you have another one sorry use that assault for your scene and then you have another set where you have an amount after time to solve your K the the only other one I give you that kind of special case where we had the how much do you need start with to achieve an amount after a certain time those are not as common they do happen let's move on to a couple more let's get start on two more problems barometric pressure is the the way that the pressure changes as we consider the weight of gravity oh sorry they grew the weight that gravity puts the atmosphere on to us so the lower you are towards sea level the more pressures there because gravity sort of stacks the atmosphere on top of us or around us and pushes it down but the higher we get well the less effect that the atmosphere you're gonna have there's less gravity the further we go away from our earth and the atmosphere is less and less dense so there's less and less pressure so that's measured in in inches of mercury and so what we know is that barometric pressure is given by this differential equation the rate of change of barometric pressure with respect to how many miles you're above the sea level is given by negative 0.2 whatever the pressure is well what that means for us is that as we go higher our pressures decreasing let's go ahead and let's obey the initial pressure so barometric pressure at 0 miles above so at sea level is 29.92 inches of mercury what's it gonna be 15 inches so at 15 inches we either need special training or breathing apparatus to be able to manage that so some sort of special stuff and all about but I think it's kinda cool so let's figure out where that is let's go through all the calculus let's separate our variables that see what what actually happens here when we start doing the the math behind and see what happens to our numbers how this is going to be exponential decay as we go higher and higher in our atmosphere according to our pressure so let's start with what they've given us already is it differential equation can you separate the variables let's do it so we're going to move our B we're gonna leave our constant we're going to move our DX and we're going to integrate them we're gonna do that inverse of a natural logarithm which is e to the negative zero point two x times e to the c1 we know that we can separate those exponents by multiplication common bases if we know that we can do the plus and minus to remove our absolute value we have our e to the C sub one we can wrap this all up in a nice arbitrary constant so the barometric pressure based on how many miles we're above sea level is some arbitrary constant e to the negative zero point to X let's talk about the other arbitrary constant so our arbitrary constant should end up being our initial pressure or the pressure at zero and we can see it right now so when we plug in zero miles above sea level and we said yes there are zero miles below sea level this whole thing is 1 and we notice that C is our initial pressure if you wanna think about that way or the pressure at zero miles it's 29.92 inches of mercury so this is that amount it's right there for so very much like initial population so let's automate our formula we know that barometric pressure with respect to miles above sea level is our base amount 29.92 inches of mercury e to the negative zero point two x and now it's really easy to answer the next question so this was problems are kind of getting easier here we just do some basic calculus we don't run the same exact model that we've had before but now it's asking us hey when's our going to be fifteen inches when how many miles above the sea level do we need to be in order to reach fifteen inches of mercury so are this is one of those ones or says how long or what what do we need to be at to achieve a certain amount we already know where we start so if we put in our 15 for how much we want our pressure to be in this case we didn't even have to solve for K look they gave it to us they gave us the cave that was pretty nice we'd have to do anything for that so they're gonna give you a difference in equation and they not even giving you a K you don't even need that value that's it's already given to you as well look what you do need though I mean they didn't give me the K they'll also give you the initial value so they've basically done that work for you all we need to do is some basic integral and then we have to understand the idea that we're solving for the amount of miles to reach that 15 inches of mercury here let's divide notice how you have a ratio here that's less than one your natural logarithm is going to be negative but when you divide by negative you'll get a positive and we'll have that many miles above the sea level so natural log of 15 over 29.92 equals negative zero point two X if we divide by negative zero point two we're gonna get about these three points something three point four five miles if you want to change that to feet just multiply x thousand two hundred eighty and get around 18,000 feet so right at about 18,000 feet we start getting really pretty so low pressure really hard to breathe be well not hard to breathe but you're not you feel like you need to breathe more and more because there's less density up there's less pressure that means there's less density of the the molecules we need to survive as far as our ears concerns so we probably need some sort of breathing apparatus or if you get altitude sickness that can happen and as we start getting higher and higher so interesting problem we get we now know that above that that amount of three point four five miles above sea level so eighteen thousand roughly feet we started getting some pretty low barometric pressure all right big mouth person discovers a secret or a treasure if you want and after one week 10,000 people in your town of a hundred thousand to know about the discovery of the treasure earth now of course the more people that know about your treasure the more likely that someone's probably gonna rob you because not everyone is as integrity as we all try to be so let's see about how long it's gonna take you don't half the people know know this the only reason why we're doing this problem it's not that it's specifically hard but the setup is a little weird so we need to kind of start from scratch here we're not gonna really be able to jump into our full exponential I didn't tell me think about this the rate of change of those who know our proportion of those who don't now when we look at this sort of a problem this is not a multiplying by a factor problem this is a you start with a certain amount of people who know that's zero at time zero and then all of a sudden someone's discovers it and then after one week we have 10,000 people so this is one of those problems where we have an initial value and then after certain amount of time we have something else we have another amount that we know so that's structured this is not a you multiply by a factor idea and then we're going to say how long and how long so fine at a time how long does it take for this amount of no but let's start by trying to find out a differential equation so the rate of change of those people who know is proportional those people who don't know start with the rate of change the rate of change of people who know with respect to time that's the rate of show how many people the rate of change of people knowing with respect to time is performed not use K let's use T for treasure know about the treasure if you will so the rate of change of the people who know about the treasure with respect to time is proportional which is pi cut use K we're gonna have a constant of variation here this constant proportionality it's proportional to well what's it proportional rate change of those you know are forcible to those who don't know well we don't know how many people earn the talent at the beginning that's how many people don't know but every time someone knows it it gets subtracted from that amount so one person knows you'd subtract one from the amount of 100,000 and you find people who don't know if 10,000 people know then 90,000 people don't know so the rate of change of those who know about the treasure is proportional to those who don't know those who don't know are the people who are left from those who do know that's the hardest part of this problem is understanding that the rate of change of those who know about the treasure with a strength of time is proportional to there's that many people in the town there's that many people who know so subtract them proportional those who do not know that's the amount of people who don't know about the treasure after that it's a separable equation you can separate the variables I would encourage you to do that right now separate the variables to do your do your integral and then the last little bit here so let's move our tea with our DT BT for treasure little T for time if we integrate both sides on the right-hand side we get ke T plus C sub one on the left-hand side we have the same sort of an idea with Ln idea we've had before we'd have an Ln absolute value 100,000 minus T but we have been negative due to the use of that we got in there and the derivative of the inside being negative let's start moving some stuff around so natural log of absolute value 100,000 minus the treasure knowers equals negative KT minus C sub 1 same thing we've done before let's make our our natural logarithm go away with that e raise both sides let's separate this when we do it we've done many times before let's do a plus and minus here so 100,000 minus T equals plus or minus this thing that's going to become our main arbitrary constant here's my hope for you right now my hope is that all this make it absolutely perfect sense to you because you've done it so much but more than that that you understand the concept this is the hardest part understanding how to represent the rate of change is based on some sort of a proportion or the comparison of another amount that's the hardest part when inventing your own differential equation it's been saying how the structure works now let's keep on going so after we have this well we can really I mean you can solve that for T if you want to but you you don't even really need to because we're only really concerned about how long how long until half no notice that if we solve for T right now to solve for big T those you know the treasure we solve for those who know the treasure we're gonna be asking how long and just a little bit longer so we'd have to end up altering the formula anyway you can lean it just like this if you really want to no need to solve for that team I'm gonna show you that right now so just another idea that we can start plugging in the stuff to solve for R K and then solve our final answer so whenever we're software C than arcaded or balancer so whenever we're doing these you're given an initial value and then hey you know how much up to certain amount of time your first fool is a soul for the C with your initial value and then solve for your K with the piece of information that's given you an amount after certain amount of time so right now we've got to solve for that C so let's look at how that works a person with the big mouth discover the treasure in a town of a hundred thousand after one week ten thousand people knew about the treasure so wait a minute where's the initial value how many people know at times zero zero so right when the sit right as The Situation's happening someone goes treasurer will write at that moment no one knew that person discovered it right after time zero so at time zero nobody knew let's plug that in so at time zero nobody nearly so one hundred thousand minus zero equals C times e to the negative K times zero we always use the initial value to solve for R seeing families of problems like this RC here is the size of the town then the amount of people who don't know about the treasure initially or specifically one hundred thousand let's alter our our formula now so we know that 100,000 minus the amount of people know about the treasure equals 100,000 e to the negative KT team now we're ready to use a second piece of information to solve for the K and then we can find out how long it takes up half the people know so let's do that so the second piece of information is after one week so we know a time 10,000 people knew so we know a team don't think we won't know was that cake-like ass off for that 10,000 people new out of the town of 100,000 based on the fact that 100,000 people didn't know when we started and it took one week so T is based on weeks right here took one week for that to happen in other words 90,000 people didn't know based on that 100,000 people we started with after one week that gives you a fraction there a ratio a proportion of people who didn't know or people who didn't know two people who didn't know at the start after a certain amount of time do you see your logarithms gonna be negative you see them do you see that right now our K is negative and so when we when we get R K we should have a well we'll have a positive K but when we plug it in will be negative the amount of people who don't know is decreasing about people who do know it's increasing and so let's solve that let's solve for K so when we divide by 100,000 on both sides we'll get nine tenths if we do Ln on both sides that gives us negative KS and I said she was one one week so K is negative Ellen of nine tenths that's around so our K is positive point one zero five four this is negative negative times negative is a positive let's alter our formula to make sure that we have this stuff down so we have 100,000 minus T equals 100,000 some of the people who don't know e to the negative because our K was negative right here so our K is positive yes but when we plug it into our function that worked well our equation that we're trying to use we have a negative of whatever we found so negative zero point one zero five 14 now we can use it answer the last part so how long will it take us for half the people to know our town is 100,000 people so how much is half of that well it's 50,000 people so we're looking for the time that this is 50,000 or how could you do it differently yeah you can make a portion out of it and use it like a wonderful defined by factor problems this one I just didn't do that way so 100,000 minus 50,000 easy to that same exact stuff getting kind of lazy I suppose when I subtract this we get that he grant if we divide by a hundred thousand we're gonna get one-half oh my gosh it is a factor sort of problem it just had some numbers in there so we got that Helen on both sides that's gonna be element one-half divided by that negative point one zero five four we have a negative divided by a negative and let's see a line of 1/2 divided by that's six point five seven weeks or about 46 days if you multiply by seven and so either way you want to go and that's the way we structure that so I hope these are making sense I hope you understand the idea that all these are be some basic differential equations are all separable we can always get an ln of that one variable that means we're going to get an e that means exponential growth or decay and the sign of our constant of variation there it one last one we'll talk about Newton's law of cooling one more time there'll be kind of a shorter bunks about and explored that and then we'll be good to go let's go ahead and tackle our last problem so our last well be here let's say and I've always been interested in like the crime-scene investigator sort of stuff how much did the FBI I was like I do criminal justice for like a year enjoyed it but then I just didn't didn't want to go through them I'd like to teach in math more so went that route but I've always been fascinated by it and so I'd watch the like CSI and CIS and all that sort of stuff I think it's kind of cool but that's sort of gruesome and messy and things but it always interests me how interested me how they found the time of death and so when I did this problem with that that was pretty cool the first time years ago but this is sort of the idea that they would go through they would check temperatures and they would do news all cooling based on the ambient temperature so we're going to do that one last time so let's say you walk into the room as a as a homicide detective or ins as an investigator and you see that the temperature of the room is thermostat controlled and it's 70 degrees someone's looking comfortably and the body was found at 12 a.m. told the morning that was 80 degrees so you took a internal body temperature of 80 degrees and you kept on checking it and after one hour the temperature has dropped 75 degrees and the room has stayed the same temperature that is key you have to assume that the room is not increasing temperature or decreasing and staying the same that's important that's got to be held constant so considering that the normal human body temperature is 98.6 degrees can we estimate the time of death that's gonna be perfect no remember that it going back to the very very beginning none of this is really perfect because differential equations isn't concerned with perfect differential equations most of the time is concerned with approximating good enough so that it's useful you see if we wanted to be perfect we'd have equations that are so crazy then we couldn't solve them and the real world has lots of variables in it so is the room going to be perfect at 70 degrees Fahrenheit probably not in fact as the body loses heat the room gains heat so it's probably increasing temperature minuscule e depending the size of the room so when we find this out at the very end it's an estimate it's fairly accurate but it's an estimate so what we're going to do we're installing new is law of cooling I'm not going to reinvent the wheel we've already done that in this video just a little while to go what we're going to do is take this and it's a very quick example just kind of a out window it's a fun walking on you know on this but an interesting one of these so the way that the temperature of a body cools or any object is what I mean by body is a proportion it's proportional to the difference between the ambient temperature and the initial temperature of that that body we found that out a little early so now that we don't have any more real calculus to do this is one of those family of problems where what you think about it is it where I have a multiplication of my original amount times a factor and I'm trying to over a certain amount of time or have I given an initial value and then the amount after a certain amount of time what's the second one we are going to use the initial value to solve for C and then the second piece information that gives us temperature after time to solve for K and then we'll be able to figure out well when was this body at 98.6 degrees so let's do the first one so the first thing was say the room is 70 degrees know that my ambient temperature 70 degrees the bodies found at 12 a.m. at 80 degrees so 12 a.m. don't put in 12 for the time because that would say 12 hours earlier started our starting time is 12 a.m. at T of 0 which is 12 a.m. our body's temperatures 80 degrees so at T zero the body's temperature is 80 degrees and the ambient was 70 degrees let's click that it so T of zero that's 80 equals we know that the ambient 70 - I don't know it C is that we're trying to find right now e to the negative K times zero for the last time in our video when you're given initial value like this solve for C first well let's see 80 minus 70 is 10 this is all 1 so 10 equals negative C C was negative 10 which means simply change our formula a little bit we know the ambient 75 we know that I'm subtracting C since C is negative we'd have plus 10 e to the negative KT now that we've found our arbitrary constants no longer arbitrary it's based on our initial value now we can go ahead and use a second piece of information considering that our starting time when we found this this body it was a 12 MST T equals 0 after 1 hour so at t equals 1 the body 75 degrees that's the second piece of information so the first piece solve for C second piece solve for K ok so it's 75 degrees so T of Milan equals 75 degrees oh sorry wrong to you t1 equals 75 degrees ambient doesn't change and that happened after one hour and we can see that we easily solve for K here so we'll subtract 70 let's divide by 10 if we do the Ln on both sides we can element of one half or people must make it okay so k equals negative Ln 1/2 another 1/2 is negative so our case is any positive but look since we have a formula that negative K we're going to have a negative number up there so we get let's see what is that 1/2 looks like about zero point six nine let's open our form let's put that back in there so from here we already knew our seed we now know our cave we know that that's a negative case so for a case positive that we found we have negative of that number and now let's let's a salt for anything that we want as far as if I said hey what's the temperature going to be at 3 a.m. that's three hours past so we could just do three in there and figure out what the temperature body is going to be but what we want to know is when was the temperature 98.6 so that would give us a time of death well then our 90s point six is gonna go here we'll solve for our team I'd like you guys to do that on your own I don't want to do it for you I want to make sure that you at least you have done one we'd subtract our seventy of course we divide by 10 of course we do the element on both sides and then we would divide by negative 0.69 and you might run into an issue here wait a minute Arty's negative how long the woman's you get a negative negative one point five two hours since RTS based of hours tell the world you get a negative time well this body is cooling which means it died about an hour I have to go so if you wanted to find the time of death you probably would do minutes so when you have any sort of time like negative one point five two hours keep the negative 1 that's negative one hour and then just multiply 0.5 two times 60 because there's 60 minutes in an hour this would be one hour and thirty one minutes ago roughly about 1 hour 31 minutes so that's prior to 12 a.m. so that means that if the body was found at 12 a.m. all this stuff happened that an hour and 31 minutes prior so what would that be 1029 so 1029 then an hour 29 minutes body was found so that's how these problems work man I hope this has made sense I hope you understand that this is just an application of our differential equations where we have a very simple process we have separable equation so we separate variables we do an integral I know I've done a lot of examples it's a very long video but I hope at least some of them helped you if you can make it through all of them that's great I mean that's you really help you on some of these applications let me know if the video is helpful leave some comments if you would if these these application problems are actually helping because they take so long they take a lot to actually make them I don't want to waste my time of your time so if you're enjoying them and they are profitable to you and they're helping you understand let me know and if not let me know also either way so I hope you all are all doing well I hope this is making sense we should hit in the next video to get onto another technique of solving differential equations which is pretty cool I'll see you for that you 

Transcript for: Introduction to Linear Differential Equations and Integrating Factors (Differential Equations 15)
hey I hope you're ready for another video this is a good one man I love this technique we're gonna learn some more techniques about how to solve some some differential equations it's ordinary different differential equations and this one's just to me it's fascinating because we we sort of use a lot of really cool clever stuff to make these differential equations solvable and the difference the places we're talking about fall into this class called linear differential equations specifically linear first-order differential equations so you've got a differential equation some derivatives in there it's first-order so there's only the first derivative and linear we're going to talk about what that means so in this technique we're going to learn some pretty neat stuff one of my favorite techniques I really enjoy doing it because it's it's sort of like crew fighting a puzzle like you like finding the missing piece of a puzzle and that's really how I want you to think of solving these linear first-order differential equations is you have this piece and what we're going to get to is what this piece is and you're trying to make it fit something and there's a missing piece to it we'll talk all about that as we go through so a new technique it's pretty cool it's not separable those are very straightforward this is kind of kind of going around the problem to solve it it's different with the different logic and this technique even though it looks kind of weird at first we use this idea of finding a missing piece to make it work a lot in differential equations so let's talk about it let's talk about what linear is how it's different from separable what these two things mean and then they move on to what I mean by a missing piece so that's what we're going with it we've got linear it's a different technique than separable we're going to talk about how to find a missing piece I'm going to spend a long time on why it works any teacher can tell you how to do it but I'm gonna tell you why it works we're gonna basically go through the process I would call it a proof or anything I'm gonna show you though through an example and through some logical thinking about why this is working for us and why you take this e to some integral of what in the world and that works magic none of this is magic we'll talk about that link why this stuff works so what we know already is that with some very basic differential equations we can just integrate both sides very good we're fine with these other types of difference of equations that are called separable we can move our Y variables on one side and our experts on the other side integrate both sides and those are very straightforward those two techniques the first one being just integrate if you don't have any wise in there or separate and then integrate if you do have some Y's that are being multiplied and that's what's separable equations work was this class of difference of equations where you have a function of X times a function of Y and we can sometimes factor to make that happen where you can't get the function of Y on one side with the dy the function of X on the other side with the DX and just straight-up integrate we did that a lot I'm not going to revisit that that was in the last several videos well linear is a different class linear says what if you don't have things that are being multiplied as function of x times a function of Y what if instead you have a first order differential equation where you have a y being multiplied times some function of x times another or sorry plus another function of X well these are called linear because you have just a single Y Y to the first power instead that linear so remember what linear equations look like like 3x plus 5 something multiplied times a variable plus something else that's why that's called linear so we have a function of x times y to the first power power plus another function of X and generally we'll consider these not to be factorable so that you can separate them I'll show you the first example where it is I'll show you both ways just verify we get the same exact answer but in general these are not separable you can't if there's no wiser rigor you can't generally just factor out a Y and divided by Y that's that's what we're talking about we're also not talking about where that's a constant and that's a constant that's a coefficient that has no variable X because then that would be separable you'd have like 3y plus 2 okay we just move the whole thing over if you want to that's not what we're talking about here we're talking about on legit function of x times y plus another function of X it could be a constant over here but it doesn't have to be can't have variables that's what linear is that's what this class of differential equations is talking about is where it's not separable you have function of x times y plus function of X so let's talk about this idea what we're what we're thinking here well if we can get this piece moved so again kind of the same logic of organize your Y's together so get your function of Y on one side with your dy/dx well if we do that I know that's a plus sign I don't really care about the sign so much it could be plus or minus I'm just writing it so we don't have to worry about it being a minus so yeah I know from here you'd subtract not concerned about it if you can write this the idea is if you can write this as your first derivative which we're talking about first ORS it's got to be the first order derivative here with this function of x times y the only Y that should be up there if it falls in this class if you can write those on one side and a function of X on the other side so we're kind of separating the variables not separable and that they're not multiplied together you can't completely separate them because there's X's right here that's why that's that's not considered a separable equation you can't divide have a product times some other function of X and have the Y's on one side x another side it's not we're talking about well when we are talking about is getting this the out of the power one y variable with that function X on one side added or subtracted to or from that dy/dx at first derivative and then another X's or constants or whatever on the other side here's the big point about what we're trying to do here and this is this seems like magic the first time you see it this works that is awesome it is awesome we're gonna focus right now on what the idea is why we would approach the problem this way and how it works not just but how to do it how it works so let's imagine that you have a linear first order differential equation and you you could go ahead and subtract that function that has Y in it on one side so you've Group this you have your X's this part should be easy because if this is all X's then we should be able to just integrate it if we're going to integrate both sides we know that we have the first-order difference equation we're gonna have to integrate some time to to go to our actual function of Y or to an equation that has that actual function of Y in it even implicitly well on the right hand side when we perform that integral that should be easy sounds very easy because we're gonna integrate on the left hand side here's the thought behind it if you look at the left hand side this sort of looks familiar where you have a derivative of Y there's something missing up front talk about that whole heart behind this problem this derivative of Y but then the Y appears without a derivative and it's added together go that man that looks familiar I remember there's one class called calculus and we had these things like that had X's and Y's all wrapped up and we were still able to take a derivative but why wasn't defined explicitly it was defined it was defined implicitly this looks like very similar to the result of implicit differentiation and that's what we're gonna talk about we're gonna treat this as a result of a product rule with implicit differentiation I'll show you that right now so if that looks familiar let's try that man let's try to make a day let's try to make that fit the result of implicit differentiation using the product rule let me show you real quick just to make sure they were on the same page here so let's just pretend that you had you know what I'm not gonna use P and Q that'd be a mistake because I want you to see what what the P is actually okay because it's gonna go over here and then it's going to explain what the world are doing so let me call this R and s if you remember when you do an implicit derivative and if you don't you should go back to the calculus one and watch that video on how to do implicit differentiation because it's huge for this well we're do understand that looks very similar to the result I'll show you right now if you were to take the derivative of both sides on the right hand side it's very easy there's no why's there's no nothing we would just do s prime of X on the stuff right now I want you to focus on this if the right hand side is just the derivative of some function that's what Q of X is so Q of X is just the derivative of some function that's why it's so easy because we just do an integral and we get right back to what this s of X is so so right now Q of X is s prime of X do an integral you get back Q of X I hope that makes sense on the left hand side well because Y is implicitly defined Y is this function of X that we don't know right now that's a product rule that's a function of X this is why R it's represents a function of X remember in first order differential equations Y is treated as the dependent variable on some independent variable X this has X's in somewhere well by a product rule we would say ok the the derivative of I'm going to do it a little backwards because it's going to fit our model I usually do the derivative of the first times a second plus the first time through the second I'm a flip flop that so the product rule says take the derivative of one of them leave the other one plus two take the derivative of the other one and leave the one you just took the derivative alone sounds confusing but take the derivative one leave the other then take the derivative one leave the other so the project can be represented this way leave the first one alone okay take the derivative of the second one got the derivative with respect to X remember Y is a function of X we're taking the derivative with respect to X on both sides it's got to match up take the derivative respect to X here taking the derivative of the back to X here that involves our chain rule so I had made the first one alone the derivative of Y with respect to X plus we got a product rule take the derivative of this our bags River and leave the Y alone that's our product rule to take the derivative the lead first one alone derivative the second that's derivative of Y let's make X plus agree with the first one times a second leaving that alone but right here because it's a chain rule the chain rule says all right well what would you how do you represent that what's the derivative of Y one but then you get that x dy/dx by the chain rule or just think about it this way this says alright this is the derivative of Y with respect to X that's the same exact notation it says it's same as anything this right there is a straight-up product rule on implicit differentiation and it looks a whole lot like that here's the thing I want you to notice right now I want you to notice that if this is linear and it's supposed to be sort of this it's supposed to be the result of some sort of inaudible of implicit differentiation there's a missing piece the missing piece is that this hasn't a function of X in the front of our derivative and this one doesn't so how the hell no rule that we're gonna we're gonna fit this well we're going to find that missing piece furthermore this thing right here this P of X this is representing a derivative of somehow some function so when were when we're doing this there's two ideas the rillette isn't you can pop in your head number one is that when we have a linear first order differential equation we are going to treat the left hand side as the result of some sort of a product rule of implicit differentiation we are going to try to right now find a missing piece it's going to complete that so it doesn't quite match up so we have this thing like okay this is the result of product rule it's missing something I'm gonna show you right now how to find that missing piece and why it works next part is that if this P of X is the result of a derivative I'm gonna somehow use the integral of this piece remember this is a derivative I'm using integral that piece to help find and the missing thing that I want well you can sort of see that right now this is the missing piece okay this is the derivative of something this is the antiderivative of that piece it doesn't match up perfectly because we're gonna see why and when I go through another champ like our very first example explain where L is coming from - but it doesn't quite match up perfect because this thing needs to go away we need to divide everything by that in order to see it but the ideas are very very similar the ideas are you're missing a piece here we're gonna find it what's that piece relate to this piece relates to the integral the antiderivative of this piece so whatever we're going to multiply here make this work it's going to relate to the integral of that piece we're see in just a moment so little bit of a recap because I know that's a lot of words and a short amount of time we're no longer talking about separable equations we're no longer talking about just integrating on both sides we're low beyond that right now we're trying to try to take a linear differential equation first-order where we can structure this as looking like the result of a product rule has a missing piece in well we see that this is really really close but we're missing something we're gonna find that the right-hand side should be easy just an integral so here's our our steps on how to do it number one we need to get the Y it might have some X's with it that's not a problem easy to deal with get the Y term on one side added or subtracted to or from the first derivative the dy/dx on the right hand side so they get the y and the dy on one side on the right hand side you're just gonna have a function of X we can integrate really easy now left-hand side don't just integrate the left-hand side it's not gonna work you can't we can't really do that we can right then appropriately and we'd be missing we need to have our dy/dx is all screwed up so we can't just integrate the left-hand side you're not just integrate left instead we're gonna find the missing piece to create the result of a product rule that's what I was talking about here if we do a product rule this is really close it's just missing something let's talk about that missing piece I'm gonna erase this but this is an important concept you need to have a concept in your head right now that we're going to try to make this thing fit the result of the product rule we're trying to make this thing fit the result of the product rule it's just that it's missing something we're gonna focus on that for the rest of our our video right now what we call that missing piece all the row X so it looks like a lowercase letter P I don't care what you call it the idea is this is gonna represent our missing piece and we're gonna talk about what this missing piece needs to have so the first thing if it's missing a piece we don't just get to multiply in one term and leave the rest of it so if you're going to multiply by this missing piece that we know I had up here we know we're gonna have to have it it's missing something or it's written in a different format we need we need to sort of undo it man I should have done that do it again the rial going today I didn't want to but I think it's it's important for you see the reason why this doesn't have it and this does is because in order to get our linear first order differential equations in the proper form we divide by the arm so really what this is doing is dividing everything by our legs and this can disappear which is why the missing piece isn't so easy to find whether you can't just do an integral of that R prime of a I mean this student intro that's gonna be right there it's not because in order to get the missing piece in order to have it missing you're really dividing it so what we're going to be doing is we're gonna find this row of X and we're going to be multiplying it here's what the row of X has to do the row of X has to be something that when I multiply on both sides which would distribute them that row of X has to have our original function in it because it's kind of canceled that out but to get back what we really want so our row of X has to have our original function in it also when I take the derivative of row next element is they have to have the original function in it but the derivative has to somehow be the derivative of that see what the world what function what function in the world can you take the derivative of it that not only does it give you itself back robux has to be has to have that in it it's got to cancel what function the world can you take the derivative of it and it gives you self back there's not a folks there's nothing that I mean nothing does that nothing takes the crap nothing takes the derivative itself and gives you itself it gives it that was a weird way to say you take the derivative of a function and it gives you itself back you're talking about e to some function of X but not only that it also has to give you this piece the derivative of it when you take the derivative of e to the function of X yeah it gives you back the function of X either the function X but it also gives you that first derivative this is how we're gonna find our row of X so I'm going through a little bit more detail here so the recap on our recap I suppose is this when we when we have this as the result of a product rule and and we think it's got a missing piece well it has a missing piece this thing is missing because to get in the right structure we divided by that function and you can see them in about 10 minutes or so after I show you what we need here well to undo that idea we're gonna have to multiply by something that's something that row of X it has to have our original function in it this original piece that we we had in our root function or our equation before it took the derivative it's got to have that it's got to cancel that also what it has to have is it's got to be able to take the derivative of that piece and give me this R prime of X it's got to have that as well we call that row of X and here's the ideas so we're gonna have our linear first order differential equation we're gonna multiply it by some thing it's gotta be on all three returns because you're multiplying both sides sure we can multiply both sides as long as it distributes goes to everything and here's what Rho of X needs to do I'm just gonna go through slowly exactly what I was talking about so linear we're treating like a project all the implicit differentiation we know we want to get everything on one side no problem that's the looking for the product or we're not integrating we're finding the missing piece so to speak we're gonna call it Rho of X here's what we needed to do number one we need something that repeats itself so we need something that because this is a product rule here the result of a product rule we need something so that when you take the derivative of it or you don't take the derivative of it it's in both places so we need something that repeats itself I hope that makes sense you do something so that when you take the derivative of the first times a second and the derivative the second times the first it's in both places well you to a function of X does that so the idea we needed to repeat itself when you don't have the derivative of the first and when you do have the derivative of the first it's in both places let's let's talk about either f of X so our missing piece is gonna be an exponential it's gonna have be in it number two number two remember that this is a derivative of Y implicitly so when we do the derivative of Y in a product rule implicitly we don't have a Y here we do have a y here which means that our Rho of X if this is the derivative of Y implicitly our Rho of X is the the function itself without taking the derivative that means this piece must be found within the derivative of Rho of X I'm gonna say that again cuz I can that can lose you I know the first time I went through this just show me how to do it because I'm not really grasping what's going on what's going on is you're trying to complete a product rule you have any missing piece we know that this thing has to be some a derivative of something that repeats where when you take the derivative and when you don't you get the same thing in there well that's a neat e to the X e to the f of X whatever that happens to be second piece because dy/dx is a derivative based on implicit differentiation and the chain rule I'm gonna write it simply so derivative with implicit differentiation I'm not writing everything out there but because of this because of your thinking that you're okay if this is the result of a derivative of Y based on implicit differentiation and a product rule then this is the derivative of the Y piece that would mean that Rho of X itself is the piece of X that you did not take the derivative of now you're going to see you see why that's important at the very end when I go through this explanation because at the very end you're gonna go oh my gosh if that's a result of a product rule then the thing that it was taken approach ruled of has to have a row of X in it and we don't have to change it and it's really nice so this is something we just want to note in our head never episode number one we need something to repeat itself e to a bunch of extra pieces so number two this is the derivative of Y based on a twisted invitation which means that this was not taking it well this was not a derivative this is going to be in your original function original equation number three number three okay so if this is base number y this thing you did not take a derivative to get this thing then that derivative repeat that when you do the derivative this thing repeats then this is missing this is this is this is this is I won't say missing we just found a missing piece but this thing right here needs to be based on the derivative of Rho of X so this right here was the derivative of Y this you didn't take a derivative to get that but because it's a product rule this whole thing needs to be from the derivative of your role of X that means that P of X needs to come from that derivative of Rho of X I hope I'm making sense to you right now when I'm saying it I'm like may I hope these people get it I can't read you right now so if you if you understand raise your hand did you did you actually set it be awesome but if that thing right here wasn't taking the derivative of it's taking the derivative right now that P of X has to come from that so let's the subtle about that if P of X comes from some function e to the F X how do you take the derivative of e to the f of X well the derivative of e to the f of X gives you back e to the f of X here but then you take the derivative of the inside by the chain rule so let's do a little bit of manipulation of this if you were to take the derivative only is purple so you see the derivative coming up if you were to take the derivative remember that's what this is the derivative says hey you leave the first alone derivative of Y you take the derivative the first you leave the Y so this piece is the derivative of robe X well we would take the derivative through the robots on the right hand side the derivative of each of f of X gives you a to the f of X times that prime of X guys that's exactly what's taking place right here this side is the derivative of Rho of X it has to be derivative the first times the second plus the first times during the second one of the first times during the second plus the derivative the first kind of second remember this is all coming from some function times y when we take a derivative derivative of the second the first that's here plus the first time through the second that's here but check it out this is your row originally remember that that's helping we did this row of x equals e and f of X you've got back your road that's this piece this is that piece x or y that's going to be there because of that that product or you're going to have that what that means is that P of X is equal to the derivative of that exponent on e the P of X must equal this you okay what's that mean to me well what that should mean to you is that if P of x equals the derivative of that exponent if you want to find the exponent all you have to do is integrate P of X now if this is getting confusing to you remember that P of X is a thing that you're given so if you look back at our original form here the only thing you're giving is the right hand side which is super easy to do an integral and on left hand side that's the only thing that's got X's in it there's nothing here you have a function of x times y so what we're trying to do is find this missing piece before realizing is that it's going to be easy to a function of X okay that goes in all three terms that e to a function of X the only thing we wouldn't know about it is what the function of X hat sounds funny what the function of X we're doing what the function of X actually is well that function of X that has to be on the function that when you take the derivative of it it gives you P of X so if we integrate P of X obviously if we integrate V of X when you take a derivative of it whatever we integrate and a derivative it's gonna give you P of X so if we know that the function of X is such that when you take it to Rivet it gives you P of X integrate then the function of X is just an integral of P P of X so what that means is this our missing piece number one has to repeat e needs some function number to this function of X this this row X it's going to be here and it's going to it's going to have this piece because it's based on the implicit derivative it's going to be here as something that you didn't take the derivative of and it's gonna be here something you did take the derivative of it it has to repeat which is where we get the e but also when you take the derivative of an exponential it's giving you the exponential back that's here but it's also taking the derivative of your exponent since that's a why it's not be some X this has to be the piece that when you take the derivative of the exponential it gives you that piece of the exponential gives me this so the integral of this gives me my exponent the integral of this piece must be the exponent so that when I take a derivative exponent it gives me back this let's just double check is this something that when I take a derivative of it it's going to repeat sure see the X is this something I want to take a derivative of it it would give me P of X back well by the fundamental theorem of calculus if you take a derivative of an integral it gives you that inside piece over an interval that's what we're doing so the derivative of this row X would give us Rho of X in both places one where you didn't take tribute one where you did furthermore when you take the derivative of this it's going to give you P of X back the derivative of the integral so the inside the riveted exponent would get you T of X it's weird but this is completing the puzzle it's such a cool idea you're going looks like progr have you make it work let's multiply by something multiplied by something that has to repeat is X multiplied by something that when you don't take a derivative of it because this is implicit derivative the second only derivative of Y gives you dy/dx this is not a derivative here of anything and then when you do take the derivative the derivative of it it's in both places we got that but more because it's based on either the f of X the derivative f of X is this guy so if you're given this guy just integrate you've got your exponential right there what I want to do right now I want to show you the result that you're going to get this is the piece where some students struggle with like well how in the world is the this the result but check it out your result is really easy your result here says this if you can write this so basically just multiply that load X if you can write this as something is some result of the product rule then the product itself that gave you this result this is why I said it's like 30 times this piece in the first term here you did not take the derivative of which means that the equation that you did take the derivative of has to have Rho of X in it it's got to know the way this is the result of a product rule which means you have a product so derivative of this oh wait but we made that's the derivative of the same piece that's the piece itself sloppy over there so what it comes down to is that this piece right here is the result of some product rule what's the product then well if this is the first times the derivative the second then that's their first piece if this is the derivative the first time a second that's the second piece done that's that's it some textbooks say well yeah so we'll do two sets here so you're not really yeah okay this is this right here this whole piece is the result of a implicit derivative based on the variable X and that's an equal to right hand side so they're not showing the the integral yet they're gonna do the next step so if you've ever seen that before you I don't I don't know what that means here's what it means it means when you take a derivative of this product you're going to use the product rule notice how I've done nothing to the right hand side this said this kind of wraps that this up and says this right here is the derivative implicitly I'm the variable X of a product it's a that's that's exactly we talked about it's the reverse of - so it says this thing is the result of a derivative based on X of the product rule boom right hand side hasn't done anything and then they would go and say hey do you remember fundamental theorem of calculus if you have a derivative then if you integrate both sides the integral is gonna kill the derivative so then they go integrate both sides okay so Rho of X times y would equal the integral of Rho of X cube X DX notice all exes should be a very basic in howtobasic sometimes they can get hard and then do this just divide by Rho of X to solve for y that's the idea I want to show you right now with an example I'm gonna walk through them I'm just gonna race this this little piece I want you to see it in action so it's something very basic and what I'm gonna try to do is we're going through this is I'm going to I'm gonna show you each little piece that I've explained for the last like 30 minutes in this I'd like to show you with an example how this stuff works and we'll see a little bit more about the Y as we're going through so again my idea is that to show you why or where this is in this sort of a problem so this can look very big or it can be like man that's a lot of symbols and there's no examples so I wanna well I really want you to follow this don't skip this one okay let's see how this works what this stuff and I'll show you each of the pieces were going through it so obviously not a differential equation we aren't going to get this back when we're done with our problem so I want to show you that what we're getting when we're talking about linear first order differential equations is based on stuff like that it's based on the result of a product rule so let's take a derivative right now let's go take a groove on both sides on the left hand side as I mentioned before so this is our theory and practice on the left hand side you have a product it's an implicit function of Y so we're gonna take the derivative of Y treat it as a function of X it's involving the chain rule left hand side we would get you know what I'm going to do it this way so pattern I'm going to take the leave the first and the derivative of the second so X cubed times the derivative of the second would be dy DX plus because you have a product rule the derivative of the first I could take a derivative correctly that'd be awesome derivative of the first times the second on the right hand side the derivative of 2 a 2 give us to yourself I'm just taking a derivative on both sides of just implicit differentiation derivative by little of the second times the first or leave the first loan to rip the second plus the first during the first time to say completely mess it up but leave this one alone and River that guy then ribbon this guy leave that one alone that's how approachable essentially works doesn't matter what order you have additions commutative we just do it this way the structure of best for our linear first order diverse equations but then the derivative the right-hand side is also important now you're going to say to me well look that doesn't look like the bat because this doesn't have that piece exactly that's why we have to find this missing piece so in order to get this watch what's happening in order to get this to look like that you're going to have to divide by X cubed you're gonna have to divide that means that we're going to have to multiply to get that piece back that's what will next Cosgrove X decimal to fine so let's divide everything by X cube to make it fit this so you see what's going on let's just do that so we've divided everything by execute that means we're just going to have a first order derivative then we're gonna have okay three over X yeah we get to simplify y equals 2x look how it doesn't it doesn't quite look like the same result of the product rule that we have so we're missing something right now we're missing our function over here and we're not able just to integrate right now you couldn't even hear you have a sulfur do you wanna do an integral but that's not the idea the idea here is that okay let's go ahead and find that missing piece so check out what's gonna happen we're going to be multiplying by something we just divided so to undo this we're gonna have to multiply so remember you wouldn't be given this you'd be given this this is where it comes from this fits our formula so we're trying to make it back to that we divided let's find something to multiply by what do we know about it we know that when we multiply an equation it's gotta go everywhere both sides means you're going to distribute it's got to go everywhere so the derivative what we want to take has to repeat itself so our row of X is equal to it needs to repeat itself it's gonna have an e in it the ITO function of X repeats when you take a derivative nextly though we know that P of X is just this function 3 over X it's just that piece this is Q of X this is easy you could take an integral of this right now you don't even have to but you could take a nibble of this right now this right here is our P of X the function of X that's right in front of our Y to the first power making this linear here's what we need to also understand we need an e because the derivative Eve repeats so we need it in both places to satisfy our our product or the result of the particle but nextly this has to be the derivative of the exponent of this function you see when you take the derivative an exponential you get an exponential back but then you take the derivative that's what this has to be we talked about it right here we said yes you're going to multiply everything by something that something has to repeat obviously but this piece this piece must come from the derivative of your Rho of X this wasn't from a derivative this one is leave the first alone to the second take it through the first thing the second loan this piece must come from the derivative of the exponential so this piece must come from must give us this when I take a derivative so if I want to take the integral of P of X this would say yeah hey if you take the derivative of my exponential it's going to be 3 over X derivative of integrals give us I can do each other there being sort of inverses all right what that means is that our row of X is equal to e if you're worried about man I'm gonna have a lot of Exponential's in there yeah you could put a lot not a lot of times some of the times they often I would say you're gonna have an Ln so the integral of 3 over X is 3 Ln x over 3 is a constant you pull it out 1 over X gives you Ln X we can move exponents hey inverse functions they're being composed we would get execute what what no wait a minute you mean the thing that I divided in order to make it fit this form is exactly the freaking thing I'm gonna multiply right now and yes that's all you're doing is you're finding the missing piece the thing that you would have divided away here from the result of your product rule that maybe did that form that's the exact thing that you're multiplying by 2 back to the parole form I hope you see that it's fascinating it's amazing it's the missing piece it's the the link that says oh yeah you know what you're right it is the result of a portable I just have to kind of put it back there it just so happens that this always does it why because Exponential's always repeat and when you take derivatives or not they're going to be in both places it has to be that the integral of P of X is our exponential because when you take a derivative of exponential e to the F X comes back but then you take the derivative of your exponent so I'm doing that that derivative gives us our exponent then we say ok that's that's not bad let's go ahead and let's multiply everything so we had this we just learned it should be kind of cementing your head right now that when you have just the dy/dx you're missing a part worth finding that missing part that extra P whose derivative gives us back the original function and whose derivative exponent is exactly this take the interval you find that exponent we now found that it's X cubed let's multiply everything by that X cubed this execute can look like it's coming out of left field if you do not understand this if you were just taught just take the integral put it on top of B you're good to go yeah you are why who knows this is why because when you structure your problem like this where dy/dx doesn't have anything in front of it when you structure it like that you've divided you've divided by what's kind of from the original equation of that products you've taken it away we're putting it back which is why you're multiplying it we're putting back in such a way that it's repeating you that's of X and that when you take the derivative of exponential based on the chain rule you get that piece the P of X that's the derivative of your exponent so take it in a refined X for me watch what happens X cubed dy DX is still there it's not a problem this right here is going to give you x squared here that's completely gone you get two equal signs of maryland's you get 2 and here's the major thought if you were able to do that and it will work every time if you're able to do that then this has to be the result of a product rule but think about what product rules are from fools have one piece in each term that you didn't take a derivative right those two pieces as a product and you're done say that again each one of these terms has a piece from a product that you didn't take the derivative of that's why this is important since dy/dx is the derivative that's the derivative of Y then this is not the derivative of the X function it's the X function itself it's not really dyslexia if you put on top to bottom as I can't use that as excuse it's kind of orgasm each one of these terms has a piece that you didn't take the derivative of it when performing the product rule since this is the derivative Y this is not the derivative of the function of X this is a bunch of X itself since this is the derivative of the function of X notice that derivative of x cubed gives us 3x squared then this is not the derivative of a function of Y is the function of Y itself so this piece came from a derivative with respect to X of that product that's what that means how have you undo derivatives with respect to X you take an integral with respect to X on both sides integrals are new derivatives by fundamental theorem of calculus we would have X cubed Y on the right hand side you have a bunch of X it's easy to take an integral a function of X if it's possible to define a great and that's exactly exactly what we started with that is the way that this whole technique of solving linear first order differential equations works it's so awful to learn it if you don't understand what you're doing and you are structuring this as the result of a product because if that's the case you get your answer really easy look here look here put them together you're done that then just integrate both sides and the derivative drops off so that's the result of the derivative of a product rule there's the products they have to be when you do an integral on both sides your derivative with respect to X is gone you have the actual function itself and can you solve it for y well of course you can't we we will have plus C's in here as well I'm just trying to give you this as as a representation of the this technique and I hope I've done a good job of that that's we talked about where our so we talked about how we need to repeat the X we talked about the derivative of the exponent means to be in that second term so when we integrate the X function of that second term functions right the X to the second term we get our exponent and then I showed you how that that works so what I'm gonna do now is do just one example we're going to talk about one example in two different ways one with separable a separable equation and then one with this technique we'll see it comes up the same exact answer it's gonna be really nice I really hope that this has made sense to you that you see that this technique is just undoing a product rule but because we have a missing piece here you have to multiply to get that back once you do pretty easy in your head right now ask these questions do I understand why we have e to a function why it's gotta be interested that the answer that hopefully you said right now is well it's got to be because when I take the derivative or not I have to have the same thing in there because I'm multiplying all three spots hopefully understand them do you understand that the first term here the first term based on its product rule this is not the result of a derivative this is this is the result of a trivet this is not generous enough do you understand that because this is an exponential this piece is just the result of the derivative of the exponent does that make sense if that makes sense integrating this would give you the exponent of rule of X so let's try that one example you might have to go through this a couple times to really get the flow of it do not cheat yourself right now don't be like yeah it's all I gotta do is do a to the integral P of X sometimes that's true but you know what that thought process is going to hinder you later because this idea of multiplying this equation to get something that you want is is use a lot so if you sure cut yourself now it's probably not gonna make a whole lot of sense later so spend some time to really grasp these concepts I hope I've done my job to explain that to you I know I took long enough let's do that one example I was talking about and then we'll we'll go on and the next video and I'm gonna give you a ton of examples on how to do this let's go through an example together I'm gonna do this two different ways I'm gonna do it one way as separable equations by separating our variables and the other way as a linear first order differential equations so can you write that as something and use separable equations you can remember the separable equations have dy/dx on one side and a function that you can move and separate your Y's on one side and exit on the other side this is actually one of them you know that doesn't have a function of X in it exactly so if you treat this whole thing as a function of Y itself times one as the function of X divided by 2 minus y you don't need the 1 there but you get DX let's integrate both sides we should be pretty comfortable with separable equations on the left hand side we're going to have a natural logarithm because we have 1 over Y to the first power we can use it you so it's gonna have a negative in there ever seen that so when we get this yeah Ln absolute value of 2 minus y but because the derivative of to minus y is negative 1 you got a negative by au substitution right hand side we have X plus C I have not shown you where to put the plus C when we were doing our our technique over here on linear I'll show you how to do that let me do this example in just a couple minutes so we do it a second way now we know we know how to solve this stuff we know that we're going to use an e we know we get rid of that negative I don't typically like to plug in right now I'll separate this I'll use a plus and minus so I'm separating my equate and my my X 1 remember we have negative X minus C so we can write this as e to the negative x times e to the negative C I'm also dropping my absolute value put in the plus or minus I'm gonna wrap this whole thing up as a gigantic C and now since we have an initial value I can plug this in right now and solve for C that'd be pretty easy to do if I plug in 0 for Y and 0 for X we get C was - okay great so we have 2 minus y equals to e to the negative x let's solve for y if I divide both sides by negative 1 we get Y of X is positive 2 minus 2 e to the negative x done now we're going to do this a different way so separable equations this was separable because we can have a Y's on one side and our function of X and the other just integrate both sides no problem now let's look at the as the into the the linear differential equation is as well does it dip the form do you have a derivative for riveted plus a function of x times y constants can be considered functions of X so D of a function of X yeah if there's no X's its call it one equal to a function of X there's no X's all that the constant that it is this would be fall under that class of linear is very basic but that's linear let's see how it works so option two right now I'm gonna write out what the P of X is how to find the row of X I would suggest you do that every time I do it every time I'm gonna do it every time so number one doesn't fit linear so what you think in what linear means linear means you have Y to the first power up there somewhere it means you can write this as a derivative plus some function of x times y or y equals no lies on the right hand side so that that fits that if that's the case then you're gonna have something that's being multiplied by that Y that we call P of X so P of X right now is just one one that's what the event Q of X would be 2 you don't need to write that down that's just gonna play along you're not gonna do much with that besides integrated after you find your missing piece the thing we're multiplying by so linear yes what's your P of X the thing that's in front of Y once you've put it in this form that I can't stress that enough you might have to multiply or divide or do something to fit it in the linear so if you had a function of X up front you're gonna have to divide by that if you get stuff floating around or wise in several places you might have a factor that you have to multiply you might have to divide it this once you fit that then you can find P of X you need to write that down or right in your head or make a mental note or something it's gotta have just the dy/dx for you to start identifying your P of X it's got to be in this form before you do anything else that's why I gave you that for now your movement is not all that hard to find all we need to understand is that it repeats that's e to a function of X the function of X when you take a derivative of it it's kind of if you want it's got to give me your P of X so our Rho is equal to a function that repeats whose derivative of the exponent gives me P of X or in this case gives me 1 that means that our romex is e to the X let's talk about when you need a plus seen when you don't when you find the role of X you do not need a plus C so you don't need this the reason why you don't actually be up here the reason why you don't need that is because you can separate that like I should draw it over here you can separate that and get e to the C that's a constant that can be divided on both sides and just incorporated with another constant that you're gonna get when you're getting rid the right-hand side so long story short you need no plus C's over here you just need a plus C on the right-hand side that will have everything for you so do not worry about it you just since that row of X is everywhere I hope that makes sense to you since that row of X gets multiplied here and here and here and that's a constant it's not 0 e to a C is never 0 you could just divide it divide it divide it so we don't need either the C we don't need that constant because you just divide it on both sides anyway all right what we are going to need is really a plus C only on the right hand side so we do not need a plus senior now let's double check let's see if this works when you take the derivative of e to the X do you get e to the X back yes when you take the derivative of the exponent X do you get that do you get the thing that's in front of Y because X is 1 yes that that's gonna work for us so we're now going to multiply this on all three sides all three terms both sides is going to distribute so we'll multiply e to the X e to the X and e to the X you know where most people forget it it's right here they forget to multiply on the right hand side because they figured on due to product really you are but remember when you divided we did I erased it but you divided on all three terms where we need to multiply all three terms so we're putting that missing piece back double check your work right now double check that when you take a derivative of e to the x times y with respect to X the derivative of the second and the first to leave the first role owned over the second that's it that's a chain rule with implicit differentiation so we have e the extruder the y is derivative 100 swag bags plus because of a product derivative of the first that's PDX derivative the exponent that's one leave a second one alone that's why that's pretty cool why do we get to go down to here so quickly without doing any it doesn't look like we do any work is because you just built this as the result of a product rule you just find the product since product rules work this way where you don't take the derivative of one piece in each of the terms just find the two pieces you didn't take the derivative oh and that has screech your product you didn't take the derivative of e^x it's there you didn't take the derivative of Y it's there that way when you do don't take the derivative times through the second or take the derivative times not the driven the second chic it's your result you get your brother give your brother the result from your products were right there on the right hand side he had this to me the X we haven't anything with that and what this is saying plain English is hey here's the product that when you take the derivative with respect to X you're going to get this piece now if that's the derivative how undue derivatives yeah it rolls with respect to X on both sides this is why we had to have Y as a function of X because when you're when you're doing this product you're treating that as a function of X and you're gonna have to undo that that integral with the DX to match up the derivative with respect to X and you have to do it on both sides and that's exes so it's couple matchup on the left hand side you just took an integral of a derivative calculus says that those are gone on the right hand side we get okay what's the integral of to e to the X I love integral Z DX to e to the X you do not need a plus C here but you do need a plus C here you don't need a plus C here because if you did it you would just subtract it on the right hand side from the other plus C and you get a different plus C so you'll need one arbitrary constant and as a matter of fact you could plug in that initial value initial condition right now so if x is 0 Y is 0 that's what that says 1 times 0 is 0 2 times 1 is 2 if I subtract 2 on both sides C equals negative 2 so well let's see we could do that and then if you divide everything by e to the X so if you divide every both sides by e DX notice that we would get go on we get why there's a fractional right this is two different fractions that's gone that's gone that gives us 2 and this is minus 2 e to the negative x so in both cases we get Y by 2 2 minus sign minus 2 over X is the same thing as 2 e to the negative x it is exactly the same answer in both cases it's how it works the what this one because this could be classified as both a separable and a linear now which way is easier that questions are relevant right now the questions are relevant because in most linear functions if you have X's actual X's there you can't write them as separable it doesn't work unless you have some factoring that you might be able to do that's the same function of ax or even removes your X's ok but in general these things are not separable so it doesn't really matter which ways easier right now they're both popping for this example in the future you don't have that option that's why we're learning this we're learning that we can write these linear first order differential equations as the result of a product rule you just need to find the product and then do integral both sides that disappears becomes very very nice I hope you like that technique it is so cool I know I talked for a really long time because I care that you get it I don't care that you just chug through and do this you need to understand the intention behind it I hope you do I hope that you this is very clear I hope it made it clearer for you next time so next video we're gonna do a whole bunch of examples much more complicated than what I've given you this was just give the idea down it's important understand the idea I hope that makes sense and I'll see you for the next video you 

Transcript for: Solving Linear Differential Equations with an Integrating Factor (Differential Equations 16)
hey there let's get started some examples so last video we learned about why why how and why this this technique of solving linear first-order of differential equations works but we didn't do a lot of examples now I'm going to start going through some examples so you may be able to skip through some of these I would recommend you watch all of them and then see that you know how to do on your own that's a great study technique you can do it without your notes if you can awesome go ahead and move on if not let's go through a lot of these pretty slowly for for some of them we're gonna start build up the intensity as we move towards the end of the video so right now it's all about learning what the world we're doing so there's a few things I want you to check every time we go through one of these equations number one does it fit the technique you're trying to use if it does awesome if it doesn't can you make it fit or if it if it doesn't is there an easier way to go about it so ho if you're struggling to make it fit to fit a technique maybe there's a different way so number one okay it doesn't it doesn't fit the technique that you got if it does cool if not make it fit or if it doesn't make it fit use a different technique so let's check this out does this fit separable equations not even close no it's got X's floating around we're not even if we subtract there's no way to factor anything get our Y over so this is not separable this isn't this is linear though so does it fit linear we got a derivative it's a first derivative we have some function times y and we have known otherwise so we have Y to the first power it's already grouped with the du by DX so this is what we're looking for we wanted the first derivative based on what we want added or subtracted to some other term where you have a wine note X's or can be there or not doesn't matter but then that Y is to the first power there's no otherwise and there's only at most X's on the right hand side so this is exactly how we want these structures let's go ahead and let's solve it remember the idea you needed to watch the last video the idea is you're gonna try to complete a protocol you're gonna try to complete the result of a product rule how to do that was to realize that you need something that repeats that would be e to the function of X and the derivative the function of X has to be in this piece if you didn't watch a video you need to go watch that right now to make sure your sanity concept is I'm not going to reteach it so the plan was let's multiply by that missing piece to get this structured this way we technically we would have had to divide to get a structure this way so we're going to multiply to undo that well we multiply by is e because of e to some function repeats itself when we do a product rule e to some function whose derivative is the thing that's connected to our Y that function of X or constant in this case so if the derivative of this piece needs to give us three the integral of three needs to be that exponent whenever we do these I would start also and write down what P of X is so we first let me check hey doesn't the the format of being linear yeah does what is P of X G of X is the piece that coefficient or function of X that's connected to your Y variable the first power in this case it's just three that is the piece you're going to be integrating every time so you're always integrating the three because the derivative of that antiderivative needs to give you back three when you take the derivative of the exponential so in our case our row of X is e to the 3x done that is the piece that when we multiply is going to complete our product rule that's pretty cool you don't need a plus C here we talked about wine last video all we need to understand is that you're gonna do that e to the 3x times dy/dx because you multiply both sides it's also going to be multiplied to the middle term and to the right term now you're gonna see this a lot a lot of times things start simplifying you go wearing them who in the world would put e to the negative weight negative three point four either negative 3x in a problem you go oh yeah in the last video we learned that these are coming from when you divide by something over quickly to this if you divide by e to the 3x you're going to get that e to the negative 3x we're multiplying 2 unto that which is pretty cool so we found out that our P of X is 3 doing the integral of 3 gives us 3x why do I do that I need to be able to take the derivative of this thing get it back in both places and have the derivative of my exponent be that number right there that is what would complete our product rule for us so we still will find you're going to see that the simplest does it's a lot this is going to simplify a lot of stuff here so we have that completely gone you get 3x e to the a 3x you add exponents you get 0 we get a 0 is 1 so on the right hand side we just get two legs on the left hand side this is the the time when you want to check your work you want to check that when you take a derivative of your exponent the derivative of this piece is that number or that expression of that whatever that is because this has to be the derivative of this piece it's gotta match up never how product rules work you leave it alone one time you take the derivative in the other term that's happening that's what's going on so we have e to the 3x dy/dx plus 3e to the 3x times y and then we understand what the world happened you see we know this can look and use it if you don't understand that this is the result of a product rule you're gonna go down a rabbit trail I have no idea what I'm doing here this is the result of a product rule how product rule is work remember it's a result of an implicit derivative with respect to X so it says when you take a derivative with respect to X of this product it has to give you back this thing what's what's the product have to be when you take the derivative of a product you leave the first term alone first factor alone I would say first factor alone that's the first factor then you take the derivative of that first factor that is the derivative but then you have the derivative the second factor and you leave the second factor alone so to build your product all you have to look at do is look at this and go hey this piece right here this would not have a derivative not be a derivative you would not be taking the derivative to get this piece because this is the derivative the second piece remember how product rules work leave the first one alone derivative the second that's the first one alone then you take the derivative the first one you leave the second one that's the second one we haven't done hardly any calculus right now we haven't done an integral all we've done said because I multiplied by the missing piece the appropriate term the appropriate actor romex I now have this as the result of some product rule here how do you undo the derivative the Perl an integral undoes it so we're just going to integrate both sides with respect to what well since that's the derivative with respect to X as an independent variable we're going to integrate with respect to X now since we have an equation we do it on both sides integrals and derivatives undo each other we get e to the 3x times y equals x squared let's see we talked about why we don't need a plus C when we're doing this integral we talked about why we don't need a plus C on this one and what we do here if we have a plus C from this integral we would just add or subtract it and get a different plus C it doesn't really matter now we can solve for and I would do it right now I'd solve for C now if I had in which real value I'm not given that but here's what I would do it instead let's just solve for y whenever we're able to then I solve for y we would get x squared plus C and then e to the negative 3x and the reason why we get even a 3x we divide both sides by e to the 3x or multiply both sides by e 2 negative 3x there and you're done but that's as much as we can do so the ideas I hope it's making sense that we're trying to structure this as a the result of some module then to find the product it's so nice because each term has a factor in it that comes from our original product just find that factor it's always going to be the function of X that's before the derivative of Y it's the lies which you would have taken derivative of here times y itself because this is not the derivative of 1 put it together then any rate both sides let's go ahead and move on so first things first does it fit the technique we're trying to use well it's not separable it looks linear to me let's double check I've got a derivative of Y minus some function of x times y itself to the first power and then no otherwise anywhere else so that's linear now can we write out what the pieces are that are necessary for us to understand let's try to write out a few MX pnub X is the piece that when I take the derivative of the exponential I'm not to get I'm gonna get P of X so P of X is the thing we want to integrate to find an exponent P of X is always the function of X in front of Y with the sign so P of X would be considered as negative 2x here let's find the piece that's going to complete our product rule well we know that product rules normally have something in front here so we're gonna be multiplying we also know that if I'm multiplying in all three places because I know by both sides here that then derivative needs to repeat so the function itself and the derivative function you have the same thing in it that's creating an exponential idea the exponential also as I just mentioned needs to be the case that when I take the derivative of the exponent it gives me negative 2x okay find the integral of negative 2x that way when you take the derivative out it gives you 2x that means that our row of X is e to the well we can pull the negative 12 and get x squared so negative x squared don't need a plus C that's what we're going to be multiplying our or differential equation by all three terms of both sides all three terms that means it won't have let's see it doesn't matter what side you multiply on since multiplication is commutative so we multiply don't worry about where you're putting this I would just multiply and make sure you're doing all three of them though e to the negative x squared okay e to the negative x squared no problem e to the negative x squared don't forget the right hand side and just just stop for a second just to double-check it just really this one place is the derivative of that exponent equal to the pieces of X that you have if it is you're good to go so derivative of negative x squared is negative 2x hey there's make it to next you know that's fine simplify the rest of it sure so e to the negative x squared dy DX minus 2xy u negative x squared equals that's why e to the x squared times e to the native expert negative x squared x squared it is zero that's one and then we are going to do two steps here we're always going to show this so there's a few things we always do we always show what P of X is we always show what Rho of X is so just the integral of this no problem and put it as an exponential we always show what we're multiplying by and we always show our simplification and then we always show that this is the result of a product rule so you're going to show that this was was the result of some sort of derivative the result of some sort of derivative with respect to X of some sort of product we don't jump down here and just solve it all the way to go well yeah this comes from the product self and I do the integral we don't really do that this shows your understanding that this is the derivative with respect to X oh that's implicitly as Y is a function of X of some sort of a product and then to undo that that's where your integral comes from to show it in one big step sort of loses the technique it sort of loses the here's the math behind it I don't want that for you I want you showed a Matthew so the product itself says if this was the derivative of the second factor this is the original first factor itself if this is the derivative of the first factor this negative 2x neither negative x squared then that Y is the second factor itself so most of the time the textbook will just tell you this is always going to be that it's always going to be rho of x times y that's true and you can do math that way and not understand look about it but the reason why this is is because this piece would be the piece when you take a product rule that you're not taking a derivative of that means it's gotta be your first factor this piece is a derivative of your x stuff with the exception of the Y the Y here is not not the result of that derivative it's the piece of the product rule but you're not touching with the derivative that's why we can change this into that nice product that's why and that's why that that's just really X because of that you on the right hand side we just get 1 and now it's the time where you say oh yeah okay so if this is the result of a derivative let's just integrate to get rid of the derivative integrate with respect to X because it's a derivative with respect to X derivatives and integrals are an inverse idea they undo each other fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that then we're going to get into the negative x squared times y people is just X plus C yeah we need a plus C and if we multiply both sides by e to the positive x squared then we're going to get y equals x plus c and then e to the positive x squared and we're good that's the idea behind I do let's go ahead we'll try that last one you'll notice that this is just a little bit different because we got an initial condition up there but the idea is the same and that we want to see that it fits our technique we want to use the technique appropriately we're going to show some really pertinent stuff here so let's first check to see if it fits the technique that was great that was great this is not so great so right now this doesn't fit the format of being linear can you see why can you see why that isn't fit it's really close but we know that we want just dy/dx plus or minus some stuff that has a Y to the first power equals some stuff that is only in X's the problem here is that facts do not write down P of X I do want you to write down P of X but do not write down P of X right now you need to put it in the correct form first so we think form before we do anything else does this fit the form the answer is no we need to make it fit a linear function a linear first order differential equation if we're gonna do this technique what that means is you might have to multiply or divide to make you fit that's not a big deal just make sure you do it before you start finding P because if you have fine P now is it well that's fine and then you you integrate then you oh it's 5x they do e to the 5x it's not gonna work this is not gonna work for you so we need to make sure it's the right form that way when we integrate the P event but in that function it's giving us back the original the original function itself in terms of X and then the derivative the expert would be our P that's not the case right now so let's divide it by X so one of these have a dy/dx oh it's better already plus when you write out that second term this should always just be dy/dx the second term needs to be a function of x times y so when you write this a lot of times we make it a fraction times y I like that you don't have to put the dot but I'm just trying to show you that I don't want this all wrapped up in one fraction I want five or X to be the thing the P of X you're talking about on the right hand side feel free to simplify that that's just seven X now that's linear now it looks better now it's something I can say yeah my t of X is 5 over X can I find the missing piece the thing that when I multiply all three terms by it to complete my product rule it's going to repeat when I have the function itself and when I take a derivative of a function more than that when I take the derivative of the exponent it's going to give me this when I take the derivative the exponents when you give me this when I take the derivative of an integral of that 5 of X it's going to give me 5 or X that's how we're fighting on the row of X is that e to the X gives you back when you have the function self in the derivative function and then when I take it in the integral of 5 over X that gives me something that when it take a derivative of it gives you P of X getting planet like that so that's e to the 5 you pull out one of our exes Ln X so that would be 5 Ln X let me move our exponent up that's e to the Ln of X to the 5th this happens frequently that you'll have e to the Ln and you can walk those simplify yeah it's your do we just get X to the fifth power that is what we're going to multiply right now so when we multiply every single term both sides means distribution both sides means every single term then that row of X that's going to be the piece that when we multiply this through that's the piece that we when we did a product rule didn't get a derivative Tinian because the derivative of y we give us do my DX that means the other piece of kimber module did get touching the derivative so I have my original dy/dx 5 over x times y vibrations 1 7 X 7 X and multiplying every single term that's both sides distributive by X to the fifth that's Rho of X let's simplify what we can 5x to the fourth we don't have to worry about the right-hand side hardly at all we're only trying to make the left hand side into that product rule let's see if it worked what we need to be able to do is think about is the derivative of this giving us all the X's right here derivative of X to the fifth gives us 5x to the fourth that works that creates this result of a product rule for just you know writing so what do you need to take the derivative of with respect to X to get this we need to take the derivative of some sort of a product since that's the result of a particle how we do a product rule is we leave the first factor alone therefore that's got to be the first factor we take the derivative of the second factor okay this has got to be the derivative the second factor that's why then we take the derivative of the first factor okay this has to be the derivative here check it make sure that it is okay good and then we leave the second factor alone that's got to be the second factor that gave us that as a result of the product rule that's how this works on the right hand side 7x with six no problem if we integrate both sides with respect to because you took this as a derivative respect next to get that particle to work for you there's no work that has to happen besides your understanding of calculus and that integrals and new derivatives that means that X to the fifth times live derivatives are undone by integrals of vice-versa on the right hand side we can exit the center let's see let's see right now it would be a good time to solve for C remember with those L ends we want to kind of get rid of that rid of that wrap up the e to the C plus a minus in a bigger plus C and then use our initial value or initial condition here it's it's easier to solve receive the way it is so we're gonna go ahead and do that those new versions crazy so if I plug in 2 for X and 5 for y so we plug it in if we take two to the fifth power times fives tracked off to the seventh power we get C equals 32 let's just put that back in there so we have X to the fifth times y equals x to the seventh plus 32 and we're just going to divide by X to the fifth done that's the idea make it fit or maybe it did a different technique let's see if you can make it fit fairly easily to a technique you're trying to use in this case linear we have to divide and then we're just finding the missing piece that creates our product rule that that's pretty much about it we have lots more examples sitting on so let's go through and try a few more like we're gonna try to see that this is gonna fit linear then we're going to try to find the thing that we should be integrating that's a P of X and then multiply everything by that missing piece of crude that product rule so number one doesn't that fit linear and it's really close we have a Y to the first power but we don't have any idea DX by itself we want to make sure that that happens so we're gonna have to divide a lot of the times to make that work so let's divide everything by two X if we do that so dividing everything by 2 over X - sorry divide everything by 2 X cube is 1 over 2x we've got our Y then before we do anything else we're gonna simplify so if we can simplify this side at least then dy/dx that looks really good that's by itself we have a plus 1 over 2x no problem that's our key we have a wide on the right hand side we get 5 over the square root of x I know that's kind of improper to write that but I'm gonna leave it there because chances are that's gonna simplify whenever we find our row of x and start multiplying so now that's linear that's a first order differential equation derivative of Y some function of x times y to the first power equals some function of X no problem identify your P of X right now right now we're going to integrate that to find the exponent of Rho of X now one half right here you can pull that out so we're gonna give each to the Ln of X sure but we have a 1/2 there so the derivative of this would give us C 1 over X times 1/2 that's 1 over 2x you can do this baby it worked more sense for you well we also want to do is we want to get rid of that E&L n but in order to do so we've got to move that exponent this coefficient as an exponent so e to the Ln of X to the one half power that gives us just X to the one-half X to the one half the square root of x that's what we're going to buy so we take everything I'm people to buy both sides so every single term by the square root of x and by the square root of x and by the square by X and we get this whole square root of x dy/dx no problem plus if we simplify that we're going to have 1 over 2 square root of x equals just 5 that's gone don't worry too much about what that this looks like it's not super super important right now because all this has to be is the derivative of that piece and you think of that that is X to the 1/2 power you move down the 1/2 well that's over to you you subtract 1 from the exponent that's next to the negative 1/2 oh that's 1 over 2 square root of x that's all it's going to be that's how you check your work now the rest is so cool this right here is the result of some sort of product rule let's write that product the product as always you left that piece alone when you took a derivative you let this piece alone when you took a derivative just mash them together on the right hand side you just have 5 if we integrate both sides with respect to X then we get square root of XY equals 5x plus C and let's just multiply everything by I'm sorry divide everything by X to the one-half or multiply everything by X to the negative 1/2 either way you're going to get y equals 5x plus C times X in eighty one half if you distribute that one minus one half is just one half and then we did see time so that arbitrary constant times next to the name one if you want to write a little bit differently as suppose you can and this would not be a big deal to read like that but you could write this as 5 square root X let's see you were screwed X and you can rationalize the denominator but if you see that and you could get that one as well okay next one I'd recommend to give it a try at least the set up see it meant to awkward-looking nine but that's supposed to be a nine if you just try to at least set this up as linear take a couple seconds and do that so you'll notice it's not right now you should make it fit see if you can of course for us that means we're going to divide everything by two eggs when your thought when you're dividing everything by two x what I want you to do with your second term is a group all of your coefficients constants where you want to call those and your X's and the group that together and just put Y off to the right-hand side so I want to see this as 3 over 2x times y the reason why we're doing that we're about to multiply but that right there that is going to be the piece of this product rule you didn't take a derivative of so I want you to separate that night worry about it on the right hand side we have 9x squared over 2 now we're gonna find the missing piece to multiply by and create this as the result of some sort of product rule well right entropy of X is P of X is always the piece in front of the Y that's why we group it like that so I just said that so that you're not looking a lot of different places you could everything together and then you have your while out back this right here is your P of X when you take the integral of that that becomes the exponent of your e to read guro the e to some function X that becomes as an integral of that function just like we did before you can pull that negative three-halves out so we have negative three-halves out in front of the integral then 1 over X so that's Ln X so e to the negative 3 halves that's your constant you pull out Ln X cool let's move that as an exponent so we have e to the Ln X to the negative 3 halves power even Ln I've gone that is what we have to multiply all three of those terms by order to create the result of some sort of product rule so let's do that let's multiply everything by x2 in there you bring us let's simplify where we can so if we simplify oh yeah I said negative three times that looks fine I don't simplify that you might even be wondering why the rule do we simplify because don't you just know you didn't take this times why hello you are but you also want to check your work I'm cheery to make sure you're not doing something that's irrelevant also on the right hand side years certainly gonna want to simplify that so we have our R minus we have our three ass and then if that's a negative one this would be X to the negative five house let's see if that works just to double check is the derivative of this equal to this piece again that's why we group our X's together in the left or the right so we can check our work nicely the derivative would be bring down the negative three house got it subtract one from that hey dime on the right hand side let's see four thousands then one half to nine that's X to the one-half since we've completed that product rule or the result of a broad rule we can now really easily write out what the product was the product rule always takes one piece and doesn't take a derivative of it in one term and another piece that you don't need either though in the second term so we have to just group our row of X and our Y together done right inside nine halves X to the one half and now we can take an integral of both sides with respect to X I hope you're seeing that these don't have to take a long time they take a long time and you don't understand them then you go where are these features coming from what am I actually doing how in the world you get from here to here it's just a result of a product rule look for the pieces that you wouldn't be taking a derivative of from your product that creates your product your integral with respect to DX should be very manageable on the left hand side nothing happens your undoing a derivative with the integral you get X to the negative three house Y on the right-hand side yeah a little bit more work that's where actually most of your work is going to come from here oh let's see if we add so x to the three-halves over three-halves that's going to give us three right-hand side twos are gone 9 5 by 3 is 3 don't forget that plus C but they only have to do after that is multiply both sides by X to the positive 3 counts that's going to kill this off let's go in - you can tell that off - oh no it's not there so let's try that if we multiply both sides we would have X - 3 halves + X to the 3 halves right there this is gone you're gonna get Y on the right-hand side well what do you do when you multiply exponents together so you add them so 3 halves plus 3 halves is six paths that would be three so distributing this is going to give us 3x cubed let's see X to the three halves and that's about as good as we can get without an initial condition also be aware that a lot of times you'll have a line without an X at the very end they'll say yeah don't don't forget that you're solving this explicitly right now as a function of X so if you see that that's where that's coming from is just telling you what that is I'll be back with a couple more in just a minute let's do a couple more so first one we have a linear TTC it's linear can you see that that fits perfectly so what exactly what we're trying to do here you get a first derivative you got plus y you have a function of X there's no otherwise why is the first power looks pretty good this is fitting our linear first order differential equation perfectly let's find our P so Beks is that piece that's right in front of why in this case new bags it's just one row of X says you're gonna do the integral of whatever that P is to find the the exponent of an exponential so in our case we're just gonna get e to the X that right there is that piece that you're gonna multiply by you complete your product rule and yeah I'm trying to kind of brainwash you right now I'm saying the same thing over and over and over again because we have lots of techniques and lots of stuff and it's easy to forget this stuff I'm trying to get you use of the format and you still what it is you're doing is if you understand what it is and why it works you're less likely to make mistake most like you forget it so we're trying to complete a product rule by finding something that repeats and something that wouldn't take a derivative of the exponent it's going to give us back the thing that's multiplied on the Y so let's multiply that's dy/dx plus y equals e to the X and we're going to multiply everything times even the X now we're going to double check our work okay well is the derivative of this thing equal to the piece that's being multiplied the Y yes and now we can keep on going we know that we've completed the result of a product rule with respect to X implicitly result of the product rule says you left the first one alone you left the second one alone in the second term on the right hand side you have let's see e to the x times e to the X that's e to the x squared multiply exponents e to the 2x now we're ready to do an integral because we know this was the result of a product product rule of a derivative respect to X we do an integral with respect to X right hand side no problem it's a u sub e to show you so we'd have u equals 2x to be if you take the derivative so we have 1/2 e to the 2 u and sure enough the derivative this could just either 2x times 2 which would give her that 1/2 let's see on the right-hand side really nothing happens if we divide everything by e to the X we would get 1/2 e to the now imagine this u divided by e to the X this is e to the x squared so you're going to get e to the X plus C e to the negative X or C over e to the X if you have initial conditions you'd want to plug them in here a little bit easier to solve so when you get down to finding two undoing your new derivatives if we wanted to plug that in there like Y of zero equals one you'd want to do it here so X would equal zero Y would equal one so that would be C would it be 1/2 so if you want to try that in your own we'd have e to the 0 times 1 you can see this is 1 subtract 1/2 you get C equals 1/2 and we can leave it just like that the next one I'm not actually going to do for you because I want you to look at what's going on to do this with as a linear differential equation would require a lot of work that's not how I want you to think so yeah this can possibly be in your do this linear' and if you have to you have to and I'll talk about that for a second I suppose but do you see that that is separable but why in the world what do we make this harder than it is if you can make this 1 over 1 minus y dy equals cosine X DX which you obviously can and agree that's pretty darn easy that that was not a lot of work I'll show you what money would require of you and you can do it on your own see actually I'm gonna courage I'll see if you can do it on your own just me so that would be negative sine X minus C little recap of separable equations I suppose 1 minus y would equal remember we have e to both sides we have e to the negative C times B to the negative sine X I drop my absolute value in the plus and minus we wrap this whole thing up into a gigantic C I'd want to plug in my initial condition here so if we plug that in then 1 minus 2 equals C e to the negative sine of PI sine of pi is 0 e to the 0 is 1 1 minus 2 is negative 1 C equals negative 1 and when we put that back up here we would get 1 minus y equals negative 1 e to the negative sine X let's subtract 1 and if you divide everything by a baby here we get one plus e to the negative sign X then that's not that bad that wasn't a whole lot of work if we try to do it differently if we try to do it linear I would just see the difference here so that was separable that's fine that gave us the right answer the same as I'd answered if you had to do this linear you'd have to distribute we have to get the cosine XY on the opposite side so we have to groove our Y's together basically then you have to say okay well what's my P my P is cosine X my Rho will be e to the integral cosine X that's 9x and we would multiply it every single on on both sides every single term so we have it's going to do it separately we'd have e to the sine X and then e to the sine X and most importantly e to the sine X on the left hand side this is not a problem this would say okay yeah you're going to have a derivative with respect to X of e to the sine X Y which of course the derivative of either sine X gives you cosine X be the sine X you're not a problem on the right hand side you're going to have to take the integral of cosine X needed sex this side easy derivatives gone this side take an integral with strength eggs we get e to the sine X y equals well that's a new so and that I mean you can see already there's a lot more work here that already introduces something that I don't really want to have to deal with I don't have to deal with it so you take a u equals sine X I completely lie to you by the way stem I can do this not totally doing it because I can't help it cosine X DX so e to the U would be e to the sine X and you can see that that's the derivative of this gives you that right there so we get cosine actually the sine X plus C and we will plug in our pi/4 x and our two for for uh for y we would get that this would equal that's that's to minus one of the CC would equal 1 so C would equal one here that tells us that I know we're kind of run into the problem we get it I'm gonna do two things I'm gonna tell you that C is one I'm also going to tell you that to get rid of e to the sine X even multiply everything by e to the negative sine X that would give you Y that would give you one that would give you one times e to the negative sine X and that's exactly what that is which way is easier the way that makes sense in this case of both of them work but is something fits simpler technique or something fits without having to modify it you should probably use that technique right here there's no reason why we wanted anything else besides linear right here there's no reason why we should do anything else our side separable that was easier I think that was easier to get to here I had it shown to this a lot but it is possible to make that into a linear so whatever technique makes sense to you but generally speaking it's the one you don't have to do as much work with the one that you want to modify to make it fit sometimes there's exceptions to that but in general that's what you're looking for so let's try two more I'm honestly I would like you to try that one on your own at least as far as identifying whether or not you have a linear first-order differential equation that one's weird so I'll talk about that one together but see if you can see if that's linear if it is can you done with my P can you do that can you see if you can do the integral of the P and put that as an X 1 on e e to some function of X for Rho can you multiply everything by that give it a try possibly if you can just see if you can do it and if not nobody do so learning it so together yeah that's linear that's first order derivative of y plus some function of x times y to the first power equals something that doesn't have lies in it that's what we're talking about now that we have it in proper form we find P of X well P of X is the factor that's attached to Y that's Co tailor the thing that's going to complete our result of a product rule is always an exponential and the exponent is an integral of P of X now we talked about that at length on why that works that way so I would use your table use your your integration take these whatever it takes to do that integral quickly that is Ln of absolute value sign X so if that is Ln a of a site X well then e ln Argan and we just get that this is equal to sine X and that's what we're going to be multiplying all three terms by so we'll have sine X dy/dx plus y times cotangent X times sine x equals cosine Oh time Silex now we do like to simplify quite a bit because right now you go hey the derivative sign X is not this yeah that's that's true the group of sine X is cosine X so let's see if that makes cosine X remember cotangent is cosine over sine well that gives you just cosine X so let me simplify things are a little bit more apparent to us so sine X dy/dx no little problems plus well we could have cosine X times y equals sine X cosine X derivative this gives us that and that's how you check this that that's how the product rule works so this came from some derivative with respect to X of a product rule where we let the first term alone on the first sorry first factor alone the first term the second factor alone on the second term and that gave us an equation a differential equation where the right side is exactly that now when we integrate with respect to X because that's what we took the derivative way these are gone we get sine x times y on the right hand side you probably have to use a u sub u equals I would pick u equals sine X that way the derivative the sine X is cosine X so we would just get u squared over 2 or 1/2 u squared so that would be 1/2 sine squared X plus C and if we let's see we have to divide when we so divide by sine of X hopefully you thought that you would equal sign do you let's take the derivative that sine X DX so this would be the integral of u du u this whole thing is to you that get us the one-half U squared and then you just put sign right back in there that's how I'm getting that I'm just doing a lot of in my head I probably should have done that sorry so we'd have 1/2 sine squared X plus C if we divide everything by sine X well we get 1/2 sine X is U divided sine square divided by sine but you also get plus C over sine X so dividing everything by sine X let's just make that better we know that 1 over sine X is cosecant so let's write that it's come seeking there's a little review of trigonometry for you and that's what we want to see so we did our basic integral again but most of the work is done right hand side left hand side just calculate along you have a set technique for that and then we solve for y so divided by sine X square divided by sine X gives something X C divided by sine X gives us cosecant X that's the idea so the next one and that thing doesn't look anything like how we want it to be oh yeah all right well I mean the lease it's got a first order derivative for sort of differential equation but it's not separable you got four terms of there I don't see how I'm gonna be able to give it to Weiss what's going on with that if you're gonna try to make this linear you have the Y in two places you're gonna have a factor so let's try to factor this and since there's four terms maybe click so we go oh let's see if we can factor by grouping don't you try that now see if you remember that's factor by grouping we're gonna be first grouping factor by grouping groups the first two that says what can you factor out that as far as a GCF nothing nothing means one grouping always brings down your middle term groups the last one says one can you factor out of that as far as a GCF what and if you have two terms with the same factor you can keep on going factor 1 plus X what remains is one plus one let me ask you is there any way that you wouldn't do that with the separable equation why wouldn't you do that with separable equations you can divide both sides by 1 plus y leave the 1 plus x squared is move the DX so I would certainly do it that way of course if you're trying to do by bilinear you don't make it that far so this right here this would be done if you could if it's possible you do it by separable equations I'm not going to go through that I'm gonna go back one step that's how I would recommend trying to go yep that's separable see if you can move one over one plus y one over one plus X and maybe written in size to do linear can't leave it there why well I told you that you need some function of x times y when we factored this we've got Y times that function this is kind of irrelevant let's move this to the left hand side let's group our wise okay if we do that we'd have dy DX we subtract 1 plus x times the Y on the right hand side we still have 1 plus X well now that we've written this as linear so hopefully you learned that there's on some of these there's more than one technique available that happens quite a bit I would have picked it acceptable at least to try it if we ran to a problem then we go back into linear so if you're practicing linear I'm going to show you where that happens so I'm gonna try it separable if that didn't work then I come back here and okay let's try our linear I can go back one step and say yep I can subtract the thing that has our only Y on the left hand side group our dy/dx and or Y term the right hand side we have an X term and then we can identify what P of X is P of X it's always the piece that's right for live role of X says you're gonna get this exponential where the exponent is the integral of your P of X because when you take a derivative that don't give you back your P of X so if we take the integral of that it looks really nasty but we have e to the negative X plus 1/2 x squared integral of 1 is X integral of X is x squared over 2 so 1/2 x squared we have a negative out front unfortunately that is what we have to multiply all of this crap line why did I just pick separable so I let that big spot for what we're about to multiply by so I'm going to multiply everything by my row so e to the negative x plus 1/2 x squared and e to the negative x plus 1/2 x squared and e to the negative x plus 1/2 x squared now the left hand side is always very nice all you have to do is check it is the derivative of this piece equal to this piece well the truth here would be 1 plus X and then it has a negative so yep that works so we can take all of that and say hey that's the result of some product rule where I had this piece times this piece and we know it's got to equal this piece then we take an integral the left-hand sides basically done for a snowy deal on the right hand side you didn't need to do so so when we do a usin and we say let's just let u equal the inside so the nasty buddy then we see that the evening was one to take the derivative derivative of X is wandering 1/2 x squared gives us X when we go okay do u equals 1 plus X DX that's this whole piece but just notice we did not include the negative with that choice of U so this would equal the integral of e to the negative you can you be careful with your signs be careful then left hand side we're gonna leave that alone for just a minute right hand side we get negative e to the negative u plus C but we know when u is negative the exact same exponent this is the time where you would want to find your C so if we plug that in we would have this gives us 0 so 0 plus 0 e to the 0 is 1 this becomes 0 still hold upside to 0 on the right hand side you would have 0 + 0 at 0 e to the 0 is 1 that's negative 1 so C equals 1 0 equals negative 1 plus C else equals 1 and let's let's go ahead and let's put that in there because now what we're going to multiply by and you might be been wondering why am i leaving that negative out there well this happens a lot happens that when you get to the end or interior substitution these things work nicer without distributing that we multiply everything by e to the positive version of this that would create one so just Y negative one and then e to the positive exponent there so multiply everything by e to the positive exponent gone this whole thing's gone times negative one you want plus one times the positive exponent and that's about as good as we can get on that one you might want to write that in different order so you could have e to the X plus 1/2 x squared and then plus or minus one to end no big deal but that's the idea is it's this all the stuff that works but sometimes you kind of want to check what what the format of your what technique would work best in this case I would have certainly tried separable equations first okay let's try another one this has some more advanced ideas on what we can do so let's try to make it fit we're gonna go quickly through it I told you they're going to look more advanced we're gonna go quick because the technique should be there so number one doesn't fit no make it fit linear if we can so let's divide everything by X we're also going to want to make sure that we group our X's in front of our why cuz that's going to be our P and we're gonna simplify well 2x over X gives us 2 minus 3 over X let's treat that as our P equals 4 X cubed then we use find our P and do the angelou that it's a little bit more manageable than something ridiculous like this that would be kind of difficult to do we'd be doing this anyway so P of X is 2 minus 3 over X Rho of X says take your exponential do an integral of P of X see what that does to give us 2x minus 3 Ln X so integral of 2 is 2x minus integral of 3 over X is 3 Ln X we know we can move that exponent up and we can also separate this so we can do e to the 2x times e to the negative I'm sorry yeah ok so e to the negative Ln of X cubed well we can also move this and as this make that an exponent you can multiply you're gonna get X to the negative third power we could have done it right from here too you can see the same thing move the negative 3 up an ad that's fine tunas we're not we didn't either the 2 x equals e to the Ln of X to the negative 3 those times those are gone we have e to the 2x over X cubed y over X and negative third power gives us 1 over X cubed so you have the 2x times X in a 3rd power get is neither 2x over X cubed that's our rhythm let's take that let's multiply we now Miller we're completing that that pro tool on a on a product let me take a derivative lots of things are going to simplify on the right-hand side so we have execute is completely gone where's Jamie for either the two eggs we would double check this but man that's that's a product rule with a negative so you if you distribute this and you figured that out the derivative of this is that thing that's crazy but you should work that out we know that this is the result of a product rule a product rule of a derivative with respect to X where we take the first factor and left it alone for the first term the second factor in left alone for the second term and if we do an integral on both sides now you're not going too fast for you I hope that made sense it's a same technique this is you getting a little bit more advanced so we the P can look funny that's not everybody um when we do an integral of that don't forget that you can split up fractions don't forget that we have an e to these things you can split up those that he has a product of either whatever those those those things are those sorry terms are and we know that negatives and coefficients moobus exponents we can simplify each of Ln no problem that's our road that I don't care what you have that's which you're multiplying every single piece by and that's what we've done we simplified where we could and we know that this is the result of product or right the product after that we do our integral we get e to the 2x over the next few times y equals is a u sub if you'd like this is going to be 2 e to X let me know that because when you take a derivative of this we would get back the exponential times 2 on that 2 so that would give us that 4 plus C and lastly all we need to do is solve for y so multiply everything by e to the negative 2x or divide everything by e to the 2x so this and this and that's going to get me in the negative x and we'd also multiply by x cubed so basically multiplying by the reciprocal in this so why would you roll we'd still never - but you no longer have an e to the 2x when you distribute you just have X cubed well we're doing both of them on the scene that's about as good as we can do on that problem okay last one and I just want to talk about this because the setup is so strange whenever you get something looks really weird like man it's almost linear but there's a Y over here you're going to have to factor do the factoring first before you divide your lot easier on you so what I mean by that and this is just a set up I'm not I'm gonna do about a quarter of the problem and you can try it on your own we want to get their Y's on the same side so we subtract that and it is okay to get 0 in fact in this problem when you after you figure out you're you're the product to get the product rule you're going to be integrating the right side it's going to be zero no matter what you multiply by do you see that no matter what you multiply by you're going to get zero so the integral is zero just gives you zero Aurel actually gives you see a constant let's see so don't worry about that get your Y's together and factor and then you can divide everything by X so when you divide by X we get dy/dx we get one plus one minus three x over X and we would still get zero it's okay to by zero by X split that up just like the previous problem and then you're gonna be all set so we would get 1 over X minus 3 it's been look so similar to last probably your P of X is this you take the integral of that given Ln X you should see that that will cancel you'll get just X minus 3x so you have either to negative 3x multiply all three spots just don't forget that when you do integral the right hand side this is for you when you didn't integral the right hand side you're gonna get a constant that's where your C is that's about it I hope this makes sense that when you have two y's you're gonna have to factor alright guys I hope the video makes sense I'll see you for the next one ok just kidding I couldn't leave it and I had to I had to do it so anyway I worked it out and this is just the answers for you so if that's your P I integrated the P I separated from my row made it a lot nicer I multiplied everything here and here and here which still gave me a zero I created my product it's very easy to do just take this piece put a wine next to it that's your product can degrading both sides integral of 0 gives you C and then solve for y so that's what you should be getting that's what you should have gotten all right now let's see the next video you 

Transcript for: Domain Restrictions In Differential Equations and Integrating Factors (Differential Equations 17)
hey now that you've mastered a few of these techniques of solving first order differential equations and and mainly we have just basic integration we we now have this the separable equations and we just mastered these linear first order differential equations we need to stop it start talking about something a little bit more specific and what I mean by that is that when we start manipulating these differential equations from where they start in to how they're fitting our technique sometimes we're running into some domain issues so I haven't mentioned it my videos have been more focused on the technique like how do you do it what's it mean what are we going for but now we need to start thinking about that and so for the next few videos at the very end I'm gonna have you go back and think well you know what what do we really do here so I'm gonna focus on technique first just like it did in the last two videos but then I'm gonna go back and say hey there's some pieces that we need to understand and I think that's best because you'll understand the technique and then you'll go ahead and go okay now that I understand what's really going on I can see that we might have some issues here and so I'm gonna walk you through a few examples of when we're gonna face some domain issues when we're rewriting our differential equations to fit a certain technique so a lot of times this happens on our linear first order differential equations so a couple things we want to we want to really nail down number one is that when we're doing our linear first order differential equations and we're coming up with that row that that piece that missing piece that's completing our product rule we call that an integrating factor so when you see that it's in the title last few videos but I never mention it again I was focused on the technique but now we need to start nailing down some specifics so what that's called look that row is called is an integrating factor and that's that missing piece that's creating the product rule for us so whenever you see that whenever you hear that once you start thinking okay integrating factor and from now on I'm going to start using that language when we get to it especially like Bernoulli equation so when we get there in a few videos I'm gonna be saying things like okay now we're fine our integrating factor or this is our integrating factor or we use that and so when we're dealing with our linear first order different equations we solve those by by implementing implementing this integrating factor that we multiply on both sides and allows us to integrate very easily by completing that product rule so the technique is there now we're just kind of naming stuff also not on every one of them but on a lot of these linear first-order difference of equations to get them in the right format we had to divide but we know something about dividing we know that we can't ever divide by zero you know wait a minute so if if I have to divide by zero to get from here to here and these two these four examples are in the last video that that we talked about so if I if I had to do buy to go from here to here whatever X is zero you go well that's a really good point what if that X is zero and so many times what you're gonna see a lot of people do myself included is in the back of it since we always should show it I should have I should be showing it I'm gonna show it now but I was more focused on the technique some people don't even show this and they need to because what's happening is when we're using a certain technique to solve a differential equation sometimes we have to place restrictions on the domain to make that technique work so for instance if we want to solve this by a linear differential equation for sort of differential equation we're gonna have to divide by X that X can't be 0 and so we're gonna start putting conditions on this so we begin ago okay that's divided by X I can't have the X be 0 but then pass that okay X can't be 0 I think we don't understand that you can't divide by 0 and for things like homogeneous equations what we get to in a few videos that's fine and that's what we're gonna stop at is okay well we just can't have 0 but especially for linear sometimes it's really nice to not have to deal with an absolute value and Y and one of the reasons why that is is because when you are dealing with these linear differential equations when we solve them they're always going to have some sort of X expression on the left-hand side and an X expression on the right-hand side and it's nice to be able to simplify them and so if one of them has an absolute value and the other one doesn't that's an issue and we can't simplify that very well now on homogeneous we sometimes run the same thing but typically it's Ln of an absolute value or if absolute value wrapped up into something where we wouldn't be able to simplify any way but with linear we can simplify a lot of these after we go ahead user an integrating factor after we go ahead and do our integration and then we go okay hey so there's an X here there's X here let's simplify it that's really hard to do if one of them has an absolute value in one of them doesn't and so many times when we're dealing with these linear many times things like every time we wouldn't we divide by this X what's what happens when we divide by this X you are going to get something that says oh yeah when I integrate that I'm gonna get an Ln absolute value X what's that we're down to e to the Ln says I'm gonna have just that absolute value of X but if I'm gonna get something on the right hand side that has X's I really don't want to be messing around an absolute value and so what a lot of times we do instead of just saying well X can't be equal to zero because I'm dividing by zero if I let that happen X can't be equal to zero I'm just gonna say this I'm gonna say let's make X greater than zero that way I'm not dividing by zero but then that way I'm also not having to deal with an absolute value on my integrating factor that's where that comes from out that makes sense and so when we're dealing with these sure our technique is hopefully now perfect we understand exactly what we're doing I spent a long time explain that now we have some finer points like why in the world are they saying X has to be greater than zero why we can't can we just divide yes but when we try to make these differential equations fit a certain technique sometimes we run into issues and so we have to place conditions on that domain and say this is gonna work as long as X is greater than zero then I can do things like divided by X family zero then I can do things like that's just going to be e to the Ln of X to the fifth instead of absolute value of x to the fifth then when I solve this difference equation have to use my integrating factor the X is on the right hands on the left hand side well they're not going to have absolute value but now the X is on the right hand side won't either and I'll be able to simplify them so that's where these conditions are coming from that's why we use them it makes first it makes our method possible we have to restrict that in order to bye-bye X and then it lets us simplify a little bit better some other reasons sometimes that we can not have that absolute value it's important for us and so we'll restrict it even more say not just not zero but let's just make it greater than zero that's one reason let me do that look at the next one maybe you can start seeing it now hey we're dividing by X you're gonna absolutely say okay X can be equal to zero you're never going to be able to divide by zero but you have to divide by X or make this technique work that's a linear first order differential equation we're going to use an integrating factor to take care of that oh wait if I divide by X I'm probably going to get this one over X inside that integral for the integrating factor I don't want to have to deal with the absolute value let's make it positive that way we understand that we're not going to have to mess around with that and on the right hand side will have some X's now on the left hand side we'll be able to take the x's without absolute value on both sides and simplify them that's the idea okay you're kind of the same idea that you can you can see it here too but same idea here we're dividing by X we have this I can't divide by zero but because of an integrating factor I'm going to be getting this Ln of X well I don't want to have the absolute value because e to the Ln absolute value of x if I were to simplify that I'd still have the absolute value of x and that wouldn't simplify with something later on so oftentimes we'll just say let's just let's make this grimming zero that way we can avoid we can avoid absolute value makes things really streamline and the same thing on this one if we divide by 2x well we're still divided by X we're still saying there's a 1 over X that's still I want to avoid the absolute value and so we'll say ok let's make X strictly greater than 0 and that's what you're going to see a lot of the times on these linear first order differential equations so just a recap of everything we've done right now not much really but the idea is number one your technique should be there the name of the thing that we're multiplying to let this technique work is called an integrating factor it's on the title just never mention it in that video I'm going to be using it from now on so whenever I say that the integrating factor that's what the role of X is as in every case that's what's completing the product rule force secondly we need to start thinking about domain and so for the next few videos what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do all the problems I'm gonna focus mostly on the technique that's gonna get you rolling on it and then what I'm gonna do is I'm say hey you need to think back on this look at some of these problems what's the problem in making the differential equation fit this particular technique in linear first-order differential equations a lot of times are dividing by a variable we need that variable to not be 0 then especially on linear not so much of homogeneous but we have this X greater than 0 so we avoid some absolute values there's there's another reason for that but most of it I would just want you to think of that that we're avoiding absolute value so I hope that helps you understand why we have X greater than 0 on a lot of these problems now so you were working out of a book or your teacher you know you need that why do we need that we need that because we're divided by a variable that can't be 0 we're going to use that in our integrating factor we don't want absolute value and some of the domain issues on these Linear's get a little crazy and so we restrict that to X greater than 0 to avoid some of those issues that's a second reason so I just want you to know that so we're referencing that at the end of our videos watch for those so after we doing technique we're gonna master the technique and talk about domain hope that helps I'll see you for the next video you 

Transcript for: Special Integration in a Linear Differential Equation Problem (Differential Equations 18)
Hey so I was working on some problems and I came across this one and we were in the the linear differential equations and our first order difference equations and this one just threw me for a loop and I thought man that's a lot more involved and some of the stuff we did it's got this kind of special technique of integrating where it doesn't quite fit what you would normally look at for integration and that happened and count too but when I came across I thought this deserves its own videos so we're gonna go through this example I'm gonna go quite slow on this one because it's so involved there's lots of room for errors and frankly I made a couple of errors myself when I did the first time so I wanted to give you the courtesy of giving this problem walking walking through it with you and and just showing you exactly what takes place so sometimes we get these difficult integrations or in these integrations that don't quite fit I want to look at that with you so let's go through together let's see if we can classify this as a first order differential equation that happens to be in that little linear category now let's work with it so we're looking at this for going well that's a difference of equation of course we have an initial value problem we've got an equation first order differential and we have Y to the first power so let's try to get this to look like how we really want our our linear equations to look with just that dy/dx and then we have this thing this function of X is next to our Y on one side and then equals this function of X so have you if you watch the last the last video that should make sense to you if you haven't you really should watch that right now this is a great opportunity for us to kind of go step by step see if you can do this step and so I'm gonna be going slow to see you can work through it and then see if we're on the same page so is it a linear first-order differential equation yes is it in the right form no you should probably try to put that in the right form right now we want the dy/dx to be by itself function of x times y and then equal sign and then another function of X no otherwise so that means for us we've got divided by the x squared plus 1 we're going to do that divide all three terms by that x squared plus 1 and so we get that that's the form that we want so that's familiar to you that's fantastic you you know that proper form for solving this first-order linear differential equations now it looks fairly benign like yeah okay no problem it's it's in the proper order of this thing is the function of X that we're looking for so that right there is that P of X we're talking about remember with linear first order difference of equations we're trying to find something to multiply by so that we can create this result of a product rule if we can create the result of a product rule we can write the product if we know that that was there was that what we have here is the result of the product rule okay well that's great then we can take an integral of both sides and solve for our function so right now what we're gonna be doing is we're going to be finding this thing to multiply by this integrating factor that we're multiplying by it's going to multiply every single term it's going to create for us the result of a product rule then we're going to integrate and that's all that we're going to do so I'm going to find the product and then we're going to integrate both sides in order to find that integrating factor what we were what we talked about last last video was that we wanted to repeat so we want the derivative of this thing to repeat the function and the derivative of the function need to have the same thing in it that means we're gonna have each of a function also because it's the result of a product rule the thing we're multiplying by here is going to be part of that product so this is going to be the X part of that product this has to be the derivative of the exponent of the exponential that we're going to multiply by and that was in that last video so our P of X is this whole entire thing all right no problem that means that if we're gonna find if this is the derivative of some exponential function of the exponent that exponential function then Rho of X would equal e to the f of X sure wrote of X that even the f of X is the only type of derivative that we are on it's type of function we have when we take a derivative of it we get the function back so on our product rule we want this piece to go here and we want the derivative of this piece to be here the little bits we need we needed to repeat this is gonna be tacked on over on this right hand side it was in the last video well if we do this if we take the derivative of e to the f of X we leave it alone by the product rule for the first term we take the derivative of it here so this is gonna have to be multiplied here but then that piece that P of X must be the derivative of f of X that was all explained the last video what that means in order to find the f of X we've got to undo this as if that is the derivative it means we get integrated so this would be the integral of 3x squared over x squared plus 1 DX and this is where I'm going to spend most of our time right now it's just integrating that and then this thing's gonna explode and look crazy which is why it does I think it deserves on video so let's take a look at how to solve this integral let's find that so I'm gonna ignore the e for a second we'll put it back in just a bit but let's focus on you know what I'm going to do I'm gonna leave this I'm going to put it up here I'm gonna show you two ways to look at that integral and then then we'll come back and we'll read kind of reevaluate let's go on here so let's look at this integral of x cubed 3x cubed over x squared plus 1 DX your first inclination might be to go oh wow that looks just like maybe trig so because we got the x squared plus 1 and it's not partial fractions because you can't well you can maybe like write partial fractions but if you've thought about partial fractions it's not a direct partial fraction because the exponent here is higher than exponent here that might lead you down long division that is an appropriate technique I'm going to show you that in a minute but there's also a way around not doing that not doing long division I kind of like long division I like perfect fractions there's another way to look at it so I'm going to show you both ways is one of the reasons why we're doing the problem right now what if you just chose to do a substitution and you go that doesn't look like a substitution but maybe we can force it to be if we did u equals x squared plus 1 let's just run with this then D u equals 2x DX you go I don't see an X it seemed x cubed up there this is one of the reasons how I was taught I was taught how to do integration by substitution by solving for the DX and that way when you put this back it'll cancel some X's but some won't cancel and that's okay and so level to check that out so if you've never seen that this is how I would do it in like a calc 1 class to explain what's exactly going on and then we sort of transform this into well you're really just looking for the DX and all the X's you group them together well what if that doesn't work then you get stuck or you have to think about this as 3x squared times X which is totally fine too and then you're you've divided by 2 and your XD X this X DX would change into D u over 2 but you'd still have a 3x squared then we're going to see that on either technique so whatever you want to do that's fine well we're gonna do is we're going to look at this as let's leave that 3x cubed we know that we call this U but then we know that DX is substituted and we use the substitution D u over 2x and this is what I was talking about as far as the cancel is concerned when we look at this we know that we can pull out the 3 halves but X is going to cancel with X cubed and leave squared so whether you write that as three x squared times X and just substitute it do you / - here's our do you / - it's gonna work the same thing so we have a 3/8 integral of x squared over you do you pulled out the three-halves cancel one of the x's we've got an x squared over you do you and then you go wait a minute that's not how I've learned out of these substitutions that doesn't work the oh yeah you're right because all of your variables have to match and so when this happens it's okay to use your substitution twice you have forgot about that it's been a long time for a lot of you since you've even looked at substitution some of the comments on the videos are saying it man you're I'm so glad you're going through this because I forgot how to do it happens happens to everybody so whenever you have this situation where you did a substitution it wasn't trig so you know I don't want to do long division what you could have maybe I can just do a substitution to work with it this happens quite a bit where if we use the substitution one time to get rid of x squared plus one we got that you maybe we try to use it again to get rid of another variable up there so if u equals x squared plus one and we still have an x squared well can you just subtract one from both sides and get x squared equals u minus one since that substitution works for you equals x squared plus one it has to work for x squared equals u minus one it's the same it's an identity I mean you're calling these things equal so however you add or subtract on both sides it has to still be equal that means that x squared we can rewrite that x squared as u minus 1 let's take a look at that a little bit closer so when we have that three-halves integral of u minus 1 over u do you remember remember how when you have a number of terms on a new writter but only one term on the denominator which is why this works you can split that fraction up so we can write u over u which is 1 minus 1 over u do you and that looks a whole lot better that's not a fraction we don't need another substitution we've split that fraction up into two fractions we don't have any X's so our use match or D use this is something where you can now either great so we have the three ass make sure you have parentheses because that's going to distribute here we have you - Ln absolute value of U and then we would normally have a plus C but remember what we're doing what we're doing is just finding this exponential we're going to multiply that everywhere so it's going to get multiplied here it's right here and here and here which means that that see that'd be e to the C well that's just a constant not zero it's actually positive on all three places so and you could easily divide it out for that reason we don't do a plus C Warner integrating on top of our exponential it's not needed what is needed is for us to put our you back so we use this to get our you okay now let's use this to get our our X's back so we used you one time to get two x's we're going to use that substitution again to get back to use sorry back from use so to use use the you to get rid of the x's and use the e to get rid of your use that's fine so our u is x squared plus one we used it to get rid of our X's now we're gonna back and if we distribute that three hats notice I'm gonna I'm gonna drop my absolute value because x squared plus one it can't be negative with real numbers so we don't even need that now that looks really nasty that is just the exponent of what we're gonna have to multiply by so we're gonna come back here in just a minute I'm gonna show you how the long division would work just in case you forgotten how to do that and I'll show you that we get exactly the same thing and whichever technique you would like to use that's fine so one more time what we're what we're looking at is this linear first order difference with equation we just put in the right form we said that's a P looks pretty okay and then we started going alright well if that's our P we need to integrate this to find the function of X so that when we would take the derivative by the product rule it would give us that back as that piece as the chain rule portion of the exponential derivative we go right well that's happen and that's nasty how do we do it not a treat so trust me you do not want that I tried it not fun so we do a maybe a substitution twice or we look anything that looks like a partial fraction with an irreducible quadratic can I maybe do long division well let's let's try our long division if we try the long division remember with long division you need every power on this numerator in here every power banks descending down to a constant so we have 3x cubed shirt when we have 0 x squared 0 X and then a constant of 0 the reason that is is when we start dividing by x squared plus 1 we need some place value holders because when we start distributing by whatever our our result is then we're going to start multiplying by x squared and by 1 we're going to start getting back some some powers of X to the power x cubed it's created squared or exes and we need to have a place for that so when we do long division of polynomials we only care about the one it just plays along so we look at what is 3 X cubed divided by x squared X cubed divided by x squared X sorry 3x and when we multiply it we can we can check your work long time our first terms have to always match up 3x times x squared is 3x squared no it's not 3x times x squared is 3x cubed but then when you distribute so we multiply the first term we multiply the second term notice how we're going to get a 3x that 3x has to fall under something if you didn't have that 0 X right here it'd be really often when I subtract that from well you don't have any X's this is a way for us to understand that what we're doing here is we're subtracting from something's not there we're going to get a negative x or if you're subtracting negative you're going to get a positive X it just gives your mind a way to see what's going on so when we subtract like long division always does yeah you need parentheses 3x cubed minus 3x cubed is 0 0 x squared that's there's no other X Squared's that's nothing you don't even need that 0 X minus 3 X 0 X minus 3x and then you start that algorithm again take the first term divided by the first term you go I can't and you're right as soon as and this is what help this is how powerful fractions work as soon as that numerator has a degree that's less than your denominator you're done you can't simplify that anymore you'd have to use partial fractions or a substitution or break it up like we did here with this fraction so what to do with that well what to do with with this piece of it by the way maybe I probably should have done this we could have pulled that 3 out from the start and not even worried about the 3 doesn't matter not really you'll see it right now if we write our equation when we could by this polynomial by this polynomial so when we took this and started doing long division our result was 3x cool and then we had a remainder and how do you write the remainder of any fraction when you're dividing is you can write that remainder over what you just divided by so this integral changes into that integral can you see that if I pulled the 3 out from this term in that term it would be exactly the same as if I pulled the 3 out there doesn't matter not really in fact when we get done with this we distribute the three halves anyway so take your pick it doesn't really matter what it does matter is your ability to do the rest of this so if you go well that this still doesn't look all that all that great I can do the integral of this one but that one looks a little funky you go to what should I use there should I use partial fractions no you should you should use a substitution because if you take the derivative of 2 X of x squared plus 1 you're gonna get 2 X and all we really care about is the variables matching up so here integral of 3x gives us 3x squared over 2 that looks pretty familiar then we have this and we'll see that in just a bit then we have this whole alright well if I do a substitution on just this piece then we're seeing that this integral is we had a three stool we substitute them using another technique now X DX so we have a deed over to so 3 and then D over 2 3 over u D over 2 and if we pull out that 3000 and integrate we've got 1 over you that's element you and we end up with three halves Ln X square plus one let me double check to make sure we're on the right track yep okay so you might be noticing a difference here and you go well Leonard if I I take this I take that and I take a look at that and those don't look the same even if I distribute this even I can see that that's that's got a plus three-halves in that one that one doesn't what's what's wrong what you do wrong do anything wrong what happened here is that your your integrals can be automatic constant we talked about how that constant isn't going to make difference so whether you include that or whether you don't the very first thing you would do is divide it away anyway so whichever one you have that's fine so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use that one it's a little bit more concise that we can show this one it's fine but you'd be dividing anyway so I'm gonna take a break I'm gonna race the board to leave just these two things so make sure you're okay with your integration then we're gonna start multiplying back let's continue so now that we've found out that that integral is either this or that and I'm going to show you that both of them work out exactly the same we can now make that integrated factor we can now make that relevant so we know that this thing that we're multiplying by equals e to the nasty junk either way you cut it so I'm going to show this one and then I'm going to replace a piece of it with this to show you in just a moment it's gonna work out exactly the same here you see what I'm talking about so let's start with this guy that we got by that long division we have e to the 3x squared over 2 minus three-halves ln x squared plus 1 ok that looks pretty good actually no it doesn't but we can still work with it let's start separating this and try to get rid of that Ln remember that what we can do is we can move these exponents to numerators so we could write this as e to the 3x squared over 2 well a couple things we could do times e to the negative three-halves ln x squared plus 1 so we're separating we know that x bones that are added and subtracted me and they came from a multiplication into twos that is a negative and then if you added those X coats you the exact same back and then we move that to the numerator so e to the 3x period over two times e to the ln x squared plus one to the negative three-halves I'm just moving that as an exponent and now we see that's a composition of these inverse functions and those always eliminate other they are inverses so this is gone let's rewrite in just a bit now this is what we're going to multiply to create this result of a product over here and here and here and then I'm going to do what I promised and show you why this difference doesn't matter so let's go ahead let's multiply that so this gets multiplied man it's going to be a really long long equation here here and here and here to create this result of a product rule on the left hand side let's do it dy/dx and we multiply by e to the 3x square root of 2 times x squared plus 1 to the negative 3x yay let me do it again so we multiply that here we still have this garbage times y and it may be the equal sign and we multiply on the right hand side also see it all three places here here your no sign there's I have the original let's make sure that original rigid looks pretty good I'll make sure that I have that looking looking correct so I used it here let's see make sure I simplified so I separated that by exponents and multiplication I know that I can move this as an exponent so I did that I know that I have composition of inverse functions no problem that's it the same okay that looks really good so I'm always double-checking my work especially some like this that's crazy now I mentioned to you that this doesn't really matter so much so why why doesn't that matter if you took a look at this and instead of having 3x squared over 2 minus three-halves ln and you just had that plus three-halves that would have been please check this out don't miss this that would have been here that would have been oh if I have that plus three-halves i could separate that as an e to the three halves that plus three-halves right here that right there would have been written as either yes think about that this is all going to be an exponent on e on the exponential so e to the three-halves x squared times e to the three-halves times e to the negative three-halves ln x squared plus one you do the same thing with this one same things that one is you did over there but that guy that's either the three-halves so what would happen well when you do this and you simplify this down you'd still have this even the three-halves just floating out there well when you multiply that you have a times in three house at times e to the three-halves and at times you three-halves and if you have something this positive number there but it's positive its own it's not a whole number but it's a positive number that you could factor out and divide you're not dividing by zero what that means is that that's and that's an arbitrary constant it's literally arbitrary it makes no difference in this problem whatsoever in fact if you just divide all three terms by that constant it remains exactly the same so sometimes you get that when you're doing this integrals two different ways you might get this awkward constant up there that doesn't make a bit of difference and you're integrating factor you should divide it away and that's fine if you were thinking about this like we'll wait a minute what about whatever if you're just doing a regular old integral well that wouldn't make so much of a difference either you'd have a constant in there that doesn't really matter as far as the adding subtracting you'd be able to rationalize that we'll divide that away so when we get back to our work whether you have that plus three-halves or whether you don't not such a big concern what is a concern now is making sure that this is the result of a product rule you go that's going to be hard to check yes it might be because here's the here's the factor that you would have to take the derivative of in order to get this whole entire piece that means that you have a product rule that means that you have a chain rule you start looking at them and you'd have to divide that away you'd have to the factor that because of that product rule so let's just imagine that is true hopefully that's true and or you'd have to check it by hand what we do after we check it mr. bill okay if this is the result of a product rule this thing that's been added then this is a factor that we didn't take a derivative of and this is a factor that we didn't take a derivative of and they're added together so remember how we leave the first factor alone derivative of the second so its root of Y that's your Y plus the derivative of the first that's the derivative of that factor that's the derivative of that thing and then times we leave the second one alone what that means is that this is a product rule the result of a product rule where a product is that this is the product rule from that thing on the right hand side let's simplify as much as we can so we know that e to the negative three halves x squared times e to the three times x squared you're multiplying common bases you add exponents these things are gone thank goodness right we'd still have six x here we have x squared plus 1 to the negative three halves that means that we move this to a denominator then be x squared plus 1 to the positive 3 halves let's combine them you've got two halves plus three halves let's bypass so now we're left with this idea of this is a derivative besides a derivative of this and if we want to get rid of the derivative we know that we can integrate so let's integrate both sides with respect to X this was a derivative with respect to X this let's find an integral with respect to X once you do to one side you have you the other so on the left hand side the fundamental theorem of calculus says integrals on new derivatives basically so we've gone we have this e to the 3x squared over 2 and then this X sorry you glad I forgot something should have been screaming at me through the video I told you that this is a product and then I never actually put the product so you need a y hopefully you got that so this this is the result of this product rule derivative the first boom sorry leave the first loan River the second plus the first derivative the first time the second time say that again because it sounded kind of convoluted in my head probably YouTube this is the result of this now product with you when you have the Y leave the first one alone derivative the second factor plus the derivative the first factor all that stuff times I forgot the why the first time so when we integrate both sides no problem we have e to the 3x over to this x squared plus 1 to the negative three halves times y on the right hand side we have another integral this one's not so bad it's just a substitution so when we substitute view equals x squared plus 1 let's do it off to the side here we have let's pull the sticks out we have 6 we would have X DX is d over 2 so this whole thing is d over 2 and then this is U to the 5 halves so 6 divided by 2 that gives us 3 let's make that a negative 5 half so we can work with it we integrate let's see about that we didn't have a 3u negative 5 halves we're gonna add one so it's negative 3 halves divided by the new exponent the Reiser gone moved that to up its negative you to the negative three house and we know what you do is we know that U is x squared plus one so this integral equals that thing with x squared plus one let's do that now we do need a plus C there that's important in fact this is the first time that we get to look at our initial value our initial value says that when we plug in zero for X we actually get one for y so let's do that now there's no LMS or anything in here so it might be a good idea to do it now so when we plug in zero for X plug in 0 for X this whole thing would be zero you would get e to the 0 that gives you 1 times plug in 0 for X here that would give you 0 plus 1 1 to any powers 1 sorry times y well Y is equal to 1 when x is 0 on the right hand side we have negative 2 of course we have 0 squared plus 1 is 1 1 to any power is 1 plus C this is 1 1 plus 2 gives you 3 C is 3 not 1/3 like I did in a few videos ago just randomly divided for no particular reason because I wanted to onyx it so C here is 3 let's plug that back in so we're gonna have eat at 3 x squared over 2 no problem looking good x squared plus 1 we can do this negative 3 halves y okay certainly kind of crazy equals negative 2 x squared plus 1 to the negative 3 halves and then we have this plus 3 all we have to do now is solve for y so we're going to divide both sides by this which it cannot be 0 so we might think about that say multiply times x squared plus 1 to the positive 3 house that would cancel cancel x squared plus 1 to the positive 3 house has to go there next thing we're going to do is multiply both sides by e to the negative 3 x squared over 2 and that's going to go here and here and here so we're going to factor it out in the second one I'm going to show you that right now so I'm gonna erase this let's deal with this first let's get rid of that so I'm going to multiply both sides by X square plus 1 to the positive three-halves it's going to cancel cancel and go on to that 3 so I still have an e to the 3x squared over two I still have my Y we multiply both sides by this so this is gone this is gone so the two we have three to the x wrote this one to three halves I multiply both sides by x squared plus one to three house now we're going to multiply both sides by e to the negative three x over two and what we're gonna do instead of putting it in both places we're just gonna do this we're gonna say okay if you multiply both sides that e to the negative three x squared over two this is gonna be gone so we're just gonna get Y but on the right hand side let's leave the negative two let's leave the plus three let's leave the x squared plus one let's leave the three halves what we're gonna do is just show that this is multiplied by e to the negative three x squared over two and that's about as good as we can get that to look without distributing so if you even if you did distribute refactor it man I hope that makes sense that that is just a massive problem it's like ten times longer than any of the problems I've seen so had a special technique in there it really wrapped a lot of stuff together good problem hopefully we didn't make any serious error by no I forgot the Y but hopefully you caught that on your own and even man even when you're going through you're gonna do stuff like that which is why if you notice what I'm doing I'm always double-checking my work I'm always stopping going especially about students in here to catch my little mistakes I'm always looking through how does this make sense can I go back does this make sense what am I forgetting and try that try that when you're doing your homework and especially in your test if you have your that that process in your head to make a lot less mistakes so when you late special problem I hope that makes sense I hope that helped you in some way to see what we can and can't do with these things especially the two types of integration techniques we had alright guys I'll see you for the next video when we're gonna do a couple of applications like with some mixture problems have a good day you 

Transcript for: Mixture Problems in Linear Differential Equations (Differential Equations 19)
welcome back we're going to take a look at applications of some of these linear first-order differential equations and one very cool kind of important application for us is mixture problems so these ideas are what would happen if you had this this container all of this let's assume it's a liquid that has a mixture or some sort of solution in there like solve their pollutant or acid or with something in there and and you're not only are you pumping stuff into it with a different concentration but stuff is also leaving it and it's really mixed up so it's very good so the concentration leaving is representative of the concentration the tank in that moment of time so it's very well mixed well if these problems ask how long would it take to get a certain concentration in the tank or what would the concentrate concentration going to take be after certain amount of time so we're going to take a look at three examples on how to how to do these these types of problems kind of cool and they all revolve around these linear first-order difference equation so let's take a look about what we're gonna be doing and then take a look at our examples um so mixture problems how this solution changes over time which is what differential equations study in the first place is how things change over time if X is our solution so the amount of the solution at a certain time so that intz and the time how much salt is there how much acid is there how much pollutant is there well let's try to model this so I'm gonna walk you through where these equations come from because sometimes when you look at this in the book you go here is what does that mean let's let's see how that's created so if we think about how much solution so X the amount of solution is gonna be in our tank after a certain amount of time well that really relates to how much we're putting in and how much we're taking out so firstly let's think that the change of the amount that's there over time would be a change in incremental change of that amount over time well what would that over that be able to how would you how do you see you see the change of how much is in there so we have this this take of stuff and it's got a certain mixture let's say I don't know 5% salt or whatever and you're gonna start pouring stuff into there another another concentration it's going to start changing how much salt is in the tanks so this idea is imagine that you have this this vat of stuff and it has a certain concentration you start pouring in this other solution that has a different concentration what's in your tank is going to change if you start pouring in a weaker solution it's going to start having a weaker concentration do you start pouring in a stronger solution is going on a stronger concentration and that's also imagine you're pouring something out so at every moment in time you're getting additional or well your concentration is changing in your tank it's either you're gaining some of this amount or you're losing some of this amount of whatever you're talking about salt or acid or whatever well how that's changing if we can make this if we can make this change equal to something we can understand and if we can make this into a differential equation that by solving the differential equation how will this solution is changing over time we can find an equation for the solution itself but you guys see what I'm talking about so this right here would be the change in solution we're wanting to find a function for the amount of a solution so let's think about how this would change no what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna walk through what's it called the verbal model if you've watched all my videos which means you've lost like a thousand videos you've seen me do verbal models for word problems a lot that's how they always start so how would we look at how are our actual amount of solution is changing well there really would be a difference in the amount that you put in minus the amount you take out well that should make some sense I mean we have the the way that our amount of salt is changing is pretty closely approximated with how much we are pouring of the salt so that makes your point in and that make sure we're pointing out the difference between those two things is how our salt is changing notice how this is not how much is there it's how it's changing so then the amount of salt that you start with that that's in there and that would stay completely consistent if you didn't pour anything in and did for anything else this would stay exactly the same how it's changing is a comparison of how much is actually coming in - how much you're actually pouring out that's got to make sense before we go any further so amount in - amount out is not how much is there amount in - how amount how this how what's there is changing how what's there the amount of the solution is changing now let's talk about the amount in amount out that's going to depend on two things the amount of salt that you're actually pouring in so the salt in what you form the salt of the concentrations you pouring in it depends on how fast you're pouring in and what the concentration of what you're pouring in is for instance let's say this you're pouring in this salt solution we call it a brine pour in a brine at one gallon a minute well if you pour in at one gallon a minute and let's say it's five percent salt that would be like it's just a real pretty mild salt solution you pour that at what I say one gallon of one gallon a minute or versus five gallons a minute for the same solution well you'd gain salt a lot quicker porn a five gallon cement than you would one gallon a minute also you gain sold a lot quicker if you pour it in a 50% solution versus a five percent solution so the amount in is really a function of two things it's a function of the rate at which you're putting it in and the concentration of what you're putting into that tank or bridge or bad or what if you want siddur so the way that the amount of our solution is changing is the amount in but that's a rate times the concentration in times of time how fast you put it in what's the concentration of what you put in which means that's what what percent what proportion of what you're actually pouring in this VAT is is really salt or acid or pollutant times how much time you're putting the sins and this is a rate in a concentration in and a time for how long that how long you're actually pouring that in - how much you're pouring out so we're not just pouring it in this situation we're actually letting fluid let's Simpsons fluid leave the container well the amount out would be same idea how fast are you live in this drain out what's the concentration of what you're letting drain out for how long you're doing it well that's another rate tons of concentration times of time let's keep on going let's call these things some variables right now what I've done is a just in a verbal model and I'm man I hope it makes sense I'm gonna recap it here in just a couple minutes but keep on going let's call the rate in R sub I let's call the concentration C sub I and let's call the change of time this incremental change in time what's happening if I look at the change in every quarter second or second or tenth of a second - rate out arson Oh concentration out and the change in time delta T well we got to look at a couple things before we go any further first is whether they understand it and second is what of these four things are constant which of those four things are constant so first thing we're trying to model and changing amount in ace in a mixture how we model a change in a mountain to make sure it's going to end up being a differential equation what we want to do is create a differential equation so that when we undo that when we solve that differential equation we find a function that would tell us the amount of that substance in the tank or that or whatever at a certain amount of time this is our goal our goal is find an equation that will tell us how much is there at a certain point in time how are we gonna do it well the only thing we know about right now is how it's changing how does that amount changing well the only way that that amount can change is if I'm pouring something into it or draining something out of it or both and the way that would change would be you're adding something some amount of solution and you're taking some out well how much you're actually adding so the rate of change of our our salt here let's call it salt for now the rate of change of our solution or salt would be well the rate of how much you're pouring in times the concentration of what's your point in - the rate that you're pouring out times the concentration point out that this has certain made some sense you right now this is and this is the amount of salt that you're actually getting in this is the amount of salt that you're actually getting out so we're calling those variables and now let's talk about what are held constant well we're gonna hold rate in constant why it's really hard to do without that it'd be like this like hey I'm sold okay Jim I want you to I want you to pour this this solution in and like let's say it's a five percent salt solution once you pour this five percent salt solution in and like five gallons a minute there you go okay no problem man I got that so it's pouring in five gallons a minute and and you go hey Jim you still pouring that five gallons a minute goes no no no no important - why cuz cuz I wanted to go dude you just screw everything up because my mouth is now off so I have to have Jim pouring in that solution at five gallons a minute for the entire length of this problem otherwise we'd have to do several different problems and add them all up together okay so that rate in we're going to hold that to be constant also the concentration in it Jim's pouring in a five percent salt solution and then he just decides to change it to twenty five percent that's gonna drastically affect our math or how much salts actually in there so we're gonna hold the rate in at constant and the concentration in at constant the other thing that we're gonna hold it constant is the rate outlet so if you open the floodgate to a lake or you open the valve on on a tank or something we're gonna assume that that's pouring out at the same rate all the time otherwise for the same thing like Jim's born in if two gallons a minute versus five it's gonna really be too hard for us to salt with this model could we do it yeah but we probably need several problems to several different scenarios and add them all up to do that so we don't wanna do that so for our examples here we have to hold the rate in a constant your pouring in the same rate we have to hold the concentration in at constant what you're pouring in all has the same concentration and then we have to hold the rate out what's your what's leaving the tank how fast it's leaving the tank is constant what's not constant what we can't hold constant is the concentration out you see in last year to the Container and what's your point it has exactly the same concentration what you point out is always changing if you have this pure water and you start pouring a concentration with salt in it this is going to start getting more and more salty more and more salty until you start draining stuff out so that concentration out is always changing now there is one thing we're going to zoom about this we're gonna assume that in this bath or this lake or whatever is very well mixed so there's this mixer going crazy so as soon as you add something to it it's immediately perfectly mixed realistic I don't know but it otherwise remember that trade up we have in differential equations where we want to make it practical but doable this is one of the things we have to assume to make it practical otherwise it was an doable otherwise when we start considering that it's not well mixed we have different concentrations in the same vat very hard to deal with so rate in held the same concentration inhale the same I hope you understand why we kind of have to do that otherwise we'd have several different problems we have to add up right out held the same so you're letting it drain the same rate but the concentration how it is changing because what you're adding into it and what you're pouring out of it affect how much is actually there let's talk a bit more about that the concentration element if it's not constant what's in based on what would the concentration out be based on how are you finding concentration all the time is you compare how much salt or how much actual contaminant pollutant salt acid is in the container divided by how much volume is in the container at that time now what I mean what do we mean about at that time well in your container the volumes are only going to stay the same if we're pouring and we're pouring out at the same exact rates so R sub I equals barsen out R sub oh then yeah you sure your volume would be constant and we're gonna see that in the very first two examples that we do but if your value if your rate in is quicker than your rate out your volume in is slower than your rate out or letting a decrease it's gonna it's gonna change and it's gonna get lower so our concentration out is based on two things how much actual salt or solution is there divided by the volume that you currently have at that moment of time so the concentration out well mixture but always changing its based on how much is there divided by how you're distributing it in this volume at a certain amount of time let's go ahead and let's change this let's change this and just put C sub o let's make that X over V Oh so ammount how they mount and is changing - how they mount out is changing but they're not how rate that's the same concentration how is X / V with respect to t man that looks a whole lot like stuff from calc 1 I wonder if we could divide everything so both sides by delta T since the delta T is not 0 so delta T would be a legit change in time you're not dividing by 0 you're saying after the seconds or days little teeny bit that means we're not dividing by 0 and we need an approximation for how the amount of the solution is changing over time an incremental change very little when you deal with incremental change what's your what you're getting is an approximation this goes all the way back to calc 1 if we're looking at little chunks of time so after this amount of time in this amount of time in this amount of time we're missing the ability to give instantaneous amount of time because those chunks may be what you're measuring falls in between the amount that you're actually considering here what solves that for us is a limit to memory man I hope you remember remember remember our limits how what happens with that increment is that that gets really really really really really really really really really close without becoming 0 and it says that one of those increments that they're getting smaller you're getting more and more accurate measurement and that limit lets us do that so instead of Delta x over delta T we start taking taking limits and we changes to a derivative of X with respect to D a differential and then it's no longer an approximation that limit says man you're so close together that makes no difference it's still at zero but it's so close so close that you no longer approximating theories of our theories of calculus that we study in calc one tell us that this is now exact I've dropped the respect to T because this says it the derivative of X with respect to D oh my gosh a differential equation a first-order difference equation a look at your independent variable its T look at your dependent variable its X you have X to the first power and you're a function of T your independent variable sure X is also a function of T but that's taking the place of our Y like we did in the last last video we had dy DX and then we want to see why the first power now we have D X DT we want to see X to the first power this is a first-order differential equation it happens to be a linear first-order differential equation if we just add this to both sides and maybe this will help you see a little bit better we have equation differential equation first derivative so first order differential equation linear we have our dependent variable right here raised to the first power what's in front of that a function that's a function of T a function of our independent variable equals functions that are constant that's cool this is a first-order linear first order differential equation we're gonna use exactly the same techniques to solve it my whole goal for this first part was just to get you familiar with the formula because sometimes we're given that we go that looks like crap I have no idea what's going on here's what's going on hopefully I've done a good job of explaining what's going on with these mixture problems you were trying to find you're trying to find an equation it gives you how much salt is in a vat with respect to time if we solve this differential equation we're gonna find an equation that gives us how much salts are installed we find X of T how much salt is in the bath after certain amount of time how we're getting around that idea of solving that directly is saying I don't really know how to solve it directly let's find a differential equation let's look at how that salt is changing well the amount of salt is changing in that we say how much we're getting in - how much we're getting out okay how much we get in it how does that how's that I'm not beginning and changing well that would be the rate in terms of concentration how fast you're pouring in and the concentration of what you're pouring in - how the facts are pouring out and the concentration of what's your for now that difference there would be how that salt amount is changing okay cool let's call some variables let's look at what's constant you're pouring it into constant rate Watson your concentration of which appointed not changing constant the rate at which you point out constant not changing the concentration of what's your point out can't be constant unless what you're pouring in matches exactly what you're pouring out and then this is a very boring problem because nothing ever changes you're like give me 30 of those please so nothing changes that's just done that's how it works so the concentration well the concentration out would be in that moment of time how does that VAT have in it how much salt is in that VAT / how much volume is in that event at that moment of time notice if you're right in right now are different the volume is growing or decreasing the amount of salt that's in there is always changing if your concentrations are changing so the concentration outlets believing your your tank or your VAT is a comparison of how much salts there divided by how much volume is there that's the concentrations how we find the concentration for everything so let's put that there okay we got that now that looks a lot like we could divide by the increment of T divided by delta T okay cool now we have an approximation for how the salt is changing over time let's do a limit let's do our calculus one that's now a derivative so the way that X is changing with respect to time instantaneously is how the Mount is changing - the amount L we have that down then we subtract on both sides and we get a linear first-order difference equation and that's where that formula comes from let's I'm gonna erase the board and we're going to do three examples we're gonna kind of go from easy ones to some harder ones and then we'll call it good so now that we have hopefully a good feel for how a mixture problem is going to work let's look through three examples so the first one very basic we're just gonna get our feet wet with this no pun intended by water or sugar water here but what I'm going to do is I'm going to start with this in this example and show you how that comes about from it so we're gonna I'm gonna kind of repeat myself a little bit here because I really want to get the idea it is worthless for someone to be able to do the math without understand what's behind it so let's look at this situation we've got this thousand liter tank and it's really well stirred so if we put something in there we're gonna assume that it's stirred up perfectly like instantaneous 3000 liter tank and it contains 100 kilograms of sugar so is this this mixture that has 100 kilograms of sugar in a thousand liters well that's a concentration isn't it now we're gonna pump in some pure water so Jim man Jim's were messing up today alright he put in a hundred kilograms instead of ten so Jim just way over dinner with the sugar he's a sweet guy but I mean come on all right so we got a hundred kilograms we want ten so what's Jim what Jim is gonna do he's gonna drain some of it but he's gonna start over so he's gonna drain some of it and you're gonna pour in pure water what's it gonna do if you start pouring pour pure water and draining out what the the current concentration is well then you're gonna start losing sugar aren't you you're pouring something pure you're taking out something has sugar in your concentration is gonna drop our question is how long is it gonna take for us to get this mixture that it has only ten kilograms in the tank so we want to find a formula again suspense is not good for math so we want to find a formula for the amount of sugar and set it equal to ten then we can solve for T how long that's going to take let's start by identifying what our variables are we need to know a rate in the concentration in a rate out and something for the concentration out so let's talk about the rate in rate in is how fast are you pouring into whatever you're born in in our case we're pouring in this pure water at five liters per second let's call that five our units match up we're talking about liters so we get five liters greater seconds so when we solve this RT is going to be in terms of seconds what else me well the concentration in concentration we're pumping in pure water how much sugar is in pure water well if it's pure water nothing no sure so how much actual sugar is being put into this none zero sugar in what we're putting in so the concentration would be zero how about the rate out rate out is also five so whatever this mixture is at that moment in time we're pumping out five liters per second concentration out we don't know if that is so as far as a concentration out no it doesn't say what that is in fact that's part of this this problem here is that that concentration is always changing so let's think how that's changing how the concentration changes is how much sugars in there at a moment in time divided by how much of volume is in there and that's not changing because what we're pouring in one poor now this is the same does it make sense that if you pour in five liters per second into this thousand liter tank and you take out five liters per second at any moment in time you're still gonna have a thousand liters so our concentration is X over V our X is going to change with respect to time but let's think about our V RV that we just mentioned it if you've got a thousand liter tank you're pouring in and taking out at the same rate that volume is constant so our volume here it's just going to be 1,000 well let's start putting this putting this all together if we take our variables and plug them in down here R sub I that's five C sub I that's zero minus R sub out five times C sub out that's x over 1,000 if times how much time is changing if we divide both sides by delta T notice how this whole thing is zero that's completely gone well we would get Delta X delta T is equal to negative 5x over 1,000 that's an approximation that's about right if we let our calculus report for us we get a differential equation if we add that to both sides oh my gosh better indeed I did get our dependent variable X here let's make sure X is with our DX over DT equals zero the only reason why I did this I'm not going to really do it after this so much is to show you that what you get from here by just using your logic of in out and all that stuff that the x over B is exactly what you did here by what most textbooks would give you as a form and so just use this why because we know how to deal with calc 1 that's why let's check it out could you actually get the same exact thing sure you get a DX DT get DX DT you got the rate out the rate out is 5 right out is 5 you get the volume volume is a thousand volumes a thousand you have an X next you have a rate in times concentration in that's five times zero oh you got a zero same exact stuff now comes our knowledge of hey then its chemical this is a linear first order differential equation can we solve it sure we know how to do our integrating factor of Rho of X we know that that's going to be e to the integral of whatever is in front of our X I prefer writing like that where we have 5 over 1000 you might even just do 1 over 200 so that might be a little bit nicer and we know all about this I'm not going to recover it again because I've done that many many times but this is the result with product rule we're trying to multiply everything by something that's going to show that so how that something works you want something repeats that's e to the whatever the integral of this is this has to be the derivative that exponent so 1 over 200 I also made a little bit of a mistake it's right here that should be a teeth because this right here needs to be a function of T naught X and it's going to happen to you two you're going to start putting the X everywhere because we're used to that being an independent variable it's not here it's T so we're gonna find Rho of T that's going to be knee to the integral of 1 over 200 DT well that's just going to be T over 200 we don't need a plus C that's totally fine that we deal and if we multiply everything by that so we have a DX DT no problem we've got a plus 1 over 200 and we have an equals 0 and if we multiply both sides by e to the T over 200 we don't work for your own X on the right hand side 0 times anything is 0 on the left hand side this is now the result of some sort of product rule on a product and let's double check is this the derivative of this and sure enough it is e to the T over 200 comes back the derivative of T over 200 is 1 over 200 we have our X so this is the result of some sort of product rule which we're going to write over on the right hand side so the derivative with respect to T of this product we're getting this piece this would on a product rule that the first does not get a derivative so this is a result of something not being so that one think if you pass this is the result of that product rule where we don't take a derivative of the first factor this is the result of the product or we don't take a derivative of the second factor so that's going to be our X on the right hand side we get zero now if that's is a derivative then an integral is going to undo that derivative let's do an integral with respect to T on both sides on the left hand side integrals are new derivatives no problem we get e to the T over 200 times X on the right hand side we don't get 0 remember that this is with respect to T sure but you're gonna have a see a constant now it's about time for us to use an initial value like I might give an initial value you sure are the very first sentence says a thousand liter tank that contains 100 kilograms of sugar so at the start that's what this X of T means this X of T means how much sugar is in there at a certain amount of time so for us well at time zero we have a hundred kilograms of sugar so remember what we're doing we're trying to find a formula that tells us how much sugars in that tank at any given time at time zero we had a hundred kilograms so if we plug in T equals zero X has to be 100 e to the zero is 1 1 times 100 to 100 C equals 100 and if we rewrite that we're going to give something that we can easily solve for X so I know that we kind of switch variables around and instead of Y we have X as our dependent variable but that's that's kind of the idea of working with that X is that that X should be this equation that says how much the amount is of whatever our solution is over a certain amount of time the way we're structuring this is let's think about how that solution is changing well that's solution in - solution out gives us a nice difference of equation we solve it we solve the difference equations which represents how the solution is changing and find out the amount of the solution at a given amount given time that's greater let's multiply both sides by e to the negative 2t over 200 and we would get X of T equals 100 e to the negative T over 200 Y negative does that make sense of the exponent is negative you have a vat of sugar and your poignant pure water you also draining out the solution it drain out sugar this right here should decrease our sugar amount should decrease exponentially it's exponential decay that's kind of cool do you see the interplay between how our sugars changing and the amount of sugar in the tank so how our sugars changing that's a difference of equation it says how long should the amount of sugar how that amount is changing is out in - out no problem when I solve the differential equation it's giving me that so that the solution for how much sugar is actually that for a given amount of time that's it now we can answer the question when winds a time when will there be 10 kilograms okay if X represents how much there is when will this equal 10 that's what we're asking so when will there be 10 kilograms solve for the time that gives us 10 kilograms if we divide both sides by 100 if we do an Ln on both sides and if we multiply both sides by negative 200 no what did I get about 460 seconds how I know its seconds is because that was what our team was defined for so this was five liters per second so that change is also in seconds yeah I hope that makes sense I hope it makes sense that we're really relating this how our solution is changing to a differential equation and then I'm doing that to find what our amount is after certain amount of time it's pretty cool that we can even do it we see an integrating factor just so we can do with any linear first order differential equation and then we can solve by understanding that yes we have an initial condition initial value and then when we're when we modify our function that we found we can typically either find how much is there after certain amount of time or how long it's going to take for us to get that amount and that's what we did in this case so we've got two more let's work on the mouth let's start a new problem so you have a swimming pool and through someone's air gyms you have this this pool that's eight thousand cubic feet of water but it has a twenty five percent chlorine solution to it concentration that's a lot of chlorine so the kids are getting out my eyes man Jim so you decide that you're going to just change it over time and you're gonna add 502 cubic feet of 5% solution why would you eat pure water maybe you live in a town that has like a lot of chlorine in your water and a gas about a percent so you add 500 cubic feet of 5% solution a day so just putting a hose in that hopefully you're gonna drain this water somewhere else not waste it but and you drain the same amount so you're gonna drain out exactly the amounts to put in question how much is your what is your volume I'm going to do is your volume gonna change or you're going I'm going to remain constant if you're adding and subtracting the same amount so for an import out the same L it's going to remain constant so when will there be a 10% concentration let's go ahead and figure this out so the first thing we want to do is identify what's the rate in what's the rate out what's the concentration in what's an expression for the concentration out the rate in says the word we have 500 cubic feet of 5% a day so what if we get this our time is going to be in days so right in 500 right now 500 no problem says out of the same exact same that now amount out so that's the same rate out concentration in says we have five percent let's make that point zero five we know percentages work like that for decimals concentration out we don't know it's working at a minute but the volume because we're adding in and subtracting out of the same amount our volume is always going to be 8,000 8,000 cubic feet now the concentration out what we've been learning is that the concentration out is a relationship between how much chlorines in there divided by the volume of our tank or in our case how much chlorines in there divided by 8,000 because that volume isn't gonna change in this scenario let's start putting that into our differential equation that we know we're gonna get so dxdt how our chlorines changing with respect to time notice this is how it's changing how Florian's changing the spec the time the rate of change of chlorine in the strength of time if we undo this derivative we get the amount of chlorine with respect to time that's the idea the position of the chlorine how much we have so the rate in says we're gonna have okay 500 times the concentration in that's 5% minus the rate out that's 500 times the concentration out that's how much is they are compared to how much we have how much chlorines there compared to how much of volume we're taking out that's always gonna be 8,000 well let's simplify some things looks like we get 25 this 25 yeah 25 minus 116 X that is a linear first order differential equation if we add 116 X to both sides we know something that we can work with I would encourage you to try on your own right now if you have it if you haven't tried it try it man stop the video figure out what your integrating factor if you have to figure out what row of X has to be integrate 116 take e to the integral of 1/16 and then multiply that everywhere we're gonna do it now but you might want to pause this and try there you go so for us wrote e so this is with respect to time is e to the integral of 1/16 DT that means that we're going to get e to the T over 16 really similar last problem the only difference here is that we had a concentration in that wasn't zero let's multiply that everywhere so we have e to the T over 16 DX DT we've got 1/16 e to the T over 16 which is really clear to see that this is the derivative of this that's great that's perfect for us times X we don't forget that equals 25 e to the T over 16 also in this case because we had a concentration in this isn't zero now what we do know about these differential equations that are linear is that this is the result of a product rule on some derivative with respect to T of this term times that term this factor times X that's and then leave the first alone derivative the second spaghettini cool driven first with respect to T got it leave the second loan not a problem on the right hand side we have exactly the same thing and this lets us take an integral with respect to T on the left hand side integrals undo derivatives that's awesome we get e to the T over 16 times x equals on the right hand side well let's see we'd have u equals T over 16 so once we're you have to multiply both sides by 6 over 2 multiplied by 16 so if you equals T over 16 D u equals DT over 16 that means 16 D u equals DT so let's let's put that in there 1625 let's see 4 times 45 is 100 times for the beam 400 plus C you can do a couple things right now if you really wanted to you can solve for that that X but I would solve for C right now so solving for C you're going to have to have an initial value now a lot of times it's not specifically given to you you got to find it in the mixture problem so let's go back to the beginning this is we've got a swimming pool and our pool has 8,000 cubic feet of water and it has a 25% solution of chlorine do you realize that at this point we have an equation that's giving us the amount of chlorines not the rate of change of the chlorine it's the amount of the chlorine at a certain time I don't want me to start at the start of this at time 0 the amount of chlorine says well you had 8,000 cubic feet times a 25% 0.25 times of 25% concentration what that means is that the amount at time 0 was how much total fluid you had but there's only 25 percent of its chlorine multiply that man to better make sense to you right now that at the start of this in your swimming pool there's actually 200 cubic feet of chlorine if that's 25 percent makeup of that pool so 8,000 cubic feet 25% of it was chlorine that means that you had 8,000 times 0.25 that's 2,000 cubic feet of chlorine is chlorine that's 2,000 cubic beautiful ring that's your initial value so if we plug in 0 for T we know that X is two thousand one times 2000 equals 400 times 1 plus C equals 1600 and if we admit this we get plus 1600 now let's multiply both sides which means all three terms by e to the negative 16 sorry e to the negative T over 16 this will be gone this will be gone this will gain an e to the negative T over 16 can we walk through this one time with you we start off with labeling everything that we possibly can we understand that we're creating a differential equation which gives us the rate of change of the chlorine with respect to time solving that differential equation says now we're no longer talking about the rate we're talking about the amount of chlorine with respect to time that's given by this stay standing from our initial value saying we had eight thousand cubic feet of water okay 25% of its chlorine that's two thousand cubic feet cubic feet of flooring that we started with so at least set that equal and then we solve we get a function that says this right here is going to tell you how much chlorine is there with respect to time now we answer the question how moms are gonna take he'll find the team how long is it gonna take find the team when until there would be a 10% now we are putting in taking out the same amount of fluid same amount of mixture here we want 10% of this to be chlorine at the end so we want the amount of chlorine to be 10% of the volume of the fluid okay how much fluids in there what's the volume does it has it ever changed no it's 8,000 so we want 10% of that to be the amount so if X of T represents the amount of chlorine that's actually in there we want 10% of 8,000 to be fluorine does that make sense to you I hope that that makes sense to you but you go right well or here I want 10% of my volume to be chlorine I want 800 cubic feet so the question comes down to and this is this is why this one was I'm doing this example is because when you get the concentrations and the percentages you're gonna have to multiply by the amounts there so to find your initial value 25 percent was chlorine okay multiply but when you buy you want 10 percent to be Florida okay multiply what's there 8,000 times 10 percent 0.10 that gives you you want 889 cubic feet so the question boils down to if this shows you how much chlorine is actually there for certain time we want to find out when this is going to equal 800 cubic feet so when is our chlorine ex going to be 800 and that's pretty easy to solve I would encourage you to do on your own I mean we'd have to subtract 400 we'd have to divide by 1600 so here we have 400 over 1600 that's 1/4 taking Ln so Ln of 1/4 equals negative T over 16 multiplied by negative 16 so T equals negative 16 Ln of 1/4 what's our T in minutes hours years days well because we're draining this in per day this is going to be about twenty two point two days is it making sense to you hope it is I hope that you're understanding the relationship between differential equation is the rate undo that you find the amount that's so cool and we're just using the techniques that we've already known or have we have one more problem we're going to go through a little bit more advanced because our volumes gonna be changing I have to show you how to do that and then we'll be done okay one more so we have another situation we got this tank of a brine solution now it's a 400 gallon tank but you have a hundred gallons full so it's not full of this brine with 50 pounds of salt in it so you probably had some water and you put in 50 pounds of salt and you're going to fill it up with this this other brine until it's full so the question is if you add that has 1 pound per gallon and you're filling this at 5 gallons a second and you're out flowing it at 3 gallons a second how much salt is in the tank when the tank is full we're gonna go ahead and do this problem but before we even start it I want to ask two questions number one I want to ask what's the what's the expression for the volume and the tank because this volume is changes not like the other two examples this is probably the biggest part of the problem here is the volume and then when is the tank full so let's do the volume first as far as our volume is concerned our volume starts at how much how much is the air when we start the problem well we have a third of gallons right now now look at what is happening we're adding at five gallons a second we're subtracting at three gallons a second if we're adding more than we're subtracting our volume is increasing so it's not subtracting it's adding how much is it adding per second well well we have a hundred 100 gallons in there right now but we're gonna add five gallons in - three gallons out for every T seconds you guys get that we're in time right now we're at I this for seconds so let's start the situation at zero seconds so when T is zero we had 100 gallons after every second that passes I've added five I've subtracted three that's a total of adding two so our volume is a relationship that says you have a hundred gallons plus two gallons per second that needs to make sense think through this work right now when you started have 100 gallons and as every second passes you've added five subtract three magnifies up a to three out of five you're adding two gallons or every second that's a big deal so when we get to filling out our concentration out we'll just have x over that now when is the tank full well if you are gaining two gallons for every second how much do we need to gain in order for us to have a full tank well we want to have 400 gallons at the end right now we have 100 so we need to fill up 300 how many gallons are we adding every second five in three out for a tea - so when's this going to be fulsome the time would equal 300 gallons / - thousands per second notice even how to use work we'd get 150 seconds these are two really important piece of information that we want to do first that when we get to them later we have the right stuff for us so we get this former gallon tank it's 100 gallons full great let's see we have filling up five gallons a second in three down the second out that's two gallons a second 300 gallons to make up we have two gallons a second that's 150 seconds volume the volume is this relationship between we had 100 and we're adding 2 gallons a second this is the same idea used in two different ways so the next thing we're gonna do maybe we put our initial value right now to that how much salt was there at the very beginning of it so this hundred gallon tank has 50 pounds of salt so be before those last two examples we did our initial value second now that we know we have to have it we have our volume expression we know when our tank is going to be full we want to figure that out first how much is the salts in there when it's full and then we need an initial value so at time of zero right when the stock starts how much salt and remember X is how much of the actual item is in there how much salt is in there the dx/dt is how is that amount changing when we gonna do that with derivatives we get how much salts in there this is gonna help us solve for an arbitrary constant here we go c0 is 850 pounds of salt I'm gonna pause for just a second to make sure that you get this so we had this situation where not only is our concentration out changing our volume is also changing so this is a little different than the previous two examples or saying here that we want to fill this tank up and we want to determine how much salt is in there when we fill it when we fill it up it's going to be in 150 seconds so we get all done we're going to be plugging in 150 40 instead of solving for T we're doing something different we're trying to figure out what how much salts in there after that amount of time now we also know where we start we need an initial value to solve for an arbitrary constant worried to get when we go through a process of solving or differential equation lastly our volume well our volume is now relationship it's now related to our time so let's fill out what we can the rate in well we know that's five the concentration in one pound per gallon is an appropriate concentration you can use that one one pound per gallon right out that would be three gallons per second notice how we're in second so what we get out of this is going to be seconds this is all seconds concentration out the concentration out relates how much salt is there with respect to time divided by your volume which is always changing notice how this concentration in this concentration are in the same same relationship this is one pound per gallon this is X pounds per gallon of volume so that's okay to have that as long as they have the same relationship there now we can start plugging in this this is better makes sense that you're in at five gallons you're out at three gallons you have a concentration of one pound per gallon in concentration of X pounds per gallon X pounds per gallon out let's plug this into the difference in the equation you might want to try this on your own three times x over 100 plus 2t that looks pretty good to me that's a differential equation o my dependent variable X is over here I'm gonna group my DX over DT with my X term I'm gonna make it look like that linear different for shorter differential equations we want with X off to the back so this is my P this is the thing I'm getting creating now I'm going to find my integrating factor so that I can treat this like the linear first order differential equation it is so what we're going to multiply by is e to the integral of nasty crap it's not all that bad we can pull the three out we can pull the three out we have them do it quickly you should do in your own we have natural log of 100 plus two T divided by the derivative of mu because you have a u sub here so u equals 100 plus 2t derivative of B 2 DT divided by 2 you're going to get 1 over you you'll get Ln of you put it back but then you'd be dividing by 2 so all this works out to was you should try your own would be 3 halves Ln 100 plus 2t I'm dropping the absolute value because time is positive we're not going back in time we're going forward in time so we don't need that there so the 3 comes out you divide by 2 because that's a u sub there and you have Ln of 1 or plus 2t so let's simplify this a bit because we can if we move this as an exponent we get what we're going to multiply by to create this result of a product rule is that let's go ahead let's multiply that everywhere so from right here we're going to multiply one two three terms by this integrating factor so that's going to allow us to create this part rule let's see if I did it right got this we multiplied here looks good kept this multiplying here kept my tax got my five multiply here everything's multiplied by the same thing I'll take a derivative imagine doing this I bring down the three paths I leave this alone I would subtract one from it and we're gonna bop about to do that when we simplify and I multiplied by the inside which is two so that's where our two's going away there so if I simplify this here's one here's one and a half now we can really see it if I take a derivative this piece we've got three cows leave it inside alone to the one half there it is and then times the derivative inside by the chain rule that gives us two which would get rid of the three paths part of it we get to that we just gave three now that's the result of the product rule let's write the product product is you left this piece alone I mean that derivative was taken you let this piece alone when this derivative is taken equals and now it's just a matter of integrating both sides with respect to D integrals I do derivatives we have this 100 plus 10t 10 to three-halves x equals on the right hand side we go through the kind of the same exact idea we can pull the 5 out we have another you so we add one to our exponent so 5 keep our inside add one to the exponent divided by the exponent but also divided by the derivative in sites or you would be this 100 plus 2t notice how when you take the derivative you get D u equals 2 DT you have to divide by 2 so you have an extra 2 here because of that you said well this is making sense you kept the 5 this would be u raised to the 5 halves divided by 5 maps but then also divided by that 2 plus C try it for yourself make sure you're doing this so we will get 100 plus 2 T to the three halves x equals well gone gone gone gone 100 plus 2 T to the 5 halves let's see it might actually be now I saw first I'd still saw proceeded without elma and I'm solving for C so we need initial value oh man hey good thing we did that first so when we have zero time passed we have 250 pounds of salt we can use that now this is the amount of salt after time that's what solving the differential equation did us instead of rate of how the salt is changing we have amount of salt pretty cool so when we plug in zero for T we get 50 for X so 0 to the three-halves times 50 equals zero to 5 X plus C this gets a little crazy but 100 plus zero is a 100 square root of 100 is 10 10 to the third is a thousand so this is 50 thousand four thousand times 50 is 50 thousand four equals right hand side 100 square root of hundreds 10 to the fifth would be zeros of 100,000 so C equals negative 50,000 so when you change it's meant to race this we get then 100 plus 2t to the three halves power times x equals 100 plus 2t to the five halves power minus 50,000 we are almost over so close all we've got to do now is solve for X so when we solve for X let's multiply every single term by 100 plus two T to the negative three halves power negative three halves power is going to kill this off its going to subtract three halves and you're gonna get a negative three halves over here so we have X the amount of salt after time is going to equal this is completely gone this remember your x this to the native three halves it's going to subtract exponents 5 X minus 3 house is to s as 1 minus 50,000 times 100 plus 2t to the negative three halves I hope you see what's going on we multiplied by B multiplied actually by this thing here create one here created this to the first 5sos three house here you had to multiply it so it's got to be there man that's nasty but that's that's our result as far as our particular solution here so we started off with a rate of change we created a differential equation we solve it we got an amount we got a function for the amount of salt after a certain amount of time so what do we do now well we want to know how much salt is in there when the tank is full this is a different type of question in the last two last two was how long would it take to get this amount of salt now it's how much salt is there after the tank is full the tank is full in 150 seconds we want to talk about that that's why we did that so if the tank is full in 150 seconds we want to know how much salt is there after 150 seconds because at 150 seconds that tank is going to be right to the brim anything past that it's going to be overflowing you think before that Sun may be full so full would be at 400 gallons two seconds gallon to go from 100 to 400 to be 150 seconds so we want to know how much salt is in there how much salt is in there when it's full after a hundred fifty seconds have passed so we need X of 150 seconds oh yeah it looks to me like we get about see if you can do this on your own 393 point 75 pounds of silver we started in town so dancers gonna be in pounds we started in second so we had to use seconds not minutes not hours lot I really hope it makes sense so weird the last that's a less example for applications here but my goal for this video was for you to see the interplay between using a rate of change like for a mixture problem how our amount is changing with respect to time and using differential equation to find the amount from that because a lot of these questions ask amounts but you can't get it directly you've got to start with a rate and then do integrals from for it run it sorry with it for our differential equations and that's pretty cool I hope it's explained well enough how to how the rate of in and the concentration of n are constant how the rate of out has to be constant but how the concentration of out relates to the amount we have in there to give them at a time compared to the volume that we have for a given number time I hope it explained how to find the initial values how that's rarely given to you you have to start with what's you have to read through the problem and find out what's actually starting and then for our questions we're almost always saying how long so that's a time will it take to get this amount of salt so once you figure out your about function you set the amount and then solve for t with usually some L ends typically you'll have you but usually it's that so solving how long that's a T will we have this amount of salt or in this case what's the amount of salt when this happens after 10 minutes after a hundred seconds after the tank is full what's it taking it before tanks full after another 30 seconds this right here is kind of a hard key of the whole problem because if you don't know that this is necessary you're never going to be able to plug in a team so reading through the problem very carefully helps us identify these these four key I hope that makes sense next time you deal with a couple extra that extra a couple different techniques which is super exciting we'll talk about homogeneous equations we'll talk about exact equations Bernoulli the equations will talk about substitution techniques all sorts of fun stuff so hope you enjoy this one I'll see you for another video you 

Transcript for: Substitutions for Homogeneous First Order Differential Equations (Differential Equations 20)
welcome back so we're in the process of learning some different techniques and what we learned really is that with some differential equations basic ones we can just integrate and then we had a couple other classes like separable equations and then some linear first-order differential equations and now what we're gonna do is look at some that don't particularly fit those models so we have a whole bunch of ideas that we wrap up into this concept of substitution techniques so here's our plan for this when we get some things like we don't particularly recognize as just a basic integral or separable or linear maybe we can substitute to make it into those things and then there's a couple other ones where we do a substitution and they're their own thing so what we're gonna be talking about are these substitution techniques and the first one we're gonna discuss is homogeneous equations how to make that substitution to change a homogeneous equation into some technique we've already learned for instance just a basic integral or separable equations or linear equation so that's the idea now these substitution techniques usually fall into one of five categories and then we have something that's it called exact equations we'll discuss later so here's our five classes of when we might consider doing a substitution number one what we're going to talk about today is homogeneous equations how to make that substitution now let's discuss exactly what we do with that next we could have an obvious substitution now that word is deceiving because every time I read obvious in a math textbook it wasn't obvious to me the group is obvious not necessarily so obvious I'm gonna use that term loosely the idea is that we have a composition and if you can see the composition to make a substitution for it then we can oftentimes do this substitution to create something we already know like linear or separable equations so homogeneous first that's today then we'll talk about obvious substitutions we'll talk about Bernoulli equations we'll talk about embedded derivatives so when part of your function differential equation has a derivative of the Y piece in there we can oftentimes do a substitution that's really nice save us a ton of time in fact in the first example I do today it's gonna be done both ways so I'll do it today with homogeneous and then in another video I'll show you how it actually has an embedded derivative and would have saved us about 10 minutes working so I'll show you that so next a lot less we have reducible second-order differential equations you might have been wondering do we ever deal with second-order very special cases yeah we do we can and so we'll talk about that so the little recap but only a couple minutes in but we're going to start making some equations that we can't directly attack into something that we hopefully know how to deal with and that maybe involves a substitution so for us it does involve the substitution we're going to get to those so we have homogeneous we have maybe a composition where it would be an obvious substitution we might have a bernoulli substitution that we can make we could have an embedded derivative or we could have a reducible second order and the last class that's not up here is exact equation so we'll look at an exact differential equation a little bit later the one thing I mentioned about this one I'm going to give you an example in just a bit that can be done two different ways and so when I tell you about these substitutions I don't want you to think that every differential equation is gonna fall into one and only one of these classes because that is not true as we go through these videos I'm gonna make certain because I'm gonna do several problems two to three different ways to show you that well while we might be able to make it homogeneous maybe Bernoulli would be easier or while we might be able to make it a Bernoulli may be an embedded derivative would be easier or they fall into several classes so take the one that would be the easiest how you do that how you determine which wouldn't be the easiest that takes a lot of experience and so when we're going through these you're gonna notice that some techniques are easier for certain problems and some techniques are not easier for certain problems so that's what I'm going to be doing several ways and you can take your pick so my my thought process right now is to kind of get us out of this mode of Wow there's gonna be one technique that works for this one type of problem that's not true a lot of these techniques cross over so let's explore right now homogeneous equations I'll show you exactly how they work and we'll go through a few examples and then in the next video what we're going to do is we're going to just do a ton of examples to explore a lot of different possibilities of these homogeneous equations so what are we looking at what does a homogeneous equation mean well it means this if we can write our differential equation as this function where we have these fractions y over X so every instance where we have a line X we can make it into y divided by X Y to my bags way that can appear a lot of different places so if you can solve for your first derivative if you can solve for that dy/dx and if you can make this function into y by X and then Y over X everywhere well then we can make a substitution so the substitution says what if we were suppose that instead of having Y over X everywhere we called Y over X this du1 why why would that why would that be so important well it's because if we solve this for y then we can make a double substitution I'm going to show you that right now so step one I'm gonna give you the steps as we go through this step one a homogeneous equation is when we can write our differential equation as dy/dx equals a function where we have Y over X in every instance of our Y ok we'll make our substitution let's let V equals y over X why do we do that magic because I told you so not a good answer if we solve this for Y which would give us y equals B times I attention and show that over here well y equals B times X then never something we'd already have all of our wise wrapped up into this substitution so every instance of Y has to have a Y over X well what that means is we can wrap up Y over X as this V so every time we have a y we'd have V and Y R X V and then V and then V but that's a problem because we still have a dy/dx but then this would not have any wise in it so we wouldn't be able we have basically three variables we'd have Y then we have V which is a function of Y X and then we'd have X and that would be really difficult to deal with but if we solve V equals y or X for y well then maybe we can take a derivative right here and it would be an implicit derivative on V so notice some of them when you take that derivative of V you're going to involve a chain rule you're going to get that whole derivative of V times DV DX because that's going to be a function of Y X but the independent variable is X that was a lot of words so I'm going to show you right now so long story made hopefully a little bit short hey dy/dx equals function where you get Liza wretches make sure that your V covers every instance of Y it's got dy breaks okay that replaced otherwise but that still has a Y so let's solve for y let's take a derivative on both sides with respect to X well on the left hand side we would get derivative of Y with respect to X yeah that's an implicit derivative on why Y is a function of X so we're assuming and so we can do dy/dx but on the right hand side when you take a derivative of a function that involves X's right there and X itself that's a product rule so we can do the derivative of the first but wait a minute is just 1 this wouldn't have to calc 1 when we did implicit differentiation you said well V is really a function of X yes it has y's and x's but y itself as a function of X so you okay let's take a derivative of V how would you do that you would take the derivative of V which would be 1 but then you'd have a chain rule times the derivative of whatever that function of X is DV DX so we do the derivative of the first one times DV DX times the second plus the first that would be B times the derivative the second since X is our independent variable we don't need a chain rule on that if you get a chain rule on X you'd say derivative of x1 times DX DX that's the same thing that's 1 so the derivative of X would just be 1 so this would be x 1 let me show you this in a little bit more detail if you took a derivative with respect to X of Y and V times X the derivative of Y implicit dy/dx that's where this is coming from the derivative of V times X with respect to X that's product rule because that is a function of X that is a function of X so derivative of the first one but chain rule implicit DV DX that's this one times DV DX so approachable through the first times the second there's our second so derivative of B with respect to x times our second X plus plus the first that's our V times the derivative the second with respect to X that's one that's where this comes from let me clean the stuff we don't really need that one so we write this as a function ok cool why Rex no problem make a substitution the equals 4x easy solve for y not a problem why why are we doing that why are we solving for y if we just replace the Y's over X's with V we'd have a problem with that y so if we solve for y and take a derivative now we get this idea of a kind of a double substitution so think about what's gonna happen I know right now it's it's not vague but it's not concrete because we don't have an example to work with I'm gonna show you that just a minute but if you have this all wrapped up and Y's over X's every instance of life is written as Y over X you can replace all the Y's over here with me but then dy/dx only if I take a derivative I can replace the dy/dx with this whole mess of garbage all right not garbage but the derivative of Y with respect to X all that'll work so we kind of have this double substitution idea we're gonna replace the right side have a whole bunch of these and X's we're gonna replace the left side and have exactly this now I need you to understand something this is going to happen every single time with homogeneous equations it has to because if you solve for dy/dx and if you're making the same substitution every time which you are with how many G's equations then this derivative is going to be the same every time then this dy/dx is gonna be the same every time then you can replace this with this every time that's how homogeneous equations are gonna work after that we'll hopefully be able to categorize this whatever we get into a basic integration or a separable equation and then we'll go ahead and solve it with those techniques so number one rioted number two of your substitution number three sulfur why why why do we do that because we have to get rid of that dy/dx which means that we're gonna have this we're gonna have this dy/dx equals whatever we have here every time and we'll make that substitution after that well we're going to be substituting into this this differential equation that we just talked about that all this is going to be V sin X's all this is going to be this piece that's what we mean by substitute into the differential equation I'm gonna make a little side note here that this should be what it whenever you substitute you should have no Y's so this should be in X's and B's only if you have any wise you've done it wrong and that should be kind of obvious because we can only have our two variables here we can't really have the y's and x's and the B's then use a known technique what I mean might have something that we're familiar with so use an integration if you can okay use separable equations if you can then since you have only X's and V's but you're really looking for Y's that's what this is relating to say I want the derivative of Y with respect to X I sort of trick the problem and call wrapped it up in a V no problem but eventually we're gonna have to unsubstituted to so we'll reset zoom back to get our why that's important so we're gonna be using this two times so so to get away from why we put this as Y over X and then make a V and to get back we do V it equals y R X and then we'll be able to get our wise back lastly just some notes when you're doing this when you're trying to write this as a homogeneous equation you need to make sure that you replace all of the Y's that's a really big deal including the dy/dx which is why this substitution works after that just just know that when you're doing these substitution techniques it's going to involve some trial and error especially because some of them fit several categories here so is it going to be frustrating yeah it is a little bit don't let that anger you though remember that psychologically what's happening is when when you transition from frustration frustration is okay frustration is your brains attempt to cope with this new information that that's typically what happens you run into it you get a little frustrated you slow down a little but your brain tries to organize your thoughts and put it into little categories Piaget calls them schema or stomata where you're you're trying to structure your knowledge and then that's a-that's can be frustrating because when something doesn't fit you go oh man I thought I knew that or now I'm having to reorganize this but when you start getting angry at it that puts up what's called an effective filter it's kind of like when you're you're talking with someone you go start you start yelling like well I'm right no you I'm right and then well this is why I'm right well no one's listening anymore you're just yelling and your brains not really processing it you're just you should out and that's what happens when you get angry so I mean that is some of these can be in SystemVue rating problems when you start getting that frustration is okay alright but when you're working on it and you're sure to get angry at your math just stop take a break calm down and come a little bit later otherwise you're just gonna waste your time to spin your wheels so a little recap before we do our examples we're now transitioning to try to make some difference equations that we don't know how to do into things that we do know how to do ways to do that are involved but we involved we say those are substitution techniques for right now one way we can deal with that is homogeneous equations we have a couple other ones that we're gonna go through as we move on what homogeneous equations are structured as is when we can write Y of X for every instance of Y if we can replace Y or X with the B and solve for y that gives us not only a way to replace the Y's but a way to replace dydx by that product rule combined with the chain rule on that influence of differentiation then when we do our substitution we'll have X's in these only use the technique to solve that and then make sure because what you're going to get here that you simply P is the force X's and B's only solve back for y so make sure that V wherever you have it is y Brax and then hopefully we solve for Y's so I'm gonna pause for just a moment I'm gonna write some of it just one example up there we're gonna go through three of them so we'll do one at a time and then in the next video we'll practice a whole bunch of them let's go ahead and start our first one so as we're going through these I'm gonna mention from time to time that this particular example can be done at least two different ways probably not like that but this particular example can be done at least two different ways so let's look at this from the scope of everything we know hopefully wrap everything together is it any different equation well obviously it's got a first derivative in there can you separate the variables well actually let's start easier can you solve this for dy/dx and take a basic integral no because as soon as I divide this I don't have a basic intervals got X's and Y's okay can I separate the variables it doesn't look easy to do that so probably not is it linear no and if I try to write that as Y to the first power times something over Y there so it doesn't fall into any of those classes right away can I do a substitution technique to make it fit one of those classes yes now I'm gonna talk right now that about how this can be done two different ways and in several videos from now I'm going to show you that so remember this problem I'll hopefully refer to it when I do a tat second way but check it out this can also be solved with what's called what I call an embedded derivative for instance if you can find the function of Y whose derivative is also in the problem somewhere in the differential equation you can make a substitution for that embedded derivative just remember it's got include all the functions it's getting a little wise here's what I'm talking about look here take a derivative of just Y squared alright to Y the derivative of Y squared is 2y that also appears somewhere in your and it's a we're getting a little more specific but that appears somewhere else in your differential equation when we have that when the derivative of the function of Y also appears in your difference or the equation usually the other side we can solve it with a even easier technique I'm gonna get there in a little while but I just want you to know that this can't be solved that way I will certainly come back and do that so remember this example because right now we're gonna structure this as homogeneous and I want to show it to you because of the two different ways I'll also want to show to you because it's a great example on what we can do with homogeneous equations so number one let's try to make this in the proper form let's solve it for dy/dx no problem we can do that let's just divide by two XY and it doesn't look all that great maybe what we do is we split this up into two different fractions well could because remember what we're trying to do we're trying to get Y over x and y over X this one's gonna be a little funky but maybe we can change a little bit we can always split up fractions when we have more than one term over one term and if we simplify then this well we get an x over y notice how this and Matt are completely gone 2 + 2 + y with one of the Y's so we can simplify both fractions and what I'm going to do I'm going to structure this to try to get as close to possible as everything is like multiplied by something that's a fraction x over y or whatever actually we'll wait a minute extra Y doesn't help us it does help us but we're just gonna have to change it a bit so when I look at this I'm gonna write this as in 1/2 and then I'm gonna write this as a fraction x over Y Emily think about this piece as something I'm going to substitute + I'm also going right this is a fraction of Y of X why do I put them in parentheses well I'm doing that because I want to show that that's my substitution in my head I'm trying to organize this as something where I've wrapped all of the Y's into YX all the Y's into y over X now okay so we said that doesn't that look good let's try to make this homogeneous okay so for dy/dx all right well I know that involves fractions let's make fractions that simplify what we have and then we've got to force this to be Y Rex because right now that doesn't look good you go what do I do with that well did you even write exponent rules how wide Rex is great x over Y is the reciprocal of what I want well we can always reciprocate a fraction by changing changing the sign of our exponent so that's x over lined with first power then we can write this as Y over X to the negative first power so let's see have we solved this for dy/dx great have we structured it so that every instance of y is also y over X so have we structured so that we have all of our wires wrapped up into a fraction Y Rex yes this is what we're looking for when we do a substitution into a homogeneous equation this is what we want so let's do that this looks really good here's Y for X is y over X the negative 1 a little bit funky but not as huge issue let's go ahead and let's do our substitution so our substitution for these homogeneous equations is always the same what we're gonna do is we're gonna substitute V equals y over X we're gonna use that twice once to get away from the Y's do all of our integration and then wants to get back to our wise now how does it work well if you watch the first part of the video you know that we need to replace everything now this is what we had to have this wire X Y where X is going to simplify it was sorry to substitute for V whatever X is going to substitute for V so every place you had wise you've got to have it by rekhs to use the same substitution every case V and V no problem all you had all you can possibly have is B's and x's here on the left hand side we also need to get rid of this Y right there well that means that if we solve this for Y like we explained in a few minutes going so we're going to use this twice and for little aspects here if we solve that for y and if we do a derivative of both sides with respect to X we're gonna get the same thing every time I mentioned that but maybe now you can see a little bit more clearly the reason why we're going to get the same exact thing every single time it's because we're gonna make the same substitution every single time we're always for homogeneous substitutions here we're always gonna write Y or X we're always going to make V equal the Y over X in every place we see why it's got a place otherwise we're always going to solve for the same light it's always going to be V times X that means the derivative always gonna be the same derivative of the first times a second plus the first times the derivative the second every time and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna do a double substitution if you're reading through a text book this looks like where did all this come from so here's what's gonna happen either we write this I'm going to show you where every piece goes every part in your parentheses Y where X needs to become a be your dy/dx needs and comes into this derivative so when this changes you okay we're gonna substitute a lot of stuff right now this whole piece remember that this and this those are the same thing when we do that substitution we're identifying that if these are changing two V's and that Y is is y and that's wrapped up in your V well I've been this dy/dx that you get from that substitution is the same dy/dx if you have a differential equation so if these are the same this whole piece is going to go there a problem but if we define our substitution as V equals y rags then we're gonna replace three pieces in this particular differential equation we're gonna replace every instance of Y over X with V we're gonna replace D by DX with the same thing every single time for a difference to click through a homogeneous equation here so on the left hand side we get X DV DX plus V that should be pretty obvious because that's exactly what dy/dx equals on the other side we get one half no problem the V to the negative one plus B to the first usually what I've seen and a lot of the what I do these lessons I usually look at least two three textbooks look at what they're doing make sure that I can explain it for you guys but what normally happens is let's say Oh substitute this is what you get you know where'd that come from that's just a product rule and with an implicit differentiation and then you're substituting on both sides the key idea here was we wrapped up X's and Y's sorry we wrapped up our wise as Y for X we found a derivative dy/dx and we were able to substitute so we said all right this is this piece this is this and then look at our look at our problem do we have only X's and B's yes so we've completely substituted out our Y now we're going to substitute that back later but here's the point if you can do this in structure this is why the premises then you always have the same derivative when you solve for y then you can always substitute for dy/dx and for that Y over X and then we're gonna try to make this into a technique that we already know how to do I hope this is making sense so far because this is pretty powerful technique it's kind of cool I think we're able to do that there's just some key points that you need to know all of your Y's have to be involved in these so you cannot have any wise floating around doesn't work also you only need X's and beefs here because you're gonna be treating this this DV DX as your new derivative we're gonna be trying to undo that so V X is still your independent variable that hasn't changed V takes like your new Y so you're trying to solve for V that should work because if we can solve for V then we have a direct way to get back from B into y no problem let's do it let's see if this can make or we can make something out of this if we already know how to do one thing you might want to do just start simplifying so this happens quite a bit too this is fun what if you subtract V well then this is all gone then we get X DV DX equals I'll probably write this as one over to the petition because that looks a little bit nicer instead of e to the negative one power you wait a minute hey that's mean that's DX there's an X there's a one over T V if I divided by X man I'd have a separable equation so can you group your V DV on one side you're xdx another side yeah that's acceptable equation let's do that so let's multiply both sides by two thee I'm sorry just to be let's keep our constants on the x side like we talked about so we'll multiply both sides by V we'll leave the one half we'll divide by X and then multiply by DX that sounds like a lot but it's it's not all that bad so if we if we multiply by V we get V DV if we keep the one half you get the 1 over 2 if we divide by X we have 1 over 2x if we multiply by the DX remove the DX we get and hopefully this on your own we're just structuring our variables in a place that they need to be for separable equations your dependent variable D the dependent variable so V DV in this case and then on the right hand side your independent variable width D X so X DX and now man we should be really familiar this we've done a ton of examples on this just take an integral on the left hand side when we do that we're gonna get um V squared over 2 on the right hand side oh wow on the right hand side we'll get 1/2 Ln absolute value of X plus C of course I mean that we talked about see quite a bit how we can deal with that another thing that we can do start solving for V I really wouldn't I won't plug in Y over X right now to be until I got it as simplified as I can with Abby's so I'm gonna multiply everything by 2 because I don't want to deal with a square root of x over there I want to deal more with just well bye-bye - and then we don't have to deal with square-root at all so they multiply both sides by two we get a V squared we get Ln absolute value of x plus two C one June we're talking about the constants held when we have constant well a factor that's a constant times C one we can wrap that up into a larger quote-unquote larger arbitrary constant we can do that a lot and we can do that here so B Square equals Ln X let's see now the last thing that we do we use this substitution to let's go through the whole thing we use this substitution get rid of y's no problem we also got rid of dy that's perfect we made this into an acceptable equation then we can separate our variables we can do a very basic integral on both sides we can get our arbitrary constant taken care of but we need to get back to our wives and that's where this substitution comes in really handy write it down and we use it two times one to get away from lies one to get back to lies so B equals y over X and B still equals 1x okay well let's square both Y and X we know that exponents distribute across one level operation 11 below so exponents distribute across multiplication and division if we multiply it by both sides I'm multiplying both sides by x squared we did and sure you can distribute that get x squared ln x plus c x squared we really wouldn't take the square root and do a plus and minus unless you have some specific restrictions on your domain sometimes by the way they do that they'll say stuff like hey assume that X is positive assume with X is greater than zero and then you would drop the absolute value so that can happen the domain is a big part of differential sometimes even a different domain you get a different solution and we sort of talked about that when we started the introduction to this and how that can happen especially with particular solutions so anyhow we're done that's about it and that's kind of cool notice how we got back to why we don't have any of these that's how homogeneous equations work I'm gonna give you a couple more examples now and then we're gonna practice just the heck out of this in the next video let's give this a try so we have another differential equation we're looking at it we're saying that that does not look like anything I'm familiar with it doesn't look linear it doesn't look separable it doesn't look like a basic integral so let's go through and see if we can substitute a good int that you have something that is that's homogeneous is when you have Y or functions of Y with no negative exponents over here and you have an x over here and when you divide it you'll be able to create these fractions y over X that's a really good hint that that might be a good way to go does it always work that way no that's why I said you might have some trial and error and that's okay so so when we're going through these expect that you might make the wrong substitution and have to go back and fix it frustrating yes but it's part of learning so when I'm looking at this I'm thinking that does not look like anything that would be a basic technique that we have maybe we can make a substitution to force it to be one of those techniques if I start dividing by X I'm gonna get a Y over X okay hey that looks like homogeneous I'm gonna get a Y over an X here maybe we can make that work let's give it a try so dividing everything by X whatever X looks pretty good at them square root of X of X Y over X looks here that don't look good another crap it does but maybe we can force this thing to become a wire X think about what X could be represented as instead of X couldn't we just do x squared could we just do that if X is positive and so you might see a domain restriction here like a bassoon that X is positive so you can make this substitution otherwise you have the this right here the actual the actual solution here with the absolute value of X so that's an even power and even root and an even power we absolute value of X and that's only equal if X is greater than than 0 so you might see a domain restriction on some of these problems some textbooks just flat-out omit them that would be an issue but some of them don't so you'd say okay well for this to work this would be X if X is positive negative X if X is not positive so we'd have to look at the domain there for us let's say that X is positive and we're going to make that substitution I just want to do a little sign up there that sometimes you'll see this without any explanation right or wrong that that's not technically right but that's what they're doing aren't they're so weird okay yeah let's uh let's just call this the square root of x squared fantastic because if we can do that is if X is equal to the square root of x squared because that's just positive there oh well then we can write this as 1 be square root and we would get X Y over x squared oh maybe that looks a lot better because now when we simplify a fraction we get exactly what we're looking for we get every instance of wide is wrapped up as a fraction Y or X we get if we do a substitution to eliminate this to say V equals whatever X and V is still a function of X fundamentally well then when we take a derivative we can also wrap up that dy/dx double substitution idea that we use for open Jesus so let's show that substitution I've shown every time the reason why I show it every time is because I don't want to lose track of what I'm doing so I always write whatever substitution I'm doing I always do the derivative for why do you have to do that no probably not and once you do this about a thousand times maybe takes five times you start seeing the pattern you go yeah I know that this is gonna be x times DV DX plus V I know that I know this is gonna be a V and that's gonna be a V if you can do that awesome I show it because I wanna make mistakes I'm showing how to explain it to you so you can see what's going on every step of the case that step of the way also if you're taking notes right now I would strongly encourage you to do that because you all know that like four weeks from now if you see this one time and you're not practicing it or you have practice it but then you move on to something else your notes aren't gonna make a lot of lot of sense so show it now that way later on you can refer back no oh that's what I'm doing so in our case dy/dx it happens the same every time creates for us this other piece of the substitution so from right here I'm not gonna write it twice I'm just going to substitute from right here dy DX dy DX is this piece Y over X Y R X is V plus sign plus sign to two square root square root Y over X is be hey lieutenant we've wrapped up every instance of why in some form of vnx bestirring now we can simplify and see what comes out of this so let's subtract V we always want to make sure we're simplifying before we try to structure this is one technique that we already know on the right hand side these gone we just get to square root V and again we see that this is all multiplied and divided so or and or divide if you divide by X so what we have here is this separable equation again let's get our X's on one side let's get our width DX let's get our visa on the other side of the DB so I'll be dividing by the square root of V I'm leaving the two I'm dividing by X and I'm moving my DX divided this over group RVE Stevie's leave our constants where they're at constant factors were that divided by X move your DX and now we can take this integral so let me take our integral you might want to write this a little bit differently so instead of 1 over the square root of B it looks a little awkward let's write this as V to the negative 1/2 power when we do our integral and these are some basic ideas this is great at this point let's add 1 divide by the new exponent we don't you might be SMS to demean you know plus C over here we already covered that when we talked about separable equations you don't because if you had a plus C here and a plus C here you just add or maybe different C's potentially you'd add or subtract them and then group it in a larger different arbitrary constant anyway so envy to the 1/2 over 1/2 equals to Ln absolute value X let's see one because they guarantee we're going to be changing that based on having to multiply here so let's try that well if we if we move that so V divided by 1/2 that's the same thing as 2 square root V so something divided by 1/2 is 2 times whether that is if we divide everything by 2 we're gonna wrap that piece up as the plus D so let's do two things we know that we've solved pretty much as much as we can for for V let's go ahead and replace V with Y over X now you could square both sides right now if you wanted to that's not the way we'll do that so let's square both sides I'm wrapping up the C sub 1 over 2 as C I'm squaring both sides so square root of B squared and then absolute value of x plus C squared and now we say well that's not good enough because we started at wise V as wise in it V is a function of Y and X so let's replace it if V equals y over X then Y over x equals whatever B is transitive property if we multiply both sides by X we're good to go the reason why people like like homogeneous equations so much is because they're very predictable if you can solve it for dy/dx and have Y over X the substitution works out the same every way and that's very nice because you go yeah this is gonna be here every time this is gonna be a function of X and B every time are they always this easy no no they're not but they're at least predictable you know what's gonna happen with them and you know what what your substitution is gonna look like every time that's why people generally generally like them so let's try one more for this video and then I'll give you some some more advanced concepts and the next one so what you should be getting out of this is that the structure works the same way every time what's necessary is that you rev up your wise as Y over X is all of them and then substitute Y rice equals B that lets you make a substitution for dy/dx by taking the derivative of that so solve for y taking a derivative and then we get this hopefully separable or basic integration for the technique of solving it let's do one more ok great problem and on lots of stuff going on here you know what I like to do I like to give you problems involve lots of things because I know that some of you have forgot some of these concepts of integration like tan inverse which we're going to get here in most universe yeah it sure does and some separation of some quote some fractions and some basic integration so highlights give you these things because I think they're challenging and you're gonna see them and sometimes teachers let's just love to trick you and go home you didn't see the one thing why they do that I don't know but it does come up and so I'm gonna show you this example that has some more advanced techniques it's kind of a segue to the next video so number one let's look at that for what it is it's a differential equation it doesn't look like anything that we could easily do so what I mean by that it doesn't look like if I solve it for dy/dx I can just take integral it doesn't look like it's separable right now or at least not easily it doesn't look like it's linear at least not easily it's got some fractions going on so can we do a substitution technique well we're gonna try which one there might be a couple but the easy one without the one you see would be the easiest one that you can do at that time can you try a few of them maybe but let's go ahead let's try homogeneous why well it's very predictable we know what's gonna happen and so let's go ahead and try to make this of that form so let's solve for dy/dx oh yeah that looks worse than what we had before make it eat but remember our goal our goal is to get all of our wise over what over exits so if we want to get all of our wise over exes maybe we just divide by X everywhere you can think about this as if I multiply by one over x over 1 over X same thing as long as X is not 0 so we'd have to say that X is not equal to 0 but as long as we do that well that means that if you were to distribute you can get x over X plus y over X plus X over X minus y breaks you might remember back to calc 1 we did that a lot of limits a lot of the times and limits and so what we're doing here is kind of the same idea but we are always looking for Y over X in homogeneous equations let's just force that to happen let's divide everything by X you're going to see this technique quite a bit a lot of problems involve well not a lot sometimes problems involve this and you get this this idea that if you divide everything by X not only will you simplify some parts of this you'll also force what you want you want the Y's to be over X in every case of Y let's just do that and see what happens this happens a lot when you have fractions okay so simplifying well our dy/dx would equal 1 plus 1 over X oh my gosh the library likes X looks perfect and then 1 minus y Rex I always put my letter X in parentheses with homogenius I always think that that's going to be that's going to be the I've wrapped up all my instances of lies in something over X and now I can make my substitution I always write my substitution I always know that I'm going to use it twice the problem I always solve for why do I need to do that for me to do this problem not really gonna produce just from here in my head why so that I remember it so that my notes make sense so that I can go back now oh yeah that's what I'm on the left hand side dy/dx on the right hand side product rule with a chain rule and B as implicit derivative and now we make our substitution dy/dx this piece is going to become this piece so on the left hand side this becomes X DV DX plus B this is dy DX that's this piece on the right hand side I have my 1 still I have my plus still I have my one of my - but the things in parenthesis I've structured them so that we know that Y of X is V now okay I've got rid all my wise even my dy/dx and that looks really good but the problem looks not so good so let's try to do a couple things to organize this maybe if we're trying to do separable equations let's move our V over let's try and cool it try to combine those so if we subtract V we get this X DV DX equals 1 plus V over 1 minus V minus V now we're gonna do something like separable equations and separate our variables we're going to need one fraction here so we're going to take the time and we're gonna write that as one fraction we're gonna need a common denominator so let's do that if we're gonna make a common denominator we know that we'd multiply by 1 minus me over 1 minus V we need the common denominator okay something like a little nasty here let's see what happens so one plus P over 1 minus P - I'd never distribute this right now ever because I'll miss that sign that I won't get the plus b-squared that I should have okay so I'm not going to do that what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write this as one fraction so I know I have a common denominator I'm gonna write minus v1 minus B so common denominator yes original numerator yes second numerator yes and now we distribute with the minus sign errors will absolutely kill you on these sort of problems don't do them go slow enough that you don't make simple mistakes so when we organize it when we combine distribute combine some like terms right inside we'd have 1 plus B minus B and plus V squared 1 plus B minus B plus B squared let's move up here so when we combine some like terms we've got our X we got our DV DX that assignments okay right hand side we have 1 plus B squared or B squared plus 1 over 1 minus B now that is a separable equation so let's do that let's put our B's on one side we've seen this before the did so many examples gotta be in there somewhere where when we do this we multiply by the reciprocal here when we move our B's over so we multiplied by one minus B we divide by x squared plus one we divide by X so when we move this over here by multiplication and division we're gonna get the reciprocal DV on the right hand side we have two divided by X let's let that sink in for a little bit hopefully you're with me on this multiplied by 1 minus B check divide by V squared plus 1 gotta leave a TV to bind by X got it move to the X now we take our integral when you're doing integrals this goes back to club - don't try to do the hardest technique available try to get easiest so when you look at then you go I don't tricks up you sort of yeah you could you know but not not directly not right now is that nasty you so no it's not not that because the derivative here's to be and this up here is one - to be so we don't have enough variables that never make that happen or signs are wrong what else could I do well maybe we split it up so let's split up that fraction instead of doings trying to do partial fractions or whatever this is already an irreducible quadratic that's already on linear it's not really do anything for you let's go ahead and split the fraction so when we do that we have 1 over B squared plus 1 minus B over B squared plus 1 all of this is DV and we have integral of 1 over X DX right hand side very nice we're just gonna get Ln absolute value of x plus C on the left hand side now we have some things that we can do so this use use your table usually use a trig so if you really need to but use your table that's going to be tan inverse of e then so I know this guy tan inverse ax B then we do have a substitution that we know that that's gonna be u equals B squared plus one all right D u equals to V DV if we divide by two get a nice substitution on that fraction so we have the integral I'm gonna do a Ravager integral of 1 over u and then D u over 2 let's see if that makes sense we've have V DV equals D over 2 so this piece D over 2 we have this V squared plus 1 is U no problem and so this is going to give us 1/2 that's the D over 2 Ln that's 1 over U and then U is V squared plus 1 so let's put that back since V squared plus 1 is never negative we don't need the absolute value on the right-hand side with you I hope that makes sense might want to pause and go through that make sure that you can see that this is tan inverse trig sub or table I'm use table or memorize if you want to you I don't suggest it but then you're gonna do so often it's gonna end up in a minute memorize this is nice use of so we got that I split that up try it easy techniques rather than harder techniques so we okay well do it u so we're gonna get this minus 1/2 Ln V squared plus 1 and then man hot that's gonna be pretty nasty if we try to solve that for V are you seeing that might not even be possible then we have a natural log we've got a tan inverse B's inside both of them so in these sort of cases most of the time we don't even solve for V and if you're not selling for feet we're probably not gonna be able to solve for y either so we do need to substitute back in but then we're gonna be done so if V equals LIBOR X then we're gonna have a tan inverse Y over X looks great relatively 1/2 Ln V squared means Y over x squared or Y squared over X we're plus one I'll probably use a bracket around that make it look a little neater equals natural log absolute value of X plus C I know it doesn't look nice but that's about as nice as we can make it look otherwise we're we're starting to try to undo a natural logarithm and at and inverse at the same time and we're going to run some major issues so the whole whole process boils down to we can't do these difference equations with the basic techniques that I've given you so far so now we're getting on into substitution can't we make it look like one of those techniques with a basic substitution homogeneous is the first class of those that we were looking at isn't the first one that you should try not necessarily people like it because it's predictable but not necessarily some of them can be done several different ways and we need to take a look at some of those other ways sometimes you get an easier way rather than homogeneous this didn't seem all that bad but look at all the work that we have to do to structure it sometimes we get away from that so structuring this isn't is imperative for homogeneous you have to wrap up every instance of Y as Y over X that has to be the same substitution all the Y's have to be wrapped at the B's that way the derivative makes sense that way we can actually find the dy/dx that way we can do our substitution and then what that does hopefully if you've done it right then I'll make something that's possible in a different type of different differential equation with IVs in instead of Y's and that shouldn't be in the form of a basic integral or acceptable equation I hope that made sense next video we're gonna do a lot of examples so I mentioned I was going to do this a few videos that at the end of certain videos where we dealt with a new technique I was going to come back and say now we need to consider domain so we've been focusing only on technique but this domain is important we looked at linear first-order difference equations and saw that sometimes we have some domain problems when dividing by a variable that happens here - and also on the integrating factor because we don't want to deal with some absolute value sometimes affirm for some domain problems that occur well the same sort of thing happens in these three problems so I want to look at them very quickly just so you understand what's going on why we're seeing some domain restrictions and this happens when we start rewriting difference or difference of equations to fit a technique we're trying to use so this this first one man the first thing you're gonna have to do is divide by two XY to make this fit the technique I'm not showing the whole problem but obviously we're dividing by two variables we just need to understand that those two variables cannot equal zero either one of them by the zero product property each factor could equal zero making the whole product equal to zero and so all we have to do here say alright well hey X yeah that can equal zero and Y also can equal zero otherwise we'd be divided by something that could equal zero and so we talked about this domain thing where when you're trying to fit a differential equation to a certain technique that you're trying to use in order to make the technique work you're gonna have to put some restrictions on your domain no right or wrong that's what we have to do in order to make the technique work to solve this and so we're saying I can solve it okay I can do this but I've got to have these two things be satisfied and that's where those domain restrictions come in now you might be wondering wait a second on the linear we always had it greater than greater than zero what's the difference one of the differences is that on your linear when when you solve them you create this product rule and you integrate and you get an X or some function of X over there and you get a function of X on the right hand side and we'd like to simplify those and that works very very well for us when we're dealing with homogeneous homogeneous equations they're always going to yield for you some sort of a separable equation that's how you solve all of these that's what the heads of the product is it's this product that we sorry it's this substitution that creates this product for us that we use separable equations with it and so what happens in those several equations if you think back a while did one of two things we either wrapped up that absolute value as a plus or minus e to the C that happens a lot or what we did is we had the absolute value in some other expression where we couldn't simplify it anyway and so one of the reasons why we don't do that greater than zero is because when we're getting this element absolute value of X either we can wrap up the e to the Ln we could wrap up that that the absolute value in a plus or minus and so we'll get this the same same sort of idea with the separable we'll get this out the C okay yeah but then when I raise this to the e power on both sides I could do the plus and minus e to the C call that C one call that thing a big seeing okay well this is my constant and I'll have the word with absolute value or we have the I have Ln of absolute value or some function with absolute value in there that I wouldn't be able to simplify anything with anyway and so we don't really that's one reason why but you don't do this here unlike the linear we're not having those cases we don't have the opportunity to wrap up the plus and minus with from the absolute in the absolute value with an e to some some constant we don't have the opportunity it's not separable it's linear and so it's a different thing here and so when we're dealing with these separable equations on based on these homogeneous equation that we were solving well we have the opportunity to do two things number one either wrap up the absolute value in that plus and minus need and C sub one or we don't get to simplify any in any way because it's Ln of some absolute value we can't simplify that and so many other X's extraneous X's wouldn't come into that Ln anyway and so for those two cases we really don't worry about it so long story made really short for linear a lot of times you're going to get the X is greater than zero because if I've mentioned things that I mentioned here we're not gonna do that for the reasons why I mentioned and so for moment change you go yeah you know what I can't have x equals zero I can't have Y it was do we care about the absolute value not really because either we're gonna wrap that up in a plus and minus e to some constant or we probably won't be able to simplify that naturally the that absolute value of x with any other X's in E out because it's going to be wrapped up in another function and so we're gonna leave it same thing happens here so very quickly yeah you're divided by X wait so X can't equal 0 right yeah great X and equal 0 but wait a minute we have x times y inside of a square root don't those always have to be positive doesn't that doesn't that doesn't that product have to always be positive for real numbers instead of a square root yeah well that implies right there that X can't equal 0 anyway so this one's all you really need says yeah hey yeah if X is zero this wouldn't if X is zero this won't happen so X can't be 0 in order to make this happen anyway is there a product property last one the first thing we do for the homogeneous you saw this in the last example we divide by X minus y wait a minute we're dividing by X minus y this is gonna heal two conditions one of them is if you're gonna divide by something that something can't equal 0 but furthermore because we had this homogeneous equation we're setting these all up as Y over X X also can't equal 0 so that gives us two two conditions that we've got to restrict our domain or make this technique of homogeneous equations work I hope this is making sense to you this is why I didn't really want to go through it when we were going over the technique it's just what it feel feel feel very choppy it would've felt very choppy like oh now I got a pause and explain all this stuff so I wanted the technique just flow and now we have this well but you're dividing by something that can't be 0 say that say can't have 0 for x and y say that can't be negative or zero because okay it's got to be greater than zero we can't we're divided by X and that takes care of it here you're dividing hey the thing you're dividing by can't be 0 also the thing you're dividing by can't be 0 we're just defying them now again this differs from linear' where we had a lot of X greater than zero now we just have X not equal to zero because we're not as concerned with the absolute value not concerned as much about the domain as well from some of the issues that we get so separable equations help us out a little bit with that anyhow I hope that's making sense you're gonna see this a couple more times in in several more videos that we we go back and talk about domain at the end method first technique first then we discuss domain have a good day you 

Transcript for: Solving Homogeneous First Order Differential Equations (Differential Equations 21)
now is there time to practice some of these homogeneous equations are solving by homogeneous substitution so we have these differential equations we know they don't fit a particular technique that we've learned so we're trying to substitute that make that happen last video I gave you a couple introductory examples this time then we're gonna crush some examples there's about seven of them that we're gonna do and some of them are just brutal and so I'm trying to give you the hardest ones I could find or create or recreate to give you those those cases where it they're very difficult now I also send some said something the last video that sometimes some of these equations can be solved at least one other way and so in in a few videos from now I'm going to show you that so while some of these look just extraordinarily hard we go Wow can't there be a better way to do this maybe but I'm giving you at least a fallback like hey here's homogeneous equations this is what you could do with this and also you know me I'm trying to get you to practice some of the whole techniques that way they're in your head so you're never forgetting them excuse me let's look at this one so we got X plus y dy DX equals X minus y and with with these substitution techniques they're only used if you can't make it into something you already know how to do it's like hey could you take a basic integral well no could you write this as the simple equation where we can separate the variables no is it linear doesn't look like it can you make it homogeneous and that's what we're gonna do this is similar to one of the examples in the last video but it has a different technique on on doing the integration so we're going to start here something basic just to get our brains working on what this is again and then we'll start some harder examples so number one let's try to make this into that form of solve for dy/dx and let's see if we can make the homogeneous or at least fit the form of it we saw this in one of the previous examples like that doesn't look great but remember what we're trying to do with homogeneous with homogeneous equations what we're trying to do is we're always trying to structured so that every instance of why is divided by X that gives us a very nice substitution if you have not watched the last video you need to watch that because I'm not going through and explaining this whole technique again spend and how we're doing that right now we're just practicing so the technique says yes you can create this Y over X every place you have Y let's just divide everything by X if we divide every single term by X which means we're multiplying 1 over x times 1 over X and we're distributing that's what's really happy to mathematically what it's coming down to is if we divide everything by X well then what we get is 1 minus y over X hey that's what I'm looking for over 1 plus y over X that's also what I'm looking for I want to structure this if I'm gonna use this technique with every case of Y has to be a fraction Y over X we need to make sure we're getting rid of all of the Y's you may not have y's and x's and these are substitutions so we're grouping all of this so we have y over X that lets us make a really convenient substitution we explored why we want that in the last video but if we have V equals y over X that's going to be a V that's going to be a V but this little Y over here is also got to go well that's where the substitution comes in handy because if I solve this for y and we do a derivative implicitly we'd get dy/dx equals by the product rule that we have here based on implicit differentiation we get X DV DX plus B now we're gonna make sort of a two-port substitution yeah we're gonna call that V yeah we're gonna call that V but also because we made this really convenient substitution because we were able to take a derivative by solving for y we now get that dy/dx these are the same dy DX's dy DX equals this piece let's substitute for all of them so left hand side is going to become this textbooks that look like magic but where they come from but here we have dy/dx equals here's some do a great job but some just kindly behaved equals this so dy/dx is equal to DV X times DV DX plus me on the right hand side so this is that derivative same exact thing that's why we need to replace it on the right hand side we still have a one we saw have a minus but now we're grouping that Y as where X that becomes our V and one plus B so let me let me double check something we knew how to do know maybe we can structure for substitution let's try coma Jeanne's let's group this so we have dy/dx and everything on the right hand side let's see if we can make all of our wise of the form Y of X divide everything by X ok let's substitute let's call this a letter it's called a vu variable all right so V equals y brakes no problem oh we also need to solve for dy/dx let's solve for y let's take a derivative dy/dx is now based on X's and B's our Y's are now based on these that's our substitution and then what this has done is this this has created a differential equation that's based on a different variable yeah that variable is still X's and Y's but it creates something that hopefully we can do with a simple equation or something else so we know how to do so let's try let's try to get rid of this mean we want to make sure all our B's are together for separable equations so let's try to do that hmm in order to combine those we're gonna have to have a common denominator so let's go ahead and let's make that make that happen so our LCD here is this 1 plus B so 1 minus B minus v times 1 plus V all over 1 plus me that was our common denominator I know that I'd never want to distribute this in my head because I'm used to I don't wanna mess up that second side so let me distribute we do it from here and we get x times DV DX equals 1 minus B minus another be those two cancel minus B squared all over 1 plus B all right Wow what now well let's simplify well if we do that you know I really don't like the way this looks now when we try to factor and do substitutions you also time it's nice to have that in order that's nice to have the first term positive so what if we let me just factored out that negative so we factor out the negative here we get a positive B squared a plus 2v and a minus 1 let's let's double-check that factor the negative all the signs change have a negative out front now it looks pretty good I don't look good well that looks good as far as being a simple equation because we have these these on one side we can make on the left hand side the X on the left side we can put on the right hand side with our DX let's do that let's move this to the left we'll have to reciprocate remember what we'd be doing it would be multiplying by V plus 1 we'd be dividing by this expression and then we'd be dividing by X we're also going to leave any constants which includes negatives on the right hand side works a little bit better that way so let's try that so moving this all-around structure RVs on the Left Divi are X's on the right DX we'd have V plus 1 multiplied by the reciprocal over B squared plus 2b minus 1 we're gonna keep that DV on the right hand side so we let C move that we kept the DV let's divide by X let's move our DX now let's make sure that we don't forget that Megan it's so easy to lose  I do it sometimes it happens well let's just be real careful I've always known back and double-checking my work so do I have my V plus one on the numerator yeah do I have this exact expression no sign changes on the denominator yeah with my DV okay did I divide by X I got that to leave my negative I got that and I move my DX now we're ready for an integral so when we integrate both sides on the left hand side don't make these harder than they have to be it's so common for people to dis assume they're gonna be brutal sometimes they are we're gonna get some of those today but sometimes they're not so when you look at this try a substitution first if you take u equals the denominator can you simplify the numerator the answer is yeah you can because if we take u equals V squared plus 2 V minus 1 and we do a derivative and we factor out 2 and we divide by 2 sorry mr. Peavey well then we get Dean you over 2 equals V + 1 DB that's exactly what we have right there so we looked at we thought man that doesn't look great but let's try some simple stuff first let's try separating the fraction bad this is not something I want to do because the substitution won't work I don't want to go any harder than that let's try a basic substitution okay well if I take my denominator as you then 2 u plus 2 V Plus would be 2 we can factor out the 2 and we get that D U is 2 times V plus 1 DV divided by 2 then V plus 1 DV exactly what my numerators is equal to D over 2 and that's a nice substitution so on the left hand side we have this whole piece this is gone that's 1 over you call this whole thing you that's really nice and then we have this piece this V + 1 DV is equal to D u over 2 man that looks a whole lot better than what we started with on the right hand side we still have a negative we still have an integral 1 over X DX now let's go ahead and do our integration so on the left hand side we get 1/2 Ln absolute value u on the right hand side negative Ln absolute value of x and yeah I'm gonna plus C now what else we want to do with it well we gotta at least substitute back in for u so this needs to become this piece and now we have a couple of the things that we can do number one well I probably would multiply everything by two because I don't like that 1/2 I don't want to deal with square root so let's multiply both sides by two right hand-side multiplying everything by two it's gonna distribute I know I'm gonna be changing that constant now let's get as close as we can to solving for V let's take both of these sides as an exponent on that e so to get rid of our lens on the left hand side remember what's gonna happen here I'm going to show all of this at one time what's going to happen is well put it me here and E on that entire side well on the left hand side that's fine we'll get absolute value V squared plus 2b minus one on the right hand side you have exponents added together what that means is that we can have e to the first term times if excellence are added together the came from common bases being multiplied each to the first term times e to the second term so that's we're gonna get so e to the ln gone b squared plus 2v put minus 1 is a value looks good each of the first term times neither the second term lorries might across this out i want you to see what happens in negative to that negative 2 is an exponent so let's move that if we do with that then the absolute value of V squared plus 2 V minus 1 doesn't change on the right hand side I'm going to move this that be X to the negative second power times BD - let's do this times e to the 2 c1 now absolute values let's group all of that idea best value remember it's either plus or minus that idea let's drop those and let's group that idea onto this constant so plus or minus e to the 2 C sub 1 times X to the negative 2 now we're gonna see this whole thing let's just call that a constant and we can even do this really big value we can do this over an x squared so that's a negative exponent no problem just a couple more things we got to do you know what we have to do hopefully understand what we're doing here we have this in terms of B so long problem these take a while some of these are just brutal but we said can't do it regularly try them when to use substitution or homogeneous equation let's make a substitution we did that we have something that we have as separable equations we've solved our integrals for term of V and X but now we got to go back to wise so every place you saw why it was Y over X maybe now every place you see V that's got to be replaced with Y over X so here we're gonna get this Y over x squared 2 times y over X minus 1 equals C over x squared if we simplify just a little bit this will be Y squared over x squared plus 2y over X minus 1 equals C over x squared let's just multiply everything by x squared so we're going to get some simplification if we multiply x squared x squared x squared and x squared then we'll get Y squared plus if we multiply by x squared 1 the X's will cancel one will not 2xy minus x-squared remember we distribute by multiply on both sides on the right hand side we just get C nasty yeah kind of some of these problems I don't know that that nice but what's just amazing the substitutions work force a lot of the time and we can solve some of these differential equations that otherwise we'd be like Milan so that's that's the idea substitutions make them a little bit more possible hope this makes sense I hope you're seeing the idea of homogeneous equations I told you that we're not going to shy away from some really hard problems you got the easy ones in the last video so if you need if you haven't watch that you really should because this might seem like oh my goodness what are you doing these are going to be the more difficult examples I'm giving you here so the ideas were in the last video now we're just putting them into practice so we have got like six more examples from a long video hang on let's start our next one so same ideas again this is a section on homogeneous equations so obviously we're gonna go ahead and do all those I will say one more time that some of these examples can be done a different way and we're gonna get to those and when we do hopefully all kind of reference some of them as we're going through that so let's try this one anything we look that looks like we know what we're doing that not so much can make it homogeneous what that involves is structure and everything with X's and Y's on one side rewriting all the Y terms as Y's over X's let's good let's do them so when we divide both sides by x times X plus y kind of similar to the last problem and that we have this idea we're gonna do the same thing where we have X minus whatever X plus y but this right here this is already what we want to do so don't be distributing that you know you don't have to undo it anyway so if you have the Y over X you're trying to make this a homogeneous equation of the form of a homogeneous equation leave that so we can look at this at why over x times whatever this is now we can divide each of these terms by X and that's the exactly the technique we've used a couple other times so let's leave the first Y of X let's divide everything in this fraction by X that's 1 minus y over X remember the idea we're always trying to get every instance of Y divided by X and we have it we have it one two three times that's when we make our substitution so now we can say okay let's call V let's call this Y of X equal to V what also happens is that if we solve for y so here's our substitution if we solve for y well then we can take a derivative and that lets us substitute for our dy/dx product rule with a chain rule so a derivative of the first times a second plus the first times the derivative the second which is one let's make our substitution hopefully you can do that right now so if you're this takes some some work and you might not be there yet but from here you should be able to make your substitution so dy DX dy DX is now this junk right here hopefully you noticed this but in these homogeneous equations dy DX always changes to that so your left-hand side always why it's always the same substitution why because you're always trying to make Y over X it gives you the same substitution that gives you the same derivative it gives you the same dy equals this so always the same on the right hand side command we get a lot of these so dy/dx I replaced it why Rex I replaced it with V y of Rex and replace it with V Y Rex and I replace it with v normally I show these in parentheses to show that this is what I'm replacing do you have to not really but for me it's a nice little organizer in my head and this is what I'm doing oh man well we're probably going to want to move that V to the right-hand side and see if we make one fraction our ideas let's try to structure this like a separable equation separator variables so if we subtract we get V times 1 minus V over 1 plus B - and under V so we subtract V on both sides well we're gonna need a common denominator our way if we get a common denominator just like last time exactly like last time we multiplied by the other denominators then others shared over Fraga factors we're gonna have to do that so left hand side we get X DV DX no problem that looks really good right hand side we have all on the numerator we have V times 1 minus V - V times 1 plus V no there's a mistake right now and it's really common and it's an algebra mistake a lot of people will do this and say oh well you you've got well let me say it a different way it'd be an algebra mistake if we did something like this that's what I want to see I didn't make a mistake sorry I'm did my own state but when we're grouping this this fraction right here this has a V on the numerator already when we get a common denominator you don't need to distribute that so this V didn't come from here this V was our minus B that we had when we multiply it by that that de nom we create this common denominator we create one fraction this V does not need to be distributed here it's it's not the same idea as multiplying you're just subtracting a fraction that V was already on the numerator that V should have already had parentheses do not distribute to the second fraction see it sometimes we go so fast you make the little bounce mistake so don't do that please don't be there so what could we do well we could just distribute everything and see what happens we could factor out a V and then simplify either way you want to go it doesn't doesn't really matter so let's give it a try V minus V squared minus B minus B squared all over one plus B so if we simplified we're gonna get our X not a problem DV DX looks pretty good right hand side these are gone negative two V squared when you combine like terms over one plus B that at least looks a little bit better now I've got my visa rather than one fraction I've got my X over here let's switch those let's keep the negative two in the right hand side we're going to keep our our coefficients that are constants like the negative two in the right hand side will move our one plus B and our v squared so we're gonna have the reciprocal DV we'll have negative two over X DX so we're gonna move that stuff around what we're trying to do is we're trying to group all of our V's on one side DV all of our X's on the other side DX we're always trying to get the separation of variables in here to work for us so multiply by the reciprocal got that DV we kept our negative two over X and now we can integrate right hand side not a big deal left hand side well let's run through it can you solve it by separating the fractions yeah let's do that without any division it's not a new sub something anything fancy just separate our fraction there so we've done that maybe we simplify a little bit maybe so it looks a nicer force instead of one over B squared let's do B to the negative 2 plus 1 over B and I got that all DV and then negative 2 integral of 1 over X DX it's gonna be absolute value of X let's just go ahead and do that so we got an integral of V to the negative 2 power not a problem we're gonna add one to the exponent divided by the new exponent plus integral of 1 over v ln v right hand side we keep the negative 2 Ln absolute value of x plus c we're actually almost done so when we do go ahead and simplify this a little bit how it looks like we're gonna have yeah negative 1 over V get it plus Ln absolute value V equals negative 2 Ln absolute value of x plus C on them what else can we do well we could just multiply everything by oh there's an idea what if we took what have we took and move this to the left hand side that way we've got L ends together and what if we took and move this to the right hand side that would we have our stuff that's not a lens over there so the idea is remember those those export rules that you can do sorry natural log rules if you have natural log to be multiplied you can you can combine them so let's try that let's move this to the right side this to the left side all right what else could we do maybe we move this is an exponent right hand side stays the same maybe even combine those do you remember what happens when you have logarithms being added together that you create a product inside one logarithm well that's about as good as we're gonna get before unless we start using some Exponential's which I don't want to do so let's plug in our Y so we know that V was equal to Y over X let's do that again so if we do V equals y over X then we have Ln Y over x times x squared equals 1 over V so 1 over Y over X plus C now a couple other people might want to do this like well the V let's make a V to the negative 1 so it would be the negative 1 we'd have Y over X but then it'd be the negative 1 power we would reciprocate that so x over Y same thing happens here 1 over Y over X that's the same thing as X to the line so right hand side we're going to get x over y plus C left hand side we since the vacation we know that x squared over X just gives us X feels like run a rule let's keep on going so we have another one and we're looking at it going back does not look very good there's an e up there what in the world we do with that well look at the export of the sometimes these substitution techniques almost give themselves away so when you have Y of an actually go I'm not going to get rid of that well that's kind of begging you to do a homogeneous into that home easiest form of the difference equation so do the substitution the V equals y over X it's almost just asking you for that so let's see if that works let's divide both sides by x squared to try to get this in the form remember the fun we want is dy/dx equals a whole bunch of stuff where every instance of Y is divided by X so that our substitution works let's try that so when we divide by x squared well we simplify and it almost get itself up for free so that's kind of nice some of these examples or some of these problems just all show you what to do it says that's that looks really similar to a substitute that is a substitution we've been doing before let's try to make everything else fit that so we solve for dy/dx we simplify what we can and now we see that every instance of the variable Y is also divided by an X that is our substitution let's make y equal to that I'm sorry feed let's make V equal to that if we solve for y it allows us to go ahead and do a derivative based on our product rule and chain rule and get something that we can replace not only Y over X so V V but now dy/dx is this whole piece right there dy/dx replace it so our left-hand side looks like this we've got that right hand side this is now V he is still there but raised to the V power now this is pretty nice we saw this a couple times on on the last video but if you subtract V this happens occasionally happens quite a bit when you're going through all of your examples sometimes your beasts cancel that's great does it look like it's separable can you group your visa on one side DV your X's on the side DX that's what it looks like to me if I multiply both sides by e to the negative beat or divide by e to the V change your exponent we're gonna get an e to the negative V DV divided by X that's 1 over X DX man this problem looked a lot harder than it is and sometimes that happens if you get the right substitution or use the appropriate one there are some that work with some of examples you can work it in two or three different ways but sometimes that one will be just really nice in this case that's what gave it away oh that's that's really nice for a homogeneous if I could write the otherwise in that form well we can so once we get it down to here we separate our variables let's do an integral the way that e to the function of X works is you get the you get that that function back again divided by the derivative of your exponent that's just negative so negative e to the negative e equals Ln absolute value of x plus C see well let's see what else can we do I don't like that negative let's multiply everything by a negative call that C sub 1 that way we might change it later looks pretty good what else can we do well we this can be kind of awkward but could we take an Ln of everything we could we can do L n D to the negative V equals l n- l 9 absolute value of X minus C sub 1 let's do a couple of things with this number number 1 let's eliminate this is a composition of inverse function so that's going to be gone we'll get negative V on the right-hand side I'm gonna do two things inside that bracket I'm gonna move this negative as an exponent I know that that means that's going to be 1 over X I'm also going to change this minus C sub 1 to plus C so remember that that's an arbitrary constant so if I define C equals negative C sub 1 then I can write this is plus C and if you're getting a lot of problems on your your homework or your practice go where where there's a sign coming from why am I not getting that they might be wrapping up and negative inside of another arbitrary constant now we have one last thing to do that V that V is representing wire X let's change it back if we multiply both sides by negative x get a really awkward-looking answer but i mean it's not not horrible I suppose so we have this negative X Ln Ln of absolute value 1 or X plus C you might see it differently so I wrote this my way but you might see this differently I'm going to show you from right from right here imagine you didn't do that negative one imagine you didn't do this as Ln 1 over X which is one reason why we do this example to show you you get several different looks here well if you consider this to be that so I still wrap this up as the C but I left the minus alone I let the negative one's gonna kill the - well then when you solve this negative Y over x equals Ln C - Ln X and you multiply both sides by negative X you get something that looks fairly different you go those don't look the same they don't look the same but they are the same you see some of those logarithms when we get logarithms you know that you get several different looks for it so whether you get this or that doesn't really matter you're gonna see this problem more often than not because people try to avoid those fractions inside natural logarithm logarithms but I wanted you to see both of those that those are equivalent answers just by stretching the problem little bit differently anyway the fundamental idea is hey if you've got a substitution you can make it's really apparent try it is always gonna work no but there's a good chance that it will let's move on to another problem all right moving on so we have another example we've got a differential equation it doesn't look like anything that we're used to seeing like well that work can be seen home genius but it don't look like anything were used to seeing as far as direct separable equation or linear or something else that we've done like basic integrals so we might start trying homogeneous because that's all we know and we're going to I'm going to show you that but I want to say right from the beginning that there is at least one other technique that we can use here it's called an embedded derivative at least that's what I call it is an embedded derivative where the function of Y and the derivative of the function of Y is also in your equation so I want you to check this out disregarding constants if I look at Y squared and the got Y squared the derivative Y squared is 2 wide there's no y and we would be able to do this with another technique and it might actually work out a little bit easier so I'm saying that now just to prove to you because I'm gonna do it later that you don't have to use one specific technique to get the same answer and to solve this differential equation right now because we're kind of limited to homogeneous equations I'm going to show you that because this has some interesting techniques as we go through that's what we're doing it but that's I just want to let you know that so let's try to make this homogeneous we know we need 2 ydx by itself we know that every instance of Y has to be Y over X let's divide by X times y and let's simplify as much as possible you go that doesn't look great well you know what we can do if we have x over Y we can write that as a negative exponent so take your fraction reciprocate it's also going to change the sign of your exponent so we have this dy/dx well we can write this as not x over Y but Y over X to the negative 1 plus 3 and then Y over excellent really good now we're ready to go now we know that our substitution can be B we know if we solve for y we can do an implicit derivative dy/dx and now that lets us do is sort of a double substitution we're gonna replace dy/dx with this piece we're gonna replace each instance of X Y or X with V so this whole thing this thing is going to change dy/dx is going to be this piece right hand side we have V to the negative one power plus 3b all right hey let's try to write this as separable let's see if that works that's one technique that we're really familiar with one or for that to happen we're gonna have to group RVs on one side create one fraction then move it back so let's let's try that so we have this X DV DX no problem right hand side we have V to the you know what let's write that as 1 over V plus 2 V they'll probably combine some like terms well that's not one fraction and if I want to group this as all my these times DV and then XD add 1 over X DX I'm gonna have to make one fraction out of that so we'll need a common denominator if we multiply by V over V we get our X DV DX right hand side we get 1 + 2 V squared over V just V to the first power because this whole thing common denominator you're not multiplying that when you add fractions now that's something we can deal with let's group RVs on one side DV so reciprocal sure divided by X move our DX no problem now we're ready so the idea try to make it homogeneous if you want to is there other ways yes we don't know him yet so divide because by whatever this XY y because homogenius are predictable we kind of know what's gonna happen we kind of know that we're gonna be trying to get separable equations we know how to deal with that so we do it even though sometimes the techniques aren't great as far as their integrals we do know what's gonna happen with them so we're going to reciprocate with our DB and reciprocate with our DX let's do an integral on the right hand side piece of cake not bad at all left-hand side this is not a separation of fractions you can't separate that unless you do partial fractions you're not going to do that we're going to do a substitution so if you equals to V squared plus 1 try something basic try the most basic technique see if they work then D u equals 4 V DV let's divide by 4 because right here we have the V DV that's fantastic and now we can make that substitution work someone just go right over here we get our integral of V DV that is our D u over 4 we chose our whole denominator to be u so here's our you there's our u v DV is DV over 4 and so we can go ahead and change this integral left hand side becomes this right hand side was really basic we didn't have to change it and now if you did great nicely we know that that 1/4 is gonna stay there Ln absolute value you know problem right hand side Ln absolute value of x plus C sub 1 in case you have to start changing that arbitrary constant now we can kind of like to read substitutions we have a u in there but we use the use of so let's move that back to 2 V squared plus 1/2 V squared plus 1 is never negative so we don't really need those absolute value more next step maybe we start multiplying I mean well unless you learn to deal with the four through let's go to play everything by four to get rid of the run for let me hang on to that for C sub one for just a bit because I know I'm probably going to be using and an exponential here I'm going to wrap all of that up in that seat well another thing I might do maybe move this as an exponent so I can get that Ln by itself now that looks pretty good let's do the e in to change both of these is x bar on e if we do that so ii ii ii this whole thing well we have exponents that are added that came from common bases being multiplied so gone gone but we're going to get e to the 4 c sub one i hope that makes sense if you fall in the algebra on this one so take these as an exponential we would get X to the fourth x naught plus x we have exponents so that would be e to this term times e to this term let's call that whole thing the arbitrary constant C now we're almost done man the only thing we've got to do now let's solve for V as much as it's possible so we can just subtract one if you're thinking why don't we divide by two you certainly could but because we're going to be ending this implicitly anyway we don't I mean we don't have to because we'd started getting getting fractions out of that so if you want to divide by two you can you started getting one-half things like that so I'm gonna leave it as two V squared but what we do have to do we start in terms of Y so we're gonna need this back in terms of Y since V equals y over X the left-hand side becomes 2y over x squared equals C X to the fourth minus one let's make this 2y squared over x squared equals C to the fourth all right sorry the X to the fourth minus one and another thing we could do probably is multiply everything by x squared we could do that so multiplying gone see X to the sixth minus x squared you could factor the x squared you could have just multiplied the whole thing by x squared you can also add x squared back if you don't like the - there's lots of different forms we can except here what we're not gonna do is we're not gonna solve for y because you get the plus and minus you have something that we don't really want to look at as far as their solution here so implicitly defined we just consider that as our solution so we're looking at it saying could could we solve this homogeneous lead over the homogeneous equation yeah yeah we can some interesting techniques sometimes happen try some simple ones first before you get all crazy on your new rules and then if you can solve for like great if you can't it's okay to leave it implicit especially when you get things like Y squared so that's about all we can do on that example let's move on to another one we're gonna start getting some some tougher ones for these last few problems well let's get moving so we have another one I'm going to show you how to do homogeneous make this into homogeneous form of this differential equation we'll make our substitution we'll go through it a couple of things that I want you to notice we're going through this is how to deal with the square roots we've seen it one time before like how you make that happen we'll talk a little bit about that and then my ideas here of course when we deal with integrals try to make them as simple as possible it's gonna look like you're gonna want to do one technique here but refrain from that until you try something easier so let's get started I would actually really like it if you guys would try this on your own try at least the first step so try putting this in the form of a homogeneous equation so can you get dy/dx by itself try that can you simplify what you have try that try to simplify see what happens think about what you want to happen you want every instance of Y to be in the form Y of X that looks really good right there it doesn't look great here so think about how you can make that happen could you define y as something that you can put inside the square root think think about that think about what you can do to make make it possible for you to combine those square roots what could you do try it could you write this as the square root of Y squared we're always under than trying to give this idea of we want Y over X Y over X Y even x over a while work because we have negative exponents that are exposed over here so Y over X looks really good the square root does not look really good so let's see if we can make this Y into the square root of Y squared now we can make one one big square root out of it and if we make that into two different fractions we get 4x squared over Y squared plus y squared over Y squared now that we have that down can you simplify it and see if you can simplify these fractions remember what we want we want Y over X so can you simplify Y square root of Y squared of course can you write this as Y over X to some power the reason why I'm asking you these questions at this point in this this lesson is I want you asking yourself when you when you approach these problems like on your test or homework I want you asking yourself these questions when you deal with these and try to make them in homogeneous equations I want you asking can I do this should I be doing this how can I simplify it am I getting the right thing that's why I ask you these even though you can't respond to me verbally I want we think and think in that way so in my mind I'm always asking those questions so can I write this is why Rex done can I write this as Y bricks probably because I know that I could make this four times x over y squared that's the same thing keep kick out before that's x over y squared plus one but because that's the reciprocal of what I want if I reciprocate the fraction all it happens is I change the sign of my exponent Y bricks got it core no problem Y over X yes but to the negative 2 power reciprocate change the sign plus one now we're ready for our substitution so can you do that so once you have Y over X in every instance of life make your substitution try it so V equals y Rex do your y equals do your derivative of Y and then substitute for everything two parts substitution one for dy/dx one for every case of Y Breck's should be trying that right now so my hat ask am I ready for the substitution yes I have Y's over X's can I solve for y corns can I take a derivative of Y so as to replace dy/dx sure now we're ready so this is going to become left hand side is exactly what we found because we solve for dy/dx that's always the case for homogeneous equations so left hand side that right hand side I'm gonna replace V and V so let's make sure that work dy/dx no use your substitution dy/dx no this thing Y breaks no B plus sign sure square root sure 4 sure why bricks no V to the second negative second power then plus one I love it when this happens oh man so nice avoid some common common denominators avoids adding fractions I love it when the B's cancel now the right hand side might take a little bit of work so we can write this as 4 over B squared plus 1 but that doesn't look really good so let's try and see if we can make that a slightly better form so for V to make it too sure but that means 4 over V squared plus 1 can you and this happens a lot when you have something over a variable squared plus a constant can you make a common denominator can you combine this and simplify the denominator so try that try getting a common denominator here try combining and then splitting up that square root for the numerator and denominator on the numerator we just get 4 plus B squared over B squared and that happens a lot when you have constant over variable squared plus constant you'll get a common denominator you'll go ahead and add the numerators but your denominator is a square I have a square root if you split that square root up square roots and exponent exponents distribute across operations that are right below them so multiplication and division so our our square root distributes to the numerator and the denominator but when we do the denominator the square root of B squared is just V oh man that looks so much better that's something that we can do as a separable equation with separate variables these on one side DV 1 over X on the other side DX I'm going too fast for you if I am slow down the video that's a joke but I'm kind of taking for granted that you you at this point understand we're reciprocating understand we're reciprocate understand we can feed VN DX because it's a separable equation to spent just tons of time on that and then the integration techniques I slowed down for so when we integrate both sides right hand side just super easy left hand side some of you are gonna really really want to make this a trick so because it looks like that form don't do that all right try easier stuff before harder stuff so when you look at it is it basic no can you separate the fractions and make it basic no is this substitution yes that's how you should go through your integrals don't automatically jump to it's gotta be partial fractions with the trig so whoa can you come crazy don't do that all right do something easier versus harder sometimes we're forced to trig so yeah sometimes you're forced a partial fraction yeah but that those are last resorts try the easier stuff first here all this taste has a nice little view some you as V squared plus 4 do you is 2v DV divided by 2 and then we got it we got a nice integral we're gonna have 1 over the square root of U so we'll write that as u to the one-half so you was V squared plus 4 square root of u there's a u to the one-half and then D u over 2 if we write this appropriately we'd have a 1/2 so that's the D over 2 is pulled in 1/2 out we got an integral we get U to the negative 1/2 D U and we do a basic and go of that that's kind of nice so let's keep our 1/2 let's do you to know that see we add 1 divide by the new exponent 1/2 and 1/2 gone right hand side get Ln absolute value of X plus C let's put our view back so ru was V squared plus 4 we know that C the one-half power things we can do well we could probably write that as a square root Finley so square root of B squared plus 4 let's try to solve for B as much as possible we could square both sides looks okay to me let's subtract 4 and now we're about as good as we can get before we start plugging back in that Y over X V is y over X so we use that that V twice 1 to get away from wise want to get back to why it just is always in conjunction to whatever X so this will be y squared over x squared I hope you see why if you don't see why I'm just but I hope you see the the reason of okay the reason why we have the square we're squaring V and so we're squaring Y and we're squaring X on the right hand side that things change maybe we just multiplied by x squared to call it good so x squared times ln f of x plus c squared minus 4x squared and that's about it you could see a different form sometimes we get that people would add back the 4x squared will not even move in the first place I like that one but sometimes you'll get this where they say I'd prefer to have that on one side it's implicit anyway so why not put them together avoid the minus sign either way is is really fine so that's about it for that problem we're gonna move on got two more to do they're gonna be some of them are Perdition these last two are the roughest ones you're gonna see so I'm going to show you those techniques they most partial fractions with the integrals we see that again so hang on formed all right let's get going on this I'm going to show you how to do this as a homogeneous equation there's gonna be some rough parts in this some things like whoa I forgot you can do that with integrals and that's how we're doing these problems of course it's pretty easy right now the destructure these is y over X everywhere and do your substitution but I'm doing these examples because the integration techniques and them needs some refreshing sometimes you're just gonna be missing that so that's what we're going through just lots of practice if you don't need it fine move on to the next video when we talk about different technique but for right now this this is kind of this is kind of nice to be able to get through these and see exactly what's going on so number one does it look like a difference equation yeah don't look like a basic one no can we do a substitution we're gonna try let's try to do this with a homogeneous equation so let's go ahead let's get everything on one side don't divide by Y first subtract 2x first we can do that okay now we get a solve for dy/dx that's how the structure of homogeneous equations work so let's divide my line now we got a couple things going on we've seen this at least two times before we're gonna take this and go well let's make that into one big square root we need the square root of Y squared so we're gonna do that but also we don't really want X over Y we want Y over X so in doing that we change the sign of our exponent reciprocate the fraction change the sign of yourn exponent plus but then we're going to get a big square root with x squared plus y squared see if I can do this for you all over Y squared if this piece of the square root of Y squared then we have a giant square root of the same numerator divided by y squared because it's now inside the square root let's simplify that so negative negative Y over X where X negative 1 power cool plus big that square root we have x squared over Y squared plus 1 or separate the fractions x squared rights are great plus y squared Y squared that's 1 no problem what else can we do that doesn't look great does it let's fix it if we had x over so this piece x over y squared that's what that is that's X over Y squared but it doesn't fit what we want we want Y over X let's reciprocate it it will change the sign of our exponent so expert over Y squared x over y quantity squared Y over X to the negative 2 power even though that looks really nasty that's what we can start substituting so we know that every instance of Y is now over X we know that we can put v equals y over X we know that if we solve for y dydx is going to be x times DV DX plus B not a problem and now we can make our substitution you should be trying that right now see if you can substitute from here do your X DV Plus DV DX plus B and then V 2 negative 1 with e to the negative 2 Plus once you can do that okay so dy/dx not anymore negative x my rights negative 1 no negative V to the negative 1 plus square root of Y Direction a to know V today 2 plus 1 stagette plus 1 it's exhausting let's go ahead and try to simplify some of this maybe make it a little bit better so X DV DX no problem that looks ok let's subtract this so let's subtract V that'll be negative V now I'm gonna do it two steps that was easy let's simplify this first so negative V of negative 1 that's negative 1 over V let's write that as a fraction plus big square root V to the negative 2 is 1 over V squared plus 1 so this side says saying this is 1 over V but negative this is one of V squared plus 1 we're gonna do two things I'm now gonna subtract V on both sides it has no like terms right now I'm going to make this a common denominator so I'm going to do that first so the end of this I'll have plus C 1 plus V squared over B squared you should be trying down here so 1 over V squared plus 1 1 over V squared plus V squared over V squared 1 plus B squared over B squared I'd have a minus 1 over V if I subtract V I've got a negative V and that's X DV DX so X DV DX got it subtract V here's my minus V I've got my - gonna repeat okay get my plus I get my square root that I'm trying to simplify that a little bit now let's simplify this so we're gonna keep the square root of the numerator by the square root of the denominator simplifies oh my gosh let's create lots of algebra right rides a fraction or as a fraction common denominator simplifying this stayed the same all the way through subtract V we got a remind of speed now in order for this to be a separable equation in separate variables we've got to have one fraction so even though it's nasty we're gonna have to get a common denominator this already has on V and V which is by simplified this needs it so it's just a matter of multiplying by V so let's think about that this should be V squared over V so negative B squared over V we're basically just taking this and multiplying by V over V so negative V squared over V minus one over me plus square root of b squared plus 1 over v let's put all of that on one fraction so X DV DX it's gigantic fraction all over thee then on the numerator we have negative B squared minus 1 plus square root of b squared plus 1 I'm gonna write that just slightly differently before we start making this into the separation of variables idea I'm gonna write my square root first and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to write V squared minus 1 but I'm gonna factor out the negative and here's why I'm doing that if I have V squared plus 1 and I can make this look like v squared plus 1 by the factor not a negative maybe a substitution will work when we integrate so the factor the negative it's changing to be square plus one if you distribute you see minus B squared minus one same thing that looks crazy let's go ahead let's separate the variables it's put these on one side so we know about reciprocal we know about the DV we know about dividing by X we know about moving over our DX let's pause for just a minute that's gonna be yep can you do homogenius yep let's see take a lot of work so divide everything by line notice on the Y over actually gotta have that en our Y over X make a square root simplify okay we can do that do our substitution as soon as you have Liza wretches make those all these make this into X DV DX plus mu okay got that but we know that we need to get all of our piece together simplify your French and get a comment another simplify our square root move over our V okay we can do that make one fraction you comment on that we can do that let's make another form where maybe the inside of our square root is the same as something else that helps us with a substitution and now we're ready for an integral so when we integrate both sides right side super piece of cake easy left side you might be struggling with that one for a while because you go hi man I'd love to do a substitution but especially generally this thank you you imagine like if you had that you know what's my substitution night I don't know what that is but if you structure it like this you know what's my substitution I don't know but maybe I try the thing that's the same maybe I tried doing u equals B squared plus one well the derivative would be two VD bye / - at least I have this piece and what that would change - is well let's see an integral of square root of U that's a bug list you never square root of U - you because they're both the same thing and that was what that one I keys here is like what else was do if those are the same call them both you on the numerator you only get one because that V DV is all wrapped up in D u / - now I'm going to take just a moment because this is also not a basic integral so you can't just separate those fractions so I'm gonna take a self to the side I'm going to do the integration I'm going to show you exactly how to do it and then we'll go through and and every do this so what could we do maybe we factor out the square root of you see if that helps us there's probably another thing 'king of another way to do it right now that might be okay also but I don't want to go through it with your both ways so I'm gonna factor out the time and force it to factor out square root of u so notice what we have here if we factor out the square root of u we're going to get square root of u times one get to square u square root of u times fur do you give us back you and then we have a 1/2 and float that out front I'll be start with Milnes now at this point we're going to need another substitution so if we do that pick a different variable like W let's call W equal to u to the one-half well if we do that when we take a derivative we bring down the exponent we have U to the negative 1/2 so 1/2 u to the negative 1/2 let's solve for that DUI well let's solve for D u let's do it that way so if we do that x to do you see it DC that is this is in our integral right there here's the one overskirt of you here's the D you this whole piece is right there so when we do this substitution if we get the one half we get the one we get the this is no longer there this this and this is all wrapped up in 2d W what we have is oh you know what let me change it to produce - sorry one with one things let's do that let's change it to that because all it would happen is negative negative negative negative and then we'd wrap this whole thing up as just a W so let's say W is this whole piece that look that works even better then we take a derivative of that we go okay well it's still it's the ones gone that's fantastic so it's still negative one-half this U to the negative one-half power so we'd have u to the one-half we bring that down negative one half subtract one we got it we're still solving for that D u over one half power so multiply by negative two we got that u / sort of 1 over u the one half D you know problem that's still negative to DW is 1 over square root of u that's here right there it's just now we have over W and that's fantastic so that's pretty cool because now we see that our twos are gone if we get negative integral 1 over W DW that equals negative now an absolute value W that's just the left side and then we're gonna have to go back and reset the two so I'm going to erase part of this board I'm going to come back and do that just a little recap that we had here try to make these the same that way your substitution works ok so we got that we can do our substitution when we get down to here factor because then if we call this a different variant of another substitution if this is W derivative of 1 is 0 derivative of this is negative 1 now 2 to the negative 1/2 that's negative 2 DW equals 1 over you've the 1/2 this is whatever you the 1/2 let me just put our negative 2 up there I'm gonna come back and do the rest of it just just a minute so I'm gonna race a bit a bit of the board we're about doing on this crazy thing so we have erased most of it where we started we've already gone and gone through that so now we got down to the very end we thought man this this integral looks nuts let's make it so that we can do one substitution but that led to uh well be forced to sing the factor we can do another substitution choose this to be W derivative of W gives you negative 1/2 of U to the negative 1/2 let's solve that for this negative 2 DW equals 1 over the square root of u 2 u 1 of the square root of u D u this piece is negative 2 DW no problem this whole thing was called W we got the negative 2 O to cancel to get negative integral 1 over W DW and we know that that equals negative Ln absolute value W so right hand side super easy Ln X plus C but now we've got to go back so W was 1 minus the square root of U let's do that so w1 my square root of you got that but view you was V squared plus one let's put that in there now before we start going and plugging in for V let's get as close to solving for V as we can one thing we might want to do is remove that negative so multiply everything by negative here let's call that C sub 1 because we're certainly gonna be changing that when we do these as Exponential's other thing we might want to do before we get there maybe move this negative up here so element absolute value 1 minus square root of b squared plus 1 and that's a guy equals Ln of well X to the negative 1 power of the absolute value of 1 over X minus C sub 1 now let's take both of these as exponents on e remember we do with those exponents if they're added or subtracted they came from common bases being multiplied so we can look at this as absolute value of 1 minus square root of e squared plus 1 right hand side would be 1 over X times not - times e to the negative C sub one now let's wrap up the absolute values in the plus and minus so let's drop the absolute value get 1 minus square root of b squared plus 1 equals plus or minus e to the negative C sub 1 times 1 over X let's call this thing C it is a constant it's an arbitrary constant so 1 minus square root of b squared plus 1 on the homestretch here C over X what we do from there the only thing that you really have to do is substitute in for your V you got to have Y square root of x squared here so let's try that if we do we might want to simplify this we've seen this a few times now let's get a common denominator so 1 is x squared over x squared so Y squared over x squared plus x squared over x squared that gives us Y square plus x squared over x squared that equals C over X and then because that's in a square root because the denominator is a perfect power of all perfect squares x squared we can simplify the denominator so 1 minus square root of Y squared plus x squared all over maximum be some elaborate doing that is because when we multiply both sides by X well we can simplify and we can get this whole distribute X minus if you distribute this that X can cancel square root of Y squared or plus x squared equals C and that's about the best that we can do on that one so from here simplify your French just some algebra multiply both sides by X this X going this X go on this is multiplied by X that's about it that's a nasty problem so that's about as much as I can show you on that one what we're gonna do this we're gonna do one less problem it's gonna involve some some partial fractions I want to give that to you and then we'll call it good let's wrap up this video with one last example one that involves a lot of different algebra techniques and Gration techniques not so much as far as it's in it so we're going to show that this is a homogeneous equation whenever the proper form we're gonna make our substitution we're going to see some special integration so some things that we sometimes forget about so number one differential equation yeah normal stuff not really let's try homogeneous let's divide both sides by x squared minus y squared let's get the dy dy DX by itself now with our goal to be achieving this Y over X look for every single term of Y we're gonna need to divide by something so both the numerator denominator but let's make something smart so instead of dividing by something random like x times y or something like that let's divide everything by something that will not only get rid of not only putting Y over X but also get rid of all the x's like next to those those Y's so something kind of nice otherwise we mess around with simplifying these things so instead of just dividing everything by x times y which is what this is to try to get that to to be 2/1 and getting everything down here let's divide everything by x squared if we divide everything by x squared and this is what's really driving this if I want Y over X I have Y squared let's divide by x squared to get Y over x quantity squared so look at it here and doing that what's nice about it is that when we divide everything by x squared well we end up getting two XY over x squared all over x squared over x squared minus y squared over x squared and lots of nice things simplify on the numerator we get just two and then ok we get that X x squared simplify we just get Y over X I love that that's already the form that I want to put in parentheses I don't know that's gonna be V on the denominator x squared of x squared is 1 that's perfect y squared over x squared is y over 1 over x quantity squared that's exactly what we're looking for so by putting this in the proper form of solving for D by DX we just pick some nice thing some nice divisor that we can put in there to simplify parts of our terms to get this Y or X however we can do that now we're ready now we're ready to say let's let V equal Y over X Y therefore equals V X and dy DX is x times DV DX plus B let's change us that's substitute let's make this equal to this let's do every Y over x equals to V so we're going to get this X DV DX plus V equals on the right hand side we've got two V and not to me well I'm minus B squared um what's the next step do you think well I would probably just subtract V and now I'm gonna try to do separable equations here so one game IVs all group together so if we do that we get X DV DX on the right hand side 2 V over 1 minus B squared but then we have this minus V okay well probably going to want to make a common denominator so that will give us X DV DX then we got this to be I'm never going to distribute that until I make one fraction I do not want to mess up those signs okay I'm gonna do I'm gonna distribute now so - V - V Plus V to the third power to be guide minus V got it plus b cubed all over one minus B squared I'm gonna combine some like terms I don't have any other X cube sorry beacuse but I do have another V so V cubed plus 2 V - V is one being over the other thing I'm gonna do I don't like the way that that denominator looks so I'm gonna factor out a negative so if I do that I'm gonna get negative 1 plus B squared or B squared - 1 the reason why is our game accrual is gonna work a little bit better that way I always like to put things in order with the first term positive we can it makes things a little bit nicer and now we have it we've got this fraction that includes all of our B's this term X we now can separate our equations there's separate variables so on the left hand side we have a reciprocal what we got v squared - 1 we've got a v cubed + b we've got a DV on the right hand side we keep our constants or our signs we have 1 over X DX man-ho that's making sense you reciprocate keep our sign over here keep our 1 over X give it that over there get our DX over there keep our DV now we're ready to do an integral well we're gonna rewrite this a little bit here's the reason why we're gonna do that let me take a look at this and go how in the world am I going to do that let's run it through does it look like you can just separate the fractions no because your denominator has two terms does it look like we can do a basic substitution you kind of want to don't you you want to say hey use this but then you get three u squared plus one that's no way we can match that up so not that can you do tricks oh no really can you do a double substitution doesn't look like it either when you get something like this and none of those are the techniques work this is where you're gonna want to use partial fractions so we're gonna explore that for a little bit so partial fractions say you need to factor your denominator that's what it's all about some factor your denominator if we factor out me our GCF they'll be factored out BT we have V squared minus one over V times V squared plus one we are gonna make these partial fractions so here's how that looks if you don't remember that so this is a big thing for us happens quite a bit and count two happens here not as often but occasionally it's all about the set up with these partial fractions was here's what you need to know on your denominator you're gonna factor everything now all polynomials can be factored into linear or irreducible quadratic factors for every linear there's a power one you're going to get a constant over the linear so it's always one less degree on the numerator so for this me you're going to create a fraction for every factor factors equal fractions so we have two factors maybe we got a V squared plus one those go on the two denominators no problem it is we're kind of undoing the idea of a common tract common denominator so we're gonna kind of use that in just a bit to break these up so whatever your factor is look at your degree if your degree is one your numerator has to be one degree less than that well what's a degree less than one zero that's no X's there's no V's that's a constant look at your irreducible quadratic you can't factor anymore so irreducible code for quadratic has power - well what's one less than R to power one power one X to the first power oh that's a linear partial fractions work you go ahead you need a factor denominator make a fraction for every factor look at your degree your numerator is one degree less than that so for linear you need constants I already have irreducible quadratics you get Linear's however many you have now the idea is you need a common denominator so if I could make these denominators equal to this denominator my numerators will have to be equal what that comes down to is since these don't share common factors I know that my common denominator would take 8 times this denominator B squared was one of these for this one BX plus C times this denominator V over V that would give me the common denominator I'm looking for so most of the time we just see it this way but the reason why it works is because what you're really doing in practice is you're creating a common denominator on these two fractions and you're saying hey since this denominator any times V squared + 1 or V times of each of us 1 plus BX plus C times B over B times B squared plus 1 since you have the common denominator here if these if this is an equation and your denominators are the same notice how on this numerator you get this thing on this numerator you'd get this thing by common denominator if your denominators are equal a fraction your numerators have to go on a fraction also so we say ok just as equal this is like that hey do partial fractions cut to this is what you have why because you're just making a common denominator that's it now let's use some of our logic here so if we were to distribute this you know what I made a mistake I'm sorry I'm so used to X's you probably heard me say X subconsciously it should be these that this should be obvious at this point so yeah V squared plus one the V plus C over V squared plus one I'm sorry about the ex probably gonna happen so multiply B squared plus 1 multiply being sure our numerators are now equal so this numerator with a times common denominator be V Plus C common denominator and now when we distribute now when we distribute we have a B squared plus pay okay be V squared + C V let's group these things together so I know that V squared minus 1 I have a V squared plus B squared if i factor out the V squared from that then these two terms make a plus B B squared plus C V Plus a and match that up with the terms over here so this is an equation this is the only possible thing they could give you B squared that means that a plus B has to equal your coefficient here that's all determines B squared so a plus B it has to equal one this is the only term that has to be there are no terms of have V so C can't be any number of a zero a is the only constant negative ones the only constant so a has to be negative one but you know that then that tracking negative one plus B would have equal one - so we've gone ahead and said all right so that integral now changes to this pair of fractions so instead of having d squared minus 1 over B times V squared plus 1 we know that this is going to be a over B so negative 1 over B that's our a over B plus sign BV so - V plus C plus C is 0 that's fantastic over B squared plus 1 over B negative 1 over V be B plus C over B squared plus 1/2 V plus 0 over B squared plus 1 I'm gonna race this side we're gonna come back over here we're going to finish that up and wrong some other problem that was kind of the biggest main idea here is that partial fractions are still in play I'm careful with them alright so coming back to finish off our problem now that we had our partial fractions we've determined that this integrals separates into two fractions now we just have these two different integrals here pretty basic negative Ln absolute value of E we can do that this guy over here well that's a u sub so the derivative of v squared plus 1 is 2 means we know that we can do that so let's do it pretty quickly that's invest nice I mean that's just straight-up exactly what we got right there so V squared plus 1 equals to V DV that means that we have well the integral of negative 1 over V DV plus the integral of this is all wrapped up in one we have u D you because 2v DV is to you that's nice on the right-hand side let's just leave that integral for just a moment longer than we do them all the same time so right here we're gonna have negative Ln absolute value V done plus Ln absolute value you will come back and substitute that for V in a moment equals negative Ln absolute value of X got it plus c1 because we're probably gonna have some exponential up here let's go ahead we know that U is V squared plus one I'm gonna drop the absolute value since that's always positive anyway now let's start working on some other things let's um you know what since there's two negatives here let's just multiply everything by negative let's also use some of our techniques of logarithms since we have logarithm minus logarithm we can combine those as natural log of that fraction [Music] now let's do the exponential soap well take both of these are the power of you've done this many times before we're gonna get the V over V squared plus 1 equals e to the Ln absolute value of x is absolutely of X but we'll get times e to the negative C sub 1 X course being added or subtracted comes from common basis being multiplied let's wrap up the absolute value in a plus registration breath up the x value no plus or minus e to the negative C sub 1 times X that's C Wow almost done there's only one more thing we've got to do we've got to change our V back into Y over X so every place we see V we get Y over X just like every place we saw wire X we got a B so we get this complex fraction if you've ever had an intermediate algebra class you like why in the world do we never deal with complex fractions I don't even said it just like that then maybe right there because it happens quite a bit so let's multiply everything by the common denominator both sides both top and bottom everything by the LCD of x squared so we multiply by I'm sorry on this side my top and bottom by x squared not that not the right hand side of the spoke there so on the top we're going to get this x squared over X that's going to simplify that's going to give us x times y on the denominator remember that this distributes so when we distribute we'll get y squared plus x squared equals C times X Oh what else do I want to do oh that's nice look at this if we consider this to be not next time well alright again not next times y of x times y over y squared plus x squared if X is not equal to 0 we can divide both sides by X or think about it I multiply X to the negative one and then last thing let's just multiply both sides by y squared plus x squared that's about as pretty as we can make it so gear were divided by X that's gone provided X is not 0 and then we're going to go so that's it that's that's how to solve these homogeneous equations we always make sure that we have Y over X we always change that into V for every instance of Y all the Y's have to be revved up we always solve for y for a derivative and then dy/dx is always the same thing then we're trying to usually make these an acceptable equation some of our other techniques deal with linear which is why I had to kind of think that is it separable is it linear is it basic integration because other techniques we'll go more towards those ideas like linear and and basic integration so we'll see that in other videos right now I hope I've done a good job of explaining how to work with these homogeneous equations and why it works with our substitution technique so I'll see you for a couple of the videos we have several more substitution techniques to learn so exciting times everything we learn makes it a little bit nicer to deal with differential equations okay back to domain and I just want you thinking about some issues that's happening when you are making these differential equations fit the technique you're trying to and so I'm always going to try to put this back in your head for you so let's look back at some examples these were meant almost all of the examples that we just did in this video but let's look back at what happened when we tried to put these into proper form for a homogeneous equation number one well if you're gonna divide by something that's they cannot be 0 so when you're dividing by X plus y we go ok then X plus y put the condition somewhere in your problem that says when I'm doing this to make this fit because I have to I'm understanding I'm doing this with the condition that X plus y cannot be equal to 0 this is saying I gotta do it solve it but I can't let this happen because that that would break over to me we'd have something that's undefined this can't happen so is it okay to put conditions on your domain when you're solving these yes because we have to in order to use this this certain technique so whatever you're doing to modify your original differential equation if you're dividing my variables just make sure those that expression that you're dividing by cannot equal 0 now furthermore because we're trying to make this homogeneous at some point we're going to be dividing by X so that X also can't equal 0 just be careful of those things when you're when you're going through these maybe you can look at the next few examples and just quickly identify what's what's going on so down here yeah we're we're dividing look at your denominator just make sure every factor cannot equal 0 X can't equal 0 X plus y again can't equal 0 so when you're seeing a lot of these restrictions like what is coming from those are those are coming from two two places typically number one is that you have your modifying your differential equation to make it that some technique here it's homogeneous and so we're dividing and then we're also dividing something by X and so that that X can never be 0 with linear we were also doing something with an integrating factor so that that came about as well as far as a domain restriction how about the next one Matt we don't have to do anything to see what's going to happen here you look right there at that fraction you go hey X can't be 0 and by defining that you get 2 divided by x squared without any additional constrict restrictions because you already did that so that that's the idea just be thinking through if I'm dividing if I have fractions my tan there cannot be zero for this homogeneous equations we we're not super concerned about being greater than zero because of some reason they explained in the last video that well with your homogeneous they're always separable we're typically getting an e to a C and we can put the plus and minus from the absolute value in front wrap the L open a big constant or what we can do is is notice that the absolute values oftentimes contained in another function that we wouldn't be able to simplify or combine our X's with anyhow so we're not very much worried about that like we were linear this over the last less three you're obviously going to be divided by X Y so neither X or Y can equal zero by the zero product property if either one of those a zero the denominator zero so just show those restrictions or just when we're modifying our differential equations sometimes we're doing things that could cause us problems if we're not saying what we can't have it's a weird way to say but you're going yeah I obviously obviously can't can't have X or Y be 0 and and for the reason that this is obvious to a lot of people some some books a lot of them and some teachers a lot of them don't even talk about it because that frankly they are a little obvious when you but you need to see them for one time for them to be obvious to you go ok any sense I can 0 okay that makes sense I can 0 here now we should always write that and it's a it's kind of a failing of our textbooks and some of these teachers have been and myself because I was focused only on on the technique at first I did that for a reason I wanted you to master the technique get that in your head and then realize that this stuff is happening when we master the technique first then we can go through and get the finer points otherwise we would try to get the finer points as we're learning a technique for a lot of students not everybody but for a lot of students that's hard because it feels like the lectures being broken up and so we match their technique but these things are also important we need to understand that when we modify a differential equation that some problems can be occurring in the domain we had to show that those problems are why don't you look at the last two and see what you do with that obviously we're dividing dividing x squared minus y squared what's that what can't that be Chile is that lastly because we're gonna be dividing everything by x squared next like we did in that example okay well if x squared can't equal 0 X can't equal 0 and so we're showing the conditions that we need in order to use our technique it's all we're doing okay last one I say this one for less because this is interesting it's it's kind of it's really clear to most people that well I mean you're divided by y y can't equal 0 if I need the homogeneous form of this then when I reciprocate this to get my negative exponent X can't equal 0 but why in the world would they have y greater than 0 and as for what you have to do to simplify this so right down here man toughest and calc align remember it vividly because it's in limits and when I when I'm teaching it it's really kind of awkward because you need to look at why are your limits going and then say can I just write y equals the square root of Y squared yes and no yes that's true but because that square takes any negative why's it makes them positive we have to look back at what the definition of the square root of Y squared is really within even radical when you match a power root and you simplify it that radicals even you actually get this you get the absolute value of y that's the definition of the square root of Y squared you're going to get the absolute value of y so it depends on what Y is now obviously that's going to be positive no matter what but we have to show that Y is greater than 0 in order to avoid the absolute value and back in limits it was this ok well where are we going to positive infinity or negative infinity and that let me choose whether we would have positive Y or negative Y there and that that was the whole the whole case so thinking okay I need this to be in that square room I gotta have a square root around let's just make it square root Y squared great but to avoid the absolute value are you guys understanding like the kind of theme here to avoid the absolute value just like in linear to avoid the absolute value just like we did with the integrating factor to avoid the absolute value man just do this make it greater than zero then you're dividing by something that's not zero and when you're using these techniques simplify what are using techniques for the integrating factor you're avoiding the absolute value saves a lot of headache later with simplifying everything else because some of our wise would have an absolute value if we did do that and some of our wise wouldn't that would be in the scene so I hope that you're understanding that that we when we're doing these things were we're restricting some of our domains just to make our technique work there's only one more video I'm going to do this on for a while so hopefully this is helping you understand some of the finer points so when we're going through this you 

Transcript for: Solving Differential Equations with a Composition (Obvious) Substitution (Differential Equations 22)
hey welcome to another video in this video we're going to continue talking about how to solve differential equations with usually separation of variables or our linear differential equation techniques but involve some substitutions so we're gonna we're gonna do that with something that that we like to call obvious substitutions and the first thing I want to say is that obvious does not always really mean obvious so kind of like in a textbook you read through it and say the rest of the prim is obvious you go that that's that's not obvious to me at least so I'm gonna show you what to look for when we deal with these other substitutions so this class of of equations differential equations might not perfectly fit homogeneous model or Bernoulli or a embedded derivative but maybe it's an obvious substitution so I'm going to show you what that means I'm going to show you three examples on how to approach these and hopefully that'll that'll make sense to you so if you remember our goal with substitutions it's put it in a proper form use some sort of a substitution to change it into either a separable equation or a linear equation and then we can use the techniques we've already learned or a basic integral so let's look at these obvious substitutions find out what they mean and then do a few examples so sometimes we can get some substitutions that are obvious here's what you're looking for here's what obvious means obvious means that what you're going to substitute is typically a composition so look in your differential equation for a composition what a composition means is you have one function inside of another form of a function and we're going to look at that right there in just a bit so you're looking for a composition like in this case well hey you have four X plus y inside this other function of something squared that's a composition of functions we're going to identify that as some V I wanted to tell you right now that this technique is very very very similar to the homogeneous equations that we just learned how to do so in that we made a certain type of substitution we did Y over X so okay that's going to be V every single time and then if we do that we'll solve for y every single time that we'll take a derivative every single time and it'll be the same every single time this is very similar only this time the derivative isn't always the same what you're substituting is always the same what you're substituting is just a composition just like homogeneous equations that was a composition that was Y over X and we changed that into B that would have been a composition something inside of another function so we chose a basic composition here we're doing the same thing it's just we're not always choosing Y over X we're choosing some composition and hoping that it works so we're gonna be looking for a composition something that you can solve for y why is that important well if we choose a composition and say that let's let's find a composition let's call it V okay if we solve that for y no problem then when we take a derivative we can make this I same idea homogeneous this double substitution idea call your composition V then if you take a derivative after solving for y you have something you can replace dydx with because you can't have that Y anymore so right our main idea very similar homogeneous you're looking for a composition we're solving for y we're gonna replace all of the Y's from the composition and the dydx by the derivative so just like homogeneous you can't have any wise left over let's see how that works we'll run through a few of them and then we'll call it good so let's take a look at this first order differential equation we're looking at and we're going to allow that that isn't separation of variables I really don't want to distribute anything doesn't look homogeneous or if it is it take a long time to get there it doesn't look linear I've got a power to so what in the world could I do here this is one of those cases when we have a composition of functions that wraps up all of our wise that's big all of the Y's inside that composition that's right here so that for X plus y we can consider that to be a composition so one of these obvious substitution technique or this obvious substitution technique says take that composition where we have a function of x and y or just a function of Y whatever it is inside something that's raised to a power or this grouped all together or that you can call it V let's try that so we're going to take our compositions say let's call that me why not one more time but that's exactly what you did with homogeneous it's just that the composition was always the same the composition was always Y over X then we solved for y we just said y equals VX well if it's time if we pick a composition that we can solve for y let's solve it for Y and the reason being is that we're about to change our differential equation sure everything that involves y's here is going to be called V and that's fine but also we need to change that Y so when we did homogeneous we said we've got to have all the Y's wrapped up in that V we also need a way to change dy DX into DV DX and that's exactly what this is gonna do for us so we've wrapped up our Y's in a composition no problem we have solved for y that's why this stuff is important we gotta have something softer Y and then we're gonna take a derivative so dy DX equals one big note you might want to write down before at least realize right here this is always going to involve a chain rule just like when we solved those homogeneous equations what I mean by the chain rule is that right there that's a function of X or Y so when we take this with respect to X so we're taking a derivative of Y with respect X well we have the derivative of B is 1 sure but there's a hidden function in there possibly so we're gonna have the derivative of e is 1 times DV DX because it's an implicit derivative just like from calc 1 we typically don't even write the 1 we just realize that that's a chain rule we're gonna write DV DX minus 4 because we're taking a derivative with respect to X we don't need to write DX DX that's just 1 so we don't really care about that so we're gonna make this substitution and now we have everything lined out really like homogeneous it's just it's not always Y over X so we're gonna start changing this we know that we called this inside function this for X plus y we're going to call that part of V so we're gonna get a V squared but because we wrapped up all the whys in that substitution we also needed to get rid of dy/dx all right that's why you pick something we can solve for y because if we can solve this substitution for y then we can take a derivative rap of that and get dy/dx equals some function in these and X's so we're going to make our substitution on the right hand side this part is V so we'll get V squared on the left hand side we also needed to replace dy/dx and it's right here so dy/dx says don't write dy DX I don't want dy DX because I have three variables right now and I can't integrate like that I can't solve like that so so instead of dy/dx let's use our second part of the substitution one substitution for the composition another substitution for the dy/dx in this case we had DV DX minus four now what's gonna happen just like on the homogeneous equations is you're going to get something that's that's a separable equation so we're gonna try to group our variables are these DV on the left are X's or constants DX on the right so if you notice that from homogeneous we were always getting the separable equations we were always separate or variables and integrating same thing is gonna happen here so one more time all the way through and then after this I'm not gonna really repeat that a whole bunch I probably will because I'm Leonard Leonard does that but the idea is look for a composition if we can't make it into a homogeneous look for a composition you solve for y no problem solving for y take a derivative and do a double substitution all the Y's have to be wrapped up in your B it has to be wrapped up in here otherwise we'd have three variables that does not work so wrap this up in a V no problem take a derivative of Y when you that's why we had to solve for y and then we can replace all of our Y terms with some sort of E and our dy/dx with whatever the derivative of your substitution when you solve for y actually is so let's take a look at that if these are going to be separable if these are going to be separable we're gonna have to add the four and divide remember separable equations are stuff that's multiplied together not added or subtracted so we're trying to get separable here alright hey you know what if I move this whole piece divide both sides by B squared plus four we can get 1 over V squared plus 4 DB equals 1 DX or just Y X and now that's great that that's the form of separable equation we've made this so we have these DV made this so that we have constants D X if we integrate both sides right sides easy right so it's going to be X plus C on the left hand side and you can do that a number well at least two ways I know of you can do that with the trig sub if you want to take a lot of time or you can do with an integration table at this point your math careers there's nothing wrong with these an integration table that's okay I would do it for sure when you think about this is it at an inverse if that was one you'd get tan inverse of just V so tan inverse would be when that number is not one you start doing stuff like this okay well I know it's gonna be tan inverse of V that would be if this number were one but you can think of it like this this is really a fraction with the square root right there so you go alright tan inverse if that was one then d square root of one both places if that was four then be square root of four both places so on the left hand side we do have 10 inverse that should look really really familiar with you we've done it several times even in this class we've done that but here it since it's not one usually you'd get one over the square root of one if this had been B squared plus one that's what you get but now it's one over before no problem that had to say 1/2 it gives us a tan inverse still it gives us V over 2 and then on the right hand side we just have this X plus c1 let me call that C sub 1 just because we might be changing it as a matter of fact we're going to right now we're going to multiply both sides by 2 just get rid of it I don't see anything else I'm going to multiply before I start doing the the tangent on both sides so I'm gonna call that M are we to find that we're gonna find 2 C sub 1 let's just call this C it's still a constant so no problem now you'll notice something this I did this a lot on the homogeneous equations also I've solved it as much as I could for V where it was reasonable and then I substituted back in that substitution we're gonna do the same thing so yeah we call the composition to be ya we solve for y because we need 2 ydx we'd find dy/dx we make ur substitution so all of our wise becomes some sort of V our dy/dx becomes some derivative that you just did from that substitution and then you solve it with the separable equation okay we got it we go all the way down to here well we're gonna have to get back to y's and x's those of these gotta go so we use a substitution one time to get away from wise we use it again to get back to wise so we're gonna have to do that but then we can do it anywhere you want but I like to do it as much as possible after I solve for V if that's reasonable to do so let's try to solve for V so right now I'm going to do tangent on both sides of tan inverse of V over 2 equals 2x plus C then V over 2 has to be tangent of 2x plus C you know what I can even multiply by 2 so V equals to tangent 2x plus C but now we're writing I mean obviously have suffered for V well we've got to solve for y and so let's go ahead we use the substitution one time a for X plus y to get away from why it's called V now we're going to say V is for X plus y are you seeing why we might want to wait to plug that in to wait to solve for B if we can't to plug that in I'd done it I did a lot on the homogeneous just as wait for a little bit let's solve it for me as much as we can it's reasonable and then plug it in because if we start putting it we could I mean we could have done it right there and right there right there right there but that's just a lot of extra writing that we really don't need so if we wait for a little while sometimes it's a lot nicer to deal with because right now instead of writing this whole time all you're going to do is subtract 4x and we've solved for y explicitly so we get this y equals two tangent 2x plus C minus 4x what I want you to ask yourself right now are you seeing that this is really similar to the idea of homogeneous you are making a substitution it's actually still a composition just like homogeneous was you're still solving for y you're still taking a derivative you're still using dy/dx as a substitution and you're still using the idea of wrap up all of your Y's in a V then make a separable equation and solve it it's pretty straightforward this word obvious is deceiving it does not have ahem sometimes they're not that obvious but what you're looking for you're looking for some sort of a function like a square root or something to a power or a denominator or something that you can take all of the pieces sorry that the inside has all of your wise call that V something you can solve for y and then this hopefully will work for it it's something that you should try we're going to do two more examples we're going increase the difficulty last one has some integration techniques that I want to show you adjust and remember we're gonna sort of refresh your memory on these things as we go let's try another one so we're looking at this we're trying to figure out if it's something that we can do directly with a basic technique something we can substitute homogeneous or something that we can do another substitution for so when we take a take a look at that differential equation it doesn't strike right off the bat something that's separable X's and Y's are grouped together and that factor doesn't look linear because if I start distributing I have dy/dx in both places that wouldn't work that great it doesn't look home ingenious because I don't want to start dividing by X's and Y's maybe I could but maybe there's an easier way so when we have this idea of what I'm trying to do is just getting way too hard like homogeneous might not be the best thing to do here maybe it would work I don't know but maybe there's an easier way and one of the obvious substitutions is look at your wise if your Y's are in some sort of a another function even if they're just a factor that contains everything try to one of these obvious substitutions so our Y is together with our X so X plus y sure but it's all wrapped up in one factor that's a composition right there that has all of our wise in it that's why I'm asking you to look for right now let's do a substitution let's call V equal to X plus y let's see what happens hey that's a good thing that mean that's something that we can solve for y and that's important why that's important you should know right now why it's important is because we need to do two things here we're gonna wrap up that composition as V otherwise have to be there but then we also have to change our dy/dx which means you're gonna have to solve for y to do that so we looked at it said doesn't look familiar to me that has all of our wise in it that is a composition let's call that V let's solve for y we know that we're going to replace this with me but we also have to replace dy/dx so let's find dy/dx so Y we solve for y so we do this writing here we know that we're gonna have a chain rule implicitly on V minus one because a derivative of X with respect to X is one and now we're ready for our substitution so we realize that this will be V so X plus y gives us V so right now V we're not gonna have to do Y the X anymore in fact we found that regular we're going to have DV DX minus 1 and then equals 1 so the substitutions can look at confusing if you're not getting it so I'm going to slow right now just so it makes sense where these things are coming from because this whole thing is going to change drastically the only thing it's gonna be here is 1 that's the only thing that that's from the original difference equation so right hand side we've got one left hand side we're gonna call this part V we're gonna call it dy/dx exactly what we found when we took the derivative of our substitution DV DX minus 1 also you don't get to just assume this is V times just DV DX the dy/dx is this whole expression you need parentheses there so let's try to let's try to go on when we made our substitutions we know that all this stuff is DVD X's and B's and exits there's no lies up there and that's what we want so we know that we're trying to get a separable equation let's try to make a separable equation out of this let's divide by V at least that way we've got DV DX minus 1 with no B's over there so remember if we're trying to get separable equations to separate our variables we need to first group everything together as a product or a quotient and that -1 screws us up right now and we can't just add it that's why it was important for you see the parentheses that it's all multiplied together so you either distribute that probably not a good idea well you could do that then you would add the V or sort of subtract the V divided by V that's that's fine too you can easily do but here I chose to divide by V I'm trying to get everything together as a product or a quotient that right there is not a product or quotient because I'm trying to get a separable equation so let's add one that's still not a product or quotient let's find a common denominator we know that 1 over V plus 1 is the same thing as 1 of the V Plus V over V V over V is 1 or we now have a quotient that's what we're looking for when you try to separate our variables we're looking for a D whatever d x equals some sort of product or quotient because then we can just multiply or divide to group our B's TVs in this case on one side our X's DX's with our constants on the other side so we're going to multiply by the reciprocal here or you think divided by X plus 1 multiplied by X however you want to think about it we need rvs on the left you know DX on the right that looks really well doesn't look great but it looks like something we can do so we have integral of V over V plus 1 DV with integral of X balanced easy this one is well we might have to think about that a little bit it looks deceitful it looks deceivingly easy it's not necessarily that easy we could try a substitution but what are you gonna do with that V so u equals V plus 1 we could do there's a couple ways we can think about this one way that you could do this you could do u equals V plus 1 D u equals DV you know well that doesn't help me at all right but if you solve for v v equals u minus 1 then you can create this V is U minus 1 V plus 1 is just you and it would still be you and then you can separate this into two fractions you over u minus one over u that's one minus one over u that would be u minus Ln U and you can totally do that that's one way to go that's the substitution technique I prefer doing that so this is fine if you like that do it cool I wanted to this idea because I want to show you it's possible I use it a lot if I can so what we did is absolutely fine let's check this out one I just force this to me that separable fraction already I mean how they separate that I can't separate the V plus one yeah you're right but watch what you could do for could you just add and that work could you just add one well no could you add one and subtract one verify that that's still V on the numerator yeah but now it's kind of interesting because I can choose to group this as V plus 1 over B plus 1 minus 1 over V plus 1 is there really any difference in doing that besides a substitution no not really it might save you a step because you have the not that you don't have to substitutions you got to go back from you but this is gonna look and should look exactly the same as what I just erased from the board V plus 1 over V Plus Ones 1 minus 1 over B plus 1 that's that's nice that's just like 1 minus 1 over u oh my god U is even that V plus 1 it's the same thing so either way you want to go with that cool just want to show you this technique because it's saves you a little bit of time and it's kind of interesting and we use in other place is so integral of one well that's a V minus integral of one over V plus one that's Ln absolute value V plus one divided by the derivative of B plus one which would still be one so just Ln absolute value V plus one here we could be here we get Ln that's a baby plus one I drew that cool on the right hand side we get X plus C we're looking pretty good so far so let's see what else we can do and would that be easy to solve for V well if I start solving for V I'd have to add an L and on both sides or subtractive V and that's going to separate my fees I can't factor out a V hmm this is not one that I'm gonna want to solve explicitly so this is about as good as we can make it without going crazy and without getting these just everywhere so right here this would be an appropriate time to plug in our substitution again so we substitute one time to get away from wise into these and now we're gonna substitute another time to get away from these in back into wise so since we can't solve this effectively or efficiently for V we're gonna plug in our r.v right now so we use it one time to get away now we're gonna say hey if that V was X plus y now we can substitute that back so we replaced X plus five with V now we're gonna place a V with X plus y so here we get X plus y minus Ln absolute value X plus y plus one don't forget that about that plus one this V is X plus y plus one equals x plus C there's only one more thing we can do we have an X here we have an X here we can subtract X so if we subtract X we get Y minus Ln absolute value st. equals C that's about as good as we can get we can't really solve for y that efficiently here so we're gonna leave it implicit and that's a solution to our first-order differential equations I'm hoping that you're seeing this substitution technique I'm hoping you're seeing on it's a lot like homogeneous where we just had a composition but now that composition is not the same thing all the time it can be wherever you have all of your wive's wrapped up into something you can substitute and solve for y that way you replace that composition and dydx stick around for one more we have a kind of a longer problem here that we'll go through kind of fine has some different integration on new all different things that we can do with integration on it alright let's wrap this up with another problem like again this the first part of it we're gonna look at this as a composition we're gonna make a substitution I'm doing this problem so you see another integration issue that we were gonna have so last example on the the obvious substitutions and hopefully by this time they're looking a little more obvious to you okay I see what you talk about a composition here I see that you have a square root I see that you have something that incorporates all of our wise in there that you could just wrap up as a V and take it out and that's exactly what we're gonna do so when we take a look at this differential equation yeah this is the good you know it doesn't look separable X's and Y's are both under the same function that's the point of a composition it doesn't look linear same reason does it look like a homogeneous maybe but maybe there's something nicer maybe there's something that we can say you know what all of those X's and Y's all those Y's in particular are wrapped up inside of a composition let's make a substitution and just get rid of it all so if we look at our composition we can solve it for Y that's an important piece so if you make that substitution you also need to be able to get rid of that dydx let's call that whole inside that whole composition wannabe we can solve it for y let's do it so we can find dy/dx to substitute for the other side of our equation let's find dy/dx we always get a chain rule so DV DX minus 1 derivative of 1 is 0 so now we're ready for a substitution you should try it right now you should see if you can take this substitute the to appropriate pieces and figure out what we have so for us we have the square root we didn't substitute for that it's the composition the compose or the inside part that we're actually substituting so on the right hand side we're still gonna have a square root inside that square root we no longer have X plus y plus 1 we wrap all of that all in that composition into V on the left hand side we actually no longer have dy/dx we solved for y we took a derivative dy/dx is this piece let's do that now in your head what I want to build there I want to build that when you do these substitutions based on composition that includes homogeneous that includes substitutions that might seem obvious and one other one you're trying to get separable equations which means this thing got to go we're gonna have to add one so that we can separate our variables in trying to get those that separable equation those separable variables we need to group everything on one side that's important because well if you're if you're trying to get a separable equation you need stuff that's multiplied or divided and this right here would become its own factor you go well how's that a factor you can think of as multiplying by one but for a separable equation to work you need to be able to get all of your stuff that's multiply and divide it that way you multiply everybody get your variables on one side with V you're beat on one side with V excellent other side with X with pluses and minuses we can't do that so if you're gonna try to make a separable equation you need if there's any pluses or minuses they have to be inside one factor that right there is your is your one big factor so we're gonna divide both sides by the square root of v plus one DV and then equals DX that's pretty good that's that's exactly we want we want to be able to group all of our bees as on one side DV as a product next to DV and then we want or a quotient next to DV and we want products next to DX that way we can go ahead and integrate both sides on the right hand side that's nice on the left hand side that that's kind of nasty so let's walk through it and think about what the world we might want to do with that is it a basic integral no not really today I separate my fraction I can't do that either because with two terms of the denominator can I do a basic u sub not really because we don't have anything to get rid of that square root of E is it let's see treat sub you know the screw doesn't go the way across there's no power to in it's a problem they have partial fractions not in the square root maybe I could do like a double so and this is going to look a lot like the last example so let's do a substitution let's see what we have and see if we can re substitute from a factor of B that that gets in there that we don't want so let's try that so if we have u equals square root of v plus one well we need to find EU that's one-half V to the negative one half DV and let's solve this for R DV so we have 1 over 2 square root of B DV and if we multiply both sides we get 2 square root of v d u equals V V so well then doesn't look good that's not what I have here yeah that's that's true that that's not what I really want I don't want to screw to the in there but I'm gonna have one maybe we can use this to get rid of that square root of these so let's see what happens here we have our integral here we got a 1 that's not a problem on the denominator we called all of this you but then our DV so we said square root of V plus 1 that's you so we got that but we solved for DV so DV is not gonna be DV anymore it's me too square root of the D you I had a one here but since I replaced the DV with two scurvy D you we can put that in place of our 1 1 x 2 square root of e is to square root of e now we always know in integrals that your variables have to match up with your ingredient variable so that square root of YZ gotta go well that's what we use this substitution to different times we say well you equal square root V plus 1 then square root of e equals u minus 1 oh well then we take our 2 out and we say the square root of V is U minus 1 over u now that's something that we can separate into two different fractions and this looks identical to the last example that we did go this is this pretty nice u over u is 1 minus 1 over u that looks pretty good do you and you go ahead and we can integrate one one thing here when you integrate and you get you - Ln absolute value of U that 2 is so important that 2 is really important for us I know I'm knitting the right-hand side it's just the integral of DX so we're gonna get X plus C wheel we all know that but the two I want you to focus on you cannot just forget the two you can't just put the two right there it's gonna screw everything up for you alright that to said you're gonna multiply that 2 by whatever you got for your integral it's going to distribute so we know that this is U minus Ln absolute value u we know it came from a substitution let's put that back so square root of V plus 1 looking pretty good - Ln absolute value square root of e plus 1 equals on the right hand side all of this was just equal to integral DX and integral DX and integral DX so that means we're going to the X plus C sub 1 some of you might be wondering why I do see sometimes and why do C sub 1 I'm looking at and I'm thinking am I gonna have to modify that arbitrary constant if I don't I just could see if I do like either I divide or I add or subtract constants I'm going to be changing that so I'm looking ahead seeing whether I'm going to change it or not in this case I'm going to now man that looks that does not look easy to solve for V so I'm gonna do one thing I'm going to distribute the two and I want to show you something here some of you you might be getting answers you get this looks man it's so close but something's wrong why would I get an exact answer sometimes things like this happen so this this is fine this is fine but that too that's a constant and if you were to subtract that constant that's a constant - if you subtract a constant from a constant you're still gonna get a constant and since it's an arbitrary constant and we don't care what it is a lot of times people will do this and say that's a consequence of tracted this constant over here that's still a constant let's call it an arbitrary constant system doesn't matter imagine this Savior well this to the infinity in the other person says this to the infinity plus one you go that plus one doesn't do anything exactly if you don't care what constant this is subtracting two is not going to make a difference so we don't care what constant that is as long as it's constant this happens quite a bit so if you're getting answers that have you have constants and they don't probably they're adding or subtracting and grouping that as one arbitrary constant so we have our two we have our square root of the - two Ln absolute value square root of e plus one equals x plus C that is just nasty to solve for B if it's even possible it would be very difficult to do I don't want to start dividing my twos that would be still a constant but that laughs I'm not gonna do that I can't really solve four V's here so the only thing that's left for us to do is use our substitution that it gave us bees to get back or X's and Y's so and sure enough when we look at it hey bees inside a square root we started with that's our composition let's just put X plus y plus one that's what V was defined as and even though it's not explicitly solved for y that still counts that's fine that's an implicit solution to our differential equation kind of nasty but I'm hoping that you see open that you see what this obvious substitution technique can do it's very similar to homogeneous in that you have a composition that you're calling V in that composition you have formulas solved for Y in that composition it has to include all of your instances of Y when you solve for y you can substitute for not only composition but also for the dy/dx that's great so all B in terms of V and X then we want a separable equation so we group our variables on one side as factors or as fractions we separator these DVS on one side X's D X's on the other side this constant doesn't count as a constant that you'd want to leave here on the exercise because it's added and we that's not the constant we're talking about when I said I said constant factors can be left there well if we're talking about several equations you need factors stuff that's multiplied we're all pluses and minuses are in those parentheses then we go ahead and move that to the other side after we get several equations hopefully it's an integral that doesn't have to be easy but hopefully it's interval we can do and then if we can we try to re substitute for X's and Y's and solve for y if we can't then we just reach substitute for Nexus and Y's and we leave it that's a balance see that's about as good as we get unless I make some mistake then we get this as an implicit solution for a differential equation I hope this making sense I'll see you for the next video when we talk about Bernoulli equations you 

Transcript for: How to Solve Bernoulli Differential Equations (Differential Equations 23)
since we're studying substitution techniques to solve differential equations we may as well talk about Bernoulli equations because this is another substitute substitution technique and a marvelous one of that that's going to take care of solving some of these first-order differential equations that we can't otherwise solve and it's a really really cool idea so before what we've been talking about our substitution techniques that change homogeneous or like an obvious substitution that's a composition into something that we can use separable equations technique for now Bernoulli what this technique does what Bernoulli equation czar is a very specific form of a differential equation that when we do a substitution will change it not into something that's separable but something that is linear and here's how it works it's a really cool idea very fascinating that that this equation exists force and the substitution works but here's the idea if you have any differential equation where you have here's the key or you have I don't care what this is but you have Y to the first power and I don't care what this is but you have Y to some other power now why can't it be the same now if this isn't power 0 then this is 1 and you have something that's linear already if this is a power 1 then these two things can be factored the Y and the Y to the first then you have something that's separable so if this is 0 or 1 you either have linear or you have separable and this doesn't them this isn't batter but if n is any other power besides 0 or 1 you have something is called a Bernoulli equation so differential equation plus something that's Y to the first power and something that's why to a power greater than that those sorry power different than 0 or 1 don't have to be greater but a power that's not 0 or 1 so we're looking for two terms here we're looking for one term that has Y in it and another term that has Y to a power that's not 0 or 1 now here's the idea this is really cool if that's the case I think it's cool four times are you counting my cools that means that this is really cool if that's the case and we make this substitution B equals y to the 1 minus n here's what happens with these Bernoulli equation so we're looking at it we're going not separable not linear not a easy basic substitution oh wait I have one term with the Y the first one term of the Y naught to the 0 1 power let's make the substitution here's what happens with it when we make this substitution when we solve this for y we're gonna get some some factor that when we when we have this substitute of back into our padule-- equation it's going to make something that is linear it's going to eliminate these and a lot of places it's going to leave one B raised to the first power right there and everything else would be X's an awesome idea very very important for us to understand how to do these things if this is not something that we can do directly maybe renew the equation would work and what we're looking for is y is the first power Y to any other power and we're going to make this substitution v equals y to the 1 minus N and like every other substitution technique we've had we're going to solve this for y we're going to go ahead and take the derivative dy/dx we're gonna make a substitution for dy/dx we're going to make a substitution for y we're going to make a substitution for y to the nth power and then what we're gonna do is we're going to multiply to get rid of whatever pieces over here because you're gonna have one it's gonna be something DV DX and when we multiply by that piece that gets rid of it this is going to change to B to the first power and then it's gonna be linear and we use these in linear differential equations techniques to solve the rest of it let's look at one example let's go through it I'm gonna explain all of this again as we're going through because this was this is a little bit vague because you haven't seen it yet but this is this is how it works so let's firstly look at our differential equation we look at it we go hey does that anything that we can do with is that something can take a basic integral with no could I view it as separable yes you could you could divide both sides by y plus y to the third and get 1 over Y cubed plus y and you could factor out the Y and get Y times y squared plus 1 and you could use partial fractions and see where that leads you if it's possible cool maybe there's an easier way can you use a substitution technique well not a non-homogeneous there's I don't really wouldn't want to build any X's in there is it separable or linear it's closed is it Bernoulli can we try it Bernoulli and make this into a Bernoulli equation here's what Bernoulli looks for but really says look at your differential equation if you have one term with Y to the first power and one term with Y to not the first power that one that satisfies the Bernoulli equation here's what we want to do we're gonna try to structure this as a linear what linear meant is you want the dy/dx with the function that has Y to the first on one side you want everything else on the other side you know well that that's not linear exactly that's why we need a substitution so the substitution we're gonna make is going to create for us something that when we multiply both sides to get rid of a piece right over here it's going to create some the first power it's going to get rid of all of this all of these views on the right-hand side going to be gone and what that substitution is is always be to the notice our V equals y to the 1 minus whatever the other power happens to be in this case is 3 y to the 1 minus 3 you know okay well that's V equals y to the negative 2 power I'm going to pause right there I want to show you exactly what we're doing so we have something that is a Bernoulli equation if we have a derivative respectable X if we have Y to the first power notice how the on one site just like every linear ever this looks exactly like a linear right now but we have another function of X with otherwise this is what creates for us the Bernoulli equation rather than just a linear if I erase that that's a linear differential equation we can solve it we know techniques for that but with this you go well what am I supposed to do now get rid of that thing how do I get rid of that thing if we make a substitution V equals y to the 1 minus n if we solve that for y every substitution technique ever if we solve that for y and well that we've done before solving for y and take a derivative dy/dx to replace T with D by DX then what we're what we're gonna get is we're gonna get some function of V times DV DX we're gonna have this as a function of V we're gonna have this as a function of V to a power and when we go ahead and multiply it to get rid of the piece that's in front of DV DX it's going to cancel all this out it's going to create this as a difference of 1 what difference of 1 why do I want a difference of 1 so that I get V to the first power we're taking this making a simple substitution that's going to create something that's linear let's see how that works so Y the first power write it as linear Y to the third power leave it over here the N part the end part is this end so you okay what's my substitution let's do V equals y to the 1 minus 3y we're choosing this guy is because this is the piece that's causing the problems if that wasn't there that'd be linear to be easy but now we go I want to get rid of that how's it gonna work well since derivatives subtract 1 and we're multiplying both sides we're going to get rid of that difference of 1 for this piece and over here but it's gonna build a 2 e to the first power we're gonna see that right now so if we have V equals y to the 1 minus 3 that's V equals Y to the negative 2 if we solve that for y and probably easier way to do that now so y equals B to the negative 1/2 power so solving that for wife we need to remember how these substitutions work in general we need to remember that right here this multiply both sides by 1/2 power we need to remember that when we do a substitution we're wrapping up in this case it's not all of the Y's so that's different with the the substitution techniques that change in the separable equations we want to wrap up all of the Y's inner substitution here we don't because what we want is we want to be able to substitute the V in both places but then have this one change it to V to the first not just disappear completely but change them to be the first row in this one disappear this substitution does it so all of our substitutions to wrap up some lies in these solves for y and then takes a derivative so we can replace it basically two ideas all the stuff involving Y's and the dy/dx let's try that right now so when we take dy/dx we bring down the power subtract one and we get DV DX based on the chain rules this is implicit V was a function of X you're always going to have that hopefully this is familiar to you because you've done lots of substitutions right now so we look for our terms you said I wanted to be linear right in this linear oh I got another piece with Y to some power cool make your substitution that's now Bernoulli equation if the equals y2 that it's always this it's always 1 minus whatever that power it is and I want you to see what's gonna happen if we do 1 months what if that power is and we subtract and we solve for y think in your head right now why do we need to solve for y it should have bounced up out of that that we need to replace this along with our wives so we need to replace this as well so once you solve for y and take a derivative we can now replace dy/dx we can also replace every instance of Y so let's do that and be careful with it there's lots of things go so from here I'm gonna start with this guy so dy/dx I'm gonna replace it with this I'm not going to have dy/dx anymore I'm gonna have negative 1/2 of V to the negative three halves DV DX so dy no that garbage - - why no I'm not going to have Y anymore I have solved for Y right here I'm gonna replace this Y with the V to the one half well negative what happened equals and then I want to replace this Y with V to the negative one half as well let's pause for a moment kisses is typically where students get lost go wow that's a lot of stuff this looks different from the other substitution techniques you're right this is a very specific form where we're trying to build a linear and in doing so we're going to make us a very special substitution we're gonna make a substitution that it is 1 if it's 1 minus of that power and we solve for y instead of going directly and say hey this one part is V notice how V equals something is not even up there but what it does do is if I solve for y it gives me V such that when I'm when I take a derivative of it this is separated by a 1 but that that negative 1 if I multiply both sides times whatever it does whatever it happens to undo this thing it's going to create V to the first power here that's why we do that 1 minus whatever the power is when we solve for y it creates this difference of 1 so that when I multiply both sides it's going to leave me with nothing methylene in terms of V and then the first power game so the whole idea of a Bernoulli equation is make it look linear as much as you can do a substitution Y minus whatever that power is solve for y replace your Y with what you solve for replace your dy/dx with what the derivative is and then that's going to finish the job of creating this linear for us so I know this is this a lot of work already we're not even to like the integral yet but we've looked at and we said why the first y to not the not the first take v equals one minus that number all right we got that solve it for y take a derivative and then we're making that substitution so dy/dx becomes whatever dy/dx is after you solve for y taking a derivative y itself it's not a direct substitution for your V Y itself is you need to find this after you solve for V so Y is gonna be beaten theta 1/2 Y the third is V to the negative 1/2 sure yeah that's still why I say Y but now to the third power let's see how this works when we when we go a little bit further would simplify the right hand side I want you to notice something what I mentioned earlier was it what this technique does it creates this this idea that there's a difference of 1 between here and here and so what we're doing is we need to make this look linear remember the idea is to get a linear here if we need to make this look linear we need to get rid of that thing but in doing so we're gonna multiply by negative to get rid of the negative 1 now we're also going to multiply by V to the positive 3 halves look at the right hand side because we base this on this power right there when we multiply that it's going to get rid of both of these pieces at the same time not only that but because we have this one that difference of the difference of one that we have here when we multiply here this power is going to be one less or more depends on what we have positive than that power and what happens is we're going to get me to the first so when you're doing these Bernoulli equations and you have the correct substitution and you substitute this in here it's going to leave you with something that you need to get rid of multiply every term that's both sides with distribution to get rid of that and what's going to happen is that these two sides that these are going to be gone this right here will be a difference of one between these two powers so that when you when you get rid of those terms when you multiply those terms and you add your exponents together the difference of one says you're going to get B to the first it's going to leave you with a linear so let's do that let's multiply this whole thing by negative two V to the positive three has negative 2 V to the positive three-halves so if I distribute to every single one of these terms negative two times negative one half gives me positive one V to the negative three halves times B to the three-halves remember when we multiply common bases we add our exponents so this and this done we get DV DX minus it's gonna be plus negative two times negative one gives us plus two but look what happened you know what I'm gonna write this out a little bit differently so I'm going to show you this I'm showing doing too much weight in my hands a lot so I'm gonna show you what happens here's the negative to be to the three-halves that we have or that we have times what we had already our negative one-half V to the negative three-halves DV DX - we have the V to negative one half up here already but now we're multiplying by negative - we did three hats on the right hand side we have B didn't e of three-halves times negative to be the positive three-halves this is what's going on here we're gonna cancel this whole thing out negative to negative one half positive 1v2 three-halves times B to the negative three-halves positive one we get just dvdx we have - oh my gosh negative - that would be plus two we have V to the three-halves remember I told you there's a difference of one of those exponents that's what this substitution does being in the three-halves plus negative one half so that when I add these exponents together we're going to get one every single time V to the 1st that's what Bernoulli equations do they create a linear for you equals on the right hand side V to the negative three-halves times V to the positive house it's the same thing that happens here they have to be the same that's how the substitution is working the substitution is based on that power so that when I subtract one already take it to derivative and subtract one well that difference of 1 here makes it when I multiply to get rid of whatever this thing is it's gonna be this positive 1 but it's gonna create exactly the same exponent over here really neat we get just negative 2 this is exactly what the Bernoulli equation is supposed to do it says that's pretty close to linear let's write it as much as possible it says this guy's got to go let's make a substitution that has Y to the basically 1 minus 3 would give you a this difference of 1 in absolute value let's talk about it that way so that when I solve for y and I take my derivative this piece replaces all of my lives well what's it what's creating for us is this idea that when you multiply whatever it takes to get this piece these two sides are going to be identical I'm going to multiply by whatever it is to get rid of this it's going to also get rid of this but there's a difference of one here between this exponent and this exponent so that when I add the opposite of this it's going to give me positive one that happens all the time that's just created this whole nasty thing into a linear differential equation in terms of the notice we had to replace the dy/dx we had to replace all of the Y's we did that and by the magic and our formula here that I sort of explained to you we now have a linear now to just do the technique for linear so we're getting a lot of practice on this we know that for our linear differential equations we need an integrating factor oh we know that we know that I'm not going to repeat that I spent a long time talking about linear equations linear differential equations so we need something that we can multiply that repeats itself but also gives us this and as far as the derivative of an exponential so our integrating factor here is going to be e to the 2x let's multiply it everywhere if we multiply everything by e to the 2x I had the DV DX and the 2v and the negative two and if we multiply everything by e to the 2x well on the left hand side what we've done and you can check it right here the derivative of this piece is - that's exactly making four we've created the result of a product rule the product of which would be e to the 2x times B this goes back to our linear differential equation so if you don't remember that you need to watch that video or if you haven't watched a video that's really important because this can look really confusing if you don't understand what's going on I spend a lot of time explaining that so that's the result of a product rule here's the product this was not taking the derivative of and neither was that V so we're going to pull that together and now we just need to take an integral of both sides so the derivative of H with respect to X if we take an integral on both sides integrals undo derivatives on the right hand side we've got negative 2 e to the 2x so you could do a little sub sub or or think about in your head we get negative 2 e to the 2x but divided by the derivative of that because that's what you use those du plus C so our T's are going to go away so we get our e to the negative 2x times B equals negative e to the 2x plus C now there's two things we got to do that happen in all of our substitution techniques we're going to solve for V as much as possible but then we have to replace V whether we substituted for V so to be out so soon as V so let's go ahead and multiply both sides by e to the negative 2x if we multiply it by e to the negative 2x this will give us a B this would be negative 1 hey even then 2x times even the names she likes things you either zero is there's one negative one but then the constant gets multiplied times e to the negative 2x well we're pretty close oh maybe right like that but then we're gonna have to go and substitute back to get in terms of why'd we use our substitution to get away from lies we're gonna use to get back to wise my recommendation don't do it here don't do it here do here I'm gonna substitute back for this so y equals plus IV equals 1 over y squared it just allows me to think of this as a reciprocal suffocation idea so if we have 1 over Y squared equals an expression then Y squared equals 1 over that expression I want to talk through it one more time because it's so really important to us all right this is realize sound like little Bunney it's a really important idea for us to master to have down so the idea one more time we're still working on substitution techniques and a Bernoulli equation is one that has a very specific substitution to it it says I want something that looks pretty close to linear so we write something that's pretty close to linear we make sure our dy/dx plus or minus a function that has Y to the first power that's what I want equals something that has a wide to any other power that's not 0 over 1 then what these this renew the equation idea does is just fantastic it says let's let's call V not a direct substitution for one of these but something that when I take a derivative of it is going to let me replace V with something and the derivative of which would have an expert on the that's exactly one different so an of the number one different from whatever this is going to be well that's the substitution that's take take one minus this number and when we take a derivative of it it's going to subtract one from it obviously if I'm taking a derivative of this it's subtract one it's gonna be one different so this piece when I undo it when I multiplied by whatever the opposite of x1 is it can be positive it can be negative I can't say all the time multiplied by the positive because we'll have will have positive zip that we'll have to use negatives so whatever this power is it's one different from that based on the fact that we have to do a derivative obviously we're going to anyway we got to get you by DX so insulted for dy/dx we're getting a power that's exactly one different from this when we start putting this in our associating this into our differential equation this is going to be and because we basis on that power this is going to be exactly the same this is going to have a power that's one different in absolute value it's one less than whatever these powers over it's always different by one I can't say one less or more because a positive or negative but this is always different by one so that when we multiply to get rid of that exponent this number two but that exponent well here and here I'm always gonna get no V's if I get rid of this one I meant be get rid of this one that's pretty cool but this one when I multiplied by the appropriate term to get real pro growth factor to get rid of these two V's on the both sides it's going to leave me with a V to the first power so Bernoulli says linear pretty close make a substitution and make it exactly we want a linear in terms of V and then we use our linear techniques so then your differential equation techniques to solve the rest of the way down make sure we're substituting back in at the very end for V into terms of Y I hope that makes sense we have like five more examples that we're gonna do so we'll pick this up as we keep going I'm not going to spend a whole long time explaining after this the main idea is find one term that has Y to the first find one term that doesn't and then do what V equals y to the one minus that power it'll create something where you have a difference of 1 in your exponents when you undo this one you ought to make me undo this one and you automatically get a power one to force this thing to be linear awesome let's try someone let's try our next one so we have this differential equation we're looking at it we're going that that doesn't doesn't look like anything that's nice I certainly don't want to try a homogeneous on oh that's crazy it doesn't look separable I have lies in a couple places oh wait I've got lies in a couple places do I have a term something's that are subtracted with Y to the first power do have a term with Y to another power yes that right there when you get that when you see then you go I want your head to just flash for me I have a dy/dx great no lies that's important the cavity why is there I've got Y to the first I've got Y to the third so this is what we're looking for now it's not written perfect so when you get these these equations that have Y to the first on one term lined up to another power on a different term we do have to write them as much as it's possible in terms of linear remember what Bernoulli's doing Bernoulli has taken a substitution that's going to force this to be linear and how it does it it creates a difference in your exponents by one so that when you undo one exponent it creates a power one to create a linear so when you do one exponent on both sides it's going to create one in the middle well let's get it as close as possible so as close as possible means you need a dy/dx by itself you need to have Y to the first power being added or subtracted to that as a term and you need Y to another power on the other side as close to possible as a linear so that when we do our substitution becomes a linear that means that this thing's got to go so if we divide everything by x squared we get this - XY over x squared equals five over x squared y cubed I'm also going to do one more thing I'm going to simplify this but I always leave my y's hanging out a little bit like this two over x times y equals 500 x squared Y cube for two reasons number one I want to really emphasize the fact that this is pretty close to linear Hey look at that again dy/dx I get plus something Y to the first power that right there is pretty close to what I'm gonna have as far as my my P of X for linear that's why it's even written as P of X Q of X it's really close to linear that guy screwed it up so this is what the padule-- equation does it says this looks really close to linear except for that guy sucks so let's take care of that let's let's use our let's use our substitution so that we create this we create this this thing that we're going to multiply when we take a derivative that's gonna get rid of this so when we when we take our 1 minus our power we're gonna get V - V equals Y to the negative 2 and much like the last example we're gonna have to solve this for y looks like every substitution technique you're gonna have to solve that for y because every substitution that we're doing is replacing the Y's with something and the dy/dx with the derivative of Y with respect to X in terms of V and X this is different because it's not a direct substitution like we've done it's a smarter substitution it's one of the same pretty close to linear let's multiply by something that makes it linear so we do have to solve for y we do have to take a derivative of Y with respect to X and we do have to make our substitution and now I'm going quickly through the substitution because we've done it so many times that we should know at this point I'm going to be replacing my y's I'm going to be replacing my dy/dx and it's all right here so every instance of Y becomes B to the negative 1/2 every instance of dy/dx which there's only one of them in a linear becomes this so let's replace that right now so dy/dx no dy/dx was negative 1/2 B 2 negative 3 halves DV DX well let's see what's the next part of it well we got a 2 over X okay so that that we don't replace with the why we replace Y we replace with let's see what what is y oh here it is B the negative 1/2 on the right hand side 5 over x squared we don't replace so we're only replacing our wise here but when we do it we get this be either negative 1/2 cubed replace D by DX left the x's replace the Y left X's replaced the why why we're doing that now fine as far as linear it was this but I looked pretty good too it was this piece that says this doesn't look linear or really only trying to replace that it's just so happens that when we place one why we're gonna replace all the Y's you can have 3 variables so this one just kind of plays along after we take a derivative it's creating for us because we subtract one from it it's created for us something that when we replace Y with this power and take a derivative it has something that's one less than this power there I can say less it's one off it's one off so then when I undo it Wow like that that looks crazy well how would I make it better I can get rid of this because my goal remember my goal it's trying to get linear we want to multiply so that we have the dy/dx by itself let's do that so when we multiply everything by the same exact thing from the last example this V 2 negative 2 V to the three-halves I'm not going to show it like I did last time because it's very very similar but negative 1/2 times negative 2 is positive 1 v e to the negative 3 halves plus 3 halves is 0 V 2 0 is 1 this whole thing is gone we just get DV DX this is what we're trying to do this is what Bernoulli equation says it's gonna happen we're gonna get a linear or just trying to make it look lennier so when we multiply you go yeah okay I'm gonna multiply by that but the way we structure our substitution is that because the derivative always subtract 1 from this when I multiply by the opposite term of the opposite sign and I distribute I'm going to be something that gives me positive 1 there so I have a I'm going to write my 2 over X and the red might be the negative 1/2 times this negative 2 V to the three-halves we distribute that on the right hand side we have a negative 10 Casey where the negative 10 comes from I have 5 times negative 2 over x squared but this is V to the negative 3 halves feed in May of three-halves times V to the positive three-halves is V to the 0 that that multiplication right there in getting rid of this factor it's always going to get rid of your V factor on the right hand side that's because we structured this substitution that lay on the in the middle we get this DV DX that looks pretty good but we're gonna now get minus 4 over X 2 times negative 2 is negative 4 over X V to the this is the magic this is what happens every time as we structured correctly negative one half plus three halves gives us positive one now that's a linear in terms of V and X so use your technique for linear we know that our row our integrating factor here would be e to the Ln of negative 4 over X done this many times that would be e to the negative 4 Ln X or if we want to think about this way e to the Ln of let's say X to the negative 4 or e to the Ln of 1 over X to the 4th that would work or just simply 1 over X to the 4th because if we get rid of our DN a laburnum and there's a composition of inverse functions so I know that our row of X is 1 over X to the 4 so you've taken this we've looked at and said that's pretty close to let's and 90 plus lunar but I see a y the 1st power Y to the 3rd let's make it as linear as possible let's make a substitution that when I find a derivative and I plug in this negative 1/2 it's going to give me the exact same power on both side so when I get rid of one side I get rid of both sides also it's giving me something that is 1 power off so when I multiply this times the thing that gets rid of that it's giving power 1 we do all that we get rid of the term that we don't want the fact that we don't want we get something that's linear and then we do use our integrating factor do these problems take a lot of work you better yeah they take a long time and now we're ready to finally start using our integrating factor so that we find the result of a product rule write it as a product rule and integrate the other side so we had DV DX we had minus 4x times V and then equals negative 10 over x squared but now we're going to multiply by our integrating factor multiplied by this 1 over X to the fourth it's gonna distribute and now we can simplify some stuff so 4 over x times 1 over X to the fourth is that 4 over X to the fifth and then the right hand side negative 10 over X to the sixth this is 4000 Linear's do they create the result of a product rule so when we when we get to this point we need to realize that what we multiply we multiplied was to create the result of some sort of product rule few videos ago this wouldn't have been a piece that was not that is not the derivative of anything this was like the leave the first alone derivative of the same so this would have been the result of something with the 1 over X to the fourth this would have been a derivative of that well you double check that if you really want you bring up the negative 4 that would be negative 4 next to negative 5 that's right there but that piece would have been the result of not taking a derivative that's what I get that would be every time on the right hand side we have something that should only be in terms of X if you have these over there you've done something wrong or this is but this technique will work so these powers should always cancel at the same time well if this is a derivative of and if this is the result of a derivative of this piece with respect to X and integral will undo that we get 1 over X to the fourth times V equals well on this side we can think about that as negative 10x and they you see to pull out the negative 10 so we have negative 10x to the remember adding 1 here negative divided by a new exponent making 5 plus C so this gives us this one or X to the fourth let's look at good times me all right negative 10 divided by negative 5 is positive 2 if you want to move that X to the negative 5 back back down to X to the fifth you can let's see I hope you're still with me on this one we're just doing some algebra now what's the next thing you would do what's next thing we have to do well we have to plug in whatever our substitution was for V but then we also have to get rid of our X to the fourth so I'm gonna solve for B as much as possible first I'm going to multiply everything by X to the fourth so X to the fourth gone thanks to the fourth gives me 2 over X X is or give me C X to the fourth and now we're ready to substitute back so we use our substitution to get into these we're going to use it to get back to wise I don't see what was it that's way over here so all the way down we said that V equals this yeah V equals V equals this or the V equals 1 over Y squared I like that substitution better the reason why I like it better is because it tells me what I need to do it tells me I'm gonna have to reciprocate this to get not 1 over y squared but Y squared that means in order to reciprocate this I need a common denominator I need one fraction so I'm going to take just a moment I'm going to multiply C X to the fourth by x over X s to give it a common denominator that's gonna give us 1 over Y squared equals 2 over X sure let's see X to the fifth over X which means that we can write that as one fraction if one over Y squared equals 2 plus C X to the fifth over X then Y squared itself well that's got to be x over 2 plus seen X to the fifth or C X to the fifth plus 2 that's the idea with these these Bernoulli equations is we're trying to make it linear we're going to be using linear techniques it's just we have to get rid of Y to some other power that's not 0 or 1 how it works is we make this substitution V equals y to the 1 minus that power what's going to create for us because we're typically because it's based on that power because we're basing on the power we want to get rid of what it's gonna do for us it's gonna create something that when I undo one side very read to one side B to the power on one side it's gonna get rid of both sides it's also creating something for us that when I make my substitution I have a power that's exactly 1 off from that guy when I multiply it it's going to give me power 1 it's gonna create a linear we're gonna try for more examples to really make this sink in I want to explain something just a little bit more I'm gonna say a lot of times that in getting rid of something you have over here this factor you're also getting rid of this one I want to show you that that that happens all the time so so real quick if you're gonna make this substitution V equals y to the 1 minus n well if you if you solve this for y this is gonna be a little bit of a theory behind this if you solve this for y you're always going to get y equals v to the 1 over 1 minus n so you can think about this as multiplying both sides are taking both sides with excellence so multiplying exponents by the reciprocal of this so 1 minus n okay how do I get rid of that one over one minus n all right cool if you take a derivative what would you do well you'd bring down the exponent we don't really care about that so much but you would take that exponent minus one this is what I want you to look at when we simplify that when we get one or when we subtract it actions we would end up getting 1-1 give you zero one minus negative n this would give you one minus one plus n over 1 minus n or n over one minus n which means this when you gain this is DVD n when you replace your dy/dx you will always be getting this 1 over 1 minus n who cares that's a coefficient no problem I'm V to the N over 1 minus n DP DN or DV DX you're always gonna want to get rid of this piece this is always gonna be the fraction of X once you want to get rid rid of keep that in mind but not watch when you substitute this in for this because this n is based on this watch what happens when you take this as y equals V to the 1 over 1 minus n you would get V to the 1 over 1 minus n to the N that's V to the N over 1 minus n here's what I was saying because of this Bernoulli substitution whenever you make this substitution and you take a derivative you're going to get this piece on the left right there you're going to get this piece on the right due to your substitution which is why I've been saying last two examples that when you can get rid of this piece you inherently get rid of this piece because that's what the substitution is based upon more than that when we take a derivative we're always going to get the derivative see this is always going to be 1 let one more than whatever your substitution is so when we do that when we multiply and get rid of these two pieces here and here so on the left side the right side it automatically creates V to the first power in the in the middle throat to make that linear so I hope that's a little bit more thurible explanation about why this works that it works but I never showed you that we work all the time so this is going to work all the time for us that's really really cool that when we substitute and we get rid of the left piece we get the right piece because it's based on that exponent and our derivative makes the same exact exponents what we're getting when we do our substitution so let's move on to the less videos with that in mind okay so next one we have differential equation but it doesn't look that great in fact it doesn't look quite like the badou the equation we think it might be it's definitely not linear right now doesn't even look close to linear doesn't look separable doesn't look like anything substitution so maybe what we can do is we can try to make it Bernoulli make it into what we want to be by dividing by one squared in fact what I see here is I see Y to the third and one in a second maybe if I'd 2 by I get a Y now this guy's gonna play along give us a different exponent but let's go ahead and multiply both sides by Y to the negative 2 power the idea is I'm trying to get rid of that Y squared and I see but that's just one power higher so when we multiply by Y to the negative 2 power now you might be asking why aren't you just divided by Y squared I really am divided by Y squared dy DX divided by Y squared dy divided by Y squared you get 6x over Y squared but now we look at it and we go oh oh man that's really close to linear this wasn't here that'd be close to linear do you have two terms one of which has Y the first power and one of which has lied to not the first power that's why I wrote that is y to the negative 2 instead of 6 x over y squared so that we can fit the Bernoulli equation model that's cool right now what I would like you to do if you can make your substitution so Bernoulli always has the same type of substitution it says I want you to replace Y - well I want you to make the substitution v equals y to the 1 minus whatever that exponent is don't get your signs wrong screw the whole thing up I just went through a proof of that if you don't mess this up you're going to get something on the derivative that goes here and something when you take the negative second power matches up exactly but if you mess up your signs it's not going to work so V equals y to the 1 plus 2 that's the third power so a writing that says linear as possible we're making our substitution Y v equals y to the 1 minus that exponent and then like every substitution ever that we've done we solve for y well if V equals y to the third power take both sides to the 1/3 power y equals B to the 1/3 like every substitution ever we solve for y and we know that we're replacing two things every instance of Y hey we've got that that's going to all the Y's you review to the 1/3 and dy/dx so we did it find that I went through that proof just a little while ago to show you that when this happens when you do your derivative we always get the same exact exponent as when we take this to that power notice 2/3 1/3 to the negative 2 is negative 2/3 I proved it just a while ago on why that happens so our substitution is going to be very nice for us we're gonna take and replace our wise with this our dy/dx with what we just solved for so I'm gonna do that right now so dy DX no this thing plus 2x yeah that'll still be there it's no close to it but the Y well we're gonna replace that as well that's what the substation does back so times of e to the 1/3 power notice right after that 1/3 and negative 2/3 are separated by 1 so when I get rid of this I'm going to get power 1 here on the right hand side get six things still but then we're gonna have why all right so we replace that why but we're gonna keep the negative 2 power so B to the 1/3 to the negative 2nd power these have to be the same exponent every time they have to be off by one so that when I get rid of these two exponents that's got to give me a power one so let's do that now what we're trying to do is we're trying to make this linear it's pretty close or come with a substitution that when I get rid of this thing it's going to force them to be a power run however one when I get rid of this thing it's going to force this V to disappear as well that's how this bonier the equation works so we need to get rid of this so that we have our DV DX then we're gonna power one linear we've no more B's think about what you would have to multiply by so we're going to multiply both sides by three for the 1/3 V to the positive 2/3 and the same thing there so 3 V to the positive 2/3 3 kills the 1/3 me to the 2/3 V the native 2/3 this is all gone that's going to be DV DX plus remember this is going to distribute so 3 times 2 gives a 6 sure X you still have it X but then we have V to the 2/3 times V to the 1/3 2/3 plus ones are up for you the first on the right hand side 6 times 3 gives us 18 we still have an X but since this is V to the negative 2/3 and this is V to the positive 2/3 negative 2/3 plus positive 2/3 is 0 it gets rid of our V I proved it that that's going to happen ever time so he has something that's linear nice let's go ahead and find an integrated factor because that's how we solve linear so we're going to find our role of X we know that role of X says one thing it's got to be e it's got to be an integral of this right here it has to be the result of a derivative of your exponent so undo that to find exponent itself when we integrate 6x see bad 1 is 2 divided by 2 so 3x squared let's multiply everything by that so we have a DV DX plus 6x times B equals 18x and we're gonna multiply it both sides so every single term by that e to the 3x squared check it out what's the derivative of 3x squared that's what you want on the left left hand side I don't even care if you rewrite that it doesn't matter what you've done inherently is you've created the result of some sort of product rule implicitly with respect to X where this would have been the first factor and that V would have been the second factor you can see right here leave the first alone here take the derivative of the second oh this is the derivative of the second the second is B on the right hand side we have an 18 X e to the 3x squared not too bad so we know how to undo derivatives we know that integrals with respect to whatever very we just took a derivative with can go on both sides on the left hand side we know that we have e to the 3x squared times the V on the right hand side well we're gonna need a substitution so if you equals 3x squared D u equals 6 X DX d you over six would equal X DX and so our integral here says well you got an 18 but our X DX becomes this D u over six and then we have e to the U so if 18 stays e to the 3x squared no we called three squared u so e to the U yep sure X DX you not only solve for that now we have D over six so when we simplify this just a bit 18 divided by 6 gives us three integral e to the UD u man we're almost done we know the integral of e to the U is going to be e to the U with respect to U we'll put a plus C up there and then we're gonna have to go ahead and replace that u we know we made a substitution we're gonna have to get back to that so U is 3x squared tell me have another substitution to undo we're gonna have to to replace a B but before we do that I want to solve for B as much as possible so I'm gonna multiply both sides by e to the negative 3 x squared this is gonna go away so is this one because 3 x squared + remember multiplying a dredge shows 3x squared plus negative 3x squared 0 3 squared plus negative 3 squared 0 but then this is going to get that e to the native 3x squared we have to distribute to every term on the left hand side just V on the right hand side we get 3 times what's going to be e to the 0 in 0 is 1 3 times 1 is 3 plus C e to the negative 3x I hope you're sticking with me here folks now it's just some algebra but it's important stuff now lastly we should know what to do we know that we've got to replace the V with terms of why some we're sort of looked way backward okay there's beef there's that's a better B to choose so I'm going to replace a B with Y to the third and you know what I'm gonna leave it just like that can you take a cube room yeah you probably could does it really super matter not really I would leave it just like that so after understanding the the proof that I gave you that this is gonna work every single time the idea is write a linear base your substitution on that number you're trying to get rid of this piece to make it linear and I showed you why that works just a minute ago what it's gonna have what's gonna happen is it's on your two riveted you're gonna get a piece that you want to get rid of but that exponent is always going to match up to this exponent when you get rid of one side you get rid of the other side that's fantastic also because you're taking a derivative of this piece right there you're you're creating this exponent upon your substitution that is one off one more or one less than whatever excellent you're getting on your derivative so when you get rid of this exponent you're multiplying by something that's different than one here that's gonna create that's gonna create something that's V to the first power it's creating your veneer after that find your integrating factor row multiply to all three terms go ahead and do your integration and hopefully you're getting the picture here man I hope it's making sense I wish I could ask you right now but I can't so we're gonna do three more examples to make it sink in and then we'll be done okay here we go so something a little funky because we have a 4/3 power but I want you thinking through this in the following terms number one is it easy is it a basic integration no remember that even though we're on a video that says Bernoulli equations I don't want you to forget a second learned so if there's another way to do it we might explore that because these frankly take a lot of work I'm going to show you that on the last example that I'm alone say this can be done a different way I'm going to show to you in another video so we think about it a while is it something that's easy that it's as separable is it a direct linear is it a substitution that might be easy it doesn't look like it but what I do see I see a function term with Y the first enter without Y to the first and no otherwise that's great let's try to write this in the form of linear as much as we can so linear says this is that's a dy/dx by itself it has something to the term to the line of the first power right next to it so add or subtracted that X has to go so linear says I need this piece by itself I want a term that has can't that exit sure but it's got to have Y to the first and then over here I have all my other junk so X's and Y's great because we're gonna do a substitution if this fits the bernoulli model so if we divide by X so gone 6 over X and just 3 so we divide everything by X that's exactly what we want this is really close to linear it just has an Y to the 4/3 and we're going to want to make disappear for new the equations do that for us that substitution the bernoulli substitution does that so let's make V equal to Y to the 1 minus whatever the power is of the thing that you want to get rid of that would be let's see one that's three thirds minus 4/3 so negative 1/3 negative one negative 1/3 now we've got a saw just like every other substitution ever we've gotta solve for y because not only do you want to replace the Y which you can't do right now you need to be able to find dy/dx replace that - so maybe multiply both sides by negative three that would raise both sides to the exponent negative 3 that would allow you multiply negative 1/3 times negative 3 multiply exponents gives you 1 and then V to the negative third power alright can you take a derivative sure so dy/dx would equal negative 3b to the negative form DV DX we've created something that when I plug in this to this and raise it to the power we'll have exactly the same exponent that's awesome that's what we want to have happen so now we're ready to do our substitution we looked at and said linear almost let's divide by X linear that's got to go let's do a substitution let's solve for y so their substitution works let's find dy/dx so that our substitution works and now we're ready to rewrite this so dy/dx no I'm gonna replace it with this piece plus 6 over X yeah I like that y no I don't want Y I want the replacing Y with the B to some power that's one different from when I took a derivative so I'm gonna replace this with feed in negative 3 notice always happens because of the case of the derivative we talked about how many times when you take a derivative this exponent changes by 1 in undoing that you're going to create this idea that when you're adding exponents if you're off by 1 you're gonna get B to the first power on the right hand side we keep our 3 but I don't want the Y in fact that's the whole thing I'm trying to get rid of that's why I'm doing the substitution in the first place that's got to be V to the negative three days on the 4/3 and when you simplify this what I approved this power is going to be same as that power we still have our three negative three times four-thirds this negative for catholics good looks really good so what now well it doesn't look linear - you might become that doesn't look good your your writing but when we get rid of this it's going to force it to become good so when we get rid of this in other words when we multiply by negative one third the each of the positive fourth power the positive 4 and the negative 3 since these are off by one that's going to give us power 1 when I multiply this it's going to give us negative 4 and when I multiply by 4 it's going to when I multiply by negative 1/3 and be to the positive boards it's going to give us 0 it's going to give us V to the 0 that's 1 so let's do that so on both sides we're going to multiply by negative 1/3 reading out of the fourth to try to get rid of this side so negative 1/3 times negative 3 that's positive 1 V to the fourth times V to the negative fourth that's B to the 0 this is Lemos of DV DX when we distributed right there we'd have 1/6 sorry negative 1/3 times 6 over X that's negative 2 uh sure that you on the right hand side we should see what's happening three times negative one third is negative one and then feed a negative fourth times B to the fourth that's B to the 0 that's one so this whole thing is you can negative one here is where the awesome magic happens negative 1/3 times 6 is negative 2 so we're gonna get minus 2 over x times V ah V to the fourth times V to the negative 30 adding exponents we can view the first now that's something that's linear we like linear linear works really nice for us so when we get this we go well since we have something later we know our P of X we know our Q of X eated well function of X and now we're gonna find our integrating factor so rho e to the integral of whatever this function of x is which means for us we get negative 2 Ln absolute value of x we're going to give me to that and a lot of times what we'll do is we'll say keep X positive that way we get rid of our absolute value happens quite a bit they don't even show that in some books to go out as just as so much positive and then we get Ln X to the negative 2 that would be Rho of X equals e to the ln 1 over x squared composition of interest functions say they are multiplied our integrating factors just 1 over x squared that's what we're going to multiply everything by so let's do that if we take that and we multiply it by 1 or x squared we're going to create the result of some product rule on the left hand side you do t have to read you can rewrite it really want to if you want to write this as negative 2 over X to the third that's fine you'll just see this that would be the derivative of this piece this piece has to be the result of some sort of a product rule when we had the product of 1 over x squared times B now that we have that we're going to integrate both sides I hope you don't mind but I'm going a little quicker on these ones because we've covered the derivatives of linear differential equations sorry the solving of linear differential equation so much that we're going to kind of rip through these if we can this would be the integral of X to the negative 2 DX don't do it LS now Ellen we're gonna get let's see add add 1 is negative 1 divided by the new two so negative x to the negative 1 over negative 1 that's 1 over X plus C negative over negative is positive take that negative exponent back to the denominator if we multiply both sides by x squared we get V we also get X plus CX squared not too bad if we distribute that we're almost done we know with substitutions we replace wise with the beasts now we replace these back with flies so that's a back here V was you know what I don't like the negatives so what if we did I got rid of money over there the equals y to the negative 1/3 so we could write this as V equals 1 over Y to the 1/3 that might be a little bit nicer V over V equals 1 over Y the positive 1/3 and now this gives us the idea so I don't like this negative exponent because it doesn't give me the idea that reciprocal now I want to do that so 1 over Y to 1/3 equals this and why do the 1 clear itself equals x plus CX squared what else could wow that's not true I said reciprocal about reciprocal what else could we do now that we have reciprocal reciprocal that way we have 1/3 power maybe we raise both sides to the 3rd power just to make it look nicer so raising to the third power this would still give us 1 but 1/3 times 3 gives us Y to the first on the right hand side b1 put on the denominator we get X plus DX squared quantity that looks a little bit nicer so we don't have to deal with that 1/3 power is it making sense to you are you seeing the ideas kind of work behind or not do the equations at this point we're trying to get linear it's close we just need to get rid of one term that has wide to a power that's not one if that's the case we've determined that making V equal to Y to the 1 minus that power does some pretty cool things that proved to you throughout the course of these examples and with an actual approval or a while ago that this will always work it'll always create something that's linear for us then we may find an integrating factor and the rest is just history so let's do two more examples to put this thing to bed okay here we go so our next instance of Bernoulli equations here and what you're looking for again is you're looking for two terms one with a Y to the first won't they why not to the first but you're also trying to write them as linear and as possible to fit our model so that when we make our substitution it becomes linear we talked about why that is it forces it so when you deal with something like this the form is really important which means that that term and that term are on the wrong side with lynnie every one our dy/dx all by itself that's gonna have to go if we want our plus or minus a term with Y to the first that's got to move and then on the other side the term with y to another power that's got to move so we're gonna do two things we're gonna switch these terms subtract subtract and we're divided by 2x so we've subtracted those two terms on both sides that looks fine with that 2x has to go so we'll divide everything by 2 X and we'll get dy/dx no problem that's gone we'll also get minus y to the first that's exactly what we want look at that we want dy/dx you want - why - the term with y to the first power on the right hand side we'll do a couple things we want to show this Y last remember we're trying to make substitutions on Y so the function of X is okay I'm gonna write negative e to the negative 2x over 2x I'm going to show this Y to the third at the back end that is what's driving this substitution that says hey if you make this substitution of V equals y to the 1 minus 3 V equals Y to the negative 2nd power solve that for y we know the substitution we're always solving for y because we need to get rid of dy/dx after we take a derivative back so let's solve that for y we can use to make a substitution and get rid of that piece we'll take both sides to the negative 1/2 power that right there is going to let us substitute for Y here and here when I take a derivative of it it's going to subtract 1 creating this piece that when I get rid of it well so get rid of this piece with this razor third power and it's going to create an exponent upon a derivative that is one off so that when I get rid of it creates a B to the first power so let's find that derivative I think we've done this one like three times now so that derivatives not much different from anything you've done but this substitution is important be careful in this we're going to substitute dy/dx y and y we got to get rid of every instance of Y dy DX is now that derivative let's replace it - Sonic okay we'll get - but why we need to replace a B to the negative whenever equals this whole nasty junk stays but then Y to the third power we need to get rid of every instance of life that's what drove the problem to make us choose a substitutions that we create the appropriate fractions upon derivatives that allow us to get rid of both factors on the sides and one from the creative to the V of the first power in the middle so why now B didn't make it one half but we still have that third power let's simply just a bit here we're going to leave everything but that we're going to make that negative three halves so we can do the gates these two have to be the same if they're not you've done something wrong this one's gotta be off by one from that exponent if not you've done something wrong and now we're gonna try to make this linear that's a whole ideas make it linear so when we multiply to get DV DX by itself which is what we're trying to do here to make it linear we're gonna have to multiply both sides by negative two V to the three halves negative 2 V to the 3 halves well when we start distributing a negative two times negative one half is positive one lead in three paths times of even negative three notes gives us V to 0 that's just DV DX I'm gonna rewrite I'm gonna do this and write it from city citizen for you so that you see what's going on we have a minus negative two V to the three halves times being in the negative one half so I kept my - here's my negative 2 V to the 3 halves here's my V to the negative 1/2 let's let that hang on for second on the right hand side really see this negative times a negative or minus a negative gives you plus B to the if these are always different by one when I when I add the exponents together you're going to get positive one every time is just V on the right hand side well let's see negative times a negative is a positive I'm not doing anything get rid of that E but two times one half gives us positive one and then over X no V V to the negative three halves times B to the positive 3 house B to the zero so this is just e to the negative 2x over X man now what hopefully you know now what now that we have something that's linear and it is linear get DV DX by itself plus V the first power people's function of X we just need a gradient vector kind of cool that an integrating factor is this a really easy one well if I were to forget the two one hopefully you didn't do that so minus 1/8 I said positive I just forgot to do so 2 is our function of X when we find an integrating factor e to the integral of 2 DX well that gives us e to the 2x which is really convenient because when we take and multiply everything by e to the two x so x e to the positive 2x e to the positive 2x e to the positive 2x even the negative 2x times e to the positive x and direction on sets e to the 0 that's 1 these are gone on the left hand side we have the result of some sort of a product rule with that products already given to us e to the 2x and B so that when we take an integral on both sides on the left hand side fundamental theorem of calculus says that's that's going we just get e to the X e to the 2x times v on the right hand side the integral of 1 over X DX is just Ln X a lot of times you're gonna see no massive value then we'll say a little 7 I keep absolutely they keep X positive and then this will work with no absolute value makes it a little bit nicer for us well now what could we solve for B well yes we could all we have to do really is multiplying by e to the negative 2x on both sides so just multiply an e to the negative 2x on both sides and now we're ready to get back into our watch so let's look at it V equals y to the negative 2 or 1 over y squared I like that better if it's in my mind that I'm going to be reciprocating something so V is now 1 over Y squared okay we can deal with that ln x plus c even a 2x and now all we have to do is think that well if you have 1 over Y squared equals this expression then Y squared itself equals 1 over this expression one more thing you might want to do because you have a negative exponent on this factor in the denominator you can actually pull that to the numerator that's about as good as we can get we don't want to be taking square roots so Y squared equals e to the two x over Ln X plus C this is about as bad as it gets I'm going to show you one more example because I want to illustrate that the next example we talked about it can be done two different ways so are you getting it are you getting that we want to make linear out of this and Bernoulli forces it to happen by getting rid of something that we don't want a power that's not one for that y factor great substitution works every single time if we can write in this form then we solve for y I like always with every substitution solved for y use that to replace it later but that lets you take a derivative of Y with respect X and get something to replace dy/dx so let's move on to one more example okay so this looks crazy and you look like anything ever the only thing that looks pretty close is that that looks okay so we looking at this we're going that no please no why why would you because I want to but secondly because you're gonna give stuff like this it doesn't fit anything that we have so far as far as being easy and so one thing we know is that when we have a term of Y with a power one and something with y that's not a power one maybe we can fit in linear as much as possible and use it Bernoulli equation making it fit a Bernoulli equation so let's try how to do this what not to do do not distribute all this stuff you get Y to the third that ruins the Y that you have the idea would be well get all your X's on one side multiply by Y to the negative tooth to get the power of Y on the other side so let's do that let's leave us where it is let's leave this X let's divide by this and let's multiply both sides by Y to the negative 2 the idea is we're trying to make this into linear as much as we can there's one more thing that we got to do do you see if we got to get rid of that bag so we looked here we said I want I like the light of the first power but all this other garbage has to go let's divide we did let's get Y to the negative 2t rid of this we did and now let's divide everything by X including this so we'll have a dy/dx plus 1 over x times y remember I'm always going to write my function of X next to my Y just in front of it equals these X's are actually gone so we get 1 over the square root of 1 plus X to the fourth times y is a negative 2 my encouragement to you right now because the rest of it is just some stuff we've done already I would really want you to try this on your own try to go ahead and find the appropriate for new the equation substitution see if you can find it solve for y see if you can find the derivative see if you can substitute see if you can get rid of the piece that you're gonna have over here see if you can find you integrating factor see if you can find the linear differential equation in terms of B solve it and replace Y see if you can do that so let's see what we do we know that we can make a substitution where we have V equals y to the 1 minus whatever exponent this is on the right hand side that you don't really want that's making this not linear this will undo it when you take a derivative and you get rid of the piece that you get upon derivation of this after solving for y so we get y equals RV equals y to the third power if we solve for y that we have two on every substitution multiply both sides or take both sides to the 1/3 power we would get 1/3 let's see it's one 1/3 B to the 1/3 now this lets us take a derivative and we begin 1/3 V to the negative 2/3 notice how this exponent when I substitute it here and this exponent when I substituted here are off by one when I get rid of this exponent it will cause this one to become positive one creating for us this linear thing linear differential equation terms B that we want this to be also notice that when I take this power to that power I get exactly that power that means when I get rid of this thing with two great this linear in terms of e it's going to get rid of this whole entire factor as well so let's substitute hopefully you've done this and we can work this through as an integral in just a bit so let's see dy/dx know this junk plus 1 over X yes why no no we want to be to the one third equals all this garbage absolutely why to the negative second no B to the 1/3 that's our wife to the negative second let's simplify just a bit let's make sure that we can see that this exponent will be exactly same as that and then we're going to try to write this as linear which means that we're going to multiply everything by the reciprocal of 3 and the opposite reciprocal of that sorry the opposite of that fraction so both sides get multiplied by something that removes this factor because linear has just dy/dx in it and just some function of X V to the first power and just some function of X so when we multiply both sides hopefully you see it we're gonna have to multiply by 3 v to the positive 2/3 if we let that distribute 3 times 1/3 that's 1 V to the 2/3 times B to make 2/3 they cancel we just get DV DX Plus let's show this we'll have 1 over X V to the 1/3 times 3 V to the 2/3 off by 1 look how when I multiply by the opposite of that it adds up to 1 M times V to the negative two-thirds times 3 V to the positive 2/3 2/3 and 1/3 0 V to the 0 is 1 1 times 3 is 3 over square root of 1 plus X to the 4th here we get this DV DX plus we have a 3 in that and 3 into the Sun 3 over X V to the 1/3 2/3 that's one love it now you have something that's linear' you have DV DX you have function of x times whatever this variable is right there and you have a function of X find your integrating factor composition of inverse functions we have row of x equals x cubed just X cubed let's multiply that on all three spots so we're going to go back up here we're going to say let's take these things DB DX plus 3 over X B equals 3 over square root of 1 plus X to the fourth and let's multiply both sides so every single term by X cubed so we've got X cubed and we've got X cubed and we've got X cubed on the left hand side we have now created the result of some sort of product rule with respect to X on implicit differentiation so this whole piece and yeah you can simplify this this would be 3x squared we can actually get 3x squared it's the derivative of x cubed that's exactly right because if this is the result of a product rule then we leave the first alone we would have got X cubed from X cubed times the derivative of the second then if that's the derivative of the second factor V would have been in because the derivative of V with respect to X is DV DX and now we're down to something that we can just do with it nice integral with respect to X both sides X cubed times B looks fine on the right hand side well you're gonna want a substitution and thank goodness this came up with a substitution so if u equals 1 plus x to the 4 D u equals 4x cubed DX let's divide both sides by 4 and it looks like we're gonna get this um let's see we like three one three okay so we got a three let's keep the three let's notice that X cubed DX is do report over the square root of U let's clean that up just a just a tad here so let's pull out the three fourths that's right EU to the negative U to the negative one-half power did it we add one divide by the new exponent so you to the positive one half over one half this is going to give us and see four times what happens to this is going to give us three half three paths U to the one power let's see let's put it back so we know we have to be in terms of X let's go ahead and make our you back into 1 plus X to the fourth so I'm doing that I'm gonna make a square root one half as a square root but inside should be u so inside should be one plus X to the fourth plus C oh man we're so close you know we could do we just divide everything by X cubed let's try that let's divide everything by X cubed to really make this into one fraction so what I've done I've made a 3 square root of 1 plus X to the 4th over 2 and then C and if I divide that X cube have it divide this by X cubed and the C but X Q so to be to be mathematically almost like grammarly correct here even though that arbitrary constant could easily be two seats you want to do this you'd want to show that you're getting a common denominator you're gonna want to show that and you don't want to show that then you're gonna change to C sub 1 into just C so I'm have to move over here now we can say you know what that that's still a constant let's just call it C now we're gonna do two things right now so we're gonna call that C but also we know that V is equal to Y cube let's replace them so we're gonna have a 3 of course we have a square root of 1 plus X to the fourth no problem we're gonna have a plus C because that's the constant we found a common number so 2 C sub 1 made C and then we're gonna have to execute just leave it we can take everything to the 1/3 power if you really really want to I wouldn't leave just like that that's pretty good and that's the idea for Bernoulli equations is you're trying to make something that's linear it should be pretty close or you should be able to manipulate it to be pretty close that was a nasty problem because it doesn't look close at all in fact I want to say a little blurb about that we're gonna have some embedded derivative problems next and I'm gonna show you how this is the result of one of those embedded derivatives so I'm going to show you that we're gonna do this a different way coming up later in a few few videos so sometimes there are differ techniques that we can use we've seen that a couple times already this is one that maybe it's easier a different way so anyhow with Bernoulli the idea is you're going to try to find linear you're gonna want dy/dx something with a y so plus or minus something with y equals something with a different why your substitution always should be Y to the 1 minus that exponent of a thing that you don't even want what's going to happen upon your derivative you're gonna create some sort of a factor that when you get rid of it it gets rid of both of these terms and creates a B to the first power then we have something linear and we know in a deal with that I hope that it made this make sense to you I hope you see how it works I hope you're not just running into this like well I just do this in this and it works somehow hope you saw and the proof that the reason why is because we manipulate that that exponent in such a way that your derivative helps you and that's pretty that's and that's nice it's really nice and then sometimes our integrals can just be nasty but stick with it you know how to do it you guys are going to be defined on this stuff so I'll see you for the next video we're gonna talk about a slightly different substitution technique I call embedded derivatives time to look at some domain again so very similar them to keep this very short and sweet when we're doing these these Bernoulli equations or doing these differential equations by that method we're having to rewrite stuff we're gonna run into domain issues and we always know that we're getting linear so we're gonna get a lot of the same exact domain restrictions that we did in those linear first-order difference equations that we're gonna get right now so when we're rewriting this obviously we're gonna try to make this fit Bernoulli so we're dividing by x squared great we simplify awesome but you divided by X Y divided by x squared X can't be 0 but because we're going to get down to this integrating factor Rho x equals e to the negative for absolute value sorry integral of 1 over X to avoid that absolute value inside that Ln did and some domain restraints of domain issues that we might get with that any negatives inside Ln that would be a problem we avoid that right now so it's not going to simplify later very well if we don't do this so we say yep you know what X can't be 0 for sure because we're dividing by X but more than that to deal with this right here we go well let's just fix it all with this right there and do X is greater than zero that takes care of the dividing by zero part that also takes care of the no more need into the absolute value same thing happens here we're dividing by X so X can't be 0 to avoid the absolute value X has to be greater than zero this one is interesting this one it's not necessarily the integrating factor that causes an issue we're dividing by X sure we divide by 2x so I know X can't be 0 if it wasn't for this piece that's where we leave it but we end up running into this hey when you wrote your product rule and we take this integral on both sides well in order to avoid that absolute value any domain problems of having negatives inside of Ln no matter what we pick for our X well we're going to say that X has to be strictly greater than 0 so if you're understanding the idea to to divide by a variable you need to restrict the domains that you can't have that equals 0 to avoid absolute value we just say let's make it greater than 0 and that's what we're doing here so on the let's see second third fourth and the fifth problem here the last one I'm a telescope like it was fourth and did ya sorry second third six problems second third fifth and six problems last one was crazy but we run into the same exact idea when we start taking this and saying well you know what I'm gonna have to divide what am i dividing by well let's see it B divided by Y I do why can't be 0 I know that that can't be 0 so Y can't be 0 oh I have something over X can't be 0 but now I'm thinking I'm gonna have this integrating factor that has an integral of 1 over X I'm gonna try to avoid that absolute value that helps me simplify that avoids two main issues later on and so where'd you let all that up that's a greater than 0 so I hope that's making sense to you again when we're trying to modify our differential equations to fit a technique we are gonna run into some demand issues we're dividing by these variables so to sit to save yourself a whole bunch of work later on we're gonna restrict our domain right when we come up to it we have hopefully mastered these Bernoulli equation understand all about them and now we're going back and going yes but but we have some issues we're dividing by variables those variables can't equal zero to avoid absolute value to help us simplification and not having negative two-sided l ends in certain cases we're going to restrict it even more than that and say let's assume that variable is strictly greater than zero okay that is the idea I hope that makes sense you 

Transcript for: Solving Differential Equations with Embedded Derivative Substitutions (Differential Equations 24)
time for another technique on how to solve some of these first-order differential equations now I want to say this before we get going on it that sometimes more than one technique is possible to solve some of these differential equations and we've actually already seen that but now this technique is going to come back and say there's some problems that we did on it with Bernoulli equations or with homogeneous that this works really nicely on in the next video I'm gonna revisit five of those and they're gonna be five of the problems of like wow that was really tough with homogeneous or that was really tough with Bernoulli and it's a piece of cake with this so this technique called embedded derivatives it's it's really cool it's so it's thinking outside of the box it's not fitting these differential equations to a specific take technique but it's looking for a piece in this differential equation that we can work with and here's how it works so when we talk about these embedded derivatives or when we're looking for an embedded derivative what we're looking for is in a differential equation do you have a piece of it then it's the derivative of another piece because if you do well maybe we can write rewrite this dy/dx with this function as DV DX by everybody making a little substitution so embedded derivatives this technique still does a substitution but it's looking for something very specific it's saying do you have a piece of your differential equation that is a derivative of another piece now here's what it has to have into it so look for a piece that's a derivative another piece it has to include a Y so here's a it here's we're going to be going this is how once your brain structures so when we get there it makes sense to you we're gonna be picking a function of Y that we're gonna call V alright so function of y equals V take a derivative we'll get a DP DX we'll get a function of Y that's a derivative but then we'll get dy DX by the chain rule wait a minute if you picked this function of Y so that the derivative of that is also in your differential equation then when we take a derivative this should give us this piece over here with the dy ix by the chain rule and that's gonna clear clean up a ton of this differential equation for us it's a very cool technique now it doesn't work every time well no of course not because we don't always have two functions away we don't always have a function of Y that's a derivative a direct derivative of another piece or we can't make it into that so we use it when we can but it doesn't happen every single time so I'm gonna walk you through how it works when we get to use it but if you do see it man use it because it's gonna save you a lot of time as far as manipulating your difference equation try to fit like Bernoulli or homogeneous or something like that so let's go ahead so then or will replace our dy/dx not with just D what sorry replace not just dy/dx but an entire function dy/dx so one more time all the way to through we're looking for a piece that's a derivative of another piece of Y when we call the piece that's not the derivative V okay why let's take a derivative we'll replace not just dy/dx but an entire function with it let's check this out of this example we'll do about four more after this this one's really kind of basic just to get our feet wet and then we'll get through it so look at the difference of equation and it is one man it doesn't look whether you're there's not even really an X up there I don't want to start making this homogeneous it's not a basic integration it's not separable it doesn't look like doesn't even look Bernoulli because they don't have Y to the first power so what in the world am I going to do let's look for an embedded derivative maybe that's one of the first techniques we would check out because here's what we're looking for we're looking for a function that is the derivative of another function that's what we're looking for it to a piece of this differential equation that is a derivative of another piece and it has to have Y's in it that looks pretty good now here's how this is going to work if we call this piece of be the piece that you're not sorry the piece that's not the derivative so let's let it be equal Y to the third think about what is going to happen the reason why this technique is because if this piece is the derivative of this piece then if I call this V and I take a derivative of this piece well what's going to happen well not only am I going to get this whole thing back because this is the derivative of that but I'm also going to get dy/dx by the chain rule so let's take a derivative on the left hand side we get DV DX great on the right hand side we get 3y squared no problem but then do you.why any X and this is the magic of this this technique it says wait a minute you mean to tell me you're gonna wrap them all your Y's all at once yeah that's right let's Y includes the Y so if you wrap up all your Y's all at once in terms of V this is really nice for us so what do we start replacing these things we know that Y cube is gonna be V so this was V no problem we take a derivative obviously the piece that's a derivative it's gonna show up so 3y squared I mean stirrers right there but more than that that attainable we get this dy/dx we can replace this like in mass this whole thing this is great so this entire piece of junk right here we're gonna replace with DV DX so this entire piece that whole piece is now DV DX Plus do we have a like cube anymore no that's what we're calling V that's how we got this derivative in the first place do we need to worry about e to the negative X well no we don't because that's got X's in it's okay to have these and X's remember the idea on a lot of these substitutions is wrap up the Y's wrap up the Y's so that they become V's and DV DX and then we can integrate it in a different independence or e with a different dependent variable is V and then go back at the very end and that's where this technique really shines it says if you have a piece that's a derivative of another piece and in fact it's this whole thing really then you go okay let's call this piece V the one that's not the derivative that way when I take a derivative of it the other he shows up and the other piece is called DV DX so this it's dvdx this piece is what we called the this piece we don't even care and now hopefully this is going to change into something that we can use linear or separable or some other thing that we can make work so for us well let's see we're now in terms of B for our dependent variable IC to be x IC v to the first power I see a fun wait a minute that's money or let's see a bunch of X so what if we say you've X is 1 can we find it integrating factors so that we can solve this this linear differential equation in terms of B now yeah we don't row of X is going to be e to that integral of P of X that's EBX we don't need a plus C we've talked about Y let's multiply everything by that so both sides this entire equation by e to the X that's going to give us e to the X DP DX plus e to the X of e equals well if we multiply e to the negative x times e to the positive x now what's that going to give us what happened exponents is going to give us 0 that's one move up here so this side remember how the this whole linear idea works the whole linear differential equation idea works in you're using an integrating factor and we can use integrating factors in different ways this is just one way you can use them and you are using an integrating factor to create this result of a product rule so let's find the product if this is the result of a product rule but pieces here and here came from the original product well now we know we can integrate both side so if we integrate both sides with respect to X we're going to get e to the x times B equals integral of 1 DX oh cool all right that means that e to the x times B equals x plus C we got to have a see up there we know that when you integrate we get it plus C we don't need 1 for an integrating factor because e to the C would be divided away right away since you're multiplying every term by it now we do have to solve for V well how do we do that use it divided by e to the X or use e to the negative x that would work but now we realize one more thing with all of these substitution techniques that we're making with V we got to go back and get Y eventually so we're gonna go back right here the substitution we made just like before just like homogenius or any of those are the ones we use this twice we use it one time to get away from the Y's we use it another time to get back to the Y's so let's go back to the wise if v equals y cubed then y cubed equals it's X plus C e to the negative x that's the embedded derivative technique easy problem yeah and I'll show you some other ones that aren't as easy but man is it cool I hope you see in the utility in this so this is really an this is really impressive the fact that we have a piece that's a derivative of another piece we just call the piece that is not the derivative part so it's called the parent function you call that V then when you take a derivative of it yes you're gonna give the DV DX that's a substitution but you're also going to get the other piece that is the derivative with the dy/dx could replace the entire thing with DV DX very neat gives us linear in this case we can solve it down make sure you get back to Weis hope that's making sense to you let's do a few more examples all right let's get ready for another two we have a differential equation we're looking at it and it looks very similar last example but it doesn't look very similar to any of the techniques that we've used and so we're looking at it going i I don't know what to do with that well maybe we start looking outside the box instead of looking for a specific homogeneous substitution or an obvious substitution or bernoulli substitution let's look for an embedded derivative can do you see a piece of this ask yourself right now can you see a piece of this where you see one part of your different equation connected to a dy/dx equal to another part of your differential equation that has Y's in it remember with all of these substitution techniques we need to wrap up all of the Y's with it so it has to work with the Y's if it doesn't then this is not the right technique to use so we're looking for a piece of the differential equation connected to a dy/dx that's the derivative of another piece and we're going to make that substitution so that other piece the one that's not connected to the D by DX that's got to be your V so when we're looking at we're going well oh my gosh hey there's my cube that's great here's 3y squared dy DX that right there is the derivative of Y Q now what about the X don't worry about the felon guide or got that little guy don't worry about the X that's just gonna be x times DV DX can we divide by that yes are we gonna get a domain tissue yes and wanted to find it when we get there so when we're rewriting these things we are gonna get some domain issues and we'll start weaving that in right now but when we're taking a look at our our techniques if one doesn't fit you know maybe I try such a different technique and one of them that we can sometimes rely on just not all the time but sometimes why is this embedded derivative so let's start working through it we know this when I take a derivative of it gives us this let's call this piece beef let's take a derivative on both sides with respect to X I hope you've noticed this but this is awful like doing a substitution with with integrals so like a you saw or something when you look at you go okay I'm gonna replace this part with a variable I'm gonna take a derivative I'm gonna replace this entire thing with the DX all at once with that substitution that's exactly what we're doing here so when we're looking this going hey let's call this piece Y cube let's take a derivative oh my gosh it's just like the substitution technique integrals cool 3y squared dy DX let's look for this piece in my differential equation it's bright that's awkward right here so can I replace all of that stuff 3y squared dy DX with DV DX yes and that's how the embedded riveted technique works it says let's go ahead and replace all that so I'm gonna say 3 dy squared dy DX all of this junk is DV DX but what I didn't replace still needs to be there I still need to have that X on the right-hand side I didn't do anything with the 3 X to the fourth but that Y to the third power that's me so I'm gonna replace that with a V so again we're looking at this no technique looks apparent but I'm gonna try to think outside the box maybe a piece of this is a derivative another piece call the piece that you want to take the derivative of V take the derivative of it you should get the other piece dy DX so a couple things to look out for the derivative has to be connected to the dy/dx by multiplication I hope you understand why that is because when you put when you replace it you're replacing the derivative and the chain rule gives you a times dy/dx we need that to be the case so we're looking at it you need the derivative piece to be multiplied by the dy/dx somewhere other stuff can be around it like that X Factor no problem just multiply that or leave that when you multiply it by the DV DX well it's like that now that's differential equation hey we got rid of all the wives we wrapped up all the Y's would be we still have an X that's fine but this is DVD X instead of dy/dx do you see a variable raised to the first power in the dependent variable Y SUV that right there says this is gonna be a linear so this is a linear differential equation now in terms of V and X let's write it as such let's subtract the V yeah that's pretty cool now I've got almost a linear what's the next thing that I would do well to make a linear differential equation I need to divide by X because I need the DV DX by itself and so what it's going to give us is divided by X divided by X divided by X we need T V DX would get 1 over X V we get a 3 X cubed now I'm gonna start working this in right now you just divided by X and now it should be pretty clear on on the work that we're gonna have a domain issue what is that Dumanis you what can't X be well X can be 0 but because we're dealing with a linear I'm gonna bet that we're gonna have an integrating factor that's gonna have an Ln of absolute value of x to avoid that absolute value I'm just gonna make it greater than 0 we're gonna put a restriction or domain that we wouldn't get there and we have our integrating factor of Rho X and we go oh yeah it's not doing with the absolute value that's gonna take care of it for us so one more time all the way through we're looking for a piece that's a derivative another piece call it B take a derivative it should be up there call the whole thing DV DX got it leave anything else that's not in that derivative no problem and look at the form right now we have linear let's divide let's take this off to the side but just nice and neat and now let's go ahead and find an integrating factor let's multiply let's solve this so I know my P of X is negative 1 over X so when I integrate I have this e to the negative integral of 1 over X no province a negative well that gives us e to the negative Ln X where's the absolute value right there we said that's why we make those those domain restrictions so we don't have to deal with it later because we found out in linear then a lot of times we can start simplifying our X's but if one of them has an absolute value one doesn't that's an issue and it cost some other domain issues to come out so let's work with this one this is going to be e to the Ln 1 over X remember that we have a negative exponent we can move that up so X to the negative 1 sure but that's going to be let's see composition inverse functions Elleni are gone we'd get X to the negative 1 or 1 over X let's multiply that all three places so we had DV DX minus 1 over x times B equals 3x cubed and we're going to multiply both sides so we're in distribute by 1 over X and 1 over X and 1 over X let's simplify before we go any further the reason why we do that is because we know with linear we're trying to make this result of a product rule by using an integrating factor but on the right hand side you're just going to be integrating that and so we're gonna definitely simplify here but here we want to check our work remember that this this is the result of a product rule the derivative of this piece must be this piece in terms of X let's just make sure that happens so 1 over X cool DV DX no problem making it 1 over x squared times the B to the 1st it's the derivative of 1 over X equal to negative 1 or x squared yes ok now I know that that's going to be result of the project work equals in the right hand side 3x squared since this was linear since this is a result of product rule well let's find the product if this is the result of a budget rule it's leave the first 11 times the derivative of the second take the derivative the first times the second that had to be the product now we're good to go we know that integrals undo derivatives that's fantastic because we can just integrate both sides with respect to X on the left hand side we just get 1 over x times V on the right hand side we get X cubed plus C and this is what we're talking about is not really wanting an absolute value up here with our integrating factor because if we had that we'd have an absolute value here and here and here but not one over here and so we wouldn't be able to start multiplying by X and getting X to the fourth we won't be able to do that and so that's a lot of times why me let me do this we say let's just let X be greater than zero to avoid the absolute value of all together makes your simplification possible lets us use our technique very well let's go ahead and do is solve for V so that means that we're gonna multiply everything by X we can either get x times the quantity X cubed plus C or X to the fourth plus C times X now there's one more thing we've got to do the only other thing that we we really need here is that we've got to replace the V back and with these terms of y so we're going to look back at our substitution now let's see we use the substitution one time to get away from our Y's and one time to get back to our lives so V equals y to the third let's replace in that's about it we can write it just like that we could solve for y explicitly take a cube root of both sides if you want to either way is fine but I'm hoping that this is can sense as far as that the technique is concerned what we're looking for we're looking for a piece that when you take a derivative of it it's also in your function in your differential equation x dy/dx that that is the derivative we replace the whole function that's the derivative with DV DX and the function you took the derivative with v it'll lead to linear or some other form and then we go ahead and solve that and work back to get our rise at the end keep in mind we're gonna be dealing with some domain problems especially with linear especially when you're starting dividing so we're gonna get this X greater than zero quite a bit let's do the next one why don't you try right now as I'm erasing this just think through it's kind of a tough one but is there a piece up there in terms of Y but when I take the derivative of it it's there x dy/dx in some fashion other things can be multiplied along with it that's not a problem but we need at least the piece I'm going to substitute to have a derivative that's up there x dy/dx well here's a piece of Y x dy/dx is there anything up here that when I take the derivative of it somewhere else I get dy/dx yes and what about all this other junk taurima the other junk let's go ahead and replace that e to the Y this one with V alright well if we're going to do that what we need to do by DX hey we need to do by DX that's why this substitution has to have wine it like every other substitution we had it had to have a wine and so that we get a dy/dx is so that we can replace that guy with dy/dx so the whole thing works and then the piece that you're calling the V needs a derivative with respect to X that gives me a dy/dx it's got to be multiplied because the derivative here must repeat give me this it also has to be a dy/dx to give me this we replace the whole thing everything in your substitutions you should have caught on by now everything you're soaked to get rid of all your whites it needs to be in terms of V and X when you're done so that's the way the embedded derivative works it says call this piece of eat that way when I take a derivative of it not only am I going to get the other piece that either Y in this case I'm also going to get dy DX that's why these things have to be multiplied together their derivative has to be multiplied by dy DX because we're gonna be taking a derivative of something with Y and it's gonna be multiplied by dy DX let's go ahead once let's change that whatever we can in this am I gonna change the X well no that wasn't in the derivative but this whole entire piece e d by DX that is now divided DV DX on the right hand side I still have a 2 but e to the Y that's now V and I still have all this stuff yes see it do you see that this embedded derivative thing wraps up all the Y's and something very nice it says I'm wrapping up the piece that's not dy/dx SV that one might I take a derivative of it it's giving me a piece that is a derivative dy/dx all of the plies are nicely wrapped up now we gotta solve it well you know what I hope you're seeing it is it separable does it look like it is it linear yeah you have V to the first power that's the only instance of V let's distribute the two let's get the V and on the same side as DV DX let's divide by X and see what happens maybe you can try right now let's distribute that looks a little bit better it says oh hey there's a bee there's no the bees that's B to the first power it's not Bernoulli there's no other bees can I subtract it to get my dvdx and my my V the first power term on the same side that's pretty close there's one more thing we need to do to make it linear hopefully you're seeing it hopefully you see that we got a divided by X right now we want some hope when you see I'm hoping you see that when you're modifying or changing or manipulate or having one say these differential equations by division you're going to get a domain problem so I've said it in several videos now that this is going to be an issue for us let's define it right now so we're doing with linear put that in your head right now we're dealing with linear and we know that X can't be 0 but we also know that we're gonna be dealing with an integrating factor to solve this so if X can't be 0 great but do you want to deal with absolute values later with linear no because oftentimes we can simplify a lot of X's and the absolute value would hold us back let's just make this greater than Israel that's gonna show up this is not because of this right now it's not a greater than 0 because of this right now it's greater than 0 because of the integrating factor later so we don't have to have the absolute value so keep that in mind how about we go ahead and find that our P of X if this is linear it's gotta have a P of X let's find our integrating factor Rho of X which we know what that is that takes e to the integral of P of X which gives us e to the negative to LNS hey that's pretty cool because we don't have to have this whole absolute value you can simplify very nicely get 1 over x squared let's see what how that happens so we'll move up this made of 2 we know a composition of inverse function simplifies be with Ln we have Rho of X equals 1 over x squared let's multiply by that so that's our integrating factor we're gonna use that to solve our linear differential equation in terms of V and X we know that we're creating this result of a product rule and that's what that missing piece integrating factor does for us in this case so we had let's see we had DV DX minus 2 over x times V equals let's see 2 x squared e to the 2x and we're going to take that Rho of X and multiply every single term because we're multiplying both sides is going to distribute so 1 over x squared and 1 over x squared and again let's make sure we simplify at least the right-hand side if you want to trust your math and just understand that your product from this would be 1 over x squared times B I guess that's fine I'm gonna simplify one more 6 I want to check the work so whatever x squared DV DX nice good minus 2 over X cubed V I'm gonna pause right here I'm just going to make sure is the derivative of this this let's see that would be X to the negative 2 and bring down the negative 2 to subtract 1 that's negative 3 move it back down yes now I know that I have the right integrating factor I know really the result of a product rule now on the right hand side X Squared's are gone and now we're ready to do two things number one we're ready to write this as the prop the product that when we take a derivative with respect to X it gives us back that result and then we're ready to say hey if I take an integral on both sides on the left hand side we just get 1 over x squared times B on the right hand side let's see that's a small a minor you so so you would be 2x the derivative would be 2 DX I'd have to divide by 2 so I'm going to get e to the 2x but the 2 and the dividing by 2 are gone so this 2 its divided out when you have that substitution of do you over - all right well maybe we can solve for V right now so if we multiply both sides by x squared guess I better do right we have our plus C we have either 2h plus C multiply both sides by x squared and there's one more thing we're going to do we use our substitution to get away from wise and into these now we'll use it again to get out of these and back into y so let's look back for it says e to the Y all right so if B is e to the Y that we have maybe I'll rewrite this a little bit x squared e to the 2x plus C if you wanted to solve this for y we do Ln on both sides so if e to the y equals x squared e to the 2x plus C then y equals Ln of x squared e to the 2y a 2x plus C that's about as smooth as we can make it are you seeing it are you getting the point the point of these embedded derivatives is that if one piece is there I take the derivative and it's multiplied by the D by DX I can substitute out both of them they become V's and it's it's kind of cool it saves us a lot of work if you try to make this into other techniques either it's impossible or those other techniques are really difficult I'm going to show you that in the next video we're gonna do five examples just like this of some problems we did in homogeneous and demand and Bernoulli the man this makes him a lot nicer so I just want to show that to you in a separate video we have two more examples now to get our our basis just perfect and then then we'll move on and do a different video all right last to this so I'm gonna do all the way with you maybe you can start right now I'm gonna do all the way with you this one I'm not going to I'm going to show you how to set up this is a little weird and I'm gonna leave you when we get to the the type of differential equation that you can solve on your own so let's start with this one you can look at it can you see a piece that when you take a derivative of it is up there and has dy/dx next to it if you can write out V equals that piece right now so V equals that sine squared why why that one because when we take the derivative of sine squared Y we get to bring them an exponent then B to leave the inside alone sine Y to the first power but derivative of the inside would be cosine Y that's the chain rule again so the derivative of sine squared Y is 2 sine Y cosine life just begin you have to have all of your lies wrapped up in whatever substitution you are making so if this is going to be your V the derivative that better include a dy/dx got a wide it's got everything else that has a Y that's connected to it so it's gotta do that and it does this is alright well hey there's 2 Lykos online here's two semi-crystalline dy/dx it's gonna replace all of that stuff except for the X so all of that is DV DX except DX equals now for we're not worried about the x's 4x squared is fine but we have this sine squared Y is V man it looks a lot nicer here this is like junk but this looks a little less like junk it looks like linear me can we subtract the V can we get the V the first power on the same size DV DX let's do that can we make it into the linear differential equation can we divide everything by X so dividing by X we'll get our DV DX we get our minus 1 over X B we get equals 4x because we divided by a wait a minute we divided by X we divided by X on a linear can't be 0 y greater than 0 for the absolute value let's not have to write that that's why we put that happens on linear a lot let's see if we get the rest of it so it's Linea we know what P of X is P of X has to be this negative 1 over X we know Rho of X then will be e to the e to the integral of P of X all right Rho of X would be e to the negative Ln X we don't worry about absolute value we'd if we restrict our domain to X greater than 0 but we do know that Rho of X could be written as e to the ln x to the negative 1 hey composition inverse functions X to the negative 1 is one of her eggs are you with me are you getting it is a making sense to you where we're getting this stuff it's just linear I know but doing the embedded rid of the substitution wants to see them really well now let's use it so we know that we'll be multiplying every single term by a 1 over X so DV DX minus 1 over x times B is 4x and we'll multiply it by the integrating factor by distribution on every single one of those terms let's simplify let's check our work and then let's integrate so 1 over X DV DX looks really good this gives us minus 1 over x squared let's double-check is the derivative of this people to this yep equals just for later works by making the result of a product rule we now know what the product is that product has to be 1 over x times me and when I take the derivative with respect to X it gives me this therefore the undoing of that says hey this is the result of a derivative the check to X of some sort of product this right the product on the right hand side we get 4 and we know how linear differential equations are solved at this point by using the integrating factor we take the integral of both sides with respect to X left hand side done man I love that technique right inside 4x plus C hmm well because we don't have the absolute value here we're able to multiply by X and start doing things like getting 4x squared we wouldn't be able to do that if we had the absolute value that's one reason why we get rid of it when we restrict our domain with that condition it's important for us to know so V would equal 4x squared plus CX what else we got oh yeah we got to get back to wise so if V equals sine squared wide then sine squared y equals that man I'm not sure if I would even throw any further than that we start taking square roots with plus and minus - would we let's leave it leave it just leave implicit it's crazy to try to solve that need for them than that I hope it's making sense oh it's making sense on why we're using this technique and most importantly how it's working so how was work it's great remember we have some domain restrictions when we're going through this especially relating to linear and homogeneous now if you're wondering well all of these and linear all the last four are they always gonna do that the answer is no so I'm going to start this problem with you I'm going to show you that they don't always end linear it's okay to not get linear differential equations out of doing this embedded derivatives substitution that we're doing so let's check out this last one X plus e to the Y dy DX equals x either negative y -1 and you're looking at it you're going okay that doesn't look like anything I know it's definitely not linear it's not separable it's not a basic integral it doesn't look for newly it doesn't look I'm a genius I can't even make it homogeneous because we have to either why what in the world am I going to do that's a good indication especially the e to the Y there with no otherwise that you're gonna have an embedded derivative and so let's look for it but you look for it you go wait a minute the derivative of this piece is not this and furthermore that's not x dy/dx think of border operations it's added first that's a problem so how do we fix that problem one way to start with fixing this problem is to multiply by by something that's going to simplify and give you a derivative so for instance I want the derivative of some sort of like e to the Y to be connected to this so let's multiply by something that does that and that's nasty let's get rid of it well wait a minute what if I multiply both sides by e to the positive Y we're obviously not multiplying by zero or anything because e to the Y can't be zero it's always positive so that's fine maybe if I rewrite this and write the e to the Y second dydx and take a close look at what's going on the right-hand side so the reason why we thought that this was the do it's not thinking any model it looks close to having a derivative over here but it's not really working because that needs to be positive and I need this piece right here and not connected with addition let's multiply to make that happen when I multiply by e to the Y I made rid of that so X either negative Y times either Y gives me X e to the negative y plus y is zero that's just X minus e to the Y and there it is and then we go oh cool if I take that happen this evening the derivative of this piece I get e to the Y dy DX now you can go ahead and try it why don't you try an illness I'm going through it go ahead and call the piece that's not next to do my DX but has all the other wise in it call that piece of B take the derivative of that piece and you know you might have to guess and check a little bit on some of these ones if it's not apparent I don't think about that for a while before I said oh yeah if I multiply by e to the Y I'm gonna get rid of this I'm gonna get it e to the Y and the derivative would be here next to dy/dx I have to think about that so the derivative of e to the Y is e to the Y but it's a chain rule with respect to X so even the y dydx let's start replacing stuff now we see that this whole piece is DV DX X is X even why is be that's no problem but do you remember me telling you this was like ten minutes ago and I said like 30 times that all of your wives have to be replaced with these what that means is that you can't believe that guy so all of this is DV DX yes and that's X and that's a B but if either the Y is me then that either Y also is V and that saves you a headache because otherwise you have three variables not okay and now we look at it and think well I actually don't have just B to the first power I have a V here and if I were to distribute it would be multiplied by DV DX I have to divide I don't want to be doing that I want to get B to the first power what could I do in this case wait a minute I had another section we had we have homogeneous equations and it looked a lot like this in fact if I start dividing I start dividing by that well it's not linear but if I divide everything by X and I say you know what X can equal zero make sure we know that we're divided by X you obviously cannot let X equal zero okay so if that's the case can we make a substitution that's homogeneous the answers yeah and hopefully you can do that on your own for the rest of the way we'd make up I don't want to but we make it another variable say we we've used up our B's so call it W W equals y over X I started B over ice so used to do that W equals B over X do the exact same thing we did for homogeneous and you can solve it so that's just again one quick example to show you that not all of these things when we do embedded derivatives work out to be linear it certainly is nice what it is but if we can do things like other techniques like homogeneous or some basic integrals that we have so watch out for that I hope it's made sense to you I hope you see the kind of power in this technique the technique works this way one last time through the technique works that if it's not fitting something that's a parent or even if it is and this ways easier if you see a piece term that has Y's in it that when you take a derivative of it gives you the otherwise of x dy/dx and you can replace all of your wise and D by DX in terms of V by taking that substitution that's an embedded derivative and they'll work out to something that you can use hopefully linear or homogeneous or another technique that Tatia but that's pretty cool so we're looking for a piece sum term that when I take a derivative of it it's x dy/dx call this piece of e then you get the derivative and dy/dx replace everything all at once that's nice so hoping make sense on the next video what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you five examples that we've done other ways I'm going to show you that this way could have really shortened them so check that out stick with it for the next video it's kind of it's a good it'll be a good one so I'll see you for that you 

Transcript for: How Embedded Derivatives Can Make Differential Equations Easier (Differential Equations 25)
hey there I mentioned in the last video that we're going to take a look at five examples in this video that we can do with an embedded derivative that we've done before as either homogeneous or up a newly equation and we're going to take a look at five of those examples the first four of which we've done is homogeneous and we're gonna see that embedded derivatives can sometimes make these a lot more streamlined because we don't have to set up the problem as much so I'm going to show you that with four or five examples for which are homogeneous one for Bernoulli and see that sometimes this is this can be a lot more streamlined a lot easier it's one of the techniques I look for right off the bat when I see the virtual equation is hey do you have a piece of it that's a derivative of a function of Y and so that that's the whole idea if you don't remember from the last video what we're looking for here is a matter of substitution that you can call a function of y equal to B and then the derivative of that function wide width dy DX is on the other side typically or somewhere else in your differential equation and then we can make a nice substitution saves a lot of energy so I'm gonna show you that does it work all the time no but when it does work man sometimes it's nice and so if you want to go back and compare these these four examples with the homogeneous then I'm talking about and alas one Bernoulli you're gonna see that it's a lot easier so here's what we're doing we're looking for a function of Y like Y squared that when you take a derivative of it you get another function or a piece of the differential equation that's up there and this is our substitution so when we look at this we go is there is there a piece of this they can take it to Rivet above that's also in my differential equation well well there is now I want to now one of us just say something here just just like we did with those u subs integration we're not super concerned about matching up our constant coefficients this coefficients this one happens to but you don't need that to happen so just like it you said we're really just looking at do the variables match up and do we get a dy/dx so if you remember all of these substitution techniques every instance of Y has to get wrapped up in a V so in this case we're going to wrap up a function of y sv the derivative function of Y with dy/dx has to be somewhere else in your differential equation let's take a look at it so if you're looking to go okay is there a function of Y that I can call B yeah yeah 2y squared okay is the derivative of that in there somewhere well drew the 2y squared is 4 why could I work with that yeah but could I just take Y squared equals B instead of that - you can do that you don't need to include those constants all in the time and so if we say let's let's just do the equals y squared notice how the entire function all the Y's on the right hand side are gonna be wrapped up into B you have to had to have them for a substitution we can't have three different variables and a difference of the collegiate and work with it with these techniques so we can't say okay well we're gonna just wrap up some of the Y's as bees and then we'll have our X's and we'll have some so B's and y's and x's that that doesn't work so well so every instance of Y has to somehow work in the substitution is being involved in a V so somehow so let's call V equals y squared all right well now well we're gonna have to get rid of that dy DX and then first that we're gonna take a derivative so we're gonna have a DV DX no problem remember that V is a dependent variable and Y is the dependent variable and X is our independent variable so we're taking a derivative on both sides with respect to our independent variable so DV DX but on the right hand side what that means that we're gonna have a chain rule yeah we're gonna get 2y look because Y is it function of X you have a dy/dx that you're gonna have to put up there and that's exactly how embed derivative works so take a look at it go oh hey look if I call this Y squared V so I'm gonna get to V and the left hand side I have a to Y and dy DX the 2 and the y and the dy/dx are gonna get wrapped up in DV DX yes we're still going to have an X that's okay we just need two variables one independent so in the x's and one dependent either why servyse but if you're gonna change some wise we can change all the Y's in this case they does it for so I'm gonna rewrite it just a little bit and then we're gonna make our substitution these I'm gonna try to go a little quicker on these examples because we have the technique I'm just showing you that this can work another way besides homogeneous or Bernoulli equation or one of the techniques that we've done if you remember with homogeneous what we would have had to have done is divide both sides by 2 XY we've got a fraction of X over Y so we had to reciprocate that change the exponent V to the negative 1 power and then we got Y over X that would be V to the first power and then we have to go through deal with that this is much nicer for seeing that so I'm gonna write this as x times 2 dy DX no problem on the right hand side x squared plus 2y squared and now we can see our substitution every instance that's why is going to get wrapped up in some form of V so x squared and leave it the - hey that's not part of your V you need the 2 but Y squared we replace with V on the left hand side we still have the X but 2 y + u my DX the to the Y the new Y DX this whole thing here that's DV DX and you go love it that doesn't look all that great to me can we can we work with it well of course we can work with it let's go ahead and see what what's really going on here do we have X's and V's and nowise yeah do we have a DV DX and V to the first power yeah where it's add or subtracted oh yeah hey that looks a whole lot like something that's linear so let's go ahead let's write this as linear so I'm going to subtract our to the humble size to get something a linear format we're gonna have to get dpdx all by itself so we're gonna have to divide by X and when we do that we're gonna have a domain issue we talked about it now several times let's write that as we go so if X does not equal zero that we get DVD X minus 2 over x times B equals just X we divided everything by X that's looking pretty good now we can go ahead and find an integrating factor now we can multiply everything by it and then we'll be fine so let's find our row of X e to the negative let's just pull that two out tooth negative 2 integral water right well let's see that's negative 2 Ln absolute value of X could I have made this greater than 0 and not how to deal with the absolute value I could have but we're going to get a 1 over X later and so I'm not going to do that because that absolute value needs to be inside of an Ln and so I'm going to put as a few domain restrictions as possible but we are going to notice that that absolute value is going to disappear because we have it to a power 2 so we have this as if we take that negative and apply that that's gonna be one over absolute value of X but then atleast square everything when you square the absolute value it's insane you're gonna get something positive in that or what because of that X so that's gonna disappear that absolute value anyway so we're going to get this 1 over x squared e to the ln gone composition inverse functions you got it we're just getting 1 or x squared let's multiply that everywhere let's see what happens so from here we know that we had a DV DX we know we have a minus 2 over x times V and then we have this X and to multiply that integrating factor of Rho of X on both sides it's going to distribute we're gonna get 1 over x squared looking good and what a r x squared no problem and 1 over x squared and let's simplify what we have this would be this 1 over x squared DV DX minus 2 over X cubed times B equals 1 of X and we're gonna get another absolute value of x so could we define this as greater than 0 yep you could but we're trying to put a few domain restrictions as possible and simplify as much as we can since we wouldn't be able to simplify with this you know see it in a minute I'm gonna leave it just X is not equal to 0 okay let's check our work as the derivative of this equal to this it is it's looking looking awesome now we know it one ear then the left hand side is the result of a product rule of 1 over x squared times a teen on the right hand side we still have 1 over X let's do an integral on both sides with respect to our independent variable X on the left hand side we get 1 over x squared on the right hand side we get Ln absolute value of x yes we need it plus C we're almost done whenever we do this we've got to replace it V at the very end with whatever function of Y we use so in our better derivatives V is always a function of Y that doesn't include X's so that we can that's not true I'm sorry it's usually a function of Y that that doesn't include X's we will see on last example we can't alter that but what we're trying to do here is replace that V with whatever function we we used we got rid of them so in our case we got rid of Y square root of the V let's solve for V first and then we're gonna have to replace that V with that Y squared so multiplying both sides by x squared we get that x squared and then times Ln absolute value of X plus C I mentioned something just a minute ago I said that because we're not going to be able to simplify our expert the absolute value of x we really didn't need the domain restriction of X greater than zero so if you had to get rid of that absolute value we'd have done that we don't really have to do that so we're gonna leave it and then our last step because we used our substitution to get away from Y squared into V now we're gonna use it to get away from feet back into y squared that is about as good as we can make it so again is it necessary all the time use one particular technique for everything a problem that you get and the answer's no it's not sometimes we can have them sometimes a different technique will give us an easier way to get exactly the same answer same answer but we avoided all the homogeneous set up so we didn't need to divide by 2 X Y we didn't need to define some of those things the same way and we still get the same thing so just a quick look at that make sure that when we're doing this that the key points here are that you have to wrap up every instance of Y in some form of be either V itself Y squared becomes V or DV DX so the derivative of your function of y equals whatever derivative you have on the left hand side connected to a dy/dx then we substitute Y squared equals V great the derivative equals DV DX and typically works out very very nicely let's take a look at another exam and then we'll come back with with two more in there last one which is really interesting you gotta hang out the last one so next up okay we see this so could we do a homogeneous yes yeah we could divide everything by X Y squared is actually not all that bad what's gonna happen is we're gonna looks like we have beaten a of two maybe I'm not sure well we divide everything by this and then we have to go through do homogeneous create a separable equation not really a huge issue but can't we do it differently with an embedded derivative well let's take a look do you see a function that if you take a derivative of it you are going to get something on the left hand side typically the left hand side so in other words do you see a function of Y that when we take a derivative of it the derivative is there with a dy/dx next to it yeah I see that if I called the Y cubed and I take the derivative of it both sides DV DX three Y squared dy DX implicit derivative we get chain rules make it wait a minute no that's not the same that this one that says three that says no three one really does look just like we did with au so on integrals man just just solve for the piece you want to replace so if DV DX equals 3y squared dy DX but you don't want the three let's just divide both sides by three then we have one-third DV DX equals y squared dy DX that way we can replace all of the y squared dy DX we'll leave the X we'll replace all of the Y squared dy DX with this one-third DV DX is that makes sense I hope that makes sense in your head that you're going oh yeah okay it's just like it used up it's basically the same thing we're just doing sort of a double substitution we're calling the function of y equal to a B then the derivative that's going to yield a DV DX replace the function with of Y the derivative of function with Y with du by DX with whatever that equals so let's solve for what we want to place and that's the idea or replacing this with me the derivative is 3 y squared dy DX we only really want to replace y squared dy DX so solve for that piece in your derivative and then we can replace this whole thing with 1/3 DV DX let's do that now so maybe she try to your own so if we go ahead and replace that we'll get on the left hand side we still have an X but that y squared dy DX this piece is 1/3 DV DX on the right hand side we still have X cube no problem but we don't have Y cubed anymore we call that V and this isn't exactly what we need to happen all of our wives are gone we replace the Y function with the limit dy DX with the derivative of that function should be some matter of DV DX in this case we had a 1/3 sure because we did not have a 3 there that's exactly what we were looking for after that man this this still looks linear we have a DV DX so we have something that's adding to the first power in terms of our dependent variable let's make this x over 3 minus B equals x cubed hopefully you're seeing the linear a little bit easier these points man but linear means that we have DV DX by itself then adders are attracted to a function of X V to the first we're pretty close let's multiply everything by the reciprocal of x over 3 so 3 over X so when we do that when we do that we need to write our domain restriction we know that X can't be 0 but because I'm gonna get a linear and because I'm not gonna get an L n over here notice that we get x squared because of that I'm gonna say that let's just make X greater than 0 that way we don't do with those absolute values don't run into any other domain issues so we're gonna do this we're gonna get this DVD X minus 3 over x times V and then we get this 3x squared that's looking pretty nice so far can you do the rest can you find our integrating factor can you multiply everything by it can you do the result of a product rule and take an integral I bet you can we should try it so for us integrating factor with it is e to the negative 3 integral of 1 over X DX well that's equal to e to the negative 3 Ln X is greater than 0 we don't need an absolute value that's e to the Ln X to the negative third power removing that coefficient is an exponent inverse functions are composed we just get 1 over X cubed let's multiply everything here in this nice form of a linear by 1 over X cubed if we do that well we still have DV DX we still have the 3 over x times V we said 3 x squared but now we're gonna multiply the 1 over X cubed so multiply both sides every terms going to get in [Applause] Oh hands wrong they're gonna get absolute Betty vex good thing I had that greater than zero nothing start out maybe simplifying probably tell em no okay so on the left-hand side this is the result of a product rule we can go straight for that derivative with respect to X of whatever the product of the functions you wouldn't have taken the derivative out so that's 1 over X cubed times V on the right hand side we get 3 over X ok let's take an integral of both sides and respect to X so left hand side integral of a derivative give us 1 over X cubed times V on the right hand side we're gonna have 3 ln no absolute value of x because again we define our domain that way we are going to get a plus C however man we're almost done there's only two things that we need to do let's solve for V as much as possible and then we'll replace V with the function that we replaced so we use the V to replace a function we're going to use the function to replace to be solve for V first though could you take the three and make it Ln of X cubed yeah you certainly could does it does it matter debate depends not really the only thing that we got to be concerned about is that what we're gonna do here well I think I pointed the wrong thing we what we get into here is we have to replace the function the V with the function y that we use them initially so we replaced Y cubed with me we're gonna now replace V with Y cubed and whether you want to write the X cubed first or last it doesn't really matter that's the idea we're looking for a function of Y that when you take a derivative of it you also have the variables and dy/dx in there and that's exactly we've done B is Y cubed great we've got a 3y squared dy DX no we just need Y's for dy/dx that gives us something a little bit different to substitute but it's just that constant coefficient it's not a big deal so we we don't lose it and it's gonna affect this of course but it's not gonna ruin this sort of technique for us so nice thing it comes up with a linear we may get a domain restriction and it works out really nicely so I hope it's making sense to you I'm gonna come back with two more examples let's try a couple more so take a look at our differential equation homogeneous yep you could write it as homogeneous do we have to know let's look for an embedded derivative see that this can be a little bit nicer for us so instead of dividing by x and y go ahead and writing well probably be to the negative one again and then B itself and doing all that stuff maybe with common denominators not super fun let's go ahead and find a vendor it embedded derivative what we're looking for is just just like au so this is a forward integration so we're looking for a function of Y like Y squared that the derivative matches up disregarding our constants so if we take our V equals y squared and we take a derivative of that with respect to X since Y is a function of X we have an implicit there we got that chain rule dy/dx and then we say well yeah you know what hey the derivative of Y squared is 2 is 2y but it is why do you ID X let's solve for that substitution let's solve for y D by DX so 1/2 DV DX equals y dy DX and now we're ready to make this this double substitution one for the function of Y one for the dy/dx with a derivative of function y attached to it and that's going to replace every instance of Y that's exactly what we want so we're gonna leave our X but we're gonna get Y dy DX is one-half DV DX on the right hand side we get x squared plus we did replace the 3 we replace just the y squared now it's still linear so we have a DV DX we have V the first power to no other cases of V it's added to that x squared so let's go ahead let's write this in linear format pretty close but we know that with Lennie we want that DV DX by itself we want the D dependent variable over independent variable without anything connected to it being multiplied so we're gonna have to multiply by 2 over X now when we do that we're gonna have a domain restriction because we're multiplying by something where X can't be 0 so I'm not gonna show here but we're multiplying everything by 2 over X this whole entire piece so that gives us DV DX minus 6 over x times V and then 2 X and we know X can be 0 in order for us to make this technique work and that's the domain restrictions we have to show that otherwise we get stuck how we do it you gotta find that X ray yeah okay make sure it's on 0 so let's do that we multiplied by two over X or multiplied by 2 divided by X DV DX looks good let me get this minus 6 over X V great that's linear and we get this 2x not a problem now let's find our integrating this factor by taking a look at our thumb to the becks in front of our B to the first power if you're wondering why I didn't do X greater than 0 that's in your mind right now it's linear once you do agreed and 0 I didn't do in the first one either because I saw that that's a power 6 no matter what that's gonna be positive so it doesn't really matter let's see so this would be X to the negative sixth power well if we think about that that's gonna be one over absolutely of X but then to the sixth power we would get composition inverse functions no problem this is going to be 1 over X to the sixth that's an integrating factor that we're gonna use for this example let's multiply everything by that so we started with a DV DX we have also this minus 6 over x times B on the right hand side we get 2x so let's multiply everything by 1 over X to the sixth if we simplify just a bit it's pretty easy to see that we have the result of our product rule that's kind of nice because that means that our that means that our integrating factor worked for us as far as this linear we could double check it really quickly to see this is X is negative 6 we bring down the 6 subtract 1 negative 7 put it back that's the derivative of this piece which means that this is the resulting apart from let's just write the product on the right hand side we get two over X to the fifth and we are ready we're ready taking the integral this looks great the integral of derivative dawn we get 1 over X to the sixth times V on the right hand side we'll rewrite that just a little bit but pretty easy to integrate so let's take that integral right now with respect to X so left hand side integral derivative we get 1 over X to the 6 times B on the right hand side let's make this the integral of 2 X to the negative fifth power DX and that way when we integrate it's a little bit nice a little bit nicer to see that so let's see we're gonna add 1 so adding 1 that's gonna be negative 4 divided by a new exponent plus C just simplify a bit it's like negative 1/2 or yeah looks about right so 2 4 negative 1 over 2 X to the 4th get a plus C C went down what else has to happen well we still have a V we're gonna have to replace that but I always like solving for V as much as possible before I do if I can so I'm gonna multiply everything times X to the 6th power see if we get that so multiplying by X to the 6 that would be negative x squared over 2 or negative 1/2 x squared then we have C X to the 6th that's lookin fine to you that's the last thing hey we used lead to replace a function of Y let's just replace V with that function of Y so that as good as we can make it one thing we could see you might see a couple different different instances here you could see is someone because we don't really want to solve that explicit for y we disrupt dealing with plus or minus square roots nasty stuff so what we could do instead is multiply everything by two so we multiply everything by two we could get and if you call this C sub 1 then that to C sub 1 we can just rewrite that as C and so 1 if your nutrients are looking different they're probably just messing around like this that looks a little bit nicer so multiplying by 2 we get the 2's squared we saw the negative x squared and a 2 C sub 1 call that C sub 1 C and then we have C X and 6 minus x squared and that's how this this could look so just let me know that's possible hope it's making sense hopefully you understand that we're looking for embedded derivative still I'm just showing you that these can be easier than homogeneous let's do two more I'm gonna start showing you at a slightly different technique so far all of our event derivatives they've had to be just a V equals a function of Y and that is fine but it doesn't have to be that way so I'm gonna show you in this one mm-hm this is gonna make this problem so much easier than we had in homogeneous so if you think about this as far as homogeneous if you learn right that homogeneous Wow you'd have to sum you'd have to subtract your X you'd have to divide everything by Y you'd have an x over Y are you seeing it you'd have to reciprocate that with a negative exponent and then you have this divided by Y you'd have to put a domain restriction of Y so you use a square root Y squared put that in there have another V to a negative power and be the first power and it's pretty darn nasty we spent a long time doing that with a homogeneous equation they used that homogeneous substitution that was nasty let's see if this is easier now I want you to I want to notice something this is a lot of people would fall into this you know we'll wait the derivative of this is 2y dy/dx couldn't I just do that and say here's ye y DX I don't know if you could is there a better way yes sometimes what we can do is we can wrap up everything here with a derivative of something involving exes so I'm gonna rewrite this just slightly I don't look at that and go how do you know what that looks like a derivative of x and y wait a minute I have a mixin Y right there why don't we turn this whole piece and call that V can you use a V with an event derivative that includes exes yes it doesn't happen very often most times it's just white but yeah I can let's call this whole thing V unless you see what happens why why I think well that why why I'm thinking about that is because even if I call this piece of e it's still gonna be nasty cuz I'm gonna the square root of an x squared plus V what do I do with that I don't know I don't know that's really nasty so what if we can call this whole thing V and then get away with doing a derivative of it and replacing the full left side that's gonna be sweet so let's try it so V is the whole inside piece this composition idea remember that how we had it's obvious substitution so it's not that obvious but we're trying to make this embedded derivative work for us and sort of an obvious substitution way let's call this whole thing V let's take a derivative well no wait a second a derivative respect to X so DV DX no problem x squared derivative of x squared with respect to X is just 2x the derivative of Y squared with respect to X it's to Y but then we get a dy/dx that doesn't look the same as that site no it does it but just like before we don't care about our constants let's solve for the piece that we want to get rid of let's solve for the piece that we can sell so if we take this a bill that's justify to wait a minute so if we factor out a 2 oh that is sweet if we factor out a 2 maybe / - this is up so not only have we replaced the inside with the V that's gonna be really nice there's the square root of V easy on the left hand side we now take a derivative of V and DV DX we get 2x plus 2y dy DX er said would wait wait just to bite man if you factor out a 2 then we can replace x + y dy DX in this entire side with just 1/2 DV DX let's do that double substitution now so left hand side x + y dy DX that's equal to 1/2 DV DX that's great every instance of Y on the left hand side is gone it's wrapped up enough DV DX on the right hand side we'd have square root of B Wow wait a minute that's it that's it that's ripped that's a man that's separable right there that we don't have Lennie around nothing as far as is being a hard sort of an integral let's move let's move our these TVs are constants DX so we have 1 over square root V DV equals to V DX let's integrate both sides with respect to X well that's going to be an integral of V to the negative 1/2 power DV on the right hand side you get just 2x plus c left hand side let's finish that integral off let's see we add one that'd be V to the 1/2 divided by a new exponent something divided by 1/2 means multiplying by 2 so this would be 2 square root B equals 2x plus C you know what I might do I might just call this C sub 1 and C sub 1 and C sub 1 that way you can divide by 2 I still wrap that up as a constant but I get rid of that too let's do that now so dividing everything by 2 let's call that C sub 1 over 2 just arbitrary constant are we done do we need anything else let's see we have replaced every part every piece every term every factor everything that involved wise with a V we use that substitution create something with a dy/dx in it that was a derivative of the piece that we chose for me that was replaced with DV DX one half yes because we don't care about constants that led us to just this really nice separable equation that we do an integral we do an integral we solve it as much as we can for V we don't want to start I don't want start squaring things right now what I want to do instead is wait if V is x squared plus y squared let's just replace that so the square root of x squared plus y squared equals x plus C done that's as that's as much as I want out of that if you look back at these at the same example when we did it homogeneous it was at least three times the work so doing better derivatives work every time no they don't but when you do work typically work really nice do you have to only have V equals a function of Y no that happens most of the time when you get these examples but it doesn't happen have to happen all of the time in fact if you combine what we think about an obvious substitution with this idea of an embedded it works really nice so try that try and see if you can wrap up something bigger and then the derivative is also there if it is great if not then you have to make something smaller we're going to try one more example mum show you something that's slightly different than this so this is a great example to see at hope see it's really neat then you can wrap this whole thing up as a B and the derivative still there this works occasionally the next one is a little bit more advanced of an idea we're gonna deal with that one there's one problem took a long time to look really weird and I'm gonna show you how to deal with it with this embedded derivatives so hang on for that one all right let's try one more on this gorgeous little thing you might remember it because it looks so nasty really yeah yeah because I need to show you one more thing that we can do so when we're taking a look at this through the lens of an embedded derivative and you don't want to do a homogeneous or Bernoulli and that's what we did the first time we did this with the Bernoulli equation so that would be in that video we back at Bernoulli equation look it I think it's like the last one or something that is just ugly how in the world is that Bernoulli well if you divide this and you move your Y to the negative two Y of Y you have a wide Omega - that's a written equation and you can solve it that way can we make it easier yes but it takes a little looking at because right now I don't see anything that I can take a derivative of that has a function of Y in it if it matches up with our dy/dx that doesn't I don't see anything there so this is one of the cases where we can kind of outsmart this problem you know well I can't find any V substitution it's obvious I can't find a V substitution that makes this a derivative work for me so maybe I look at the derivative Department ok well let's think about this let's look at X dy/dx plus V you know that looks like the result of a product rule right there doesn't it yeah well wait a minute wait if I if I had if this was the result of a product rule X would be part of the product through X is 1 through wise do my DX Y would be part of the so this comes from the result of a product rule of Y times X notice that derivative leave the Y alone dy/dx derivative Y is 1 and then you have a y let's call this piece V and let's just see what happens so if that piece is V then obviously the derivative of V with respect to X is going to give us exactly this piece you know yeah absolutely because we'd say X dy/dx plus derivative of X is 1 times y so that lets us go ok ok I'm gonna be been able to replace this whole piece with DV DX does that make sense to you are you getting that this piece is DV DX will wait that doesn't help me with my Y's well it sure does because if V involves Y isn't here involves X is also that's ok remember embedded derivatives cannibal X is most of the time don't but they can't involve X's so if this is your function or sorry if this is your dream of DV DX and it doesn't help you with lies well your involves wise can't you just solve for y as long as X does not equal 0 should be able to do that let's go ahead and make our substitution so we remember I'm gonna do it two different parts I'm gonna replace it this which is DV DX I'm gonna leave all this alone X is fine X is our independent variable that's ok so this piece becomes DV DX we have a 1 plus X to the fourth 1/2 power equals x and we have a y squared right now so I want to take a look to make sure this works for you what's there an obvious sort of a choice for V whose derivative is also up there no there wasn't so we thought backwards look at the dy/dx can you choose a V who when you take a derivative of it gives you that piece well yeah in fact this is the result of a product rule x times y ok are those always easy to see no they're not this one was but they're not always that easy so if I take a derivative yeah DVD X and then we owe my gosh should get the exact same piece this whole piece gets replaced with DV DX I still have a y squared I'm about to replace it I still have all this message ugh now about the Y's I mention it but I want to make sure it sinks in if you have a V equals some function of x and y solve for that y and you can replace the Y's it's sort of thinking backwards and before in all the other examples you see the choice of V equals y first and then you go ahead and find your derivative here we use the derivative to pick our choice for x and y and then made the wife fit and that's what we're doing here so this led to this leads to solve for y oh now I can replace my Y with y over X sorry we've done with V over X so y squared no no no let's do V over x squared and then we have a DV DX and we still have all this nasty stuff what's that look like does it look linear to you does it look like you have a term that's added that has C to the first power no it doesn't in fact is everything multiplied and divided yeah this needs to be a separable equation for us so what we're going to look at is that's V squared multiplied by DV DX that's crazy we have an x squared we've got this can be divided we have an x over here let's write this as a separable equation so we already ate our domain restriction no problem let's just start simplifying so V over x squared we know that exponents distribute across multiplication and division let's divide this let's move our X's and our D X's on one side RVs and D B's are already on an appropriate side so we're going to get this V squared DVD on the right hand side well if we multiply by x squared we'll get X cubed over one plus X to the fourth to the one-half power and then it's a nice little convention we have that we can separate that demand that derivative or the into that differential sort of form so let's make sure it works this led us to the idea of e then we use our V to replace our wise take a derivative to replace this whole mess of crap with DV DX and it works out nicely perceptible so we've separated our variables we have these TVs we have X's DX's we're ready to take an integral on both sides so left hand side let's see one third b cubed right hand side looks like the basic use of how that works is very similar to most of these embedded derivatives where you have to solve for the piece that you're trying to substitute so D you over 4 equals x cubed DX that's great so we give this integral we do so we get this integral of x cubed DX note we call that D over 4 1 plus X to the fourth to the 1/2 no we're going to do you two 1/2 we write in that just a bit let's pull the 1/4 out we'll have integral of U to the negative 1/2 do you okay that's 1/4 let's see we add 1/2 excrement plus our constant 4 times 1/2 that's 2 so 1/2 you to the White House yeah but you is one plus X to the fourth and then to the 1/2 plus C let's go ahead and write that what else can we do what would you do what let's think about replacing V with what V is equal to but before that it's often nice to solve for B as much as possible in this case we're going to at least want to multiply by three everywhere so I'm gonna call this C sub 1 and C sub 1 and C sub 1 so when I multiply by 3 I can wrap that up a little nicer so V Q equals 1/2 on the right this way too because I'm seeing a fraction here so I want 1 plus X to the fourth to the 1/2 over 2 plus C sub 1 and I'm gonna multiply everything by 3 so 3 times 1/3 gives us B cube ok times 3 times 3 because I've gotta distribute the right hand side now I'm gonna wrap this up I'm gonna wrap this up as a C but I don't so I'm seeing this this fraction maybe I want to write this as one fraction so here's another thing that we can do if we put this over to the 1/3 let's see common denominator of 2 went I have to multiply by 2 over 2 yeah so I would get this since 60 said whatever to the point is I don't care whether it's 3 C sub 1 or 6 east of 106 million C sub 1 it's still arbitrary does not matter what that is and so when we write this as one fraction and we do a plus 6 C sub 1 don't worry about that just put a plus C that arbitrary constant does not matter what that is you will have this over to though that was all nature of getting common denominators so rest of us manage is this some algebra let's let's go ahead and let's replace our are you with what X is let's go ahead and put it over here so reviews must be can be multiplied everything by 3 we know that arbitrary does mean arbitrate the matter with that is let's wrap up all of our constants together as a plus C and now we are ready let's replace this with what V equals so V is excellent so we don't use this we already have these use this one these x times y so this would be x y cubed all the stuff that means we're going to get X cubed times y cubed okay and this is the reason why I chose right this is one fraction because now we can divide both sides by X cubed we already have our domain restriction we can do that if we divided by X cubed we just now have X cubed on the bottom of one fraction instead of splitting this over two fractions it's a reason why we do it so instead of rewriting all this we're gonna go okay yes let's just divide everything by X cube this is gone we get X cubed and that's what we're looking for okay the same answer done a different way with Bernoulli but this time you have to deal with a lot of those that technique this was basic but it was important for you to see what we actually can do is synthetic derivative technique does it always have to be wise no it involved X's but if it does involve X's darn well better make sure that it includes the whole entire piece surrounding you by DX all right also the end this one this one's very special we can go backwards sometimes so nothing else is working for you and you see that that looks it's triggering something your head like man that looks nothing like like the result of a product rule do it call that V then solve your V for y and you can replace all your otherwise with the B's and x's and that's exactly we want one dependent one independent variable it makes sense I hope you see the utility in this technique how it really does make stuff doesn't look a lot more streamlined but at least you get another way and it can be a lot easier than something's homogeneous or Bernoulli or another technique so I hope I've made this make sense to you practice them start looking for them sometimes if you look at hey I see that and the more you the more you do them the the more often you'll start seeing these embedded derivatives ago I can do it that way man that saved me a headache as far as this technique is that was really hard so I would encourage you go back and look at these examples from the previous videos and see which one you would rather do again people like homogeneous because it's predictable and same thing with renewed is very predictable but this can save us time so it's kind of a double-edged sword there so anyway we're gonna move on and I'll show you a different substitution technique involving some reducible second-order derivative of differential equations next time have a great day you 

Transcript for: Reducible Second Order Differential Equations, Missing Y (Differential Equations 26)
hey it's time to talk about something new so so far we've really only had techniques that have worked with first-order differential equations or very very very special second-order and this is this is one of those times too but we're gonna do a certain to this technique so what we're getting in this class is we are gonna start talking about some applications in a few more videos and then ask that we're going to talk about how we can how we can deal with higher order differential equations so we're we're about to get there again videos before that but right now it's kind of this this thought like are there techniques to deal with higher order differential equations yes of course there are and this is one of them so how we can deal with some second-order differential equations differential equations have a second derivative of Y with respect to X in them can we deal with them and the answer is sometimes a lot of times if there are certain form definitely this is one of those forms so when we have something that we call a reducible second-order differential equation we need know what that means and then we need to know how to work with it so what reducible means is that we can make a substitution and in making this substitution typically a variable that represents the first derivative okay if the variable represents the first derivative then the derivative of that variable would represent the second derivative and then second derivative looks like a first derivative first derivative like a variable okay we reduced it one order into a first order differential equation that we can work with but there's only a couple cases that actually work so when's it work this works if we have a second order differential equation where we are missing a variable completely we're missing Y or where we're missing X and there's two different cases and we're going to talk about both of those cases you might wonder well what about the two cases there's no third we'll talk about that so when we have a second order differential equation that we are missing the Y variable I don't mean Y to the first power Y to the second power I mean just the function of so I said everyone not the first derivative second derivative why I mean just the function of Y itself we're missing the function of Y or when we're missing the function of X I'm not talking about missing Y the derivative of Y I'm talking about Y itself I'll see that we'll talk about it but that's when we would call these a reducible first order difference of the clay I'm sorry reducible second order differential equation when we can call the first derivative a variable then the derivative the first variable represents the second derivative of Y and we could replace both of them to reduce it by an or that's the idea to use one of the techniques we already know how to deal with that's what we're looking to get out of it so we're gonna take a look at it what to do and then how to do it so what to do why this works what's gonna happen here we're going to talk about just missing the Y variable first in this video and next we will talk about when what happens when you miss an X video a X variable so when we get we look at it what if we were to call D by DX so the first derivative of Y with respect to X just a very very well then if he represents the first derivative of Y with respect to X then wouldn't the second derivative of Y be represented as the derivative of P with respect to X I mean shoot if P represents the first derivative then the derivative of P would represent the second derivative and that's exactly what we're gonna do and you go we'll wait a minute it's that easy yep that's it if Y is missing it's that easy what about otherwise I mean we don't you have to have a substitution for y no that's the whole point I gone so if Y is gone we don't have to replace Y with anything that's why this technique works so we say okay call the first derivative P then the second derivative is the derivative of P that's it if the first derivative is P itself the derivative of P would represent the second derivative of Y that's a yeah now what about X go I'm not dealing with it in this this video but the next one that will well we do the same thing we go okay well then then why crying what equal dpdx sure but if my ex is gone then that with respect to X is really hard to deal with and so we do something else we say okay let's sound let's use a little bit of the chain rule idea and say deep if we can write DP DX as DP dy times dy DX oh whoa okay so hang on hang on dy DX is P then we can write the second derivative of Y as P DP dy because this should not alignment that's the idea so if Y is gone it's easier a little bit easier to see you just do a straight-up substitution if X has gone a little bit more involved we have some P times DP dy which gives us the third case what if both of them are gone what what if you don't have an X and you don't have a why choose this one most of the time because it's a little bit easier so if you have a choice between them and both x and y are gone you just have the derivatives of Y up there choose that one a little bit nicer most of the time so that's what I'm gonna encourage you to do so case three is what the book done so anyway let's go ahead and give this a try this is the idea and hopefully it's making sense of what we're doing a man if you if you're missing a lie you don't have to replace the Y with anything let's call the first derivative a variable then the second derivative is just the derivative of that variable it's going to reduce the the order of our derivatives by one same similar something similar for X's but we have to deal with the fact that X is gone and so we're gonna have a little bit of manipulation here to say okay the first derivative is P greater the second derivative is P times DP dy and we'll deal with that in the next video let's give this one a try so is it reducible is it is a differential equation is this second-order differential equation that happens to be reducible where you start using some Prime's here because when we get to higher derivatives it's very cumbersome right to everywhere and three everywhere and seven everywhere if we get to that so we deal with a lot of these crimes or when we get to higher derivatives and you write a third derivative we write it like that so that's a notational convention that we're going to use pretty much from here on out when we do with these higher derivatives so Y double prime says the second derivative of Y minus is the first derivative why is it a second-order differential equation is it reducible well is it missing a very warm yeah it's missing the variable Y it has the variable X so we're gonna try to do a substitution I don't want you just following rule so once you understand it if we can do this and say hey let's just call ki the first derivative of Y with respect to X alright well then what's what's y double Prime what's the second derivative then the derivative of P with respect to X would equal the second derivative of Y with respect to X or Y double prime that gives us a very very nice substitution that we made so are we still gonna have an X of course but this changes to x times the second to L look P was the first derivative the derivative of P with respect to X is the second derivative so y double prime is DP DX y prime itself well my prime stands for the first trip that's just P that that's it do you notice what it does if you call the first derivative of variable then the derivative of that variable is the second derivative it's reduced the order of this differential equation by one now so notes for you do not forget to substitute back in you're gonna have a P floating around you have to deal with that and then you have to do another integral so do not forget about that and then secondly because we have a second order differential equation you should end with two arbitrary constants we're doing integration twice on two different things and so we're gonna get that so let's take a look at it now we have x DP da okay so our sort of first order differential equation now is in terms of a dependent variable P with an independent variable X it's separable let's separate this so that means that we can group our P's DP and our X DX we'll talk about domain a little bit you're gonna hear this quite often but a lot of times you're gonna hear assume X or Y or these variables to be positive we're convenient or necessary or something along those lines and so they don't even write it I think he should we don't have to write greater than zero here but we certainly need to make sure that we understand that your first derivative can't be zero that would I mean you'd have a constant there for your life it was so but your first trivet can't be zero but we definitely don't want to say that X can't be 0 but you're gonna hear that a lot like assume these conditions to be positive where necessary or convenient well okay so let's see second rule the first derivative is a variable second derivative is the derivative of that variable no problem separable claim we got PDP get 1 over X DX let's integrate both sides on the left hand side we'll get Ln absolute value of P on the right hand side we'll get Ln absolute value of x plus C sub 1 well it's kind of nice let's let's solve for P now here's the point you're gonna have to solve for P or have something that's going to be decent because you're going to replace p with what P equals which is the first derivative of Y so that P is going to become your first derivative you're gonna have to do another integral and so we want to solve for P as much as possible so that our integrations easier well what that means is that we're gonna take the DS as exponents on e so e to the and e to them well that it gives us absolute value P equals do you remember it this would be e to the Ln absolute value of x times e to the C sub 1 we don't composition inverse functions we're going to get just absolute value of X but we can also do this we can also say let's wrap up those absolute values as plus and minus B to the C sub 1 times just X all of this right here can be your Barba trade constant now I'm gonna leave it for just a bit I'm gonna it's gonna look kind of nasty but I'm gonna leave that there for just a bit to show you what's gonna happen at the very very end so can you write this as C sure you can't and you know why I guess it doesn't really matter if we do or not it doesn't it doesn't super matter if you want to write that as C right now fine but we're gonna be changing it again later so I'm gonna leave it there now the point of all this the point is that well the census is a first order differential equation it was fairly easy to solve but now we understand that it was reducible we're gonna kind of have to unreduced it we're gonna have to say well he represents something don't forget to sub soup I can't you mean your variable here is not P that you want to solve for its Y so if P represents the first derivative that's the substitution we made it yielded this substitution so we're able to do both like this double substitution idea we've been dealing with it for a long time but now that it reduced the order we solved it now I understand P means dy/dx you go oh wow that's still separable actually if we think about this as a group you're wise be wise and your X is DX that's a really nice separable difference relation or you can think about it this way you can think about it as that's basic integration you could just integrate both sides right now with with respect to X that's fine well we do and we integrate let me say okay then on the left hand side we get Y on the right hand side we get plus or minus e to the C sub 1 X plus C sub 2 well I'm sorry x squared over 2 plus C sub 2 so integral of 1 dy is y integral of this whole thing is a constant so constant we have X to the first power add 1/2 by my new constant that's plus or minus e to the C sub 1 over 2 and then plus C sub 2 this is why I said we're gonna get two arbitrary constants here you're getting great once you get an arbitrary constant it's still in there you integrate again you're going to get my another arbitrary constant it's still in there so I mentioned something a little while ago that we're gonna change this again this is the reason why I didn't change it at first it's because I'm gonna wrap this whole thing up in a constant could you have just said let's make this C sure and then this whole thing is C not a problem and this whole thing is C not a problem this whole thing is C yeah but you're gonna have to wrap this up in a different seat so if you wanted to do this I would suggest calling a C sub 2 C sub 2 C sub 2 C sub 2 and then the C sub 3 that way we get y equals C sub 2 over 2 x squared plus C sub 3 now I want to tell you one more thing we're gonna wrap this up is another arbitrary constant and this is going to happen a lot in in these reducible second-order differential equations that they represent families of curves with two arbitrary constants so most of the time you'll see them a and B so instead of C sub anything with these subscripts you'll say Alice let's just call this C sub 2 over 2 let's call that an arbitrary constant a and then C so let's call it an arbitrary constant B and you're gonna see that an awful lot what that means is that's that family of curves let's see those are parabolas so those are cratylus upper open downward-opening narrow or wide that are on they have a vertex on the wax it's shifted up and down isn't that interesting so this second order difference equation the result of the solution of that is a family of curves that are all parabolas very kind of neat I hope you understand the technique that we're going to do for more examples there get a little bit more involved here this is the most basic that I could I could get but the idea is replace the first derivative with a variable that automatically reduces the order then the derivative of that variable represents the second derivative of your of your why replace them typically a bit very nice integral just don't forget that this is second order so when you figure out the first differential equation you've got to solve for dy/dx and do it again or find some other technique to be able to do it again let's move on and check out another example let's learn about two more of these so let's take a look at our second order differential equation and we look at and go okay I don't know how to deal with those so unless they're super easy and we just integrate twice no problem but if they're reducible then I can reduce the order of this differential equation by one do the integral then do it again and so what we're looking at is this idea that these are reducible if we have X missing or Y missing there's two different cases in this case we're looking to go hey why is missing that's the nicest case because that's a direct substitution if we replace the first derivative with a variable P then the second derivative would be the derivative of that P with respect to X the same variable so first derivative we'd call that a variable then the second derivative is just the derivative of that variable very nice substitution let's go ahead and do that now so we're gonna leave everything else but we're gonna replace the second derivative Y double prime with the derivative of P because we can replace Y prime first derivative with P itself so X no problem DP DX no problem plus the derivative of Y the derivative of y respect X is P we do Forex what does it look like to you genius does it look like a first order what technique fits in best well it looks linear because we have this dpdx we have P to the first power we have a function of X no other P's and not separable can I do it linear is don't you have to divide by X no you know what I mean no after you divided by X you would get 1 over X here you'd have e to the Ln of sorry e to the Ln of 1 over X sorry e to the 7 alone you have e to the Ln X e to the Ln X would give you X you multiply X back you get exactly the same thing this right here is actually the result of a product rule already look at that the derivative of P with respect X the X alone the derivative of X is 1 leave the P alone that's the result of a product rule so even if you want you know I'll show to you if you wanted to go through and divide this I'm gonna race this but divide everything by X of course X would have to be nonzero or you get a greater than zero so it's positive we're convenient we go right well e to the Ln X because integral of 1 over X DX gives you Ln X that would give you X let's multiply that X gone X BAM it's the same exact thing so even if you use an integrating factor the integrating factor would be X the thing that you're dividing by it would be the ingredient that you put right back it's like that first time I ever showed you linear I said if you've got a divide you're right now you're dividing by that piece you're trying to find let's not do that so this whole left side that's the result of a product rule where you would have X and P notice leave the first alone derivative the second derivative the first thing the second alone that's it that's a little product rule very cool on the right hand side we just have 4x it's ready for us all we've got to do is take an integral on both sides with respect to X we're gonna do that now level 1 works out like that and girls derivatives awesome we get x times P right hand side we would get well let's see for X add 1 to the exponent divide by the new exponent that would be 2 x squared plus C sub 1 that's our first arbitrary constant that also mentioned well you you probably should get P by itself if you can so let's divide by X keep it in mind that X can't be 0 for us to do that that's important so what do we do what do we do now so after we have this well taken care of as far as our first-order difference equation plot and substitution we need to understand that you cannot forget to resub stitute this means something this means the derivative of Y with respect to X so if P equals this and this represents the solution to the first derivative now thankfully if we're able to solve for P this is typically something very simple so that's something to go okay yeah derivative Y this Rex all I'm gonna do is integrate that if I want to move my DX think about this more like a differential form cool if not take it to an integral right now with respect to X on both sides either way works so let's write this as separating this set bull equation in its most basic sense let's take an integral on both sides this would be y equals okay that's x squared plus C sub 1 is a constant but we do get Ln X if we don't make the restriction that X's has to be greater than zero well then we've got to show that there's an absolute value if you do make that restriction you can omit the absolute value plus C sub two man that looks looks pretty nice the only other thing that we've got to do is it's not super great to write C sub 1 6 & 2 all the time and it's not it's not a problem it just looks a little bit cleaner to write this as x squared plus a Ln absolute value X close to me what's the idea if we're missing Y if we're missing the variable Y that second-order differential equation is reducible we call the first derivative a variable the second derivative would be the derivative of that variable very nice so use a technique to solve the first order differential equation that's the result of that substitution and then replace that P don't looking like that with the first string and basically do it again you shouldn't it with two arbitrary constants either C sub 1 C sub 2 5 or 8 and B's it does not matter that's a bad that's about it the only other thing I always say is watch your domain restriction so if you wanted to not have to deal with absolute value you'd have to define that differently just be careful with it okay let's look at the second one why don't you try it right now take a minute and just write out what substitution we work I'm gonna race this for just a second but I want you thinking is it a differential equation obviously is it a first-order second-order obvious it's a second-order is it is it missing a variable which means it's reducible once missing why oh great if it's missing why then I can straight up do a substitution for the first derivative and then the result of the derivative that the second derivative so let's call our first derivative P and then the second derivative would be the derivative here with respect to X do our substitution so this is your x squared no problem second derivative is DP DX plus 3x the first derivative is just P and we haven't - isn't that nice man it's so nice level works when it works out like that oh yeah what now well now it's a first order differential equation what's it look like to you it doesn't look separable not like the other ones it looks linear it looks like this one as far as is linear though because we have a DP DX we have add function of x times P in the first no other P's function of X over here or at least a function over there that has involved peas or Y is there anything obviously not Y's are gone so let's try to write this as the linear that it represents so let's divide everything by x squared so this isn't an easy last one when we had that really obvious product of result of applaud what was your nice we're probably gonna have to use our integrating factor here let's go ahead and do it so one thing we'll want to note on the on our work somewhere I don't keep bringing this this up but when you divide by X you you cannot have the X be 0 so we're going to write that but since our an integrating factor if we don't want to deal with that absolute value we're gonna say let's just make X greater than 0 and you that that takes care of the dividing by 0 we don't have that and also takes care of we don't need absolute values so that that's kind of it's very nice and you're gonna see a lot of times as I mentioned that we're convenient right X positive or something so it happens quite a bit okay well now that we have our X's it's our sorry 3 over X being our our RP next to our P well don't worry about that think about the function of X that's gonna be the exponent of our integrating factors so when we do our row racks are gonna create a factor here we have e to the integral of 3 over X or 3 times integral of 1 over X that gives us e to the three Ln X that gives us e to the Ln of X cubed and so that gives us just execute I hope that these are all the stand on issues at this point that you really understand any vector who done just a ton of them let's take that X cube let's multiply it everywhere so we had a DP DX we had a 3 over X and a P and 2 over x squared and we're gonna take an integrating factor of Rho of X in this case do you use integrating factors other places yeah so I can't say this is the integrating factor but it's an integrating factor that we're using here so we're gonna multiply by X cubed and X cubed and X cubed all by distribution on the left hand side this simplifies to 3x squared hey look derivatives is this perfect this simplifies to just 2x so we have the result of a product or a where a product would be X cubed times P on the right hand side we've just got two eggs that's really nice because we can just do a straight-up integral on the right hand side looks really easy on the left hand side same thing as long as we were with respect to eggs so we're gonna get this X cubed times P on the right hand side we have x squared plus C sub 1 let's solve for P as much as possible as divided by X cube so if we divide by X cube we're gonna get 1 over X but we're also going to get C sub 1 over X cubed so let's see next guess 1 or X over X Q okay fantastic now the reason why we solved for P is because if we can do that obviously I mean hopefully it's obvious to you that if you solve for P then when you replace p with what it actually represents with this dy/dx it automatically makes something business-ready to integrate for us it's already there so we're going to do that we're going to say dy is this one over X plus C sub 1 over X cubed DX when we integrate both sides with respect to X we get Y on the right hand side hey that's kind of nice only two fractions this is Ln X we don't need absolute value mainly made this domain restriction and then we have well let's see this would be C sub 1 X to the negative 3 so I'm going to add 1 to that that's C sub 1 X to the negative 2 over negative 2 plus C sub 2 so we're trying to be careful here watching our signs so Ln X - looks like C's that you know what on the lead of LM leave it plus plus C sub 1 over negative 2 times 1 over x squared C sub 2 why am i doing that I'm doing that because I know when I wrap this whole thing up as an arbitrary constant probably a and I don't want to have - as if I don't have to and then I have a cease of - hanging on the back so we have this a line X perfect we have a leisure constant 1 this they go to divided by the new coefficient let's see 100 negative 2 that's going to be wrapped up as another constant plus C 2 so if we want to write this a little cleaner we def Ln absolute value of x + let's call that a so we have a times 100 x squared that's 8 over x squared + mean and you can write that different orders but that's about all we get out of it I hope it's making sense this idea hopefully you're getting it what we're doing right now it should start being very straightforward in your head like yeah I totally get it that the first group is a variable second derivative would be represented by the derivative of that variable then undo the first order resultant differential equation and then just integrate again and you're gonna get two arbitrary constants I'm gonna come back with two more examples we got three to do if there's one example you should really focus on it's this one this has a lot of really good stuff in it for you - no is it basic it looks basic it doesn't end up being all that basic so why don't prime or second derivative let's try to expose x equals x plus y prime for supervisor spec 2x all quantity squared you go okay hey it's its second order is it reducible well let's look is it missing a variable yeah it's missing the variable Y can I make a basic substitution yes I can let's go ahead let's call the first derivative P that way the second derivative is DP DX no problem let's go ahead and let's replace that so the second derivative that's gonna be DP DX on the right hand side you don't replace your exes when you do replace your first derivative remember with every substitution every instance of Y has to be replaced so pull apart derivatives of both of our derivative of Y with respect to X have to be replaced thankfully we don't have any wise uses technique so we don't replace that so there are none of those to replace why it's so streamlined but then we have to empower too if you go ok what now let's just distribute the 2x plus we don't freaking do that you can't do that we have a derivative you strike the X but we have peas and X's is it separable no the linear' know what do I do hey is there an obvious substitution that you can make yes there's a composition right here once we call that composition be ok with obvious substitutions I solve for the dependent variable DP DX because with an obvious substitution you're trying to rap though P or will all of this as a different variable and then you're saying but I need to leave my independent variable get rid of my dependent variable so I need to solve for P I hope you remember this from from these these obvious substitutions you call them typically the composition you call that some variable you go right well let's solve for the dependent variable P that way I can take a derivative of it and do a double substitution idea the whole inside seemed to become V but then I need to be able to also substitute dpdx does that make sense I've got to get rid of that to all of the dependent variable must disappear just like here it did it's got to again alright well so DP DX would equal C function so that would be one DVD X minus 1 because the derivative of X with respect to X is 1 so this chain rule one DV DX this one that gives us something we can substitute so over on the right hand side kind of nice you said this whole thing is V so we have V squared we said all right well with obvious substitutions solve for the dependent variable that way when you take a derivative of it you can also replace DP DX and that's exactly what we have oh so wait a minute so you're saying we can we can use we can reduce the second order to a first order and then all of the techniques are open to us so we did that and go okay how do you do that one it looks like an obvious substitution so V is X plus P awesome solve for your dependent P equals X minus B do a derivative Y because if you're gonna replace that P you'd better replace the DP and so we've done that DP DX is DV DX that's a function of three tags okay minus one awesome and that all do our substitution so that's V squared cool this is DV DX minus one awesome what in the world is that well it's not linear notice that DV DX v squared nonlinear separable yeah let's add one and then have one over V squared plus one equals one hey that's a separable equation let's group RV's TV and our constants or DX and now we are ready to integrate on both sides it looks pretty nice integral of V squared plus one I hope you remember it and we love V squared plus one is tan inverse V squared plus one equals x plus C sub one that's our first arbitrary constant we're going to two of them in this case oh my gosh what in the world did we do now well yeah before we do substitutions it's awful nice to well I totally that was a brain-dead sorry guys that should just be V naught V squared plus one um tan inverse of V just on role I guess equals x plus C sub one just like ever be screwed this month what so any like 10 the integral of 1 over V squared this one is tan inverse of V naught V squared plus 1 equals x plus C sub 1 great ok know what well we got it substitute back in for V but I like to solve for V first if I can let's make V equal to tangent of the right hand side so if tan inverse of V equals x plus C sub 1 then V itself equals tangent of X plus C sub 1 all right let's keep on moving now V equals something what's what's B equal so we use the substitution to get get something we can work with a separable let's let's replace it so V is X plus P ok this is looking a little bit better or worse than your perspective but wait a minute P means something oh I like to solve for P before a replace it you noticing this solve for the variable that you're trying to reach substitute for before you substitute it's a way cleaner so let's let's do that so P is now tangent X plus C sub 1 minus X ok well know what's P oh yeah he was pretty nice he was just dy yes that's separable in drove itself and if we take an integral on both sides we get y equals if you take an internal correctly where it's supposed to go on both sides we get life on my gosh wrote it when the water is tangent integration table should be a saint ln should be Ln of absolute value of one secant oh yeah soap Ln absolute value secant X plus C sub 1 and x2 value minus x squared over 2 or 1/2 of X plus another arbitrary constant because get two different integrals that we're doing not the same as doing an integral on both sides and getting two differents two seas that you can combine this is different you're integrating an arbitrary constant from a previous integral that's a different idea so we have y greater melon absolute value secant X plus C sub 1 and then x squared over 2 plus C sub 2 let's just call our arbitrary constants something slightly different eggs and visas which are mostly going to C so y equals Ln absolute value secant grade X plus a minus x squared over 2 1 plus B so great example for you to see Nano makes sense that you understand yeah you have a reduced will second order but when you reduce it you might have to use other techniques here so you might have to dig deep and go bad that's an obvious obvious substitution well be solve for your dependent variable that way you take a derivative you replace your DP DX your d dependent variable or X great we're gonna solve for the thing you need to replace replace it solve for the thing you need to replace replace it and then integrate again and then we end up with something nasty but that's the right answer ok I think we have one more to do and then we'll be good to go so last example here we're dealing with these second order differential equations that we can reduce to first order differential equation solve that first order with techniques that are known replace it with the derivative we substitute for and then do an integral again getting two arbitrary constants now we run this last one but that's not nearly as involved as our previous example but I want to show you what to pick whether you should wear what option you should go with if possible so we have second derivative of Y with respect to X both x equals the first derivative Y squared is it a second order differential equation yes is it reducible yes why well because it's gonna see why but wait a minute it's also missing X that's true and so you get to pick which option you want to go down most of the time the missing Y is easier to work with because the substitution is nice nicer so when we look at this I go hey I'm missing axes and I'm missing y's you actually you do have options you can go with either case now have a cover missing X but I would I would suggest that you go with missing Y because it's easier especially for this case so let's try it let's just replace our first derivative of the variable that way when I take this derivative of that variable I can also replace my second derivative and let's try it so the second derivative the Y becomes DP DX the first derivative of Y becomes a P squared that's about as nice as it gets so keeping it simple is really nice and using the the missing Y option rather than missing next option typically keeps clean things a lot cleaner the other option works but this is going to be cleaner for us so let's continue with it hey it's separable let's pull our peas over let's go ahead and integrate so when we integrate we have an integral of P to the negative 2nd power DP equals integral DX and we get this add 1/2 exponent equals x plus C sub 1 we're gonna clean up just a bit so let's see negative 1 over P equals x plus C sub 1 you know I don't like that negative so let's solve for P as much as possible before we start replacing people with what it actually is so negative 1 over P let's multiply everything by negative 1 that would be negative X minus C sub 1 all right one of the P equals you know what I might do right now I might take this guy and call this C sub 2 so now we'll be able to date so C sub 2 minus X that's fine hey now we can reciprocate and get that P equals 1 over C sub 2 - next we've done all this stuff before we're just now wrapping it up in this new technique now that we solve for P we can replace p with what actually equals so P is the first derivative of Y with respect to X let's show that when we solve for that P it makes the rest of this problem really really nice because all we've got to do is integrate both sides with respect to X so when we do that when we integrate both sides respect to X we get y equals u so you would be C sub 2 minus X the derivative is negative 1 so this would be a negative Ln absolute value C sub 2 minus X let's see some three weird that one to our next arbitrary constant yeah that's about as good as I think we can make it the only thing we would we do after this is maybe switch some stuff around call this C sub 3 minus Ln absolute value C sub 2 times X and then because sometimes we don't want to work with subscripts we can call this these two different arbitrary constants we'd say a minus Ln absolute value b minus X as about as good as it gets man my goal is always to explain things to a level that you actually understand them the reasons behind them and are able to do them so I hoping that's happened here the idea is if you have a second order difference or the equation and you are missing a Y variable call the first derivative Pete called the second derivative DP DX so replacing the first trivet of the variable therefore the second derivative is the derivative of the variable or really nicely just don't forget the two main things when you do your first solving of your differential equation your hand with key solve for your P you need to replace that with what P equals and then you're gonna have to get a grid again you get two arbitrary constants I'm gonna see for the next video and we're gonna talk about how this all works if we're not missing Y but we're missing X here we were missing both of them so it didn't really matter but this way is going to be cleaner and that's typically the case if you're missing both variables choose the missing the y1 or Y gone I'll see you for the next video when we discuss how to do this the second order differential equation happily reducible by missing an X variable have a great day you 

Transcript for: Reducible Second Order Differential Equations, Missing X (Differential Equations 27)
hey welcome to another video we are ready to get going on some more reducible second-order differential equations now if you remember from the last video we did this and we talked about there's three cases when we can solve some second-order differential equations and that's when they're reducible right now that later on we'll learn some other techniques but from the last video we learned that there's really three cases where we can reduce a second-order differential equation into a first-order so that we can use some of the techniques that we know to solve them and a lot of times they end up being separable so I want to review the the cases with you and then we'll talk about our second case which we haven't haven't done so far we'll do about five examples and then we should call it good and that next video will move on to what exact equations exactly mean and then how to solve them so I know some of you are really looking forward to that video that's coming up next I'll do three videos on exact equations because I feel that they're so important so we'll talk about that a little bit later so for right now what a reducible second order difference equation means is that we can make this substitution so normally you'll find this under a substitution heading and like a textbook or something where it will change the second-order into a first-order and there's three times that we can do this if our second order differential equation is missing the Y variable so Y GaN or if it's missing the X variable so X gone or if it's meant the missing both x and y so both x and y are gone and we'll talk about how this is really a case which should be done like a case one so here's the idea if our Y variable is completely gone that means that we have Y prime or Y double prime for the first or second derivative and second derivatives but we don't have the variable Y in other words all the other variables besides the second derivative of Y and perhaps the first term Y are all X's we can make a substitution we say let's just call this the first derivative of Y P all right let make sense because if we take a second derivative then the second derivative of Y with respect to X on both sides would give us a derivative of P with respect to X so all right that's that's not so bad so we replace all the first derivatives of Y with P all the second derivatives of Y with DP DX and what that does is that reduces the the order so instead of a for a second order we have now a first order differential equation in terms of a dependent variable P where X is still our independent variable you see if Y is gone then everything's in terms of X and that actually makes sense okay I can actually take this derivative with respect to X because there's X's involved I can do integrals with respect DX because we have X's involved now let's look at the second case all right a little bit second case well if X is gondola it's let's let's try the same thing let's say um let's just make our first derivative of Y with respect to X equal to P okay that should reduce the order of ikana first derivative into a variable of some sort that's not we were looking at it as if it's not a derivative right now we're going to go backwards but if we treat this as just a variable and we take a derivative on both sides notice how the second derivative became like it looks like a first derivative of P and that's that's what we're doing here so let's let's try it again okay well the Y double prime would be the derivative of P with respect to X well that looks the same right but this is a problem because if exes are gone and we get down to here and say let's find let's treat this as DP DX or derivative of P with respect X and when we try to integrate well there's no X's so when we do it integral DX we're going to run into a lot of problems so if we had to do derivatives we'd run into a lot of problems because if X is gone that that doesn't really work for us so what we're going to do is a nice little use of the chain rule to switch this just just a bit know what's a chain rule do do you remember what the chain rule does the chain rule says man if I have if I have something like DP DX but this is hard to find I can write this as dp/dy or sometimes I'll see a DP D u times dy/dx and that's what the chain rule says it says I can do this derivative by considering this one if I have some intermediary variable and so that's we're going to treat the sets we're gonna say okay for Y gone this is fine because I got X's if Y's are gone I'll only have X's then dy/dx is P great Y double prime gives us the derivative of P with respect to X and I have X's in there no problem but if X is gone okay the river wives rate the XS p take the second derivative great y double prime is DP DX that's a problem I don't have any X's so we're going to use this chain rule and say instead of thinking of this as DP DX let's make this y double prime equals derivative of P with respect to Y times the derivative of Y with respect to X because I still don't have exes yeah you're right but here's the cool part battery this is exactly what you define P as so if you defined P as Y prime or the first derivative of Y and we get down here say okay let's take a second derivative then y double prime is DP DX no chain rule that derivative of P with respect to Y times do you my DX by the chain rule but that right there is P and so we get a nice substitution that looks like this since this is P we can have P times DP dy and and when we think about that I hope that makes sense that chain rules if this has only wisent no X's and we make it all the way down to here this is not a problem before we define that as the first derivative of Y from step y is in it it has X is implicitly in there but then we also have a derivative of P with respect to Y and why as the variable here so all of our intervals are going to be dy until I get to the very very end and the integrate with both sides and then we'll well we still treat it as dy but then our Y is gonna our functions can be implicitly defined so our Y's do have X is somewhere and there we assume perhaps they're just not in our differential equation let me walk through this one more time to make sure you understand the concept we'll do one example and do like four more after that so the first thing I want you to notice is there are three cases the first case if it Y's are gone it's a very very straightforward substitution we just call the first derivative peeing then the second derivative is DP DX and it works out nicely that's the last video watch it if you haven't let's jump down here it X is gone we do the same exact substitution the first derivative is P but we've run into a problem with DP DX because there are no X's so we use that chain rule alright DP dy dy DX oh hey that's what I defined PS so we get something that's totally defined in terms of why we treat Y as a variable works out great I'm going to show this one time on this example but after that I'm just gonna jump right into this substitution from here on out now the last case what if both are not what if you have no X's and no wives if you have no X's and you have no wise use case one because the substitution is nicer I did that in the last example the last video so if you don't remember that you might want to check that out I'm not gonna do this one in this video because it should just be done like that and that's our last video so let's start with this example let's make sure you can go through all I'll really kind of go slowly on this one and then we'll kind of fly through some of this form or why would I do four more when I explain this one so well is because there's some as always I like to give you some integration techniques as we go through because I know that we forgive them and that's okay it happens from time to time so I'm gonna review some integration technique some weird things that can't happen as we're going through here so while the technique will be the same for all five examples I want you to focus on solving them and how we should end our problem so let's start this if we have y double prime equals 2y y Prime we're looking at is that differential equation yeah is it the second order absolutely is it reducible well are we missing all our lies no we got a while right there we go I'm gonna Y double prime y prime we have a lie will be our missing our X's so let's see how this substitution actually works what we're going to look at doing the same you know it's reducible I'm gonna try to change the second derivative of Y into the first derivative of something else and we call it something else P so let's take P and say our first derivative of Y with respect to X or Y prime it's going to equal P well that means that the second derivative of Y is if I take the derivative of both sides with respect to X I get the second derivative of Y with respect to X equals the first derivative of P with respect to X and what that does is that changes our second derivative of Y into a first derivative of some other variable P that's why that's reducible we just reduced org now I hope you've seen the problem our problem here is that that's a DX I have no X's I run into a big issue and this is where that change will I mentioned earlier comes into play to see let's instead of doing this let's use that chain rule to our advantage let's call this derivative of Y with respect to Y times the derivative of Y with respect to X by the chain rule and then as I mentioned earlier are you seeing it or I seem like this first derivative is P that's great take a driven both sides it reduces the order calls a second derivative a first or some other variable do you see the problem if I have no Exodus that DX screws us up so we use the chain rule and say the second derivative Y is DP DX yeah but let's chain rule that thing and then recognize that this piece is already defined that piece is exactly what we called P that's pretty cool so we're gonna say y double Prime is not just derivative of P with respect to X like we did in case one what it is is P times D anyone you know a lot of students get confused right there we go where in the world does that P come why do I have a line right there you have a Y dy right there because you need it because you're in terms of Y only you don't have any X's so you have to have that the second thing I want to understand is that that P comes from a chain rule so you are making the exact same substitution I hope you see it in this case in this case start up exactly the same the only reason this P comes into play is because you are using the chain rule so if your if your teacher asks you your man how it works okay come from just a chain rule because that's exactly what you're doing here you sayin let's use the chain rule this is already defined as P and so we gain extra P so the substitution we're about to make is going to look just a little bit different from before we're still going to call this Y prime P so this is still P that Y is still gonna be there but that's gonna look a little bit different than case one let's let's go kind of slowly to make sure we're understand exactly what's going on here on the right hand side you're still going to have a two you're still going to have a Y look that Y prime that first derivative of the Y with respect to X we're gonna call that P on the left hand side we can't just make this because I have no X's look at what would happen if we did that and maybe this will make it sink in for you so really pay attention here if we call this DPD bags did you see how I have three variables floating around you see that we have a P we have a DP we have a P we have Y we have an X that's problem because there's no way to to use this as a separable equative you several equations here whether there's no way for us to deal with those three variables at one time with the techniques that we understand and so that's why this is a problem that and so that's what we did that thing and said well in order for this to be separable that's got to be really ID live that way through my T's on one side DP why isn't one side dy then I can integrate but in order to get that it involves a chain rule in order to get from here to here you have to tack on a dy/dx you have to tack on a P and that's exactly what this substitution says it says let's just let's go ahead and let's make liable prime chain rule of DP DX or P DP dy does that make sense to you if that doesn't make sense you I need you to relaunch the last couple minutes make sure that you can go through here understand that we're just using the chain rule understand the problem with having DX if your X's are all gone because you'd have wise in their X's I'll be all gone that'd be a problem last thing I want to mention before we go on the reason why we use this one for both cases is not because it's the only one that's possible you could actually use both imaginers imagine that that why wasn't there that what why wasn't there your DX would be perfectly valid your DUI would be perfectly bad be fine but we choose the Y's are gone because it's an easier substitution I just want to mention that to you that both techniques are valid if both your variables are gone that one's just easier so let's get back to it we uh man we've noticed reducible second-order we've made a great substitution to say Y prime is now key we're taking a second room and said DP DX is a problem because I have no exits I have wise though that's a problem so I'm gonna take a second derivative but I'm gonna use a chain rule and now we look at and go this is this is pretty nice we got something that's separable let's get our P's DP let's get our constants with y dy if we divide both sides well we're just going to get and you would make some some domain restrictions where appropriate so be careful with that most of time a lot of text we're gonna say just assume that these things are positive or not zero where you need them to be and that's that's very common so just take a look at your textbook there probably is a little blurb about that somewhere if you're working out of the textbook so we're gonna divide both sides by P and we're also going to move our dy so dividing by P we're just gonna get DP on the right hand side we'll get 2y dy and the nicest integral we've added a really long time if we integrate both sides with respect to y notice that we're integrating both sides but we are with respect to why we're treating Y is the variable here why because it's the only variable that we have there's no X's we can't really do that we're going to assume that Y is implicitly defining X on the left hand side we just get P on the right hand side and we get Y squared but notice you're going to get a constant we're going to call that c1 because we're definitely going to change that at the end so we're integrating oh yeah that's P this one's really nice y squared plus c1 and then we realize that what P is P is really a first derivative with respect to X so first derivative of Y with respect to X so just like case 1 we're going to have to go backwards and say because P is that guy up there because P is the derivative of Y with respect to X we're gonna change this that's what P is that's what we defined it as and then we have another integral to do when they have another differential equation to solve so the whole technique of reducible second-order differential equations boils down to this fact you're trying to take the second derivative reduce it to a first derivative of some dummy variable like like P then what we do once we could solve for P well that is a first derivative of Y with respect to X so we're basically doing two differential equations at one problem now we have this thing so well how do I solve that do I just integrate both sides no not really because right now notice this this real important right now because we have that DX X now come becomes our independent variable we're going to integrate with respect to X now and so this becomes separable just like we did before just like actually up here this was separable where we sort of treated Y is our dependent variable but now this is separable or between X as our dependent variable it's always that that looks like the denominator of a fraction that bottom part right there that's telling you what you're treating as you're integrating variable there that as well you're let's say independent variable there so here we're treating X like that that means that we need to get our wise dy on one side and our DX and other so if we divide by Y squared plus c1 and we get our constants DX do you see what I mean about that do you see what I mean like we just switched variables so with a case - it's a little bit weird because you're using Y is your variable until you get all the way down to solve for P and then you go alright what's what's P well it's the first rivet of life with respect X right there you're changing back into that independent variable being X so that's that's the idea hope that I hope that makes sense I'm gonna explain that well know if we understand that so right here we're saying okay now now we got it we can do one more step and go treat this as the first root of it is let's make sure that we understand that separable in this case Y is on one side with dy X and other sides of constants DX and now we can integrate so when we do well on the right hand side that's pretty nice we're just going to get X plus C something on the left hand side though that looks like a tan inverse now I'm gonna do something real interesting it's interesting to me when you do a tan inverse you can look at your table or something when you do a tan inverse of what it would that be alert variables Y then you have a constant C sub one do you remember what you really do you treat this as Y squared and you treat this like some other number squared so this is in Y squared plus the thing for you would get Y over 2 or the square root of 4 now I want to tell you that I'm not going to put the square root of C sub 1 Y if I put the square root of C sub 1 a square root of a constant is still a constant so here's what we're going to do instead because that number's arbitrary we don't care what it is this is still going to be why sure you're always doing that one over Y squared plus constant gives you tan inverse of Y over that square root of that constant well if that constant C sub one the square root of that is just going to be a different constant let's just call it C sub two and not have to worry about that square root let's say that one more time whatever this number is you'd be taking the square root but it'd still be a constant it would just be a different constant so who cares let's call it C sub two on the right hand side we're gonna get X but since we just used up a C sub two let's call this season three all right now let's solve for y as much as we can so we're gonna be taking tangent on both sides so Y over C sub two equals tangent of X plus C sub three ma'am we're almost done when we multiply by C sub two we're gonna be done we're gonna call this constant something slightly different but I want you to notice this also with these second-order differential equations we should be getting two different arbitrary constants well this should make sense we're doing the integral one time arbitrary constant we're seeing that's a first derivative do an integral again a second arbitrary constant you should have two of them in there so when we solve for y and get this C sub two tangent X plus C sub three most of the time you're going to see these written is like a and B because the the subscript oh yeah those subscripts right there they're not super important it doesn't really matter what they are and so a lot of times not all the time but a lot of times we'll see this as y equals a tangent X plus B so very similar idea just a little bit of a different substitution I'm always the type of teacher who likes to explain why we're doing this so I'm Anna never stuck with me unless it was fully explained like where's my even coming from where that's coming from as a chain rule that's why we came that extra pee while we have to have a dpdy instead of a deep PDX because we don't have any experience we have a y-variable that we're treating as an independent until we get down the pee and we're saying hey that's the first derivative the spec 2x then we go back to our independent variable thanks I wish I could ask you if it makes sense to you know yeah makes sense but it should be making sense right here if you're ok with the chain rule and you understand or substitution its kind of the same technique so what we're gonna do we're gonna come back we're gonna work through four examples I'm gonna go fairly quickly this is the only time I will show you the actual chain rule here from here on out I'm going to say here's a substitution and we can change into that by the chain rule and then we're gonna go through and I want to focus more on some of the integration techniques so I'll be back in just a second let's do a couple more so check out our next one it's clearly a differential equation it's clearly a second-order got that second derivative of Y with respect to both times the hell reviewing that adds so let's go ahead and see if it's reducible now think about what case you have here so our second order differential equations are reducible if we can make a substitution that changes the first rhythm into a variable and the second derivative into a first derivative of that variable and that is happening if we have missing an X variable or missing a Y variable here we clearly have a Y but we're missing an X so we're gonna do the same exact substitution to start that's how what you think of it there's only one substitution the only thing we're really doing so we're saying let's make the first derivative of Y with respect to X equal to P go alright well suppose it works so the second derivative of Y with respect to X is equal to the first derivative of P with respect to X that's the only substitution we ever make but because we're missing the exit here's how I want you to think about I do not want you to think of this as two completely different substitutions I want you to think about it as one substitution where this one doesn't particularly work exactly like it is for this type of a case when you're missing X's so same substitution same substitution but then in your head you go oh I don't have any X's so that DX is a real problem for me so we're going to just chain rule this and by the chain rule we say this would be derivative of P with respect to Y kind of derivative of Y with respect to X which is P that's where that P comes from now let's do the substitution and what that's gonna do is see it immediately it's going to reduce the second derivative into a first derivative of P so we're still going to have let's see what we got we're still gonna have a while that second derivative we're gonna call it this piece by the chain rule we have that P derivative of P with respect to Y plus also that Y Prime's got a change you see when we called that derivative of Y with respect to X equal to P that Y prime has changing your P so this is P squared equals zero let's make sure we've got this second-order yes missing exes okay same substitution same substitution oh that's substitution to work I don't have X's so we're going to use a chain rule we keep our variable Y we change all the derivatives that's why it's reducible is because you can change this into a variable first derivative into a variable the second derivative is the derivative of that variable P with respect to Y in this case X implicitly now well it's about you a little bit God you know first glance you might think that can be linear if you divide everything by P kind of it looks that way but could you make it easier and if you have a zero over here that answers yeah you can if we subtract P from both sides then we're gonna have something that is separable so let's do P squared any less let's do that so Y times P derivative of P with respect to wild if we subtract that P squared and get negative P squared now we're going to group our PCP or wise dy so let's divide both sides by that P squared you'll remember like with separable I always try to keep my my sides and my constants or even my command constant coefficients on the right hand side a little bit easier for us to deal with because we're trying to solve for P once we do that first integral so here let's let's divide by P squared but let's leave the negative let's divide by Y so divided by P squared we're giving 1 over P DP on the right hand side we're dividing by Y that's negative 1 or Y dy let's make sure that you guys are ok with that one so we've divided this right so P divided by P squared that's one of repeat you'd make some some domain restrictions if you have to we have DP great let's divide both sides by Y I know I'm doing a lot of algebra in my head right now I hope that you stick it with me on that one should be about that level that we can see divided by P squared you need to wonder what can you divide by Y you're gonna do one of the why you keep your negative here group our DP dy now we get something that's separable why don't you try right now to see if you can solve that let's see if you can get that all the way down to solving for P if you want to possibly do that now I mean we're going to continue so clean do an integral on both sides left hand side hey man that's nice that's gonna be Ln absolute value of the people on the right hand side we get negative Ln absolute value of 1 over y plus C sub 1 now do you remember what we're gonna do with those L ends so when we have this Ln Ln we're going to do that the evaluate both of those as an exponent on e so we're going to do an exponential on both sides so left hand side will just get the absolute value of the P on the right hand side let's move this negative and we're going to get e to the Ln yeah I'm sorry I kind of did this in my head a little bit too fast Ln Y and then we're gonna get that negative 1 it's going to be 1 over Y my dad absolute value 1 over y time e to the C sub 1 you're very very careful here when you're doing this e to the Ln yes those are gone those are composition inverse functions your absolute value P same thing happens here but do you remember when we take and we treat this as an exponent on e we can separate exponents on on on a base by saying those are multiplied together with the common base so if with a common base you add exponents added expose means you have a common base so we can separate this and get either the C sub 1 so let's make sure we're here this right here would give us a composition inverse functions in just a minute we have Ln of absolute value why I mess up the first time I put 1 over Y cuz I was taking out of here we move that negative right there that's going to give us 1 over Y now we can simplify this e to the Ln on the left hand side let's get absolute value of P on the right hand side we're going to have this e to the C sub 1 we're going to have this 1 over Y and do you remember what we can do with those absolute values because we can treat them as a plus and minus because we can wrap that up and our ISA bond we can say P equals plus or minus e to the C sub 1 times 1 over Y and then we say this whole entire thing this thing is C sub 2 I know that I've gone a little bit quickly on that one but this is all some old technique that we've seen before so P would equal C sub 2 over Y or times 1 over 1 that's fine as well now what now are we done how we solved for y whoa no actually I'm going to solve the differential equation dy/dx yet so all we've done here is we've said that's a reducible second-order we made a great substitution we got all the way down to here we said that's separable fantastic do separable equations there do certainly separation of variables let's integrate both sides let's let's understand that in order to get rid of Ln we do that be on both sides to make sure that we understand that that e gets raised to this exponent and this exponent multiplicatively that can be a constant and we can draw our absolute values because of that plus or minus that's fantastic so we say hey that's P yes that's one of our Y great but let's wrap up those absolute value that I did that positive negative inside of this constant it's arbitrary anyway and we get down to P equals C sub 2 over Y but we're not done because we have to remember what exactly P is when we did that substitution P is dy DX let's go back and let's make that dividing X so P is C sub 2 over Y then we know that P really came from dy DX you know some of you might be wondering letter D huh then you're calling that Y prime Y do you have that is Eli the X there instead of Y prime and why do you have that it's just y double prime Y the notation switch I like that as dy DX because when you do your substitution right here it's much easier to see that you have a separable equation it's a lot easier to see that if you just call that Y prime you down here Y prime you got what's that mean you're gonna have to really change into dy DX anyway so you don't have to but it's nicer to see it that way so that's why I write Y Prime like this within Y double Prime it's not really necessary to do that it's a direct substitution you never have to go back to it I hope that makes sense to you so we've done all of our work we use our exponential appropriately we've simplified some things we've got all the way down here we've said that's great I've solved my differential equation in terms of that dummy very liquid in there but now realizing that what that P means is dy DX I've got another usually basic differential equation to solve it is separable that's great it's now in terms of our independent variable X I'm going to group our Y's be Y our constants and X is the S and so when we do that let's multiply both sides by Y on the right hand side we're going to leave that constant DX if you have something that's really nice to integrate so when we do let's integrate both sides well that's that's pretty good on the left-hand side we get this y squared over two on the right hand side we get C sub two x plus we're going to happen have another arbitrary constant just like every time we have that second order differential equation we're going to get two of them so if we multiply both sides by two check this out check this out you're going to multiply both sides by two right well that would be two C sub two x plus two C sub three is that it's still an arbitrary constant is that still an arbitrary constant yeah so you can wrap all those up in like an A and B and that's how we're gonna end this so we'll say that Y squared is a X plus two B and that's about as good as that we can as we can get we really don't want to go solving for y we don't want to deal with that plus or minus square root idea so we leave that implicitly defined are you with me are you getting the idea do you understand the idea that this substitution is the same substitution as for when Y is missing but when X is missing you need to just change that and that's the chain rule do you understand the same exact idea separable equations that we've done for a long time I hope that's really just from here just kind of easy for you I hope that's easy for you and then getting down to our P just remember what P is P is dy/dx which means you're going back to it in their independent variable X they're typically separable always but then we can do an integral of both sides and solve for y how we want to let's do another one and then what I'd like to do is give you give you two of them this next one is kind of awkward I want to show you something about it so let's do this one together and then I want to give you two of them and give you a chance to do that so I'll write two on the board I really want you to pause the video after we do this example together so let's take a look at it well know one thing we notice is that yeah it's a differential equation and hopefully you're seeing a second-order and hopefully you've seen its reducible how do we know it's reducible if we're missing a variable its reducible so if we're missing X or we're missing Y we have a do that just same technique it's just when we're missing exes it gets a little more complicated so let's look at how to do it do it together so a second order differential equation we're missing exes let's go ahead let's make our substitution understanding that we're going to call the first derivative of Y with respect to X equal to P all right but wait there's no first derivative of of life so is that a problem it's not a problem you're just not gonna have the variable P by itself that's totally okay all right so if the first derivative of Y with respect to X is P then the second derivative of Y with respect to X is the derivative of P with respect to X but that's not gonna work why is it not gonna work the x's so we're gonna change it just slightly we're gonna use the chain rule and say if this is DP over D Y times dy over DX that dy/dx is P that leaves us with a derivative of P with respect to Y which we're gonna treat as our variable for right now now let's go ahead let's plug everything back in so we don't have any y Prime's any first derivatives of Y to call people we do get 1p up there but there's nothing else that we're gonna call feed that that's okay that's another problem so our second derivative of Y with respect to X made a substitution we took a derivative on both sides we used a chain rule since this piece right here is P times DP dy plus 4y don't ever change the variables alright so if you have X's you want to leave those if you have Y is to the first power y is just saying whatever leave those now what you don't leave are Y primes and Y telephones you have to change those on the right hand side we have 0 what is it get a 0 it's not linear that Y doesn't count that Y is treating this our independent variable right now so this is not linear what this is a separable so we're going to subtract that 4y we're going to group our peas on one side y lies on the other side we're gonna integrate and it looks pretty innocuous right now so you'll that's that's really easy that doesn't look too bad so I'm gonna group my PvP I'm going to subtract that for Y on both sides and then we're gonna move our DUI so we're subtracting the for y we're moving our dy on the right hand side is a nice convention that we use to integrate these for these different equations and we'll take an interval on both sides on the left hand side starts off looking kind of nice we get this P squared over two on the right hand side let's see we add add 1 so it's Y squared over new exponent of 2 so B that's negative 4 over 2 that's our negative 2 y squared and we will have an arbitrary constant now every other time we've solved for P now we're gonna solve for P here but do you see that we're gonna run into a problem well let's multiply both sides by 2 first let's get this P squared equals negative 4 y squared plus 2c someone yes we're gonna change that into a cease of two in just a minute but this is an issue this is going to cause a problem for us and we're gonna have to define what we want here so when you solve for P you know this you're gonna take a square root of both sides and you shouldn't be giving either positive or negative we oftentimes choose just the positive could you choose the negative yes but it's gonna lead you to a different solution set all right so I'm not gonna show that but you could do that so normally normally we would just choose the positive square root also depends our problems we can make that that determination but but I do want to understand that when we're about to do this when I want to take a square root on both sides and when I omit the plus and minus what I'm choosing is to just look at the positive square root I'm not choosing the negative in front of that square root okay could you do it what the negative yes it's just going to lead you to a different solution set with a different interval let's call this thing C sub 2 right now since that's just a constant I want to pause right there and make sure that we are a hundred percent before we go any further so are you okay that it's a second-order differential equation it happens to be reducible and we're in the technique of having a missing X so we use the same substitution but you say that doesn't work I need a chain rule because I have to treat Y as my variables this finally variable we do our substitution it's separable we do a nice integral get although okay we gotta solve down for P we take a square root or understanding that I'm taking the positive because my choice here and then we say all right well what is what is if you don't stop here some students that don't get this are going to stop here you get that right because they've got lots of their no but but you sold it for a dummy variable it's like doing a substitution like doing a u sub and ending your integral and used and not going back to X's it's essentially what we've done we've just not using you so to use a P sub so fix it we want P that we want to understand that he is really you my DX so dy/dx what we have our substitution equals and I'm gonna start changing things around I'm gonna start putting this as C sub two minus 4y squared is it separable yes because now our independent variable is X so are we want dy with Y's on the left hand side we want DX with constants and X's on the right hand side so we're going to divide both sides by this we'll have our DX on the right side oh this is why we're doing the problem is for the integration technique right here when we're when we're doing this when we run into this sort of a problem some of your tables might actually give this to you they will hold that that for out and call it a two in front of your sine inverse which we're about to get I want to show you a slightly different technique where if you don't remember that that you can still get the sine inverse and still see where that two comes from so we're going to integrate yes we're gonna do them both sides right hand side hopefully I don't have an issue with that left hand side though if you want to use your table right here do it that's totally fine I do not have a problem with that if you don't or if you don't have a table or if you forgotten it or you just wants to said cool something cool look you can force this to factor out of four notice how if I distributed that I get C sub two minus 4y squared because because square roots are exponents because exponents distribute across multiplication and division you can simplify that four so we have two square root of C sub two over four minus y squared that's where that number comes from on the integration table white has a number in front sine inverse there's because of that because you can simplify that out of the times usually the square root of whatever that number is the next thing I want you to notice is that because this is a constant let's just call that C so we're gonna burn up a lot of constants right here let's call that C two three or leave it I don't care whatever whatever it is it's just an arbitrary constant so what I'm going to do I'm gonna come down and put this right here we'll talk about the integral and then that will be good we're almost done so we'll factor out the 4 we'll take the square root of four which would give us two so this would be 1 over 2 square root of C sub 2 over 4 minus y squared dy equals integral the X on the left-hand side yeah you're gonna get it you're gonna get that one half so that one over - yeah I guess I said it wrong the sine inverse you're gonna have a 1 over something I just meant that that that's gonna be 2 so you can have a 1/2 you can have a sine inverse from the integration table but then what it looks like it says here's your usual 1/2 here's your sine inverse sine inverse works a lot like the tan inverse does so in that you're going to get Y over the square root of this number now listen we're gonna say to see some three-tiered Y because that's an arbitrary constant divided by 4 you're still going to get an arbitrary constant take the square root of you're still gonna get an arbitrary constant it doesn't matter what it is so when we do all this and you're seeing sine inverse but that's screwing me up who cares just call it C sub 3 it's just some number that really doesn't matter what it is in order to make this differential equation work so with differential equations remember we're talking about families of curves those arbitrary constants are exactly that they're arbitrary unless we have an initial value a point where we need one of those curves to go through we leave them and we say this is representing a family of curves and we can't really solve it the first particular solution without an initial condition therefore it doesn't matter what that is that could be 500 million I don't know what it is so when we were doing this we're simplifying or we're going straight from the table and you're having trouble with that guy and you're saying I don't know what to do with that arbitrary constant I know that it should be like the square root or something this should be something squared so we get the square root who cares the square root of C sub two is still like arbitrary contour the sphere sees two or four still arbitrary constant just put on the right-hand side we get x + we'll have to call it C sub 4 it's already burned through 1 2 & 3 we're pretty close to being done we're almost almost there so let's go ahead and let's do this yeah I get it a little bit different on my notes but this'll work just as well mine I did this before and I move the two to the right hand side and integrated to DX but you'll see that that's the same thing right what what I mean is I before I even did an integral I pulled the two out I multiplied both sides by two instead of having a one-half I had to over here be the same because I just get 2x plus constant now I have one half I'm going to multiply by two anyway so where that is that's fine so sine inverse Y over C sub 3 equals 2x plus 2 C sub 2 C sub 4 and we're gonna do the same thing we did with tan inverse we're going to take sign on both sides and we're going to multiply it by C sub 3 let's multiply both sides by C sub 3 and that's perfectly appropriate but a lot of times what you're gonna see is you're gonna see an arbitrary constant called a and an arbitrary constant this - C sub 4 and we're gonna call that B so all right back because I ran out of the room I'll write that right up here so here's what we should we should be getting we should be giving y equals this a some arbitrary constant sign it looks pretty good we got this 2x that's great and then plus B guys that's about as good as we can get we've solved for y explicitly which is pretty fantastic considering where we started I hope this this this techniques making sense to you I wanted to go through this integration technique and show you what to do with the constants because I've seen students get really all jacked up a mountain do about that stuff why do I do with that don't worry about it use your integration table and when you have an arbitrary constant you're trying to figure out where that go it doesn't it doesn't matter it's still arbitrary so you don't worry about the square root or whatever they have to do there so anyhow I hope this making sense I hope that you can do it I hope that it I'm getting this to to be internalized with you so that you will remember that these techniques for missing X and missing life identical but the X screws us up so you realize that that's gonna lead you to the chain rule that's gonna lead you to having that PEP dy and then our integration is exactly the same to solve that differential equation terms P and y when you get down to P you need to understand what that is that's the derivative of Y with respect to X X now becomes an independent variable and we do in another technique so it's like two problems rolled up into one with a very nice substitution I'll be back with a couple more in just a minute which I'm gonna have you try on your own all right let's get to it so what I would like you to do if you can I would like everyone to do this actually whether you're in a class or not man it's really good for you to practice on your own if you screwed up now who cares but you will learn from those mistakes so if you can pause the video and try these two examples man that we rock solid alright so be thinking about is it a second-order differential equation is it reducible which means it's missing a variable what variable is it missing make the same substitution in either case both these are missing X's but then realize that a DX would be a problem if you're missing X's that's the thought process of one I'd just modeled my thinking on how I go through it I'm gonna start right now but you really should pause the video and try so I'm looking at that saying second order differential equation man absolutely is it reducible yes it's missing a variable what variables missing it's missing X so in my head right now it's triggering DX is gonna be a problem I'm gonna make the same system substitution but I'm gonna have to use a chain rule here so we're gonna try it and what's funny is that problem looks a lot harder than that problem this one's gonna be real easy this one's gonna take a little bit of time so let's let's look at this so when we do our substitution we say hey let's make the first derivative of Y with respect X equal to P and I'm doing this I'm doing the dy/dx instead of a Y prime because when we have a substitute back for P that dy/dx is very nice it shows us that we have a differential equation where X is are independent variable and y prime does not do that that's what we're doing that so we say alright on then the second derivative of Y is the derivative of P with respect to x sure that's what that means we're taking a second derivative with respect to X on both sides so we have a derivative of P with respect to X but since we're missing X's we need this chain rule that we've talked about Lots right now so that we can treat Y as our variable until we get down to people that's been put into practice so every single inner instance of Y prime is gonna change to P every instance of y double prime is going to change to P DP divided by the chain rule we leave all the other wise alone so we're gonna leave this Y but this is gonna be our P DP dy Y great y double prime got it y prime oh that's a P but it's squared on the right hand side why we leave this why this is gonna be P so Y stays Y double prime changes Y prime color P we have a square Y stays Y prime P if you did on your own I hope you made it that far now taking a look at it that's a whole lot of stuff floating around so what in the world are we gonna do well what I notice and we take and talk about some domain restrictions here we talk about think about at least usually said in a footnote assume positive or not zero where you have to we're gonna divide everything by P because every single term is a peanut so we're going to do that so dividing everything by P we get Y times DP dy plus just P to the first power equals one go alright well the world's that wait a minute hey that's great so that right there that's that's P that's P the first power here's our will retreat in its independent variable Y we get Y on one side we get a Y right here that looks so many earth because that's P to the first power that is linear in fact don't go any further don't find any green in this bag actually don't try if you want to find an integrating factor right here you're gonna do this you're gonna get back exactly this because take a look at it think outside the box a little bit this left hand side when we deal with linear remember remember linear we want to get this integrated factor to make the left hand side a product rule and have just a function of our independent variable on the right you remember that we're on the left hand side to become a product rule we have the right hand side to be whatever this variable is well if you found an integrating factor you would be integrating e to the flash you'd be divided by Y wouldn't you so B divided by Y everywhere you get 1 over Y here you get one here I'm Kevin shouldn't be doing this but I'm gonna show you you'd be divided by Y so you get 1 over Y that's important that's a white you get one right here you're integrating factor B 1 over Y dy you get e to the Ln Y you get Y so you will live waited you tell me you divide everything by Y you get your integrating factor Y and they multiply everything back my life wait a minute if that's gonna happen then what that means is that on the left hand side you've already got the result of some sort of product rule look at that if you take the derivative of P leave the first during the why leave the P that right there is already once you would get if you took Y times P and took a derivative with respect to Y so this is the result of some derivative with respect to Y of Y times P leave the first one alone the river the second there it is derivative the first one that's one leave the second alone that's already there so that's kind of cool so when we're saying this I almost did that any rating factor and did that on my own whoa hey that's that's already a the result of some sort of profit rule and that's what linear wants anyway on the right hand side we still just have one so since that the result of some sort of product rule we just showed the product if we take an integral on both sides just like we've seen a nonlinear a lot of times the left hand side is just going to deal this Y times P remember we're taking this with respect to Y that's where you have this little decent Y here derivative with respect to Y on the left hand side we get this one-half Y squared or Y square root 2 plus C sub 1 now what hopefully no now what we're always trying to solve for P because that means that we can substitute dy/dx and get something that's really nice so let's multiply both sides by Y I'm sorry I meant divide so if we divide both sides by Y we get Y the first power divided by Y over 2 and then C sub 1 over Y you know what before we go any further and you're gonna see this a lot whenever you get these two terms and you're gonna have a dy/dx you're probably gonna make something inseparable not all the time but 99% of the time you're going to get that it would benefit us to make a common denominator and get one fraction before that happens because if this is all in terms of Y which it is and you're gonna put a dy/dx here which you are and there's no X's over here then this is all gonna be in terms of Y and you're gonna have to move it to the other side and find a common denominator anyway it's easiest to do that here so let's take a moment let's multiply and I'm gonna say that anything that was that was really fast look you're about to put dy/dx here right and you have all-wise many low ones you missing the X whole reason for this technique so this is gonna be separable but all your Y's are here with no X's you're going to have to move them to the left hand side and make one fraction anyhow so that you can integrate the separable equation that we're about to create let's get one fraction out so we're gonna multiply by Y on the left hand traction and two on the right hand fraction so Y squared plus two C sub 1 over 2y and that's our common - number that we're gonna have that that looks a little bit nicer as far as making a separable equation later a month I don't look any nicer it's gonna be in just a moment so and so now let's let's go through it again reducible yes made a good substitution great we already had the result of some sort of a product rule for that linear showed it we took an integral both sides with respect to Y because that's what we're treating this or variable right now we solve for P we understand that this is going to be separable I'm gonna want one fraction and now we see it P is dy/dx let's change this on the right-hand side we've got a y squared + 2 C sub 1 over 2 1 now do you see whatever copy I might not have sunk in at first and that's okay right now I hope you see what we're talking about we have all wise we have dy over DX so we have our independent variable X we want that on the right hand side you are wise dy is here so we're going to have to multiply by the reciprocal here we would think about some domain restrictions when we're doing this but again a lot of books get a little lazy and some math these are you'll amazing sometimes I do too and we just say we're because they happen so often where appropriate you're gonna have to assume that some things are positive or not negative it happens it just happens a lot so we're going to multiply by the reciprocal get our wise dy our X is DX and now we can integrate them that looks really good as far as integrating goes because what we're gonna do is integrate both sides on the right hand side would be something real nice for you keep X on the left hand side you have a little bit of a substitution to do so this is not like a tan inverse or anything we don't have that we have this making use of 4y squared then D u equals 2y dy that's great that's exactly what we have that's so nice and little when it happens no need to divide anything what we get is this oh sorry plus 2c something I made a mistake I should have put this whole thing I was thinking of the derivative only so take your whole denominator make that Y squared plus 2 C sub 1 the derivative is 2y dy never that's just a constant it goes away when you take a derivative and then we have this real nice integral 1 over u this is are you one of you 2y dy well that's now D u so let's do the integral right now the integral of 1 over u D U is Ln u we'll call that C sub two we've already burned it the C sub one so now let's see well we're gonna have this this outline of what was you well you was this y squared plus two C sub 1 e equals x plus C sub 2 hey I mean even exponential on both sides let's do it if we do an exponential on both sides we're gonna get Y squared plus 2 C sub 1 equals I'm going to I'm going to do this this e to the nd to remember that what we're doing we're going to have an e to the X but we're also going to have this e to the C sub 2 you remember that if we can separate that egg the addition of excellence by multiplying the common bases so we have an e to the X we have a times e to the C sub 2 and I'm wrapping up the absolute value in that plus and minus so we're just doing exponential on both sides its composition inverse functions we're getting this y squared plus 2 C sub 1 but now we're gonna start doing a couple other things let's call this because this is sort of look real nasty let's call this piece right here let's call that C sub 3 back is a constant no matter whether it's positive or negative that's a constant e to the X and if we subtract that to C sub 1 well now we have two arbitrary constants we have assumed a let's call that C sub 3 2 it doesn't really matter we're about to change it to an A but now we have this solution to a differential equation implicitly defined where y squared equals e to the X plus being the women that's a minus who cares so call this plus negative 2 C sub 1 and then you can call that negative 2 C sub 1 equal to B or something so that's the final form of this I wanted to do this to show you our substitution to show you that some things can look really hard within the integral for the person was really easy we have just a basic u sub and then just make sure that when going back we're remembering that if you're using a you you're going back to the original whatever you substituted for we're doing Exponential's on both sides remember that we can wrap up absolute values with pluses and minuses remember that we can separate these addition of exponents by multiplication of common bases with those exponents and then we're solving for y as much as we can and we should be ending with two different arbitrary constants like a and B are you with me is it making sense to you are you are you getting it because if you are and that is cool so very valuable stuff that we're learning what we will eventually go on to solve some second-order differential equations that aren't reducible and I'll give you techniques for that we're out there yet so last one we're gonna we're going to power through it and take a look at it it is a difference equation it is definitely set the second order is it reducible it looks a little funny because I don't have them of Y Prime we've dealt with that before so that's not such a huge issue but it's not a it's not a it's not one that's missing X I'm sorry it's not one that's missing why does ever widen to their power it's missing X and it's missing that Y Prime that's okay we've dealt with it before we don't have a handle it let's make that substitution and see what happens so the first thing we're gonna do is realize that if I'm missing a variable then I can reduce the order of my difference equation by one by calling the first derivative equal to a variable and in the second derivative would equal the first derivative of that variable if we're missing X's that's a problem so we use that chain rule we use that chain rule correctly and let's make our substitution and it looks really easy at the start but we're gonna see some things in the second integral that I want to just make you aware not super hard stuff just just to remember okay so uh Wow what do we do do we ever change Y's did we ever change once no doing while crimes yes into peas and why don't rhymes yes into either dpdx if we have X's or PD PD widens we don't so that Y to the third that has to stay that Y double prime becomes P times DP dy and that one is right it is what it is alright well hey that's separable in fact I've already get my piece on one side DP but I need to group my y's dy is on the other side so we're going to divide by Y cubed and that's so nice we can do this by simple equation but again what we're seeing out of this is that on the left hand side we're going to get that P squared over 2 or that one-half of P squared on the right hand side well we think of this as an integral of Y to the negative third power so one-half P squared looks real good on the right hand side or adding 1 that's negative 2 we're dividing by the new exponent and we always get that arbitrary constant you should get another one by the time we're done let's simplify this just a bit because it looks kind of nasty you know what I'm going to do it is a couple things the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna leave that 1/2 for just a moment so we don't be confused we'll have that 1/2 T squared on the right hand side wait surely right this is negative 1 over 2 y squared let's see someone so we're keeping that that negative but moving to the numerator we have a 2 and a bi that over Y squared just wants your negative exponents in your sign so we're keeping this 1/2 P squared great we've got that negative okay over 2 y squared let's multiply everything by 2 when we do that we'll have negative 1 over Y squared Plus to see someone now do you remember me telling you that when you're about to go to dy/dx you're going to want to have one fraction over there because if you're missing X's all of this is in terms of Y this is not the same as if you're missing Y's all that would be excess that would be fine because you just do dy/dx moving the X and you're already good to go but when you're missing X's and not missing Y's all this stuff is going to be in terms of Y you're gonna have to move it to the left hand side you'll get dy over DX so Y is d Y's have to be on the left with X's again you're good to go you're fine there's move your DX and integrate that's what we saw a last video but here we're gonna have to move this left what that means is that we're gonna want to spend some time right now to just find a common denominator so when we do to make that one fraction let's go ahead that's x y squared over Y squared and we'll get P squared equals well let's see here's a minus one this is gonna have a common denominator for y squared so it's real good well this gives us some sort of a constant y squared minus one are you with me on that one you see it if I get my my common denominator I can move these around there they're not commutative but I can move my terms at long distance you know I can move my terms of their sign says to C sub 1 y squared minus 1 all over Y squared why are we doing that for two reasons number one and you see the square we have to get rid of that and we're gonna choose to keep the positive square root here so if we do let's take a square root on both sides because we have that one fraction already it makes it much much nicer to deal with so if you know you're gonna be taking the square root get that one fraction also if you're missing X's all of this right hand side of P equals whatever is always going to be wise you're gonna change that P into D by DX if the right hand side is all-wise and you have dy over DX you're gonna eventually have to move your wive's to left hand side so we want to create with these this white a this missing next technique we're going to want to create this one fraction pretty much every time especially we're taking square roots especially when we have this dydx we're about to get on the left hand side man we just get p on the right hand side why we got one fractious because you can distribute excellence across multiplication division because square roots are exponents they're one-half power we can simplify that denominator which is nice now that's something that's something that we can deal with because now they walk through the game maker substitution you go all the way down you're doing do our nice little and enroll say okay that's that's kind of nasty let's multiply by two great ok I'm going to take a square root it's real hard to take a square root of two terms because exponents don't distribute across addition and subtraction I can't distribute it across terms I can across multiplication division make a fraction so that you have division then we can take a square root of the numerator and denominator and then we realize we realize what P actually means he is dy/dx and now we're hopefully seeing it if you have no X's over here these are all wise they're gonna have to move to the left hand side so we're going to multiply by the reciprocal your X DX has to be on the right hand side I've made a little blurb made a blurb I'm a blurb here guys I've said a little blurb in a while ago that said if you have X's and are missing lies then if all these are X's this is a lot easier you just have to move your DX integrate that's the last bit of it so let's let's let's do this it's get our wise be wise constants DX the right hand side is always obviously going to be very easy because you have no X's you should have a DX and we integrate [Applause] I'm gonna move this up here to have a few more steps so now that we have moved up there um there's there's something that's starting to look a little awkward it's that to see someone so a lot of time this especially when we're about to make a substitution we want to make that part as concise as possible because we're going to be using it again what I mean is we're about to call that you this is not some sort of a trick subarray while this is just a you equals that inside that square root because the derivative is going to give us a Y that's going to cancel out that Y in the numerator so we're gonna make a substitution with that but before we do that it's really nice to make this look better because when you say you equal to that expression we're gonna have to resub stitute it so what I'm going to do is take a moment to say hey instead of back to C sub 1 since that's an arbitrary constant anyway 2 times C sub 1 gives us just a constant what's called C sub 2 y squared minus 1 then when we make our visa and say u equals C sub 2 y squared minus 1 the reason why I want this as nicely written as possible is because you're going to substitute this back in somewhere so you can be using that c2 again we don't want to have to write to C sub 1 everywhere think it's really awkward but what we're also not going to do we're not going to be changing this C sub 2 throughout this integral even if we get a concept or not going to change it because we have to plug in that C sub 2 in let me see if they're the same constant and I'll show you what I'm talking about so our D nu equals those two a C sub 2 y dy hey that's nice I've got a Y dy right here so we're gonna solve for a variable dy and that lets us make a very nice substitution so we do have an integral we've got a 1 over square root of U we call this whole thing you that's 1 over square to you we don't have a Y dy anymore we've got a d u over 2 C sub 2 so what can we do with that well we could call this one over to season two we have to all that constant mallet you have been negative one half you notice what I'm not doing right now what I'm not doing I'm not calling that cease of three why because I'm still in terms of you right and so when we substitute that back in I'm gonna have a cease of two here I have a season two here I'm gonna have to cease of twos and I want to show that those are the same constant that needs to make sense I'm not going to call this season three because I lose that so 1 over 2 C sub 2 let's see how we take integrals we add 1 we divide by noon exponents so you to the positive 1/2 over 1/2 hey that's pretty nice look at that we've got a 2 cancelling with a 1/2 that's great let's do two things number one we haven't even dealt the right side on the key right now let's do two things let's come back over here let's make that the square root of u 1 over C sub 2 square root of u well let's call you what it is seize the 2 y squared minus 1 this is what I was talking about now it's very clear that this constant and this constant are the same constant if we go ahead and call them like an A or something we're gonna show that so we've taken a nice use of but made it cleaner before we did it we did our use so just like normal we did our integral just like normal but when we're seeing constant that C 2 we're not changing that because we understand we've had the C sub 2 that we're going to substitute back in for that you so I'm leaving this so they can see when I do this when I step back for you these are the same two constants I hope that makes sense in your head the next thing we're gonna do is say hey you know what what this equals to is the integral of this X plus some constant and that is a different arbitrary constant so should you end with three arbitrary constants no this is the reason why we can't change in season two right they're this because you end with two different arbitrary constants not Celine so we have one over cease of two okay square root of u by nu with C sub two Y squared minus one and then a very easy in the bold let's multiply both sides by C sub two that looks like we can do that lets get kind of nasty I suppose we could square both sides maybe that one I don't think it's going to be much better if we do anything else besides that so let's look at what's going on we have an implicitly defined solution to our differential equation it is general it's got two arbitrary constants but this constant and this constant are the same this right here that C sub two times C sub three you can go ahead and call that one arbitrary constant now it does have the same concept here here here but that C sub three since we don't know what that is it doesn't really matter so we can call this like a y squared equals ax plus let's call that whole thing B and that is about as good as we can get and I hope it's making sense I hoped I know there's a longer video hope the technique works for you though I want to spend some time going through some integrals showing you some techniques showing you exactly how to deal with those constants because frankly when you're going through this on your own and they're not really showing you how they're doing it you're just gonna answer your own idea I have no idea where those concepts are coming from it can make you feel like you don't understand and guys you're very smart and you do understand this stuff if you're here you would definitely have the ability to do this so just just take your time learn from some of the stuff that I'm doing here that way it's the little things really then hold you back so let's let's make sure those things don't hold you back the technique itself I'm sure that you guys get so keep your heads up you're gonna do fine I hope that this has made sense to you and that you have a better feel about how to deal with these reducible second-order differential equations missing either X or Y now we've dealt with that X with both again you're going to want to use the missing why it's it's a little bit easier Missy next we have some more work to do so I'll come back with another video just a little while I'm gonna try to be doing one video a week from for the foreseeable future we'll talk about exact equations but I know a lot of you in the menasset pool have a wonderful day and I'll see you for that you 

Transcript for: What are Exact Differential Equations (Differential Equations 28)
hi welcome to another video on this video we're going to talk about something that a lot of you have been asking for for a while now we're gonna talk about something called exact differential equations and we are going to discuss exactly what that means so we're going to start with with where they come from where they're used and how in the world they get this idea of exact difference of equations and most importantly the process in solving for the potential function that gives us that exact difference equation so let's start off with what these things are now in order to get here you gotta you kind of remember something about calculus 3 you gotta remember that backing right there let's look at that if you have a function Z equals two variables x and y you have what's called a service in in r3 or three dimensions and if you don't remember that maybe check out finding differentials for multivariable functions from from calculus three so what that would create is some sort of a service now if you remember from calculus three when we set such a function equal to a constant what we get is something called level curves and you can picture like this imagine a surface and imagine the z-axis coming up and imagine setting that Z equal to a constant like 1 or 2 or 3 and the surface is doing something well if that cuts this surface on a plane like Z equals 3 would be a plane you're gonna get a curve on that plane and that's called a level curve or yeah that's called a little curve and so what we have is this idea that if we have a function that it creates a surface and we take this equal to a constant we're gonna get something called level curves and in physics and engineering these level curves happen an awful lot and they're very important and a lot of times where we're trying to get this potential function that's giving us a level curve and that's the the impetus for talking about these exact difference of equations so so one more time those are surfaces set them equal to a constant you get something called a level curve now I'm going to show you two ways to get down to the idea of what is an exact differential equation so I want discover what that means but what it required was as kind of knowing where we're coming from so so why why in the world are we doing this we have these things called surfaces if we set them equal to constants we get these things called level curves and exact differential equations deal with level curves that's what they're dealing with so let's see where they come from now the two different ways I'm going to look at this is if you remember back to surfaces the way that we can find differentials took a long time to explain and again you should check that out but in order to find the differential of such a function what we would do and by definition we sort of proved it and kind of a loose proof when when I went over it would be like this willing says we saved the differential of Z is the partial derivative of F with respect to X DX plus the partial derivative of F with respect to Y dy and that is the definition of a differential for such a function well let's let's look at a different way let's look at it from here so imagine you start with these functions that that's a surface you know okay well the differential would be this and you find that in any calculus book or one of my videos or let's suppose we start with the level curve how would we get down the same thing and the idea what a different way to look at this would be what if we looked at this as a function of two variables equal to a constant one such a case if I wanted to find the derivative of that function with respect to X I could do implicit differentiation and one way to accomplish that so taking a derivative on both sides with respect to X so let's take a derivative on both sides that will exclude to excuse a notation here I'm just going to do this derivative with respect to X on the right hand side and we know we're going to get zero derivative of a constant with respect to X is zero but on the left hand side the derivative of F with respect to X would equal we would take and and this is kind of cool this is a way that you can do implicit differentiation with respect to X you would take the partial derivative of F with respect to X plus the partial derivative of F with respect to Y but because you have that chain rule we have this dy/dx and again on the right hand side the far right-hand side you would get zero so well not just like a 10-second recap here we're looking in this two different ways and so we can get the same thing I'll show you that in it so if we have these surfaces that differentially be defined like that okay that's a differential no problem if we look at this as level curve well then if we take a derivative on both sides implicitly with respect to X that's gonna involve implicit differentiation or we can think of this using partial derivatives see well those those don't look the same how would we make this look like like that you know well firstly they're coming from a slightly different place right now so we're gonna have to change this one a little bit but if we formally multiply both sides or all of this by this DX that we can do so if we just multiply everything by DX then we would get DF or the derivative the differential f is we get a partial derivative of F with respect to X but we would have a DX now this would give us a partial derivative of F with respect to Y but we would get rid of that DX and just have a dy we would still have zero zero times anything still gives us zero just kind of an interesting idea now what change is just a little bit and then we'll talk about how these things are the same so let's go back over here we go okay well how's the differential that looks pretty close actually we just don't have a zero imagine that Z changes to a constant no right well if Z is a constant instead of an actual variable Z and we say we are going to set this function equal to a concept they give us those level curves from that service then this changes a little bit then this says all right then this differential if we set this equal to a constant it would just change to this it would be the partial derivative of F with respect to X DX the partial derivative of F with respect to Y dy and then we would get zero and we get exactly exactly the same thing so again there's two ways to really look at this do you look at it as a differential of some function equal to a constant well here's the definition of a differential from this surface and we go well let's just let's just make it equal to a constant if we do that then the derivative gives us zero and so we have this differential right there from that that function equal one constant or do you look it as a level curve and take a derivative on both sides either way it's fine if you look at that implicitly you got partial derivative of F with respect to X plus partial derivative inspector yd Y DX and we form ly x DX now here's where the main exact differential equation comes from what these are called what these are called this is called the total differential for some potential function I miss I learned it as parent function so I will say that from time to time if you hear me say parent function accidentally it really is a potential function I learned it the wrong way when I was going through it so that's called a potential function for some exact differential equation now why they're called exact differential equations these things this thing this exact same thing here is called a total derivative a differential or an exact differential that's the name of it and so when we talk about an exact differential equation what we're talking about is a differential that's coming from some potential function which is a level curve one time all the way through as fast as I can go like like maybe a twenty second recap we can't look at this two different ways just as a differential and then say okay but what if that is a constant well then we get this equal to zero and this is called the total or exact differential or we say let's look at this is level curves take a derivative on both sides no problem have implicit differentiation we'll have a 0 over here we'll multiply by DX and we'll get again the total or exact differential I hope that I've made this make sense of where it comes from the first time I went there that I'm going to what that actually means when I was learning and what does an exact differential equation mean where'd you come from comes from a differential or comes from a derivative and changing it into what's called differential form as a total or exact differential now why is that important what do we actually do well let's um let's let's go a couple more steps and see what's going on when we get these differential forms of these these differential equations or a total differential here oftentimes you won't see this partial of f with respect to X and you won't see the partial of F with respect to Y what you'll see is the letters m and n or some other letters but if we define m to be the partial of F with respect to X and n to be the partial of F with respect to Y then this total differential changes to M DX plus n dy equals 0 and that probably looks familiar to you oh yeah yeah that makes sense because we have this this okay that's that's the exact differential equation I've seen in my textbook but that right there is representing any an exact differential of some sort of potential function now here's the issue and this would be exactly what that differential is here's the issue we're not starting here in this class and ending here where we're starting is here and trying to end with some potential functions so so how in the world do we know that this is an exact differential for some potential function and here's the beauty of it so I want you to listen real carefully that understand where this is coming from when we this is when we talked about continuous and differential differentiable functions with two variables we learned something really interesting what we learned is that mixed partial derivatives are always equal on some sort of region where our function is continuous and differentiable I said one more time so look this is a partial derivative of f expect X right that's what that's what M is and this is a partial derivative of f respect to Y that's what that's what n is if we take another another two partial derivative this one with respect to Y and this one with respect X those things have to be equal if this is representing some potential function as both continuous and differentiable on some region I know that's a lot of theory but I want it to make sense because I don't want to just to give you the hell thought you understand the why that's pointless it it'll work but you'll never really get it so so let's let's get this let's see it's a real straight in order for this to actually work that function has to be continuous and differentiable on some sort of a region do you guys get that like it's got to be differential linked in continuously differentiable for us to even do this so we don't start here though we start here so how do we know we're gonna be able to go backwards well we know we're gonna be able to go backwards if we have these mixed partial derivatives being equal because what that means is man if this is continuous and differentiable on some sort of region then the mixed partials will be equal that means if I take the partial derivative of X and then Y it will be equal to Y and then X that has to be the case in order for this to actually be continuous and differentiable on a region for this up to work so when we start here we say there's a test that we can do if this is the partial derivative of F with respect to X let's take the partial derivative of this with respect to Y let's take the partial derivative of this with respect to X and let's see if they're equal because if they are that means that this comes from some sort of a potential function that is continuous and differentiable on a region which means we can go backwards and there's a way to do that it's not that hard in this video I'm going to show you two techniques might show you why I probably take the - show you both I'm going to show you that a lot of textbooks will sort of make you choose this one to take an integral of all the time you don't have to do that so I'm going to show you that and then I may and we'll practice in the next video in the third video I'm going to show you that there is also an integrating factor that we can find so I'm gonna give you everything I know about exact differential equations I can teach them in this particular class where we where we go the the driving thought behind this is we're trying to get back to a potential function you're going to be given this so in order to not waste your time what we're gonna do is we're going to test to see whether this actually is an exact difference of the equation for some potential function by checking the mixed partials then we'll be able to undo it so how's that going to work for us man if M is the partial of f with respect to X and n is the partial of F with respect to Y then the partial of F with respect to X and then Y is really just the partial derivative of M with respect to Y it's saying look this is the M is already a partial with respect to X let's just do it again with respect to Y and the partial of Y with respect X well this already is the partial of F with respect to Y let's just take that again with respect to X and these two things are equal this is a great point if these two things are equal it means that this is representing an exact differential equation from some potential function and then we can go backwards what these aren't equal well then this is not an exact differential equation for some potential function and we'd have to either a say it's not possible or be theoretically it is possible with some sort of a function that we can multiply and so we can make it an exact differential equation with something called an integrating factor now we've had that before that's gonna be in the last in the last video about exact differential equations so okay so let's suppose let's supposedly start here how in the world are we gonna do it I'm gonna give you some steps right now I'll talk about both meth methods that you could use to go back and then we're just going to practice two examples and we'll we'll continue with that okay so hopefully I've explained this well enough for you to understand that you understand where we're coming from that you understand this is a differential form that I'm sorry that this is the differential for this function this right here is the total differential for this function ends up being the same if you let that be set equal to a constant there's two ways to come down to that idea what we also learned is that mixed partials are equal so in this differential exact differential equation if bar makes parcels are equal that's coming from sort of some sort of a potential function that we can go back to that is continuous and differentiable on a region now let's suppose that we don't start here we want to get here let's suppose we start here at this that's exact difference in the glacier the first thing we want to do is we want to check we want to check the partial the mixed partial derivatives here so we want to check is that actually true which means since n is already the partial derivative of F with respect to X we just have to take that and do it with Y and since n is already the partial derivative of F with respect to Y we just have to take that do the partial derivative of n with respect to X those right there represent our mixed partials you could even see it like this partial derivative am inspecteur y must equal partial derivative of n with respect to X if this represents an exact differential equation so so get this real clear if this if this actually happens then this is an exact differential equation of some potential function so I'm like right off the bat you don't just start calling this an exact differential equation a lot of people do they go oh that's an exact differential equation no no not necessarily it is if the mixed partials are equal because if Parcells are equal then it's representing the exact differential for some sort of a potential function not the other way or not not this way not well this is an exact differential equation therefore this has to be true you know this being true says that's an executive it's equation of some potential function that we can now find so we check this and says hey if that happens right there if that happens then this right here is representing the exact or total differential for some potential function let's find the function how do we do that well let's think about it it represents the partial derivative of F with respect to X how do we go back to F how do we undo derivatives integrals how do we know undo partial derivatives with integrals but everything with the partial derivative it's held constant for instance if we took a partial derivative of F with respect to X we held the Y's as constants so when we do this integral of this partial derivative when we can get back we have this this idea that there can be a whole lot of terms with lies in them that would have been cancelled out and say this one more time when you take a partial derivative of function everything that's not the variable under consideration goes to zero if it's a term so like X plus y take the positive x that Y term goes to zero well if I'm gonna undo that derivative I'm gonna undo the partial derivative then yeah I can just find an integral with respect to X that seems pretty logical this is gonna say well hey M is the partial of F with respect X how do you don't undo derivatives do an integral with respect to whatever Verity - the derivative - but since it's a partial I very well could have a function in terms of Y that would be completely annihilated imagine it but the derivative of this piece this only have X's right all of its gonna have X's you're gonna be able to get the partial effect X everything over here that has no X is just terms of why that's going to go to zero and so we have to represent that I hope you're getting that like if you have a partial adventure this or a partial of a function spec 2x your washer gone we've got a show that doing the integral would give us something of why now most of your textbooks are going to end right there and say that's all you need to know then what we do is we we take a derivative of this piece and then we set it equal to man and then you're going to go and that is true but sometimes this can be very challenging and what some of the textbooks don't tell you is you can actually do it another way so instead of just saying well I got us I got to take the integral of M I have to do that have a G of Y that's really hard what have we thought about different what if we thought wait whoa women if ends the partial derivative of F with respect to Y could we find the same exact thing by saying let's undo that derivative with respect to Y let's do an integral of n this time with respect to Y but keeping in mind that you're gonna have this function of X that would have been knocked out when you take a partial derivative so we check we go hey if that's equal that's that is an exact differential or total differential for some sort of potential function well what's that mean then this is the partial of F with respect X let's do an integral but we're gonna have a function in terms of Y or let's do an integral of n but we're gonna have a function in terms of X no that seems really good but you're thinking by the way just so I'm real clear here you don't do both you don't do both you look at this you say which one would be easier to deal with is it easier to look at the integral of M with respect to X or is it easier to look at the integral of n with respect to Y again M with X or end with y which integral would be easier and you do that one you don't need to do both it's one of the other and then you go wait though I mean this is the function of F with respect X this is exactly what we're trying to find this is it but there's half the function I don't know but here's the beauty in this technique if you take an integral of M with us to X and you get a function of Y well well what about this what if we took this and took a partial derivative of this piece with respect to that y so we're integrating X we did some wise we don't know let's take the partial derivative of this function what if we're going to get with respect to Y all right then if I take the partial of this with respect to Y that's what I'm doing right here well this must be full think about what must it equal if I take the derivative of F with respect to Y I take the derivative of F with respect to Y it has to equal n so the idea is take your M do an integral tacking a why take a derivative and then that derivative with respect to Y must be home and it has to that's what this means that is the end that you're standing on your on your work right now also when you do this if you take a derivative of this with respect to Y you're going to get a G prime of y the first derivative of that whatever that function is respect to Y in then likewise another way we can think about it let's say you did this one because that was easier ok great right now this is the function of ethylene this is what the function have what the function you're looking for this is the function that you're looking for okay but you don't know the X is well we do have something that we we understand about the derivative of F with respect to X we understand that the derivative of F with respect to X is M it's the same thing so we say alright well now that we integrate it with respect to Y let's take the derivative with respect to X ok so we're gonna have this thing derivative whatever it is with respect to X and it's gonna have to be equal to M you're gonna get some derivative of that function of X a couple questions that students always have is this always going to be only wise yes is this always to be only exes yep so long story made real short integrate em with X then take a derivative with why instead equal to N or integrate n with respect to Y take a derivative and with respect to X and set equal to M you're going to have some sort of a derivative in there solve for that derivative so you're gonna have you're gonna have these set equal you're gonna solve for that derivative so solve for G prime of Y or solve for H prime of X and lots of stuff is going to cancel typically so you'll get something that's that's nice now again when you solve for this should this be in terms of Y only yeah that's that's that's kind of the point right because you have a function of Y's should this be an X is only yes now how do we undo so you solve for this right you have this equal how do you how do you undo that what we doing this so let's find G of Y our H of X G of Y that's doing integral of G prime of Y dy H of X let's do an integral of H prime of X DX shoot that so we got it anyway we took a derivative with respect to Y to get n to get this thing all right cool and then we undo that with respect to Y or we took a derivative of X to get to em to get to this thing so let's take an integral the spandex your variables have to match up anyway you're only gonna have lies here you only have X's here so that dy and the DX should be making sense lastly once you find this piece man I promised you earlier I said this is your function right it just has a piece you don't know likewise that this is your function it has a piece you don't know so either way you go here you're gonna get the same answer um do one of these ways and then the piece you don't know can solve for right here so let's replace it let's take these two things this is G of Y or this H of X and we replace it in our function here and then you know what you're done because what we're trying to get is our potential function right there this does it man would you replace that that is your function set it equal to some constant some C and you are your money you're good to go we're going to explore that in two examples if you're given an initial value after this step is where you plug it in so so keep in mind what we're doing right these are low occurs so they're curves and and like every difference equation when we solve it it's giving us a family of those scrips like an infinite family to figure out what specific curve you want what particular solution instead of a general solution in the initial value so I hope that makes sense to you I hope that the logic behind where you're getting an exact differential equation is explained well enough for you guys understand that's always my goal to make sure this stuff makes sense the process right now seems pretty vague because we don't have what's not but it seems pretty big because we haven't done an example hang on for it we have two examples I will walk you through will see how all this stuff works to make it a little more concise and then we'll go through it okay hang on I'll be right back okay I hope you're ready we're gonna go through how to solve an exact differential equation what what it means I'm gonna show you how all these steps make sense but now when we go through it there you're gonna see where these come into play so I know this is very maybe not vague it does fully explain it but without doing an example you're gonna lose track so stick with me on this one let's go through every little detail make sure that we get it so number one what normal is that well that's an exact differential equation written in what's called differential form so we have a differential equation is it exact well before we can say that we need to do a test on so for this let's test the mixed partials let's see what what happens now let's make sure that you understand the the terminology here and what these little pieces mean so based on the form of our total differential or an exact differential equation our partial derivative of F with respect to X would be this piece but this is written three different ways the partial derivative of F with respect to X could be written as that our saluteth F with respect to X and that is our M is the piece the partial derivative have inspected X is the piece that's in front of your DX so this in this case is just 4x minus y now the partial derivative of F with respect to Y according to our differential form or you could write it as partial F with respect to Y or you could write it as n that's the most common is this piece it's always the piece that's right for that do you why I need to be familiar with that this n is in front of DX so this n is in front of dy that means the partial of F with respect to X and with respect to Y now we do our test we see if this is actually an exact original equation by doing what's called a mixed partial so we want to discover is the partial derivative of M with respect to Y the same thing as the partial of n with respect to X since this is already a partial derivative with respect to X according to our form then that we're just doing to do with Y since this is already with respect to Y we're just going to do it with respect to X and that gives some mixed partial this right here would be XY this regular would be YX let's try it so look at that you're hopefully remember partial derivatives we look at the partial derivative of M with respect to Y say hey with respect to Y that's a constant that's 0 with respect to Y this would give us negative 1 now let's look at the partial of n with respect to X partial of n with respect to X this is wise that would be 0 with respect to X minus 1 partial and with respect to X is negative this is what we're looking for we're looking for the partial derivative of M with respect to Y and the partial derivatives and with respect to X to equal the same thing what that says is our mixed partials are equal what that says is that if our mixed partials are equal they're coming from some function where it is continuous and differentiable on a rectangle that's saying that we can work backwards and find a valid function on the interval that's what we're doing here we're saying hey this is now guaranteed an exact differential for some higher parent function we're gonna find that now so how we do it so we we've done check them good now we find and now we find f of XY based on that so so how how's that work this is where your textbooks pinafore would kind of push you to this and we're going to be at this time but I want you to look at this we're gonna look here and see which one is easier to integrate is it easier to integrate you this with respect to X or this with respect to what now line those two variables this is already a partial derivative into X so we're gonna try to undo that this is a partial derivative respect to Y so we're trying to undo that one which one's easier this respect to X this respect to Y or does it matter in this case it looks like they're about the same so I pick this one because I'm more familiar with integrating with respect to X you don't have to do it down there so let's try it and say hey well you know what if I'm man if if M is the partial derivative of F with respect to X which it is and that equals 4x minus y then check it out from here if I take an integral of both sides with respect to X then I would get f of XY is equal to the integral of 4x minus y with respect to X I'm basically doing this basically saying hey take an integral with respect to X take an integral with respect to X that's basically we're doing and we're saying well then this he's really not bad the integral of 4x would be let's see 4x squared over 2 so x squared X square root 2 to the 2 and Kansan of 2x squared minus integrals of things that are being held constant so what like why we get this X Y but we also get this is very important we also get some function of Y because if I were to take a partial derivative let's just verify this if I were to take a partial derivative of this thing with respect to X it darn well better equal M because that's what M means and means a partial derivative of F with respect to X let's take a partial derivative of F with respect to X and make sure that happens here those are all exits that before X here I take the derivative of X but Y would be held constant minus X is to be 4x minus X I'm sorry 4x minus y the derivative X would be 1 we leave the Y alone is a constant for X minus y here that that would be all in Y's so all of these terms over here that are added all these terms would give a 0 on a partial derivative with respect to X man I hope that makes sense for a lot of students is losing what how about that one why is that there because if this is that partial that's a partial then when I do an integral of both sides I do respect to X so I get this but it has some function of Y because that integral said that partial River says all those wise we go to cereal Lisbon so we we've checked it we know it's exact we labeled it we've picked something we're gonna integrate either Ammerman and you integrate with respect to X because it is based on it partial of X we do that we have a function of Y considering the partial derivative but no no so we're right here we found one of these two things now what we're gonna do is we're going to take a derivative and we're gonna say what's the point of doing this well we think well if you face this on and he said this is a respected X I did an integral with respect to X I have this thing with the function of Y then let's be smart about it what we have now is something that's really close to our final answer this f of X but we don't know that piece we don't know what G of Y is now is the process we're finding that well but we know something about this we know that the partial derivative of F with respect to Y the portion of your management of Y is exactly 6y minus X so what if we were to take the partial derivative of that with respect to life this would go to 0 this would go to minus X this would go to the derivative of G with respect to Y and this is really important right here understand this please get this this is exactly what n is the partial derivative of F with respect to Y is exactly n its n not n factorial I'm just end it is end you have to get back one less time all the way through because it's giving site again is that an exact differential equation for something yep because we check the mixed partials and that says that that comes from some parent function that's continuous and differentiable on an interval this has to be an exact differential equation from one of those things how do we do it take either one a miranne and just just integrate with respect to X for them or why for n great you're going to get something very easy to find typically and you get some function of the variable that you didn't integrate with respect to so for DX you're being the Y then be smart about it if this is the function that we're looking for but I don't know this function of Y let's take a derivative with respect to Y what because we know that piece to so take the derivative straight to Y so the other thing the variable you didn't integrate with respect to take that derivative and set it equal to the other piece so basically integrate em take a derivatives of equal to N or integrate n take a derivative set equal to n the key is don't forget about that all right now lots of things are going to cancel typically so like here you add X to both sides and we get G prime of y equals 6 wine let me ask you a question shouldn't it be in terms of Y only yeah because you said it's just a function of Y right so you're gonna get lots of things that cancel well wait a minute women or right we're right here by the way how do you find just G of Y integrated if G prime of y equals 6 while then she of y equals the integral of 6 y dy so G apply would equal to C ad so it's 3 y squared plus some sort of a constant now do we need the constant not really I'll show you why it's a little C sub 1 but here it is we took our animal we integrated inspect X to getting some function of Y we didn't know we took a partial derivative with respect to Y because we know what that's supposed to be what that does is that allows us to solve for the missing the derivative of the missing function of Y do we got it so notice take a derivative this you get G prime y solve for that how do we solve how do I do derivatives where we take integrals and you just found the missing piece that's right here you just found that so to replace that from step number two replace it from right here so our function is now this is great we got that from integrating our X's this is great we've got the same thing but now we know this this is 3 y squared plus C sub 1 but here's the thing here's where this constant does not matter we know that this is this was an executive equation for something that's of this form I recently there's something of this form right here so something in the form f of XY equals C well if this is sorry not zero f of XY equals C so we have solved it we now know the function we have all of our stuff all of our complete function there's no G of Y no H of X but we know that this comes from some function of X's and Y's equal to a constant notice how we can just subtract this constant and you would get just another arbitrary constant so typically people don't even have to show that you don't even need it because you're going to wrap it up in the concept either way so for us our final solution would say that that is a function in terms of exit live equal to some constant exactly what we're looking for - exactly something that's producing level curves for us that is rad like that's it that's what we want now if you had an initial value problem say Y of 0 equals 1 or something you can plug in the 0 for the X the 1 for the Y and you could actually solve for C that would give you a specific curve going through a specific point that would give you a specific differential equation sorry a specific function that satisfies the particular solution to that exact differential equation I hope right now that that has made sense to you I hope right now that you understand a little bit better about what an exact differential equation even means because half of but not half of it some of it is knowing what it even means what it means is it's it's coming from a differential form from some function that looks like this and if you have mixed partials that are equal it says that that differential equation is an exact form of a differential equation for such a function all we're really doing take a piece and it becomes very easy when you get it ok I hope that I've made it make sense you take a piece either and then do an integral have them functions you don't know take a derivative set it equal to the other piece solve for that that derivative of the function you don't know integrate and then plug it in we'll do one more right now and then the next time we'll practice just heck out of it alright here we go we get time for about one more so we're looking at this we're going to determine firstly is this an exact differential equation for some function that I'm gonna try to find if it is perfect we have an easy way to do it it is it's very streamlined very nice once you get the hang of it but we got to check it first because there's no sense of going through this if the mixed partials are not equal so I want us to be able to identify this I need you to be able to identify this I need you to be able to identify that from this form the partial derivative of F with respect to X in such a function if this is a differential equation for such a function if the function exists for which this is the exact difference equation then this part would be the partial derivative of F respect X bats of this it's always next to the DX and if such a function exists such that when I take a derivative of it and put a difference perform its this then this would have to be the partial derivative of F with respect to Y it's always next to the dy now our test comes in and says take the derivative of M with respect to Y and n with respect to X and it will create some mixed partials so this with respect to Y says that's treated as a constant so this would be for X Y and that would be 0 that would be a constant term and if we're only looking at y's are very well likewise here with respect to X that would be a variable to be 4x but that Y would be a constant like a coefficient but that Y with respect to X becomes a constant hey look those are exactly the same what this is proven is that f of X Y first because F of Y then X derivative of Y was a bit too Y and then inspect the X in other words our mixed partials are equal and what that says to us it's very important is that this is an exact differential equation written in differential form of some function that is continuous and differentiable on some rectangle now it's up to us to find it I mentioned earlier that it does not matter which of these you integrate you just need to know which one you're integrating so you either integrate this with respect to X because that's where it came from or you can agree to this with respect to Y because that's where it came from they looked about the same next time the last example on the next video I'm going to show you how to do this one it's it yeah so let's go ahead and let's look at this let's say let's pick this and say I'm going to take the integral of F with respect to Y that's our N that's 2x squared y plus 4y cubed now what do we don't like that if that's the partial derivative of F with respect to Y how we undo all derivatives is with integrals so let's integrate this side but we're going to do it with respect to Y we're doing this with respect to Y because that's what M came from us a derivative with respect to Y you're just I'm doing that and say let's undo the the derivative with an integral with respect to Y but what's gonna happen here when we integrate with respect to Y we'll have our two x squared Y squared but we would divide by two this is all treated like a constant so two x squared that's a number five and then Y squared over to our twos are going to disappear plus this needs to be integrated with respect to Y so we'd add 134 divided by the new exponent so before Y to the fourth over four and that's gone now every time you integrate you know you get a constant right every time but when we're dealing with stuff that came from a partial derivative this was the partial derivative of F with respect to Y that means that every function of X would have been cancelled out just exactly like we did up there right here when we took this with respect to Y this thanks cancelled out and we took a respect to X that Y cancelled out so understanding that this came from a partial derivative with respect to Y means that any function of X that would have been there in the original function would have been canceled to get this pieces in again because it's a partial derivative with respect to Y any terms or functions of X alone would have been cancelled out when we took a derivative of this with respect to Y therefore when we get it constant it can possibly have X's in it because those would be held constant with a partial derivative with respect to Y this is what our function looks like our function really is this our function is x squared y squared plus y to the fourth plus some function of X that we don't know now how do we find that well beautifully since we used n to find an integral to find our function now we can take a partial derivative of F with respect to whatever variable you didn't just integrate so we integrated with respect to Y right you okay I have a function of X that I don't know if we want to find the function of X that I don't know let's take a partial derivative with respect to X and set it equal to the thing that it has to be and is the partial derivative of F with respect to X so if I take a partial derivative of F with respect to X you have to believe that I'm gonna be setting this equal to M this is M this is exactly what that means so let's take this partial with respect to X now the variable that I did not just integrate in order to find the function that I don't know well let's see here that would be 2x that be constant this would be a constant at 0 plus if I take a derivative I'd have the derivative respect to X I check out the Sokol take a derivative respect to X this is the derivative with respect to X and this is M the derivative with respect to X as predicted as predicted a lot of things are going to because you're going to everything with wise in other words in this case and everything to exit we've done the other way you're just going to have a function in terms of X or what that's exactly what this says so a first derivative of the function that we didn't know is 3x squared I'll say it again the first derivative of the function that we didn't know is this rigged squared how do you undo derivatives let's integrate then H of X would equal the integral of 3x squared DX or that's just X cubed do I have to do a constant you should when you're doing integrals but here we don't have to because we know where we're going with this we know we're gonna have some function equal to a constant anyway and that constant we just get wrapped up in the sake of now you want to show it every time and subtract it totally cool but we don't have to but we do have to understand it's the following we've got to understand that if our mixed partials are equal this is an exact differential equation if right once we have that once we understand that's an exact difference or the equation take one of these partial derivatives of F with respect to whatever you want whatever looks easier and integrate integrate and with respect to X Y was and with respect to Y I did the second one to give you some diversity here so with respect to Y great okay do it you can have a function of X that you don't know okay well now take a derivative again but with respect to the other variable so you can set it equal to the other thing that's gonna allow you to make a derivative solve for the first derivative of the function of X that you said would have been held constant under differential differentiation with respect to Y in this case we do our integral we have our function and we are done so our function of X right here our function of x and y was x squared y squared plus y to the fourth plus some function of X that I didn't know and have just found and that's going to equal some sort of a constant because that's where these functions come from now we can write it simply like this and if you've had an initial value problem this is where you go ahead and plug it in what's really cool is if you take a partial derivative I'm sorry if you if you take a derivative of this with respect to X on both sides and you start figuring out and put in differential form it's going to be exactly that thing on the right-hand side you get zero on the left-hand side and you get partial derivative spec 2x that's that 2x Y squared plus 3x squared right there and then partial derivative with respect to that vector Y would give you that 2x squared Y of 4y to the third and then that second part would be dissolves well go to zero and you'd have that dy/dx which is spread here and here and that's that's it yes so anyway I hope that that's made sense I hope that I've Illustrated this well enough that you understand what exactly a differential equation that exact differential equation is where it comes from and what you're doing when you're been doing it I hope I've explained you the necessity of doing the test first because that's saying that makes partials are equal therefore your function is continuous and differentiable on some sort of a rectangle I hope that I've made it very clear that most textbooks will always do this integral and then take your derivatives city will do this thing and that is ok to do most of the time that's fine I made the point in the second example kind of went off script here a little bit to show you that that's not necessary you can certainly take the integral of this with respect to Y take a derivative keeping the function X taking a derivative with respect to X and then City equal to M that's the opposite way it will give you the exactly the same answer it does not matter which way you do that so other than that I think that's about it next time we're going to is we're gonna practice man just a whole lot of these to make sure that we're really good at it they don't talk about an integrating factor that we can use on these things that might not be exactly exact so I really hope that makes sense please leave comments if you have questions or anything I'll try my best to answer them so have a great day I'll see you for the next video you 

Transcript for: Solving Exact Differential Equations (Differential Equations 29)
hi welcome to a video where we're gonna we are gonna practice solving some exact differential equation finding potential functions from these exact differential equations and the last video we recovered was was what they were why why they are the way they are where they come from and how to solve them right now we're just gonna practice and like always I'm gonna give you a lots of examples because I wants you to try them on your own I'm gonna give you some that I think are a little more difficult course and that way we can see how to work with initial values so that's our last problem I'll show you where that is if you want to skip there and just see that one that's fine I will also show you that whether you integrate M with respect to X or and respect to Y first it doesn't matter so I'm gonna show you that on last example as well so let's get right to it well I'm gonna discuss with you and kind of review what an executive resolutely equation is as we go through this but mostly this video is about the technique of solving them so we're just going to get some examples under a belt that way you feel very confident going for the worst thing we can have is for you to go forward and not feel like you know what you're doing that's an awful feeling so I'm gonna make sure that you do feel good about your understanding this stuff because you really can't get it so let's take a look at this and the first question that you're gonna be asked is is that an exact differential equation and you're gonna look at it and probably you're gonna go yep and that's wrong that's that's a mistake and the mistake is that's not an exact differential equation of some potential function unless it satisfies a very specific quality and that the mixed partials would be equal why is that because in order for a and exists for a potential function f of X y equals C to have this sort of a form of a total differential or an exact differential the mixed partials would have to be equal same it came from some function where it was continuous and differentiable on some region and so what we're doing is going backwards from that we're saying the this is only an exact differential equation of some potential function if the mixed partials are equal because if that's a case then it is coming from some function that was continuous and differentiable on some sort of region and would have given us this differential I hope you understand the the very specific nuance there that it's really important you're absolutely gonna go yeah because if the mixed partials aren't equal then no that is not an exact differential equation of some sort of potential function so we're going to check that first it's a first step last video I gave you in some nice steps on how you go through we're going to explore those so step number one we're going to typically call this and and this and M is the piece this this partial derivative of F with respect to X that's joined to the DX and the N is this piece this partial derivative of F with respect to Y that's joined to the dy and we're gonna say all right all right well well if M is the partial derivative of F with respect to X so this is M and and it is the partial derivative of F with respect to Y this is bad so that's all well and good how do i do my test guys if M is already the partial derivative of F with respect to X then the mixed partial would take this and just do the partial derivative of M with respect to Y or in this case if you don't remember partial derivatives you really need to go back and check that out in this case we say well that'd be like an X sorry that would be 0 this would be 1 over X because those x's would be held to be constants now they don't go to 0 when you take a derivative son like this they are treated like constant coefficients so you get 1 over that constant so like derivative of Y over 2 wouldn't giving you 1 over 2 1/2 1 so we're gonna give you one half here we're just gonna get 1 over X I hope that makes sense to you so so one more time I'm not going to go through this an awful lot like really slowly because that was the last video we say all right hey this piece that that is and that's what we call them so if I want to find a mixed partial I just take the derivative of M with respect to Y and would give me X then Y likewise the partial derivative of Y with respect to X says well this is already the partial with respect to Y already so if I want to find the partial with respect to X after that the mixed partial I would take the derivative of n with respect to Y well let's I said that wrong find the partial derivative in respect to X this is already a partial with respect to Y so I'm just gonna go I want the partial to a 2x a mixed personal and then that's that's fine I'm just look at them take it with respect to X so all the Y terms that's a constant that's gone but the derivative of Ln X with respect to X will give you 1 or X oh that's nice that right there when that happens what that's telling you is that yes now you can make the determination that this is an exact differential equation for some potential function f of X y equals a constant now we can say that now we can say because these mixed partials are equal they're they're representing a function within that a function that is continuous and differentiable on some sort of a region whose differential form or total differential would have been this exactly this now we can say it's worth more time to go backwards because this is true we can now find that potential function how you do it next I do this every time I always write my mixed partials here I always do my structure here partial derivative F let's wait to x and y respectively and then I look at because I want to see it I really want to look at it I've asked the question which one is easier is it easier to take an integral of this with respect to X or this with respect to Y because the point is if we have a derivative how you undo derivatives if we have a derivative of function how you on your derivatives is with an integral we're about to take an integral and you're gonna have to choose either M take the integral of M with respect to x to undo X getting the function f or and with respect to Y getting rid of the Y I'm doing that derivative and getting F by and taking integral it straight to what either one works it doesn't matter sometimes they look about the same so this would not be hard to take a an integral with respect to X that's not particularly hard to do an integral with respect to Y it really doesn't it doesn't matter so much I would say that one looks easier to me because we get this this natural log it's fine Ln X we already defined that the X would have to be positive even to be up there so we're not gonna have any strange domain issues with that so I'm gonna do that so if they look about the same most of the time I would suggest to you because the most experts do this to just pick the integral of M with respect to X because we're more familiar with that but if this is considerably easier to do with respect to Y that integral then you do that one and I think it showed that in the last example last video I will show it again velocities include this video so let's do it again the idea that going through idea make sure it represents the exact eventual of a potential function then we're going to undo this derivative with the integral we're going to take the derivative again with respect to the opposite variable and set it equal to this thing and we'll talk about that right now so let's semantics over here we go so if we have this as the partial derivative at respect X then F itself would equal some integral of M with respect to X great let's do that it's not too bad then this would equal let's see X to the fourth over 4 plus y Ln X I don't need the absolute value because we've already defined that that X would have to be positive just by happiness this function the domain is implied so this would add the easy integral this one hey that's a constant that's like two alright so we would have two Ln of X but now the Y is held constant when we're taking a derivative there's my X now here's the issue I spent a long time on this and last video because this is coming from a partial derivative because we're integrating this if we wanted to get this back every function that would have just Y's in it would go to 0 for instance if I took this I took a derivative with respect to X it would have to equal M and let's see what that would do the derivative of this with respect to X is XQ the derivative of this with respect to X is y over X the derivative of this everything would be in terms of Y is 0 with respect to X that's why instead of just like a plus C you've got a function of wise because under partial derivatives with respect to X all of them will disappear we have to represent that it's incredibly important for you to have that don't put a plus C here put a function of Y because this is coming from a partial derivative with respect to X all the Y's would have cancelled so if you're not ok with this right now you need to go through just listen to where this is coming from one more time and then we're gonna move on right now so we know that's a partial of F with respect to X we undo it with an integral we say because it came from a partial all the Y's had we taken that derivative would have gone to 0 so we're representative of the function of Y that we don't know now here's the magic the cool part this is your function f of X Y this this is it it just has a piece that's gonna be all Y's that we don't know now we do know something about a piece of that differential that's all wise you know n we know n is the partial derivative of F with respect to Y so so wait a minute if this is the function of F just a little piece I don't know and this is a function of F under a derivative with respect to Y let's take a derivative of this piece with respect to Y that would be zero it's a derivative of some X's with respect to Y that's zero this would be just Ln X this would be the derivative another function with respect to Y so we've said okay man this is the function just integrate M with respect to X this is the function sum wise I don't know this says some wise I dunno let's take a derivative of this with respect to Y oh yeah that's that's pretty easy but wait a minute is it this itself the derivative of F with respect to Y yeah and they have to be equal this is what's gonna let you solve for that missing function or actually the derivative the missing function of Y is that you don't know so take the derivative respect to Y from what you found upon integrating really quickly I'd say integrate X derivative of Y integrate Y derivative X and then you set them equal to the opposite thing so you take your M integrate set equal take a derivative set equal to n if you integrate n take a derivative set equal to M so here we say this derivative of F with respect to Y that we got from here these are the same exact thing you have to set them equal so this is going to equal and I mentioned also in the last video that a lot of things are going to cancel out and yes you should end with something that just has wise in all of your X things all of your X terms they need to go away because when we take our integral here we say man how do you undo derivatives we just we just do an integral so if we integrate both sides we're going to get that G of Y is third like you we also talked about how the plus C's not really relevant I'll talk about why that is in just a moment but we integrated em with respect to X we take a derivative with respect to Y and now we set it equal to what it has to be equal to and we solve for if we solve them the the derivative of the function we didn't know we integrated it gives us it gives us the missing piece so now right back up here man elicits lion that is your function of a Beth but now we've actually managed to fix all that so we managed to figure out the missing piece here so we know that the function of f with respect to x and y is what it is this and this and this it just took us some time to find it took us the realization that taking a derivative the strength of y is going to say equal to end solving for the derivative of that let's just do a very basic integral to find that missing piece and because the potential functions are always level curves they're always two variables set equal to some constant we're going to show that that you will see so the final answer here the potential function that would give us that exact differential form is this I mentioned to you a minute ago why we don't need a scene if we had a plus C that would be right here is a constant I would just have to subtract that to the other side and would still be an arbitrary constant so it really doesn't matter to include most most people don't show a plus C here if you did you would just subtract it over and you'd get a different arbitrary constant which doesn't really make a difference I hope that that makes sense I hope that my explanation to you it kind of reinforced the process of finding these these potential functions from exact differential equations and and really importantly that you can't just look at it without doing that mixed partial and say that's an executive force equation the exactness of it the exact difference relation part of it comes from testing the mixed partials and then saying okay now it is I can guarantee an exact differential equation from some potential function and we go through and solve it that way so the next one I'm gonna go quite a bit quicker I think ivory explained the entire last lesson right here which is good you should see it again but but really it's check your mixed take either amber and integrate with respect to the variable you have a derivative of then take a derivative of the different variables set it equal to the opposite thing and that should make sense when we get the hang of it so I'm gonna go through one more here I'll give you about three more and then we'll have some great practice under our bill all right so let's do it the first thing we want to check is some mixed mixed partials let's see if this is actually exact differential equation so we're gonna call the part that's next to the DX m and the apartment that's next to dy and so we know we know based on the form of our differential here that if this is an exact differential equation or exact differential form of some sort of potential function then this right here is our M and that's the parcel Evon strike to X so I would write that down and this would represent the partial of F with respect to Y if this is going to be the exact differential equation we call this M and this end now let's find our mixed partials because M represents the partial derivative of F with respect to X we just have to take that piece with respect to Y so here we say let's see with respect to 2y that would be 0 this would be I'm gonna factor my head for I'll show to you but this would be derivative of the first times the second plus the first times the derivative the second now let's see here would be we have Y we got e to the XY but by the chain rule we get an X so that's e to the X y plus y and XY remember that this derivative with respect to welcome is zero but this is a product rule so derivative the first is why they the second plus the first that's our Y derivative the second is e to the X Y times chain rule chain rule says derivative of X Y gives you X because that would be held like a constant there man okay or the derivative of F with respect to Y then X is a mixed partial so now X this would go to zero and then this with respect to X would give you derivative the first is one that's e to the XY plus leave the first that's X derivative the second let's eat to the XY but the derivative of this would be a I can't a chain rule and you say the derivative of XY with respect to X now actually be the variable Y would be held constant and those are exactly the same thing I'm taking some work to go through those if you get a product rule but this is exactly same as that do the community of videos of multiplication what that says is that hey that is now called an exact difference equation of some potential function let's find it now we're gonna look back here and say which one would be easier for us to find and in your integral would it be easier to define the integral of M with respect to X or and with respect to Y I would say that one with respect to X so let's do that does it really matter it doesn't really matter sometimes it matters a lot because once way easier but it doesn't really matter you're gonna get the same answer so let's do this let's say that the partial of F with respect to X this is where we're starting that's M that's 1 plus y e to the XY okay so if that's the derivative of F with respect to X as far as impartial jury was concerned then if we integrated with respect to X it should give us our function back mostly the only thing it won't do well it won't give us that that thumb in any sort of terms that just had y's and then we call that a function of Y those would have all gone to 0 so we're going to say that yes this function is going to be the integral and let's write X let's see how we do this we take that would be held like a number like 2 so be a wide exponential would be give us that back but yeah if you did it you so you did that you said there you'd get bu d poles with respect to X Y the X what's really happen is you have an integral of 1 DX plus an integral of Y e to the X Y DX this is going to give you a viously an X but in this case when you do your U sub and you say hey D u is why the aect it replaces this whole piece you call it UD u and then we'd say X plus e to the U but U is X Y so we're going to get this X plus e to the X Y it's good to see this integration techniques from time to time anyway you feel you're gonna do the same thing I'm gonna erase this but just to use some here ok so but if we find now we have it wrong first off they were wrong the reason why we have it wrong is because every time you do an integral you should get a constant or you should get something that would be held constant considering where it came from because this is a partial with respect to X any function of Y would have been held is a constant it would have gone to 0 and so we're gonna say in terms of just align them would have gone to 0 here so we've picked em we integrated X let me have a missing function of Y now we're going to take a derivative respect to Y so we picked the derivative of M and integrated we're going to take as derivative of Y and that's not hard to do this is 0 this is going to be X e to the X Y by the chain rule and the derivative of the missing function of Y and that has to be equal to M so so again it's going to start I'm gonna say it a lot here integrate and derivative equal to n or integrate n derivative equal to M and so here we did integrate M derivative has to be equal to end and it's write it down so it's nice to see we just took a partial derivative F restrictive why it must be equal to this then if you are not cancelling out your terms that have X here you're doing something wrong the this missing function can only be in terms of Y and so this this stuff a lot of its going to cancel we're just gonna get to what man that's kind of nice because we know how to undo derivatives since this is the derivative of Y I'm sorry G with right to Y we know that we can integrate both sides and say this is just gonna be whatever the integral of 2y dy is or I squared so that missing piece is just Y squared since we've got our function right here and we just don't know that piece this is the only reason why we did all this stuff we did this another partial derivative to set it equal so we can solve for that piece and now let's put it back so f of X Y it's this stuff it's the X it's e to the X Y and it's the function G which we just solve for as Y squared it's nice and we know that that's going to equal a constant coming from the level curves that's where that's our potential function that we just found so Lord we're gonna write it that way one more thing if you're able to solve for y here a lot of times that happens so if you're able to solve it for Y and that's the BET's final so we can't in this case that's not it's implicitly defined but you you could do that also if you had an initial value that's where we plug in we say like hey y is 0 is 1 we plug in 0 for X we plug in 1 for y let us solve for that arbitrary constant into a particular solution so I hope that's making sense we've got a few more to do here I'll be back in just a second let's get started on a couple more if you can I pause this at least try to do this much of a good set up properly on both of these examples because we're gonna go through them fairly quickly we've kind of got got through the time of explanation like the full explanations and now just sort of really making sense your head now's our time for practice and in a in a class I like and you are my students right now I would have you do it just on your own I'd be walking around seeing how you're doing I can't do that but I would really like you to walk through that so let's do this together now that you've hopefully plus a bit you and try this on your own the number one thing we need to get straight is the fact that this is not an exact difference equation until we satisfy that test so let's call this M and and and let's write down these things so if if M represents the partial derivative of f of X which this is the difference performance what that does then is this piece and I'm always writing this down it's really helpful for us our brains to see what's going on most of us are visual learners and so by writing this down you are cueing your brain and you're seeing it your cueing your brain to see M is this thing the partial of F with X is this thing likewise for n what that means is you're less likely to integrate the right thing with respect to the problem variable okay so now that we have the partial of F expect X partial of F its vector Y we're going to find our mixed partials we're going to see if this is an exact differential equation so we're gonna find a partial of M with respect to Y that's 0 that's 1 over 1 plus y squared and I always set it up like this ok now the partial derivative of n with respect to X this is 1 this is a held constant so we get 1 over 1 plus y squared that right there's what you're looking for actually if you're not want any more work if they're different it's harder because we're gonna find an integrating factor in the next video that's good let us do stuff like that but it's much more work and so you kind of want that to happen so you gotta deal with an integrating factor to change this into the exact differential so that right there says that's an exact differential let's keep on going pick one of these that looks easier to integrate either this with respect to X I'm doing the partial or this with respect to Y I'm doing the partial this with respect to X looks much easier to me than integrating this with respect to Y so I'm going to pick this one I'm going to integrate this so because the partial of F with respect to X is X plus tan inverse Y then the function of F itself would be the integral of that so we're going to integrate x + tan inverse Y with respect to X and that's not that hard well we do need to understand is that we are integrating we're not taking derivatives here so yeah you're going to get this x squared over 2 that's not a problem but this doesn't go to 0 that's held is it constant so that's like 2 which means you would get 2 X or x times tan inverse Y but you're also going to get a constant only that constant would be everything that would just have wise because it's coming from a partial derivative with respect to X so we're gonna say G of Y we use G as a function for y is an age for the function of X mostly okay hey this is the function you know what we have we have all the X terms that we that we need this this is it this is going to be in a final answer what we don't know is are there any terms that would just have wise if there are then taking a partial derivative of F with respect to Y zero this is just x times 1 over let's see you have 1 over y squared plus 1 so this is a multiplication that will be held at constant like 2 you would get 1 over 1 plus y squared that's at 10 inverse Y plus G prime of Y if there are any functions and any terms that just have wise in them taking a partial derivative will let us solve for those because this right here has to be equal to n this is and we took a partial site to why that is and so let's set an equal and you go they said all the next stuff is gonna cancel under it is it just looks really funny so I thought what I actually told you was solve for this and then a lot of the all the next stuff is gonna cancel so if I subtract this and the first derivative of G with respect to Y is X plus y over 1 plus y squared minus this piece x over 1 plus y squared and I hope you're seeing it that has a common governor already if I subtract my X's are gonna cancel G prime of Y is just Y over 1 plus y squared and there's only one more thing we have to do we've got to integrate this to figure out the missing function of G so we're going to integrate looks like we're gonna have a new sub here integrate with respect to why you only have why is shoot it's it as a function of Y let's solve for y dy let's say this is 1 over u D u over 2 and though that's going to give us is this Ln there's a 1/2 Ln u we're not going to do the absolute value this can only be positive anyway and we would get a plus C but that's we determine that's really not necessary because if we had a plus C then right here when we put that G of Y if we had a plus C when we put that right back here that plus C is going to get absorbed into another arbitrary constant anyway so so weren't done we found the function with a missing function what took a derivative found the derivative of G respective Y with Y we solved for the function itself and now we're ready to put it back so the function is we have an x squared over 2 from we've got this X 10 verse 1 that stuff is gonna stay that's that's fine we want that the missing function of y was all we really wanted so if you have X's when you're done you've probably done something wrong and we would say that right there is going to be equal to C and so if you would have had this plus C right here it would have been just absorbed anyway I'm gonna leave it right there but I hope that I'm making sense to you I hope that when you're when you're walking through this on your own you're able to follow the logic down right now it should start being internalized for you saying yeah I understand that if I'm gonna integrate M with respect to X then I don't have a missing function of Y and if I can't agree and with respect to Y another missing function of X I hope you understand that taking the partial derivative of the variable that you that's opposite of what you just integrated with respect to is how you solve for that missing piece so take an integral M you can take a partial of wine set equal to n take an integral of n take a partial expected X it's that equal to n it's just the opposite let's try the bottle that looks nasty let's try this one and where we started we start by thinking if this is an exact different equation then that would have to be the partial of F with respect to X that whole gorgeous piece would have to be the partial of F with respect to Y and man we're gonna write that down we rinse in it and is this and it's all of this and now we're gonna do our test we're gonna find our mixed partials so we're going to take the partial derivative over and with respect to Y and n with respect to X we're going to see what we have so and with respect to y man well that part's pretty easy this part remember that this would be 2 X Y to the negative 1 so I'm showing this you should show this the derivative would be let's see negative 2 X to the X Y to the negative 2 so negative 2 x over Y squared that one's not bad with respect to Y that would be negative six Y over X to the 4 all right next one now a good thing that's with respect to X because that's going to go to 0 I like that but with respect to X so this is this isn't seen to Y X to the negative 3 negative 3 that's negative 6 X to the negative 4 so we have a negative 6 we still have a wine we know over X to the fourth now this next one with four members is respect to X so we have two x over y squared this would be with respect to X so 1 over just a function 1 would give us 0 oh great hey they're the same look at that they're out of order but that doesn't matter right now what we've proved is that that's an exact differential equation for some potential function let's find it now which one is easier to man which one it's easier to integrate either this respect to Y that's an that I don't want to do that or this with respect to X and either don't look good but this one looks a lot better do you see the point I would not want to integrate this with respect to Y it looks really junky don't do that do the easier one not giving me like what four in a row now where this is the easier or it doesn't matter so the next one I'm gonna give you this would be easier this victor y so we'll check that out in just a moment so let's let's go for it we know right now that the first or the partial respect to X is this junk this two x over Y minus three y cubed over X to the fourth because that is the partial of F with respect to X getting the function itself that potential function is sellable involves an integral of that that M and I'm doing the derivative with respect to the same variable so I'm doing that with respect to X okay well we can do that it's not super hard just a partial derivative for goodness sakes so x classy 2x over wife if we integrate that with respect to X Y is held like a constant so you think about this like two thirds X or something let's see we add one to the X exponent so I'll be to divide by the new exponent that would be divided by two we're going to get x squared over Y remember with respect to X with respect to X this is treated as 3y squared X to the negative four where that's just like a number like five or something let's add one to the exponent that's negative three divided by the new exponent that's divided by negative three so this would be a 3y squared X to the negative three over negative three those threes you can cancel we're going to get X to the third on the bottom and our signs being challenged but most importantly where I see a lot of students just kind of make a mistake here what they do is they'll put a plus either forget it and then we'll take a partial derivative they'll set it equal and everything will cancel and they go what about or nothing will cancel and let me get the problem I'm gonna solve great thing you have to understand that there is a constant here but it's any terms that would have been in Y's only those would be held constant so we need to have that now we say if that's our function we're missing a piece let's take an with respect to the variable that I didn't just integrate with respect to you so integrate X take derivative Y this right here remember that's a negative one so let's see negative x squared over Y squared with respect to Y here would give us a plus two Y over X cubed and then we get this derivative of Y so let's see we picked em integrated X derivative Y derivative Y is and we set it equal so this has to be equal to all this stuff hey that's wonderful because if we add this to both sides this is gone everything in for me actually you have to be gone here if we subtract this from both sides and this is gone and we get that the derivative of that function of Y that we really want to know is 1 over Y squared sorry I said the wrong one over two squared Y so the function were missing it would be the integral of that so the integral of Y to the negative 1/2 d1 that's nice that means the function we're missing is pretty basic let's see we add one to be Y to the 1/2 over 1/2 that's 2 square root 5 perfect we just found the missing function we just wrap this up we say hey now that we found this we know that the function I was looking for is this piece and the missing piece that I found by taking the partial inspector Y and then integrating after saying that equal to and it's just 2 square root Y that's really good that's about as far as we go we can't solve for y if we had an initial value we plug it in right there to solve for that that see man am I am I getting through am i am i really making it sink in we've done a lot of examples taking a long time I understand that but it's useful because there's some well I wouldn't say it's just incredibly hard to do there's some nuance there's some really fascinating things that have to be done just right and reverse really follow them and the better I can explain it the more likely it is to stick with you we have one more what I'm going to do in the last example I'm going to show you how we can pick this and integrate Y and then take a derivative with X and set that equal to n so I'm gonna do that one we'll also talk about initial value so hang on I'll be right back alright we're on a roll so speak so let's finish strong we got something to look really nasty don't worry it's not that bad it just looks really bad this example is just one that I want to really reinforce that it doesn't matter what you pick I've been talking a long time about that and where initial values come into play because they'd be remissed pleasure put something in there for you as far as that one so let's go through it I'm not gonna go super slow let's let's make sure that we're all just understanding where this come from we want to try on your own that man the best thing that happened right now is if you do it on your own get right if you don't that's okay you just to learn it but try it so is it an exact difference equation let's find out man let's find out let's call this M and this end and let's see what happens when we find or mixed parcel so if this right here is an exact differential equation then this would be the partial with respect to X and likewise this would be the partial F with respect to Y now it's fine our mixed partials it means if this is already a partial with respect to X take it again with respect to Y and that gives you this right here partial M inspector why would give me to the X plus X the X looked bad not bad for since this is already that partial districtwide I mean you can't respect X now that's the zero but that is a product rule so you're gonna have derivative of first that's one times a second PPS plus the first x times the derivative of the second P DX and that's exactly what we want our mixed partials to be equals saying this is coming from some potential function that's continuous and differentiable on some sort of region that's it that's all it says it says we can basically keep going now now we look at M and n which is easier to integrate it this with respect to X really you want any rate that that's horrible this rate that's not super fun I don't want to integrate this because this is a problem not a problem this is a problem this would make it really nasty now could you do it yes do you have to no don't let's look at this take this and say can I find the integral of this with respect to Y you know but I don't have any wise exactly that means that that's all like a constant that means it's really easy to integrate so let's take n let's say hey the man the partial derivative of F with respect to Y is N and it's really easy it's e XE to the X plus 2 we see if that is the partial of F with respect to Y then the function itself can be found by undoing that derivative with integral with respect to Y so how do we do that there are wise yeah no they're all constants so our function of f with respect to x and y would then be X e to the x times y plus 2 times y we see with the two pretty easily write and say the derivative of 2y give us 2 so the integral of 2 would give us 2y likewise here X e to the X is constant when we're talking about Y as our variable the only issue here is that we have to understand this that because this came from a partial derivative with respect to Y and we're integrating with respect to Y a function of X that would have gone to zero when we took a partial derivative check it out if I take a partial derivative of this with respect to Y this would give us that this would give us this and anything and only X's would go to zero that's why this exists to say hey there's some X's here that you probably don't know let's find them out we just integrated with respect to Y they gave us something that has X as we don't know because we integrated with respect to Y I'm doing the partial with respect to Y we haven't really considered the partial respect to X yet let's do that let's find the partial with respect to the variable you didn't just integrate so the partial of F with respect to X is well now we are going to have this this product rule so with respect to X this is going to give us X plus e to the X the wrong gonna give us e to the X plus X e to the x times y that's a big deal because we have this product rule here as B multiplied by Y that Y is a constant right so we'd have to distribute across that product rule I would encourage you to do it this way first and then distribute it but there are a couple ways you can't do this so the main thing here is to recognize yeah that's a product rule derivative the first one times a second plus the first times through the second but you are multiplying by Y can you see how a lot of people would if they forget those parentheses are going to really mess us up so be careful with that the second thing that I want to do I want to acknowledge that that's a Y with respect to X that goes away this right here says hey you can even this derivative of some function of X with respect to X it's still going to be there if you have any terms involving X and then we understand that that partial derivative with respect to X is what we called em so it's gotta be equal to M this you see a super-nice you know well if I distribute this so it's a tracking stuff whole reason why I got into math and I just love crossing stuff cuz he didn't make sound effects like Star Wars when I was uh it's probably a horrible ending but I could roam in the starboard generation and that's probably too much information for you guys anyway but when I was 3 years old my parents started let me watch Star Wars bad decision by the time I was 4 I'm not even joking you I had memorized every line to the first sorcerer who ever stood for so dorky but like as a four-year-old I just walk around like it doesn't matter anyway I love crosses to fell and everything crosses out have you done something wrong no you haven't done anything wrong all this means is that you have no function of X that's just X's where's that what do you do then when you take an integral it's just gonna give you a constant so if the first derivative of a function of X is giving you 0 then that function of X that looks really awkward yeah it really is awkward but that means that all you had was at most a constant here no X's you'd have at most a constant so and let's call that C sub 1 because I want to really show you one last time where that comes from so we had our function with the missing X there actually aren't any nice admission X's this is this is it you can kind of confirm that by taking a partial with respect to X and maybe this partial inspected wine getting exactly that and go oh yeah really aren't any missing X's but we go through the process we confirm that that that right there has no X's it would just be at most a constant so let's right so our missing piece is a constant now if we solve this for just our X's and Y's if we subtract that constant DC how a constant minus a constant is still a constant I'd really encourage you to do that first before you start trying to solve for your initial value otherwise it gets a little bit awkward so now right now now that we've solved for the the potential function now we get to use our initial value so now we plug in 0 for X and negative 1 for y and we can solve for that constant doing here don't wait don't do it later do it here because it's solved for that constant you say oh that's nice I don't spend the time to solve for y which we are going to do until I solve for the constant that'd be silly so if I solve for the constant now all the variables are here that is the constant it's much easier than solving for y and then trying to find the C basically better to undo everything you just did so plug in your initial value here x is 0 Y is negative 1 0 times all that stuff is 0 sorry I meant to see you so C is negative 2 ok let's plug that in let's solve for y how the world and solve for y well on the left hand side we could factor good week so if we factor this factor 2y and divide we actually have an explicitly defined function that's a particular solution and what it's saying is that we've now found the exact curve the exact function that has this as its exact potential equation or derivative in differential form if you want man I hope it's making sense to you I hope that you really seeing that the the finer points of the technique can you trudged through it yeah it's not it's fine it's it's much better if you understand it my job my goal is to always provide that level of intimacy with the sounds of hawkers with this problem with this sort of technique I hope I've done that I hope you understand that how these things relate the the very important point that you don't just assume it's exact until it meets the whole mixed partials being equal otherwise you do not just start this without checking that because you can go a long way and waste a lot of time when they're not exact I will teach you how to make them exact in the next video when we talk about an integrating factor and how to use that so I hope you've enjoyed it I hope that it's making sense to you hopefully you're encouraged that you're getting this and I'll see you for the next video have a wonderful day you 

Transcript for: Integrating Factor for Exact Differential Equations (Differential Equations 30)
hey there and welcome to another video our last video in fact on exact differential equations and we're going to talk about it so let me preface this with saying if you haven't watched the last two videos on what exact differential equations are and how to solve them you really need to do that because I'm not going to go explain what those are again uh what we're going to do is look at a very specific technique on how to solve some differential equations that aren't exact yet and we'll talk about an integrating fact and we'll learn that if we can make an integrating factor with just X's or just y's it's very easy very nice and will'll change something that's not quite an exact differential equation is something that is now you might have remembered we've used integrating factors before we did on some previous differential equations um several times but now we're going to apply them to exact differential equations and see what they look like so again watch those videos if you haven't done it then come back and see this one it's very interesting uh but you need a lot of background because I'm going to be using some terminology that if you haven't really heard or seen of exact difference of equations is not going to make a lot of sense so we're going to jump right into it and explore what this is um I'm going to go through a lot of theory at the beginning then three examples to show you exactly how to work it so what if you got a differential equation and it looks like it should be exact and that's why I say what if an exact differential equation isn't exactly exact what if you have this and these are not equal so what if you took the partial derivative of n with respect to Y and the partial derivative of n with respect to X and it's not coming out the same so the mixed partials are not the same saying this is not an exact differential equation from some sort of potential function that's continuous and differentiable on some sort of a region so what if that's not true can we make it true can we multiply by something that says Hey What If I multiply on both sides by some function of X and Y properly defined to make this thing an exact differential equation of some sort of potential function so well is that possible let's find out let's see if it's possible theoretically it should be possible all the time so what if we multiply [Music] by some function let's call it U on both sides so as to make this a differential equation that is exact and so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to show you that what we want to happen kind of drives what we um what we're looking for to make this exact this equation into an exact differential equation so let's let's start looking that at that so if we multiply both sides by some function of U I'm going to get a u here and a u here by distribution and 0 times some function of X and Y still going to be zero so our function U * MDX plus our function U this can be in terms of X and Y right now we'll talk about that later time ndy still equals z what we call that U of X this function in terms of um sorry U of X and Y this function in terms of X and Y or what we're going to learn later is that with both x's and y's this would be very very difficult so we're going to look at the cases where what if you can get exactly just X's or exactly just y's that's a lot nicer so what that U of X and Y is called is called an integrating factor it's something that U that lets us slightly change the form of a differential equation from what it is into what we want it to be now we did it several times before in a different few different sections but now we're going to use it for exact so very quick recap just make sure you you're with me I know that You' just watched the videoos so you should be uh just make sure so we have this thing that we really want to be an exact difference with the equation and if it is the mixed partials have to be equal if you check it and they're not equal that means that is not an exact differential equation or total differential of some sort of potential function so we're thinking how do we make it possible let's multiply by something that forces this to be possible is that even possible can we even do that well let's think about what we want to happen what we want to happen from our new form so this theoretical function that we multiplied let's let's think about what we want to happen what we want to happen is for this to be sort of our new M and for this to be sort of our new n so we still want the partial derivative of this entire piece with respect to Y we want that equal to this entire piece when we take a partial derivative with respect to X does that make sense to you I mean do do you get that that if we multiply by some sort of a function to make it exact it's still going to meet the properties of being an exact differential equation which means I need my mixed partials to be equal I need to be able to take this first piece and this just stands for some function of x's and y's okay I need to have this partial derivative with respect to Y to equal this partial derivative with respect to X and then we can guarantee that that was some sort of an exact differ of equation I still need that to happen so I still need to be able to take the partial derivative of this piece this function in terms of oh YY look x's and y's I still need this partial with respect to Y to equal this partial with respect to X in order to guarantee that this is of the form of an exact differential equation it guarantees it's coming from some potential function that we can find so now what in the world would that looks pretty crazy first of all and at the end of this I'm going to give you some better notation but right now it's important to see that this is in terms of X and Y both of them and so we're going to have to deal with some partial derivatives what we're going to go on and do in a minute because there there really shouldn't be any any suspense here in math what we're going to do is we're going to see that at the end of this if I say that kind of in the middle if I say that well what if this was just with respect to or just in terms of X would make it better or just in terms of Y would it make it better we're going to see yes and so we can simplify this a little bit but for right now to get the the feel of it here's what we would want we would need for the partial here with Y to be the partial here with X to guarantee exact now now what do you see what do you see do you see that you have a product and do you see that you have a product you're going to need to use the product rule so what we're what we're trying to do is we we're trying to solve for you we're trying to get some function of U that we will be able to know explicitly we're trying to find that um but in order to get down to the U it's all wrapped up in partial derivatives it's wrapped up with all sorts of stuff so let's take the partial derivative of this side with respect to Y this side with respect to X because that's what we want to be equal let's do it so the product rule says hey let's take the the um let's take the derivative of the first I'm going to drop the x's and y's but this still is a function of X and Y right now partial derivative of U with respect to Y so derivative of the first times the second plus the first which is just our U time the second the partial derivative of M with respect to Y we're just using a product rule derivative the first * the second plus the first times the derivative of the second do the same thing on the right hand side the partial derivative of the first time the second plus the 1 which is just U function of U time the partial derivative of n with respect to X so we've said this is what we need to have happen for an exact differential equation to be exact for some potential function we said well let's try to solve for you and that's what we're doing right now we're trying to solve for you okay uh well if I'm trying to do that then maybe I I need to actually perform the the partial derivative here and do the product rule all right so if I'm trying to solve for you it makes sense to maybe let's group our 's on one side and group everything else that doesn't have 's on the other side so we can Factor so let's do that let's subtract this over here subtract this over here so moving some things around I'm going to keep my U * the partial derivative of M with respect to Y that's going to stay there minus the U * the partial derivative of n with respect to X that's going to stay there on the right hand side so I kept this I subtracted this from both sides I'm going to keep this on the right hand side partial derivative of U with respect to x * n uh minus this partial of with respect to y * and just some algebraic manipulation we grouping our 's so 's on one side everything else on the other you're going to subtract two terms here now let's let's try to factor so if we factor out the U partial M with respect to Yus partial n with respect to X on the right hand side same thing we're not going to change that but we are going to talk about it right now why do we need to talk about this cuz that looks really nasty now theoretically yeah you could solve for you couldn't you just by dividing but but look at what's happening You' got a whole bunch of parcels all with you all with 's in them you got a u that is going to be solved it's really really ugly theoretically possible yeah um but very very difficult to actually make work effectively and often and so what we're looking for is man what what if we and granted this is a special case but what if we were what if we were able to find a u with just X's so if I look up here and say well what if I just what if I don't have a y so exact no multiply sure it would look like this now what do I want to have happen partial here with Y partial here with X but what if I chose a u that didn't have any y's in it so what if our U only had X's would that make a difference would that would that help us what if you only had X so so no y's think about what would happen if I took a partial derivative of this with respect to Y and this with respect to X but you only had x's and had no y's whatsoever this would still be valid that'd be fine because M can have x's and y's this would be fine this will be valad because n can have x's and y's partial derivative of U with respect to X would be fine because youu would only have X's but look at this the partial derivative of U with respect to Y If U only has X's you remember this man I hope you remember this that if you only has X's no Y at all and you take a partial derivative of a function that has no y's with respect to Y everything would be held constant it'd be like saying hey um take the derivative of this with respect to Y and you're going to go uh zero zero and zero zero exactly so if we choose a u that has just X's then this piece becomes zero 0 * m is still zero we basically annihilate that whole entire term you get do you get that do you understand that if U has just x's and no y's but the partial derivative of U with respect to Y would have to be zero that's an important concept to understand so we're understanding that if U has X's that thing's gone that's pretty cool that's going to simplify this a little bit later what I'm going to say is what if we had chosen to have U equals only y instead of x's well then this piece would be zero and so I'm going to give you two different formulas one of which occurs with what we're doing now if you use only x's and no y's but the other one would be what if you came back to here I'm not going to show both and what if you had y's but not X's then this would be zero and we're just going to basically flip-flop a couple things it's not going to be that bad I promise it's not this is just all the theory behind it because when you see this formula in your textbook for the first time you go what in the world is that it's it's not that bad what you're doing is you're saying I need this to happen for exact difference of equations let's solve for you as much as we can and let's make a restriction on it let's say to make this nicer to make this possible really for us let's assume you only has X's then this is zero what do I what do I do now well hopefully you're with me still if not go back and rewatch that minute what do we do now now we make one other little alteration and it's right here and this is important for you to get if you only has x's and no y's Not only would the partial Dera of U with respect to Y be zero because there's no y's all the X beeld constant but the partial derivative of U with respect to X is no longer a partial because U only has X's you're literally finding the derivative of U with respect to X not a partial derivative do you guys do you get that so like if that if that doesn't have any y's you don't need to take a partial it's just literally hey take the derivative with respect to x no problem 3x2 + 1 that's not a partial derivative so this becomes DX that that's nice what why that ice that didn't seem so nice to me it looks about the same garbage well hey if you if you only has X's you just got rid of a whole term you didn't know how to deal with but secondly you changed a partial derivative of U with respect to X because it could have had y's into a derivative of U with respect to X because if you guarantee it only has X's then that's now not a partial you why is that important let's rewrite it let's look at it also keep in mind we're trying to come up with a formula we're not trying to get one U for everything but a formula on how to find U and so we're going to have some ugliness that's actually very nice notice this too I want you to see it when when they give you this different formula that this is found already and this is found already when you check to see if your mixed partials are equal so you go hey you know what this you would have checked that wouldn't you and this you would have checked that too so that that's already on your paper not even hard to find on the right hand side we get DX * n now keep in mind what n is n is not really a variable and this is sometimes where students get a little bit confused on the notation keep in mind that M and N are functions of X and Y so it's not a variable like P or something that you would say I need to do separable equations here separate my variabl n right now is a function of X and Y all right so what the variables are that we're treating are X and U because if you look at this and this is just brilliant right now this is a first derivative of U our variable our de independent sorry our dependent variable of X our independent variable so so wait a minute wait a minute if that's a variable and that's a derivative you're you're telling me this is a this is a differential equation yeah yeah because we held x constant and I know there's a lot of theory here but because we held x constant we were able to change this partial into a a real first derivative and if you solve for that first derivative you can get I mean look at it if you got the first derivative of U with respect to X and you got a u over here and all of this other stuff is in terms of x's and y's then can't you do this by a separation of variables can we get our U on one side or xdx on the other side remember n and all this stuff has x's in it let's just group that and let's see what happens so what I'm going to do right now is I'm I'm going to switch sides because we typically in every example we've had we've had our Udu sorry um D DX on one side our derivative on one side and all the things on the other side um so I'm going to switch that before I start moving a whole bunch of things around okay I'm going to go through it one more time because every time my teachers in front of real students well I guess you are students right uh sorry every time I teach this in front of students who are watching this for the first time um there's always a question about about that they go why why why is this possible so last time all the way through all the way through because you need to get it in order for you to understand why this equation I'm about to give you Works um so what if exacts not exact what if your mixed partials are not equal multiply by something okay great what do you want you want the mixed partials of this new differential equation to be equal that's what you want to happen what we're solving for is the U that will force this to happen and we go okay um product rule no problem maybe group our use because we're trying to solve for you awesome all right we get this we look at and go that's really hard that's really difficult because I have partial Dera of you with respect to two different variables and then we say well what if we consider two cases case one where there are only X's then a partial derivative with Y would be zero and this would no longer be part the second case is what if you only had y's this would be zero this would be not a partial and that would give us our second equation I'm going give you just a moment so all right well oh my gosh if that's not a partial that's a first Der with respect to X I have a differential equation and now we're solving it we're saying all right this is awesome just like day one with separable equations so all right what do we do well we get our DX on one side and and then what we're going to look at is say let's try to get our U's du and all of our X or stuff that has X's DX on other side so so we got U oh there's a u maybe we divide both sides by U and then we want all the junk that has X's that has X's that could have X's this could have X's so we're going to keep this Over N DX I'm looking at it it's a first order differential equation this is my treated as my dependent variable this is my treated as my independent so I'm getting my u du/ u I'm getting my everything that could possibly have X's all of these X's this could have an X so all of these X's DX understand this is where the question comes from does what is n is n a variable no no n is a function all right and N is this little piece that has x's in it potentially and so we're going to have that this is a function that has potentially x's and so are the partial derivatives so we group everything that has X is DX we group our U du we go oh my gosh man this is like close to day one which is really neat that something as advanced as this is is from day one we do an integral of both sides and we say hey Ln equals this integral and I'm not going to Sol there's no way to solve it right now I don't know what these functions are remember we're getting a formula and so we're keeping it as general as possible the only thing that we've said the only restriction we've said is that well what what's the only thing we've said about this process so far we said that my U only has X's so remember that my U only has X's I'm going to check for that in our first example they go okay that's that's still really nasty um I've got this lnu how do I get get rid of the uh the Ln and you go oh yeah I would need an exponential and man this is me cool when you do an exponential we would on both sides so e e you would get U equals e to the integral of nasty stuff you go you know um that looks really familiar do you remember do you remember you remember remember integrating factor of row and it was um e to the integral of PX do you remember that e to the that looks very similar so here's what we've done we've said this is the U that's going to be necessary to actually make this thing turn into an exact differential equation of some potential function because our mixed partials would be equal if equals this that's rad that's awesome um the only restriction here that you need to write down and you really need to understand this is this is for a u with no y's X's only a you with no y only X how it would change and then I'm going to give you a shortened version of this how it would change is this if you had for um for no X's only y's we'd still get a e we'd still get an integral all that happens is that you would actually flip flop these and that would be an M hopefully that makes sense maybe you can walk yourself through that you'd still have an M you'd have an m and not an N so this would be zero this would not youd end up dividing by m do you see it also you'd have this uh because that's a negative we'd have to flip something around to get that not being a negative so you'd end up dividing byga M or you'd solve this in a different different order than I did and then these would be out of order so for a u with no x's and only y's we change this and that would be an m and of course we'd have a Dy why well that if this was zero this wasn't if we had only y's and no X's uh well then gone and then this would be a d Dy and we'd integrate with respect to Y obviously because we'd have only y's where we had only X's here this is for no y's sorry no X's only y's now the process is actually pretty easy um what we're going to be doing is we're going to look at this and say hey let's check our mixed partials if they're exact we're done if they're not exact let's do a comparison let's see if this gives us only X's or this gives us only y's and so we're going to do two different things we're going to subtract partial of M with respect to Y minus partial of n respect to X M over n and see what that gives us if it has both x's and y's it's not a good choice and then we're going to reverse it and do partial n with respect to xus partial n with respect to Y and divide it by m and if that gives us either well we'll see which one gives us just the variable we're looking for and whatever one works that's the one we're going to go with with our integrating Factor we'll take e to the integral of that and then we multiply the whole exact different we make it an exact differential equation through that multiplication now I promised you I was going to make this a bit easier but I want to make sure you see it I want to make sure that you're okay through here so if you're not you really need to understand the product rule the hey make um U X's only get rid of a couple things that changes to an actual derivative with respect to X that's an important important concept it's no longer partial and we do the reverse for this one so how to make the formula easier cuz man when you look in the textbook uh this is basically what they're what they're going to give you right here they say that's that's what you do and that's true but maybe to make it a little nicer what exactly is the partial derivative of n with respect to Y um it's the thing that you check right here it's the same thing so when you even check it's your first step to see whether or not you have an exact differential equation you are doing this right off the bat so it's not extra work minus and you're doing this right here that is what that is so you're checking your mixed partials right at the bat so to find your integrating Factor really all you do is you subtract them and you divide by the thing where you got your your last partial so partial y minus partial X and then divide by partial of n respect to Yus partial n with respect to x/ by the n and then this right here if this is in terms of x's only you take an integral with respect to X and you take e to that for X's or for y's what would happen well then our integrating Factor would be e to some integral but it's the same thing in reverse right there this is your mixed partials right there this is the partial der of n respect to x minus the partial der of M with respect to Y divided by the M this time and then with respect to why that's how I really would like you to think of it I don't want this to be crazy hard I I gave you the crazy hard stuff to show you why it works to show you that we guaranteed that it worked this is a this is really a proof If we um if we show that there are no no y's or vice versa there are no X's that this is going to be an integrating Factor that's going to make this work we we guaranteed it because we said let's multiply by it let's show that's what we want to happen then we solve for the thing that's going to make it happen we solve for the thing that's going to force this to be an exact difference equation really neat stuff and we said if this is true with no x no y's or no X's then we can find that it will be an exact differential equation some potential function and we can go and solve it with the techniques we already know so the solving part of this is going to be very very fast I spent a long time going through that that proof for you but now how you think about it should not be this difficult how you think about it should be I'm going to check my mixed partials so this is the thought process I'm going to check my mixed partials um if they're equal I'm I'm good okay I'm going to use the techniques I learned in the last two videos if they're not equal what I'm going to do is I'm going to start with this one X's are generally easier for us to kind of think about I'm going to start with this one I'm going to subtract my partials I'm going to divide by n I'm going to see if it gives me something with only X's if it does I'm going to multiply everything by E to that e to the interal of that um if it doesn't then I'm going to do it this way I'm going to say okay let's reverse it let's subtract them in an opposite order and let's divide by m this time and if that gives me something that only y's I'm going to integrate e to that multiply my my function or my difference of equation and get an exact difference of equation is going to work so what I'm going to do I'm going to rewrite these on the board we're go through three examples just one at a time U the checking is the hardest part the integrating Factor understanding um which one you use it once we get done with the videos will be very obvious but at first it's kind of difficult to see that and so we're going to spend some time on that and I'll be right back all right I'm ready I hope you're ready let's go through this and let's learn how to change something that's not an exact differ differential equation into one that is so let's take a look at it is it an ex exact differential equation you can't say that just by looking at the form that's not the way this works we have to check the mixed partials to make sure it's coming from some some sort of potential function that is continuous and differentiable in some sort of region right now it's not and let let's show that so I'm not going to write out the MN partial derivatives explicitly we did that in the last few videos and that should be very very comfortable with you what we're looking for now is we're looking to understand how to get this to fit that exact differential equation model so I might write something like that would be my M and that would be my n If This Were an exact differen equation we're going to check the partials right now so is the partial derivative of M with respect to Y which is 2x equal to the partial derivative of n with respect to X which is -6 x and you go yeah no those those are those are clearly not the same what that means this is not an exact differential equation these are not equal also if you like the notation of partial derivative M with respect to y or partial derivative n with respect to X that's fine it just gets a little bit cumbersome to right but that's exactly what these things mean if you like that formula better that's that's fine with me I personally because we have to write it a lot uh I'm going to use the the M subscript y to represent the partial of M with respect to Y and N subscript X to represent partial of m n with respect to to X so these aren't the same so Y what man that's not exact difference to equation how in the world can I make it work can I find an integrated factor and went through the whole process so here's the idea we're going to start with this one and we're just going to see hey if I do this am I going to get a function with only X's if so then I use that if not not I'm going to do this one and say if I do this do I get a function with only y's and if so then I use this so it's kind of like a check I start with this one because we're more comfortable with u with respect to X sort of things so I'm going to start with that one let's check to see if the first the derivative of n with respect to Y minus the partial with respect to X of n Over N let's see let's see what that is so for us all we're doing we're not doing anything new all we're doing is saying let's take this piece minus this piece / this piece 2x - -6x / y^2 - 3x^2 some of you will get very good at this very quick and you'll be able to do it in your head and it's not that hard because when you look at it you all all you're checking for is whether you're going to end in all X's here is there any way to get rid of that y like at all well no then there's this is not a good choice because no matter what you do and don't try too it's hard for me a Matthew to say don't try too hard but don't try to so hard to make this work into only X's without I mean just some simple factoring should do it if it's going to be possible so that would be 8X that would be something with a y That's not going to cancel you cannot factor that very easily and so we say no this is not a good choice for us so not exact but this is not giving us a function of U that's just in terms of X so let's try the other one let's let's do so X only did not work nope so let's try y only if we're going to have a function of Y only it's got to fit this model where i' have partial of n with respect to x minus partial of n with respect to Y / M so in other words you have flip-flop it this P sorry U this piece minus this piece divid by this piece and like I said sometimes you're just going to look at it and say hey this is going to work out real nicely because what we want and this is not an X this is a no what we want is for everything except for our y to cancel so here you want only X's here you want only y's and we see that that's going to work so this gives us us -8x over 2x y oh my gosh that's nice this is 4 over y now listen this is not your integrating Factor what you have to do is say all right now now that I've determined that there is a function in terms of just y as a matter of fact this right here says that's only in y's I can straight up integrate that you found the inside of that integral so what we know is that if our e if our sorry r u is e to the integral of thetive of n respect to xus of n respect to Y all over M Dy you've now found this piece that piece right there that is4 y so this is not your integrating Factor but what it does it gives you the ability to integrate pretty easily it's going to look very similar to linear with respect to y That's the only variable we have that would be well4 Ln y e to the Ln 1 no no it's not Ln to 1 y 4 and so we're going to get u = 1 over y 4 we've done this many times I know I'm going through it fairly quickly but this is really old stuff as far as doing this piece of it so again uh since it's our first example you checked you just check it's the same thing you do anyway right so check to see if you have an exact differential equation mix partials if you don't if you do don't do any of this garbage man if you don't try this minus this over this if it's only X's you're good if it's not try this minus this over that so the opposite way exactly if that's only y's you're good integrate take e to that and that right there so this is the inside integrate got it take e to that simplify that right there is your integrating Factor let's see how this plays out so if that's your integrated Factor where we started was is right here and if we multiply everything multiply everything by that integrating Factor man not4 y but e to the integral of that that's how the integrating Factor works we just found the inside piece integrate e to that gives us integrating factor of 1 y 4 let's multiply everything by 1 over y 4th again you're going to get that statement of make domain restrictions where appropriate or assume that what what you need to have is not um is not zero so we know why can't be zero and if we if we distribute everything here we're going to get this 2x over y 3r plus I'm Distributing here and here remember this would distribute here but you multiply through that 1 y^ 2us 3x^2 over y 4 and yes you need parentheses here DX Dy and still Z you know what you should do now just for your own edification just to see it take the next partials again this is your new M with respect to Y let's see that would be 2x y3r I bring down3 that's -6 x y4 would be over y 4 and this would be your new n with respect to X that would be zero look at that with respect to X that would be 6X y 4th what the heck that actually works this guarantees you that integrating Factor because we proved it that guarantees you that if you can make the first one with x's only or the second one with y's only it's going to make an exact differential equation for you that's awesome theoretically if you use both variables it happens all the time um but here you go hey that that worked that's now an exact differential equation and you go through it exactly the same way that you learned in last two videos so the way that we go through this is that we look at which one of these would be easier to integrate are you going to integrate this with respect to X or this with respect to Y this looks way easier to integrate with respect to X so we're going to pick that one remember what this is this now is the integral of the function we're looking for sorry the derivative of the function we're looking for with respect to X which means that our function itself well that's the integral of this with respect to X and that's really nice that means that we're going to get x2 over YB but we're also going to get some sort of a function that could have y's in it remember that that man this is the first Der of a function with respect to X and exact difference of equation guarantees that so if I do an integral and undo the X part so with respect to X I'm going to get a very easy integral to do but I'm going to get a a function of Y sorry it's not derivative yet think the next step a a function of Y that if I took a partial derivative of this this would go to zero since this is based on a partial der F respect to X we have to show that any constants that any terms that had y's in them would be held constant now the next step is let's take a partial derivative of f with respect to Y well that would be that whole - 3x^2 y 4 plus the first derivative of G with respect to Y and the reason why we do that we integrate M with respect to X take a derivative with respect to Y and set it equal to and because that's exactly what this means this means hey this is the partial derivative of f with respect to Y okay this is the function of F that we're looking for take the Der respect to Y but when we do that we know that that also has to equal this piece also has to equal our new um n if you will so those things being equal if we subtract or add that - 3x^2 y 4 this is gone and our first derivative of the function of Y that we don't even know we know the first derivative now we know that this is 1 y^2 so how do we under how we under derivatives Let's do an integral so the first derivative of G with respect to Y is 1 y^2 if we integrate with respect to Y then the function of G we're looking for the missing function from right here well let's see um y-2 add once1 over the new exponent so that's going to be -1 over y we don't need the plus C because this is going to be a function of X and Y equal to a constant anyway and it would just absorb any other arbitrary constant terms that you would have so we don't really need to show that what we do need to show is that our function that we had after understanding it's not exact X's only don't work for an integrating Factor y's only do work so we took this in the proper order we got4 y we integrated we took e to that we found an integrating Factor we multiplied everything by it it became exact we said all right that's fantastic uh what's easier to solve well solving solving an integral with respect to X here was easier so we took our M notice how the integrating Factor being y's only had nothing to do with what we chose over here all it did it made an exact differential equation force it does not affect the rest of it it's just a first step from here you do everything the same as what I've already taught you so we say this integral is easier take the um the integral of M that's M with respect to X great function of Y derivative with respect to Y great equal to n solve for for the derivative of the piece you don't know integrate we found the piece now we go back to the function we already knew but we now know what that function that missing piece in terms of Y only is it always going to be in terms of Y only yes that the G will be in terms of Y only and we know that's equal to a constant so we'd have this x^2 YB - 1 y = c and if you had an initial value that's where you plug it in I think that's about all I I really need to show you the next two we're going to go through probably a little bit quicker because I did sort of re-explain some of this stuff um but the long story made real short is don't confuse finding an integrating factor with actually performing the solving of an exact differential equation this is just setting have the proper form for you find the thing you need to multiply to make it happen after that from right here you're basically ignoring this you're saying that's not a substitution you just multiplied by something um so this works exactly like the last two videos pick the part that's easier to integrate either M with respect to X or n with respect to Y integrate the easier one whatever you integrate with respect to you're going to have a function in the opposite variable that you don't know that would be held constant a partial derivative take a derivative with respect to that variable a partial and set it equal to the piece that you didn't opposite of the piece that you just integrated so with M for an integral equal to n with the derivative and then we solve for that missing piece that's about it I'll come back with a couple more I'd really like you to try the next one on your own so when I start introducing it maybe pause and and try it okay let's give it a shot hopefully you can pause right now and try that yourself uh well actually hang on wait before you hope you haven't pause it already um before you do before you do that because exact difference of equations have have a plus between the two components that you have um you might see some people asking you to do this first while not extremely necessary you might see this and what that tells you is that okay just remember that when you take the partial derivative of this this piece it's including that sign and that's why they would have you do that so now you should pause it I want you to just test see whether that's an exact difference in equation or not and if it is great you're done if not see if you can find the integrating factor of course we're going to start that right now so how to go about doing it if this were an exact differential equation which it isn't actually um then what would happen is that this would be an m and that would be an n and we would say okay the first thing we do is we test it let's test the partial derivative of M with respect to Y and the partial derivative of n with respect to X N with respect to Y is one n with respect to X is negative one and you go man I I really can't Le can you just please change it to a minus no would ruin all the fun guys so so no you can't do that right that this is not exactly the same and for an exact differential equation the mixed partials would have to be exactly the same that's why it's so important to understand that that sign goes with that term that's why I introduced that to you so is this an exact differential equation no can we find can we find an integrating factor to make it exact and yes that's our next step that's what we're going to try to do right now so what we're going to do is we're going to do a little test and we're going to take this piece minus this piece over this or this piece over this piece I said minus I made a mistake this minus this over this or this minus this over that in your head do you see it right now do you see that uh this minus this over that will have no y's this minus this over this will have both x's and y's what's the best choice this this over that if you're not clear on that one maybe think about that for a second or just try both so we're going to start with 4 X's partial of M minus partial partial of M with respect to Y partial of M with respect to X All Over N the original not this the original saw that a lot with a lot of students they'll be like hey this divid by this sorry this minus this over that or this minus this minus this over just that number make sure you're going back to your actual n so when we're doing this we're taking the one minus the1 which is not zero over the N thatx don't don't do this minus this over that that's that's not what that's asking you for that's asking for the partial derivatives over the original piece n that's what that's saying uh which says that's that's actually really nice that's 2X or -2X ask yourself is that your integrating Factor no but what what we're doing is to find an integrating Factor we're going to have to integrate and take e to that to find the factor so long story made real short that's not exact it shows it right here let's take our mixed partials put them in a relationship that's going to work for us and say hey if I have only X's that's awesome I'm done don't do the next one why do the next one this will work just fine for us if you did the next one you'd take 1- 1 would be -2 but you'd have to divide it by m and that's going to have both x's and y's it wouldn't work for you anyway so find one of those things that's either X's by taking first the Der respect to Yus der respect to X All Over N or flipping that around that should be only y's so for us we go yeah our R uu is really nice it's an e to the integral of -2X DX that gives us this e to the 2 Ln X that gives us and you can probably see this e to Ln 1^2 or just X2 so our U is just X2 let's see how that flies what we're going to be doing that's not true what we're going to be doing is we're going to multiply this entire differential equation by 1x^2 and it is going to change it into an exact differenti equation so let's let's do it x 4 - x + y all DX plusx Dy equals z we know that and we're going to take and multiply all of this distribute through everywhere where we need to by our integrating factor of 1x^2 and let's see how that that works out for us so I'm going to move up there and get x2 we're going to get -1x we're going to get yx2 DX plus let's see X it's 1X Dy and still equal to Zer you multiply by zero function of x x cannot be zero here um X is uh well yeah X cannot be zero here and so let's go ahead let's see let's test it let's see if it's actually an exact differential equation by finding mixed partials this is our new M and that's our new n well let we try it the partial derivative of M with respect to Y zero cool 0 1/x^2 partial derivative of n with respect to x uh let's see this would be -1 x to the1 let's bring down 1 be postive one subtract one2 but move it down that would be positive 1 overx oh my gosh it worked hey it's going to work it's good promise proved it so if those are the same that means the mixed partials are equal I use different notation just to make you aware of that to reinforce that we're dealing with the same thing this is M sub y it's the same exact idea um I just wanted you to to see it to reinforce that concept so now that we're over this this this is now basically a besides the domain issues we have to impose on this is basically irrelevant and we do this process from here down exactly like any other exact differential equation we pick the piece that's easier to integr so what would you pick would you want to integrate this with respect to X or this with respect to y yeah that's a lot easier so our our derivative with respect to Y this is our n this is -1x that's exactly what that means so if this is an exact differential equation which we just said that it was then this piece has to be the partial derivative of f respect to Y let's integrate with respect to Y which means our function in terms of X and Y is going to be an integral of -1x Dy not DX you know that a lot of students get confused here right they go oh yeah that's going to be oh that's a negative L and X it's not you're integrating with respect to Y look if your partial derivative of f with respect to Y is this piece you're undoing the Y derivative der respect to Y so you're taking an integral with respect to Y now what what is that actually it's it's a really nice thing it's just well if -1x should be held constant it'd be like let's say -2 you would get -2 y so we're going to get YX but we are going to get a function that could have x's in it because under a partial derivative with respect to Y all of these X terms would be completely gone so we took an integral of this with respect to Y we Ted on a y and we also said a constant all terms that would have X's would be held constant under a partial derivative with respect to Y let's take the partial derivative of f with respect to x what we're going to do is when we take the partial derivative of f respect to X we're going to know that since this is the function we're looking for the partial derivative of that function with respect to X the variable opposite this one has to be set equal to that piece you see this is the partial derivative of f with respect to X so we're going to take it and set it equal to that partial respect to X that's a POS y x^2 but the first derivative of H with respect to X we did take a derivative that that piece has to be equal to our M because that's how m is defined m is the partial F respect of x all of your terms with Y in it have to cancel here just like all your terms with x's have to cancel in last example so these two they have to go away if they don't you've done something wrong so the first derivative of that piece that we're looking for that has only X's hey only X's we get x^2 - 1X and how we undo these derivatives is with integrals so the H of X is the integral of x^2 - 1X DX which means we're going to get3 X Cub minus Ln X now I'm going to not have that absolute value there because we can drop it from over here that's where the X came from that's what I was talking about a little while ago U when we talked about how your your integrating Factor really doesn't affect how you do the problem but it could affect your domain so watch out for that we'd say things like assume uh positive or not zero where necessary because we have the x s on our integrating Factor that's going to keep that positive for us and man that's it we're just going to put this back in the function so we integrated n with respect to Y then deriv respect to X that equal to n m so n integrate derivative M we solve that and we know that our function of X and Y it was here where we had a function that was X's that we didn't know we just found that function of x's and we know that has to be equal to a constant a couple other things that you can do um sometimes sometimes you will see this solve for y so is this okay to leave it like this I would say sure that's of the proper form but sometimes you're going to see that solve for y so let's practice that right now uh what we might try to do is multiply everything time x so if we multiply everything time x we would get just NE y 1/3x 4 - x l and x and then CX a constant X and if we add our Y and subtract our constant X which subtracting that constant you know what we're going to do right we're subtract CX we're going to change that minus C into just a plus anyway we would get this I'm I'm flip-flopping sides here I'm adding my y I'm subtracting my CX which is just fine so 1/3 x 4 - x Ln X plus C of X and and then when when sorry c times x when you get to the back of the book and you say wait a minute why is that a plus when the heck it's because they're saying let's suppose that C equals c and then you will see probably this because it's arbitrary and the sign doesn't matter for us man I hope that makes sense I hope that you're with me on the fact that once you find your integrating factor and use it you will get an exact differ equation it's going to happen and you solve it the same exact way you pick whatever's easiest M with respect to X or n with respect to Y whatever one you choose you're going to be integrating getting a constant that has the opposite variable taking a derivative with respect to that variable and setting it equal to the opposite piece you just uh to the the thing that you just integrated so if you picked M first you take a der respect to Y and you equal to N You Pick N first you integrate respect to Y take a der respect to X that equal to M and then that's the rest of it pretty nice um we're going to come back with one more I hope that's making sense I hope I'm explaining it well enough to you understand it's always my goal here so hang on for just a moment you know what I need to correct something I I I had this wrong in my head um after thinking about it this integrating Factor does affect the domain but only on the integrating Factor the fact that that x s doesn't need the absolute value I was wrong over here so I want to correct this right now um when we get down to here and we say hey this doesn't need an absolute value it's because we're squaring that we're squaring that X and the absolute value squared no matter what that X is is going to be positive but I was wrong here so when we get down to this this integral we can't assume that that X is always positive and so what we would say is we need the absolute value of that the absolute value is necessary my mistake I'm sorry but I noticed it right when I was about to do the next example and so we would follow that all the way down and you're going to end with an absolute value of x there my apologies on that one I I had my brain not straight so I hope that makes sense now maybe that clears something up for you um I do try to leave these mistakes um on the videos for the the main reason to show that it it's going to happen it does happen and hopefully you're learning from those mistakes so I I make them too obviously I just did because we can start thinking a little bit wrong um but that's why it's important to go back and check your work and so you look at you go okay let me go through this one more time that's what I did I I paused for a second I turned off the video I looked and said wait a minute no that that's positive that's positive because of that power two but that doesn't affect this Ln of X and so we need the absolute value there because those two things are not this is not guaranteeing over here is not guaranteeing the x is positive we need to make sure that the Ln has only positives in it so again hope that makes sense hope you you're learning from my mistakes as well okay we'll be back with one more example let's take a look at this one do you see the first thing you might do the first thing you're probably thinking I'm going to check mix partials and you're absolutely right but right before that you might take the time to write this as uh the the proper form if it were an exact differential equation which means that really should be a plus and we saw last last example that that that sort of impacts our um our mixed partials to make sure we're taking that sign with it so you might see this a lot let's just write this as the proper form if it were an exact differential equation it would look like this and we can we can now see that all right let's define it let's say that this is M and this is n and yeah and now you check your mixed partials and let's see what happens so if we take our mixed partial derivatives n with respect to Y we're going to get 2 y + 2x this with respect to Y is 2 y this to Y is 2X and then partial derivative of n with respect to X is -2X he said those aren't the same yeah exactly right so if those are not the same that is not an exact difference of equation some potential function F right now we are going to find an integrating factor to make it happen try it now actually what I encourage you to do try it in your head H at least check if you took this minus this and divided by that so this minus this that would be 2 y + 4x over that is there any possible chance that's going to get rid of your y the answer is no that's not going to work so I'm going to show that to you but you can eliminate that right now this is not going to be an integrating factor with just X's this is going to be if possible an integrative factor with just y's but here's how we here's how we show it so for maybe just X's we' say let's take first Der or the Dera of M with respect to y That's 2 y + 2x minus the derivative of n with respect to X it's -2X and we would divide that by n so that's here that's x^2 since this gives us 2 y + 4x over x^2 that Y is not going to simplify for us nothing there you're going to have both x's and y's this is not one we want to deal with so we're going to say no that's not the way to go let's do the next one let's just switch this around and divide by something else so let's try for y that would be -2X so we're doing the derivative of n with respect to x minus derivative of n with respect to Y yes you need parentheses so we're taking this minus this whole piece minus both terms here and dividing it by n that doesn't look very nice well let's simplify let's see what what can happen um what if we do simplify it this will be -2X - 2x that's -4x - 2 y over well let's see y^2 + 2x y that's not too bad maybe we try to factor that so let's factor out a -2 and get 2x + y let's factor out a y and get y + 2x you go I know about commity of addition I know that these are EX the same and I can simplify them and that gives us a function that's just in terms of Y that's what we're looking for folks we don't want to mess around with both variables so we try the X first if you have both variables no forget it reverse do the opposite subtraction divided by the opposite piece and so we'd say either this minus this over this or this minus this over that and that's exactly what we're doing here and so when we got that -2 y that's not your Integra Factor but it's the way we find it so r u is e to the integral of -2 y Dy U is e to the -2 Ln y we know that this is going to be e to the Ln 1 y^ 2 and then U is just 1 y^2 so we're going to get 1 y^2 that's what we're going to multiply our differential equation by to make it exact that's an integrating Factor so what we had Let's see we had this y^2 plus 2xy d DX are you with me hope I hope you're with me plus this x² Dy = 0 and we're saying that wasn't exact but but because we had this nice proof over here we can take this and we can multiply by an integrating Factor this time with just y's in it we tried X's it didn't work we tried y's it did and that is 1 over y^2 so we're going to distribute and that's going to distribute through to all of our terms in that factor which means we're going to get 1 y s * y remember we're Distributing here here and it's going to distribute through so one + 2x y that would be R DX plus x^2 over y^2 that's next to our Dy and still zero can you follow it can you do it because right now we're going to check to see if that's an exact difference of equation and it's going to be but what that's going to say to us is that we're going to start basically like two problems in one find your integrating Factor verify that this is your new M and this is your new n verify that those things I'm going to use different notation here to keep you comfortable with it that those things the partial of M with respect to Y and the partial of n with respect to X make sure those things are equal because that is telling you that you did it right that's a way check your work so you don't just do this and then go for the integration you do this you check man you check what your mixed partials are you got to use them anyway because what you're going to end up doing is you're going to integrate one of these right then you take a derivative and set it equal to these pieces down here your partial derivatives anyhow so you got to find them anyway you may as well check right now to make sure you've done this part right so this part's not a waste of time so the partial derivative of M with respect to Y that actually is a constant so zero this is going to give us a -2 x over y^2 and the partial derivative of n with respect to X is -2X over y^2 hey hey it worked of course it's going to work it has to work if you've done this right if not it's going to show up right here and then you go oh man I probably made a mistake back here let's check that and let's see if that I get my integrating Factor right this is awesome now we take a look at it and you tell me meth think it to me right now in your head which one's easier for you to look at would you want to integrate this with respect to X or would you want to integrate this with respect to y I don't see that there's much of a difference really this you'd have two terms this you I don't think it makes a difference I'll pick that one today so if I'm going to integrate so if I know that the derivative of f with respect to Y is n so this is your n if I know that n is the derivative of partial D of f with respect to Y then that is this x^2 y^2 then our function is the integral of that but just watch out this is the partial of f with respect to Y you're undoing a partial with respect to Y that means an integral with respect to y okay let's do with respect to Y uh integral of x^2 y -2 Dy what world is that let's see that's that we um we add one so that would be1 divide by the new X of1 so our function is going to look like this we're going to have this x^2 y1 over1 we're going to clean that up of course but we do have a constant we do have a constant in terms of X so that partial would say any terms of X are gone that's why we have a constant they could have X in it because we got this from a partial derivative with respect to Y so let's uh let's make this a little nicer so our our function says that would be x^2 over y and plus h of X okay now what now that we have the function itself so th this is our this is our answer it really is there's just a piece we don't know so if this is really our answer we have a piece we don't know let's use some part of this to figure out piece so we know that we used n with respect to y we got our function let's take a partial derivative of f respect to X and that's got to set equal to our M so try that partial derivative of f with respect to X okay respect to X that would be a 2X y plus h Prime of X the derivative of all that function of X that we don't know and that's got to equal man this piece is what m is so that's got to be 1 + 2x y that's got to be that if we subtract that 2x over y kind of cool we get the first derivative of H with respect to X is just one those pieces are gone let's see how we undo derivatives well we we do integrals so let's integrate with respect to X we just get X that's nice so let's see we integrated we found we actually found our function right here we were done we found our function the problem is there's a piece we didn't know we took a derivative with respect to X partial and that let us set equal to M we got rid of everything that had y's in it we integrated the function of X that was remaining and we have H of xal X let's plug that back in so our function is that's x^2 y plus xals some constant all right well that means that x y + x = c that right there is a potential function that would give us this exact differential equation it's fantastic uh the other thing that I want to talk about is sometimes I'll make you solve that for y so if they do that you'd have to subtract X and then we can multiply both sides by y divide both sides by C- x one thing I do want to mention here we don't we're not going to cover explicitly now but we'll talk about it later um is that when you use this type of a solving technique um this integrating factors sometimes you can get extra Solutions sometimes those work and sometimes those don't and sometimes you can miss Solutions like singular Solutions so be careful of those um that if you're if you're seeing some things like I'm not so sure we talked about singular Solutions a while ago I I mentioned a blur about it and I'm going to do a video on it about exactly how to find those um a little bit later but I want you to just be aware right now that sometimes you can gain Solutions or not find all of the solutions with these techniques we talked about that a while back how some of our techniques don't give us everything like singular Solutions of like zero um for instance so be careful of that um just wanted to say a blur about it but I hope this video was enjoyable for you I hope you learned this new techniques a lot of a lot of classes that i' I've seen teachers teach they don't even talk about this so hopefully that was kind of neat for you to see how a different type of integrating Factor worked I mentioned how there were other integrating factors besides just doing the ones with um with what we've done so far and now I got to show to you so that that's fun okay hope you enjoyed it hope it made sense and I will see you guys for another video coming up soon when we talk start talking about some some real life applications have a good day 

Transcript for: Introduction to Population Models and Logistic Equation (Differential Equations 31)
hi and welcome to another video in this video we do something exciting not that the rest of men unexcited super exciting but in this video we start to look specifically at some some very neat applications of differential equations now we've talked a ton about how to solve them now and we've done solutely some examples of some applications on what they're used for but we're going to talk about some very specific things in these next few videos we're going to talk about population growth we're gonna talk about how difference of equations do it a fairly good job at modeling population growth and decline we're also gonna look at some different techniques to look at this we're gonna look at at what are called equilibrium solutions and stability and we're gonna look at critical points and how all those play together but it starts with an understanding of how populations really work and how they can be modeled by differential equations so in this introductory section I'm going to show you that I'm gonna show you two very common ways that populations can grow and decline will talk about extinction will talk about population explosion will talk about limiting the carrying capacity and limiting populations so those are the things that I want to discuss in this video and then we're gonna map that over the next several videos we'll start with some very simple examples and deal with some ones later there that are quite advanced so let's run through exactly what it is that we're gonna be talking about and how a difference of equations can model these populations so we all know that populations change and barring an influx of immigration or people leaving like an exodus or something populations generally change depending on birth rates and death rates so we all know that the kids are born and and people die and and our population changes or or any sort of the population where things are born and dying it changes over time and so because their population changes due to births and deaths it makes sense that how our population is changing can be expressed by births minus deaths now know note something because population is a change in population and not population itself or with a rate of change with respect to time or a time rate of change it sounds kind of funny but it says how the population is changing in a certain amount of time and that's what we're going to deal with the increment for just a little bit so so think through this does a population change is that based on births and deaths well it seems so so how a population is changing is let's say births minus deaths great all right well well we typically have a birthrate and a death rate in any population but here's what we mean when we say a birth rate for a death rate what we mean is a birth rate would be the rate of births per unit of population per unit of time that sounds kind of funny and let's we understand what that is so let me explain this to you so when we say like it's a birth rate as this we say a birth rates let's suppose five births per thousand people per year does that make sense so it's kind of based it's not kind of it's based on the population and a time period and so this birth rate is a birth rate per unit of population per unit of time it depends on both things and so we're gonna say all right well if the birth rate depends on population population change also depends on time so it's related to both of them in other words we say hey this birth rate is related to both population and the population is related time it's going to include both of these ideas same thing with the date the death rate so our death rate is all right how many deaths per thousand people per year or per hundred people per month whatever it is it's per unit of population we're talking about per unit of time I hope this make this makes sense see let's do it a little bit of a recap here we're going to be talking about how population changes that's it's gonna be a derivative in just a minute with respect to time how the population changes is related to the births we have and the deaths we have and the difference between them so if births are outpacing deaths if the birth rate is outpacing death rate our population is going to climb if the other way is true if the birth rate is is below death ray probably it's going to fall you talk about that so um so let's let's look more specifically about this so if our birthrate is this this beta and our death rate is as Delta and these are all remember what this is this is the rate of births per union population per unit time well then let's let's think about that so our births themselves not the birth rate but the births themselves the number of births that we have since the births would be rated based on the rate of our births per unit of population per unit of time and the population is whatever it happens to be so amount and time is whatever increment of time we're considering when the number of births would be the rate at which our our things are our group of subjects is growing so the birth rate times whatever population we have at that time times however much change in time we're considering now let's go through this real quick so because a birth rate is okay number of the birth rate is per unit of population per unit time let's make sure these units match up so birth rate is per unit of population so if I say hey this is a this is five births per thousand and I have thousands here some amount of population units per year well I have a change in years here or days or seconds or whatever we're considering so these units would match up to the number of births and needs to get that so if this is per population and then per unit of time we're going to get the number of births ear burn three times population times time the same thing would happen with our deaths so the deaths would be the the rate at which things are dying her unit of population per unit of time some sort of thinker now these are incremental so this is considering every small that will increment well if we put this together if the way our population is changing is related to our births minus deaths and births can be represented by hey a birth rate per unit of population per unit time and deaths the same thing but let's take this and say hey the way that our the amount of change of our population the way our population is changing can be represented by births minus deaths only we're going to use this Earth's minus deaths let's do that right up here so then our incremental change in population would be about equal to our burdens minus our deaths now let's let's clean this up a little bit we we know that our birth rate can change with respect to time we said this is birth weight per population per time and it can change over time and so can our death rate the so current population is are all changeable with respect to time that all rates of change with respect to time so I'm gonna drop the T here here here and here we're gonna keep that delta T that the incremental change in time for just a little while just to clean this up a little bit so our change of population is remember birth rate times population times time minus our deaths death rate times population times time and we're gonna factor out that delta T and we're gonna divide so if we factor this out so factoring out that Delta team gap bird three times population - death rate Amish population and then we get this delta T let's let's divide that so we're going to buy the delta T and we have this birth - death times population if I continue to factor that piece so all we've done here is said all right you know what change in population should be the way that our births and deaths are related so let's subtract them and say the change in population would be births minus deaths we can get positive population growth or negative population growth that's a decline we say all right the birth weight what that means is the rate at which our were being born per you know population per you'd at a time no problem so our total births will be given them here birth rate times population depends on death rate times population times time would give us our debts at a moment of time that's what that means so if our population is changing comparing our birth to deaths then we can subtract our births and our deaths no problem that that's all we've done we have factored out our delta T we've divided by our delta T and we haven't we have an estimate with for how our population is changing with respect to time and incremental change if we take the limit then that error should go to zero and we have this this relationship that the rate at which our population is changing with respect to time is birth rate minus death rate times the population now this is very interesting because this is how a lot of populations actually change is in some way they are related to April they're proportional to the population this is this is really stranger babies in or two really important cases here in just a bit so what I want to talk about right now is if our births and our deaths are commonly proportional to our population we're gonna look at two case on how that is so one last little recap all the way through then we're gonna talk about these two cases and see some really really cool things about it I'm gonna go super in-depth on to why it is that sometimes we get is what's called a carrying capacity or a limiting capacity we have a threshold oh sorry we have a bounded situation with our population and sometimes we don't sometimes you have extinct extinction or sometimes we have explosion so in one of those two cases so we're gonna talk about that for a really long time this will be a long video as far as my explanation is concerned now our birth rate and our death rate can change that they're typically always changing and there's two really important cases that we're going to consider one and there's more than this there's more than just two but these are two very important cases one is oftentimes as our population increases the rate of births decreases map now that that can be due to intelligence of the species saying hey there there's not a lot of resources here so if we make more things they're not gonna be able to eat or just sometimes naturally this just happens and where the the rate of births is decreasing as the population is increasing on a linear type of scale we're gonna look at that the other case is what if we don't have something that that's that's thinking about that we're considering that is not following that model sometimes birthrate is just straight-up proportional to population so as the population increases the birth rate also increases as the population decreases the birth rate also decreases that could be due to just availability so let's say that there are lots of males and lots of females and they're getting together and they're doing the bunnies do that population could explode oh but but wait a minute what the population is declining well then there's less males and there's less females and they're not meeting is often that population become extinct we're gonna look at that right now so two important cases are what if the birth rate is decreasing as the population is increasing on a linear scale I want to also mention in both these cases we're going to consider the death rate to be constant so now that doesn't mean that for a billion bunnies we only get five deaths so what that means is that the rate of deaths per unit of population per unit of time is staying the same so old age people things are died of old age or something or some other factor that's in there but we're not going to consider that to be changing for these two examples can can of change of course and I will show you some examples of that there's lots to this which is going to take several videos so two important cases we're going to consider whether the death rate is constant is what if the birth rate is decreasing as our population is increasing on a linear scale so so how would that look well then our our birth rate would be some initial birth rate minus some birth rate that's related to our population so can you see how this would became first we can see it's linear based on the variable P yeah can you see that we would start somewhere can you see that we would have a negative slope so our birth rate will be declining as our population increases the population is a positive number so if V sub 0 is positive so we start with some sort of birth rate that's positive and we have some sort of population that's growing remember this number is this positive number is well our birth rate is going to be declining notice will still have births but the rate at which they're born per unit of population for every time period is going to be declining as our population it's bigger and bigger as our population gets smaller and smaller it would increase so they're they're inversely related that's the idea okay well and our death rate would just be C what would our death rate be well ever if our rate of death is not not changing if it's constant well let's just call this the initial death rate Delta sub 0 why why would that be a constant well it's not changing we can say whatever is in the beginning it's going to be there forever per unit of population per unit time now we're gonna do say all right provided that change of population is births minus deaths we figured out a birth rate of death rate so we figured out births and deaths in relation to level in terms of that birth rate and death rate and we factored some things we didn't limit we have this relationship the change in population with respect to time is birth rate minus 10 three times population guys that's got to make sense that's to make sense of the way of population is changing with respect to time would be the difference between the birth rates and the death rates types of population it's it's almost not even a long time through this but it's almost an obvious obvious statement so yeah the birth rate minus death rate gives you kind of a rate of change per unit of population so multiplied by the population you'd have the rate at which this is changing with respect to time all right so our if our birth search our birth rate is dropping as our population is increasing linearly and our death rates the same we're going to take this we're going to substitute this for Earth's this for our deaths so our change in population our time rate of change population in respect to time would be this initial beta initial birth rate minus some birth rate that's changing with our population - our death rate that's always constant times this population this part is this we've just said we have a initial birth rate and we're dropping as our population increases linearly and then our death rate is held constant man here's what we're gonna do we're gonna distribute all this stuff we're in a group some things together so let's look at the change in population inspect the time let's say all right so let's uh let's just read the P and then what I want to do is I want to group this together so that I have my alright so to have my my keys out front and my p squared the back so I'm gonna do this so we can see what factors in with is it I almost factor out the P from here I'm gonna put my initial birth rate my initial death rate together and then what we're gonna do is we're going to factor out a P so wouldn't let us sorry we're gonna factor out a this birth rate that's changing with respect that is affecting our our birth rate change with respect to the population we're gonna factor out this beta sub 1 and P for both of these and what's gonna happen we're gonna force this guy to factor so we're gonna be dividing that so I'm looking the same I can certainly factor out a P we'll put that out front I'm also going to factor out this right there that that birth rate that's that's affecting our total change of birth rate it's a cut it's going to be young constant so let's let's factor that out so we do that let me have this maybe someone population inside we're gonna force that to factor so factory means divide or divided the base of one that would be beta sub 0 I'm still this is your over base of 1 we factored out the P minus P let's make sure that this works man it's a lot of stuff so if we were to distribute this base of 1 we can so we get beta sub 0 double sub-zero and of teen that's this and then if we distribute here we did this is someone P squared that's this these are the same exact expression out now a lot of times in your textbook or whatever you're working out of you're not gonna see that you're gonna see this you can see suppose that this and this and this and this say they are all held constants if they're held constant then let's call this one k let's call this one m and you get something that you might have seen before you might you might see it now where did they get that they've got this expression and there's a lot of things hidden in there isn't there they've got this expression by saying this constant writing and it is a constant if I hold our initial birth rate initial death rate and the way that that's changed well the the thing that affects our guard told birth rate change if I hold this all be constant then this right here is the constant we call em this right here is a constant we call it K this right here is called the logistic equation so if we called these things to be constant and all positive then what this is is called the logistic equation you might want to you might want to note that for a second because this happens on a lot of population change is that we have something that our population the rate of births is decreasing as our population is increasing but death rates held constant it's going to yield something called a logistic equation now I'm gonna make a statement right now before we go on to the next thing so I'm gonna have to go through this one last time I'm gonna have to erase some of this and put the logistic equation right here and then I'm going to talk about what if birth rate is proportional population we'll talk about what happens here now I'm gonna go and if you don't want to watch it that's fine I'm gonna go behind the scenes in the list so I'm gonna talk about everything you really need and I'll talk about the the reasoning behind that in kind of a quasi proof sort of thing to verify what I'm saying so if you don't want to watch the rest of that you just want the bare bones basics here it is for the first part least when we did all this stuff we said the rate of population change is related to birds minus deaths we got all the stuff now then we said okay if our birth rate is decreasing as population increases but death rate is held constant it's going to yield here's all the math behind it something called the logistic equation this is the missus logistic equation if this this and this are all positive one suppose it means velocity that means that we start with a positive birth rate and we're subtracting something that is based on population this is always positive and this is positive then this means that our birth rate is decreasing as their population is increasing we have to have this positive otherwise if that was negative obviously this would be growing as population increases that's our next case and so this would say that if these are all positive our debt rates staying the same and the end is positive death rate that should make sense we have a positive initial birth rate that is actually positive and initial and in a way that our population is making that decreasing linearly that's going to yield that logistic equation we just end up calling this whole thing which is constant a different constant and this our constant K so I'm going to talk about what happens in just a minute I'm going to erase this little bit I'm gonna rewrite that logistic equation alright so let's take a closer look at the logistic equation so let's take a closer look at what would happen if our birth rate is decreasing as our population is increasing on a linear scale me get this logistic equation what's going on let's suppose that our population our initial population starts with M if P equals M you are not going to get any change in your population you're going to get this equilibrium solution this thing that says you're not changing at all you have managed to keep your population at exactly this level forever your birth rates and your death rates would even out and since your populations not changing in this case then your birth weight can't change your death rates are constant it's gonna be the same exact population all of the time we call that when we get there a carrying capacity or limited capacity so we're destroyed in just a second but if your P equals your M there there's no change now what would happen if P is greater than M what would happen if P is greater than M well if P is more than M you get this negative do you see that if that's negative this is positive that's population this is positive we help them to be a positive constant then that would be a negative if P is greater than M that's a negative that means the rate at which you nation is changing with respect to time is negative that would be a declining population go okay so wait a minute if are populated so M is a really important number if our our population is greater than that M then this is going to be a negative and our population will decline and it's going to be a population decline what if our P is greater than s are less than M if our our P is less than M our population is less than M our initial population then what's going to happen well if our initial population is less than M then hey that's positive remember that's positive this is population it's always positive if P is less than M this is positive and we will get a population increase it says the rate at which our population is changing with respect to time is positive remember about about slopes about these these first derivatives and if it's positive our slope is positive and our function is increasing this would give you a population increase now I'm gonna verify this the next statement for you in the next part of this video but yes this would be a population decline so so imagine this we have this number and that's based on a comparison of birth rates and death rates if they'd is greater than P you get it positive here so if P is less than M and that would be a population increase and the opposite is true if M is less than P or P is greater than M we get a population decline but only until we reach em why I'm going to show you that in a little while but this would be only until we reach em so here's the idea we're gonna have this this M that's a constant constants are horizontal straight lines so we're gonna have this M like this if our initial population is below that M we are going to get a population increase until we hit n if our P is greater than our initial population is created than M we're going to get a population decrease but only until we get to em and this this number M it's called our limiting capacity if we reach it from the bottom so if our population starts below and we get up to it that's called our limiting population and if it's something that we fall down to it's called our carrying capacity so M is this value that's either a carrying capacity or limiting population explain that one more time it's just from looking at the the rate of change of population state the time if that is positive then it's growing but how far it's going to grow until you reach M because at the moment that you reach in you stop so right there you say okay and that's called our limiting population that case so if n is above P we're going we're going we're going but the closer we get like that the closer we get to M so piece below it piece of piece positive for sure but we're growing so if this if the population is initial population is less than this value and then our population is growing that's a positive value but the closer we get so the population is growing but the M is staying the same the closer we get the less and less our population is increasing to the point that right here when this P equals M we no longer changing it anymore we just we reach it and we stay there or we get really really really close well what if that is true what if we start up here if we start with our initial population that is greater than this value and well then what would happen well that's negative if this piece of zero is greater than M and that would be negative and we would say there are our populations declining that that makes sense but the closer we get to it the closer the population gets to this constant M but less and less and less we're declining to the point where we're asking hi to that we reach what's called a carrying capacity so depending on where we start we would call this M this thing that we're going to end up at either a limiting population or in carrying capacity I hope that makes sense to you I hope that I've explained it well enough that you understand this thing called the logistic equation that at some point no matter whether we're above or below that's this at this value and this constant value and based on birth rates and death rates that we're going to reach it this right here is called a funnel and we're going to talk about funnels and spouts in the next few sections coming up what were we also talked about stability and things like that but what this is saying is that if you start here or here you're going to eventually reach this this solution this is business owned this carrying capacity limiting population now what if this is not the case what if our our birth rates are not declining as our population is increasing well that's not that's not true our birth rates are not declining population increases that are proportional to it then our beta would be directly proportional to our population we're gonna go right back to here yes all right if that's the case then the one even our populations changing with respect to time would be well beta would be this proportional to a population we'd still get this Delta and we have still a population I want y'all I want to make sure that you're with me on here this represents every suit every sort of situation right so we're gonna always come back to this and say the later population is changing with respect to time is some comparison of birth rate minus death rate proportional to the population okay so let's suppose that our birth rate is also directly proportional to our population it's not declining it's not declining as our population increases it's proportional to it all right let me as our population goes up the birthrate could also go up well that's crazy that makes sense that makes sense like if there's more things in an area they could breed much much more without a limiting factor this thing is going to explode or if there's less things in the area they might be breeding less this population might become extinct it's a different situation here so we're saying let's suppose the birth rate is proportional let's make this K times me let's hold that death rate to be constant okay we're going to do something just a little bit tricky so what we're going to do is I'm gonna move this P to the front what I'm going to do is I'm gonna force this thing to factor out a cave if I force this a factor okay then we're fine here we just get people what I have to divide factories right so I'm dividing out okay we're gonna get this this constant death rate divided by K which was actually remember that that was that V sub 1 beta sub water we had now if I define this to be an N so let's just call this n another constant then here's what's gonna happen in this case M is no longer called our carrying capacity or limiting capacity and is called your threshold and here's what happens it's wild but check this out if your initial population is greater than your M you have a positive changing population this remember this is slope man this is how our function is changing so if our population is greater than our threshold then that's a positive slope and it will never now its ability to increase and increase it increase imagine this so this is greater than M and if it's still increasing it's going to be even more greater than am been more greater than M than more greater than M your population your slope is just going crazy or sub is filled positive your population is exploding so it m is your threshold then if your population initial population is greater than M you're going to get a population explosion I think they call that like a doomsday so it just it explodes to so much then they're eventually won't be any food so I'm going to say explosion so a population explosion what if your population is below that below that threshold well if your population is below that threshold then look at this if your population is less than M populations less less than them so this would be negative the rate at which your populations change in this rate the time is negative its declining but it doesn't ever reach em it's always always below that if your population starts below an and you subtract from it well then it's even more below them your slope is even more negative you're going to get you're gonna get extinction what I'm going to do is I must spend some time to go through I'm going to show you this I'm going to show you why this is because a lot of times it's not explained a good a good teacher will probably just do what I just didn't say yeah you know what here's here's to here's a few things number one the way the population changes and related to births and deaths it's pretty obvious number two if if we have this rate at which your population is changing is a birth rate minus death rate times population so and somehow somehow it's proportional this and some men are speaking we have two very important cases there are a lot more cases but here's two really common ones number one our birth rates sometimes decreases in a population increases and we study all through that we've got the logistic equation and we said all right here's the thing about it is that if our population is less than our M we're going to eventually reach it we're gonna grow it's going to be a positive growth but we're gonna reach it eventually and as this gets closer to this this slows down slows down slows down slows down slows down until we finally hit it if though there's other ways true of our population is above it it well decreases decreases decreases but a decreasing rate and then we're going to get we're gonna hit that that carrying capacity anyhow so that's what happens with our logistic equation but what another case is true whatever with another case is that our birth rates just directly proportional to our population as it grows rhythmic roses and declines or declines well then what would happen here is that we have what's called a threshold and as your population is above your threshold the rate of change just keeps on increasing without bound this is bounded this one's not or if it's below the threshold it's decreasing and it just keeps on decreasing to an explosion or to an extinction a lot of times your class is gonna stop right here and that's okay that's okay if you want to know why this is and why this is I'm going to do some pretty hardcore math we're gonna talk about partial fractions I will take this and I will take this and we're gonna use it as a differential equation we're gonna solve for P and you're gonna you're gonna see why this is a carrying capacity gonna see why this is an extinction or an explosion idea so hang on for a little bit I hope that I've explained to you the way that population change is really the births and deaths I hope I've explained these two important cases there are more but the two important cases where if our birth rate has decreased as population increases we get a bounded situation I need that to be the case okay I also need it to need to understand that if we don't have that if we have the birth rate is always just proportional we have this unbounded situation should be kind of kind of makes sense right if if we have a birth rate decrease it's published in increases you're going to hit a balance at some point but if you have it growing it as before just directly proportional it's going to be unbounded we're square that just meant okay so now that we should have a fairly good idea about how population change is related to birth rates and death rates and we had two very important cases we have that logistically logistic equation would mean that the birth rate is increasing as populations decreasing or decreasing as populations increasing inversely related I hope that made it make sense that if that's the case then remember that your birth rates are slowing and if we start up here that your population would look like this your birth rate and the rate of change of your population your slope will be increasing as your population is decreasing do you see that your population is going down your birth rates going up or vice versa if our population is going up our birth rate is decreasing on the way to the rate at which our population is slow me down it's decreasing so increasing at a decreasing rate or decrease in an increasing rate compared to our population what that's going to do is always give you some sort of a founded situation it has to this one's not that case this one says if you have a threshold if you start up here you are increasing at an increasing rate or you are decreasing at a decreasing rate your slope is negative he just keeps on getting more negative that's explosion or extinction I'm gonna show you mathematically why that happens not just show you in a picture I'm sure he mathematically so we're gonna solve we're gonna take that we're in salt it's gonna take a lot of time alright so because that's a difference of equation you go man I know about that I know the been acceptable and you're right so let's go ahead and group our P's DP and our constants DT let's take an integral now look inside we're gonna get something that's partial fractions yeah partial fraction BAM done that a long time yeah we're gonna get partial fractions do you remember this how we can say this this fraction can be separated as a over P plus B over m minus P oh yeah okay over that I remember that one equals a times M minus people are just getting some common denominators and seven of equal to the numerator might have been a long time for you plus B P if I let P equals 0 then P is there let's see that's 0 this would be a 1 equal a times M and so a would equal 1 over m and if P equals M [Music] so people's M this would be 0 this would be M 1 equals B M and B would be 1 over m so in both cases we're going to get this one so ya 1 over m p & 1 over m times n P I'm going to show that right now so we've used partial fractions here if you don't remember that on this and put a link up there so you can follow partial fractions again and we're going to get that this equals let's see it is 1 over N so 1 over NP plus B is also 1 over N 1 over m times n minus P DP on the right hand side we get this KT plus some sort of a concept and yeah we do need it we don't need on the left hand side because we will absorb it but we do need at least one constant here we'll see why in just a bit so oh my gosh well hey you know what those both have a factor of 1 over m let's pull that out another thing that I'm going to do and this is gonna seem kind of weird at first until you realize why I'm why I'm doing it so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pull out a negative I'm going to factor out a negative as well so I'm gonna put this 1 over P plus 1 over n minus P DP what I'm gonna choose to do is I'm gonna factor out a negative let's say all right let's make this negative now what would happen if i factor a negative is I'm gonna give negative 1 over P plus this is going to give us 1 over P minus M not M minus P and then factor the negative and we change its sign now I'm actually ready to do this integral if I integrate this this would be a negative 1 over m and we would get let's see 1 over P that's LNS of AP but either negative so Ellen 1 over P gives me Ellen absolute value P they you front same thing happens here you can do use of but because we factored out that negative right there we factor negative changer signs because because we did that remember our variables P we don't care about the M we don't have to use a use of like it all for there's no negative here this would just be this plus Ln absolute value P minus m and yeah we have a constant but we can reabsorb so making sense apart now here's what I'm gonna do two things right now I'm gonna multiply both sides by negative and that's going to clear this that's going to give us something be multiplied here I'm also going to say do you remember that Ln of M minus Ln of n will give you Ln of n over n do you remember that we can combine two logarithms being subtracted by dividing we have a logarithm - a logarithm we're going to make that a quotient here so I'm multiplying my negative M I'm also combining this we're going to get Ln absolute value this over this and I've x ham I've also distributed we're getting their head then looks nasty Boober we're sort of hitting there now we're gonna make an exponent on both sides so P to raise to both of these as exponents gonna give us this P minus M over P equals I'm gonna do a couple of fancy things here if I do e here and E here do you remember that I can separate my exponent I can take e to both of those terms and this would give us this e to the negative n ket times e to the negative n see that right there is a constant if I wrap up my absolute value in a plus and minus this whole thing is going to be one giant constant so all of this gonna change and this is gonna give us a constant e to the negative n ket I know that that's that's kind of quick but we've done this so many times in this in this course so we know that this is gonna be e to the negative M KT we know that this is going to be e to the negative MC plus and minus from absolute value we wrap all of that idea into a concept that's being multiplied times e to the negative M K T now we have to solve for P so here's what we're gonna do what we're going to do is is to kind of weird face number one I want to get rid of that constant how the wording really continent I'm gonna do it here because every population has an initial value doesn't it so when we take a look at an example the population at time zero is going to be an initial population now I'm gonna plug that in right now I'm gonna get our C and our C is going to equal P sub 0 minus M over P sub 0 but I'm not gonna plug it in until later why is because it gets real nasty if we try to do that right now really really really crazy so what I've done I've got all the way through the part of fractions I've just integrated we got this trying to solve for P I want to also solve for C in terms of our initial population and so I'm going to plug in 0 for T I'm gonna plug in P sub 0 for P remember this is a function of P based on time population based on time that's a constant that's a constant that's a constant that's our independent variable and then our PS are deep in it very short of solving for P and right now I plug in 0 for T and get P Sub Zero for the P and relationship to that zero I'm gonna get my C but I'm not gonna plug it in yet so if I plug in 0 for T notices look at if I plug in 0 for T this whole thing would be 0 I started this whole thing we zero this would be 1 I would get P sub 0 minus M over P sub 0 equals C times 1 C is this right here so I'll write that to the side and say see is P sub 0 minus M or just M ever over P sub 0 we are going to use that in just a minute I promise but before we do it before plug it in there let's leave this where it is because it's much nicer to work with right now and let's solve for P we're going to multiply both sides by P we're going to improve our P terms on one side and our n term on the other so I'm going to subtract this from both sides and add our M so we've subtracted this we're going to add our M let's factor that P since we have two terms and let's do by the sulfur people now I promise you we're gonna come back to this but do you know there's a lot nicer dude that's see but we do have our see right here we're gonna now plug in that see because we want this in terms of P and a constant K with T they're variable remember the M is a constant K is also a constant we know what those things where we define them for the logistic equation and then that's C we now know what that is let's see is this piece of zero initial population - am a constant over P Sub Zero and plug that in now so our population with respect to time is some constant end based on birth rate and death rate 1 - C is that piece of zero - end of the piece of zero so that is C times e to the negative n ket now that might not look very good to you but we are almost done all we're going to do because this is a complex fraction and you know how to accomplish fractions right we know how to multiply my piece of 0 over T sub 0 just multiply by the LCD or denominator yes this is going to multiply give you something very nice n times P sub 0 this is going to distribute it will cancel this fraction this will have to go in parenthesis but it will also go to your 1 so we're going to get M times initial population over initial population - what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna cancel this piece of zero we're gonna get piece of zero minus M e to the negative M K T now we're gonna do one other thing that's going to help us to see this a little teeny bit better what we're gonna do is we're going to factor out a negative here remember how it's better than that you're way back here and it made things easier we're going to sort of undo that right now so we're gonna factor that negative in other words we're just going to reverse these and change that sign so factoring that that would be a piece of zero plus and minus P sub 0 e to the negative and AD thank you world's Inc let me see anything i okay great this this is your population so we just solve a pretty heavy-duty differential equation with a lot of stuff you go ok we got down to there that's that's that's fantastic what's going on what what the rule would happen here well we're gonna look at is the relationship between m and your initial population what I told you was that in the logistic equation you have this M that is like this flat complex obviously constant so it's this horizontal flat line and I told you that if your initial population is below it and we logically went through it but I'm showing you right now if your initial populations below it you will have an increase in your population until you reach it if you have and there's no populations that above it you're going to have a decrease in your population until you reach that M it is called a limiting population or a carrying capacity depend on whether you're increasing to it or decreasing to it let's see why that is it's a very important year and we'll look at these functions understand what's going on this is your population it is what's going to happen now you know that an exponential doesn't matter what they said that exponential it is positive do you see that like that's a positive number now how the size of it I only carried on it's a positive number here's what I want you to look at what happens if P sub 0 if P sub 0 is less than M if P sub 0 is less than panel if P sub 0 is less than n then this is a positive think this through and minus something less than it will be positive that's already a positive then this right there will be a positive number what that means if P sub 0 is less and then this is positive right so you take this initial population that's positive you add something to it this would be then your population then this thing where this whole thing would be less than I can't write it there I'd have to write up your soo this would be less then the population times M over the population itself with it so if this thing is positive then this is a bigger denominator than this then this fraction would be less than this fraction and this would be less than that itself which means your population would be less than that so if your population so and this equals M if your initial population is less than M sure your increasing but your bounded we've just proven that this would be bounded right here you said man if this is positive we know that's positive then this is a number that's bigger than P Sub Zero what that means is that this fraction is less than M times P Sub Zero P Sub Zero that's an upper bound if we simplify that that upper bound is just M it says that yes if your population is below M it's going to increase your saw that in our differential equation but it's in again increased until you're bounded by ya that's what's gonna happen now now what would happen another case what if your piece of zero the initial population is greater than animal if your initial population is greater than M if this numbers bigger than this number this is positive if this number is bigger than this number this is negative negative times a positive is a negative you take something positive - another number this would be smaller than P sub 0 therefore this fraction would be bigger than M over and times P sub 0 P sub 0 this is bigger than that look at look again positive number times negative number P some sort of beaker and that would be a negative times a positive to negative something positive - negative balcony that's going to be this is gonna be smaller than P sub 0 therefore this fraction is bigger than this fraction but this is and that gives you a bounty gives you lower down so what's happening here this man I know there's a lot of stuff I hope I haven't confused you but what's happening here is we know that two things that if this was the case our population was going to be increasing we saw that from regular put everything together for you I know if our initial population is less than M get this if our initial population is less than M this is smaller than this that's a positive number times a positive number positive then these are population is increasing okay so this case right here says population is increasing right it says that but it also says that our population has number bounded it says that you're increasing but you aren't only increasing until you get to M it can't give it any other way now what if the other case what if our initial population is greater than M this is bigger than that gives you a negative it says population is decreasing but we have another bound or decrease until we reach M so in either case we're a logistic equation we're going to reach M this carrying capacity or limiting population that's all they can they can happen now I'm gonna race this I'm going to talk about the next next situation but I'm not going to go through all of this work it's extremely similar you're just doing I'll show you in a minute but let me let me erase and stuff and we'll come back and talk about this alright so last little bit we're going to talk about the explosion and extinction we just learned about the logistic how we have this this limiting population or a carrying capacity because in relationship between an increasing population and a upper bound or a decreasing population and the lower bound it's going to happen that way up with analyzation equation now what if what if we have this other case where our birth rate is just directly proportional to the population so as population grows birth rate also grows without bound or dense population decreases birth rate also decreases without bound they're directly tied together you would go through exactly exactly the same idea all the way down and solve repeat just exactly showing like show you again same stuff but you end up with something like this I want to talk about why this population is going to explode or become extinct let's look at it what if your initial population is greater than n notice that's not negative so this is not this right here is still positive but it's it's growing pretty fast generally so let's look just here focus on this what if your initial population is greater than M as we go forward and go forward and go forward with our with this situation then if this is positive and this is getting bigger and bigger and bigger then the difference between your initial population and something that is positive look at this difference between an initial population something is positive this is going to get smaller under this would be positive positive and growing so we have seven ischl population that's getting then where the population shrinking smaller to only getting bigger the same thing smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller this is a constant so wait a minute you taking a constant as time goes on you're gonna get number over number that's shrinking this is going to go to infinity that's gonna go to infinity as T approaches infinity this that's it remember this is constant that's going to say this is positive this is going to get really really really big this is going to stay positive number - really big number as we get close to that population initial population this is going to get very very very very small dividing dividing concept by something very very very small you're going to get infinity it says that if you have a threshold of M and you start here with an initial population above it if the initial population is greater than M it is going to eventually explode there's no bound now the other other case if our initial population is less than n that's the same this would be yeah well this would be that would be something really large as T goes to infinity but this if P is less than M this becomes a negative a negative times a positive is a negative oh wait a minute you're taking a positive number and you're subtracting it you're adding you're adding to it so you're getting this this denominator that's growing bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger not getting closer to some initial initial about not getting closer to zero eating something it's getting bigger bigger closer to infinity take a constant and divide by something getting closer to infinity and you're going to go to zero that means that your initial population starts below your M you are going to get the population is decreasing and continues to decrease you're going to get extinction I really really hope this has been probably one of the most brutal lessons as far as theory that we've ever had so I understand that it's really heavy-duty I said a lot of things in this lesson and if you stuck with me good job you're going to be fine in the next few videos I'm gonna do a lot of examples to illustrate these concepts to show you from some very basic stuff some pretty complicated ideas what we've done in this video is I've shown you that the way that population growth relate I've shown you how population growth relates to birth rate and death rate I've shown you two very important cases where birth rate declines as population increases or birth rate increases as population declines I've also shown you how the relationship where birth rate is directly proportional to our population and we've seen that for the first example the the logistic equation that we are going to reach some sort of threshold what I want you to understand is that if birth rate is decreasing as populations increasing if it's inversely related that you are going to reach some sort of a bound the opposite if birth rate is directly related directly proportional to your population you're not you can have a threshold where if you're above it climb forever you're below you fall from voluntary zero in this case I hope that makes sense I was to you from the next video we're going to start just to to very basic examples on how to set problems up and then as we go forward we'll be talking about this and explore an extinction and an explosion and we'll also be exploring the logistic equation in several more videos so hope you enjoyed it that was crazy and we'll see you for another video you 

Transcript for: Basic Population Models in Differential Equations (Differential Equations 32)
hey welcome to another video so we've just explored what the logistic equation was we've explored what extinction and doomsday it looks like we've explored what bounded growth unbounded growth looks like for populations in other words we did a lot of theory and we were going to get to in the next videos how to work with that logistic equation and what sort of problems were modeled by it and how to work with explosion and extinction and populations but before we get there I thought it'd be really nice to give you some some introductory problems on how do you go about thinking of some of these setups because stuff like this isn't necessarily modeled exactly by the logistic equation it's this is not that that advanced but it's gonna step up to it so we have a real good feel with how population works hopefully now it's time to look at some real examples to get maybe an exploration on setting up some word problems again because sometimes it's really hard and so I'm going to show you how that works I'm going to do just two examples then next time we'll start looking at more of the logistic equation and then we'll talk about these these population explosions that we could have so and I'm gonna do that in the second example and covered they just think about what would happen a little bit later we'll see why why this is so let's look at one example let's say that there's a squirrel population and the the rate of change of the squirrel population is proportional to the square root of the population itself so what does that mean it means that the way that the population is changing is directly related to the square root of the population itself we're gonna look at how this affects the outcome of our problem remember that one thing we were very interested in the last video is is this population bounded or unbounded we'll start thinking about that as we go through at the time zero when you first start looking at there's a hundred squirrels and increase in its twenty squirrels a month that's a lot of squirrels how many squirrels were to be in one year so we're gonna diagnose exactly what this does so firstly the time rate of change of a squirrel population one the world is a time rate of change that is the rate of change of a population with respect to time so okay well if we make P the population than the rate of change of our population with respect to time let's see is proportional to when you hear that word proportional to that means that you have a constant being multiplied by some variable so if the rate of change of our population of the speck time is proportional to that's going to be constant times proportional to the square root not the square the square root of our population notice something this is a very stripped down problem there's nothing about how birth rates are changing there's nothing about how death rates are changing all this is giving you is some very basic information like okay the rate of change of population is proportional to the square root of our population but it's important it'll set these things up now the next statement says all right at time equals zero there are 100 squirrels and the population is increasing at a rate of 20 squirrels per month let's think about that for a second so the population at time 0 is 100 so the initial population is 100 squirrels but then this is really weird it's increasing at 20 squirrels per month well wait a minute we know that increase you think things that are increasing or decreasing things that are that they talk about a rate of change are talking about that derivative so when this is this is increasing at 20 squirrels per month well what's increasing with the population with respect to time whoa the bats talk about your derivative so this is saying the population is increasing with respect to time at a rate of 20 squirrels per month now this happens at a certain point so this is at time equals zero okay so writing we start we've got a hundred squirrels no problem I have under squirrels but we're also the population is also increasing at 20 schools per month so the first derivative population would speak to time the way that our population is changing with respect of time this is increasing at 20 so positive 20 schools per month when T equals zero here's what this means for us what this means is list some of these basic examples we can plug in everything and solve for that constant if you remember back to like the early days of Pompeii dealing populations the one of the big ideas was solving for that constant we did that with like half-life we did that with other sort of radioactive decay or population exclude increases exponentially is we wanted to find out what that constant of variation was so that that came out of words so one time all the way through we're either probably going all right the time rate of change is a derivative it's the way that the population is changing with respect to time we know that that's proportional to so a constant times the square root of population great let me give us some other information at time equals zero we have two things going on here we have that the initial population is 100 fantastic we also have that the change in population with respect to time is 20 that's at time zero what that means is that we can plug in the 20 and the 100 and we can solve for K right now so at time equals zero notice how this and this match up so they're both attainable zero we can say that at t equals zero our population with respect to time is changing at a rate of twenty squirrels per month and there are 100 squirrels present we're gonna get tables too so that's kind of nice because that's that lets us change this this original differential equation is something that doesn't have the arbitrary constant of that constant started concentration and one thing I want to mention right now this is the most basic example that I could find okay or come up with later on it's not gonna be that simple and so what we're gonna be doing is it's not always gonna give you this right there it's not always going to tell you the rate of change of your population straight the time right for that so when that happens you're gonna have that K in there for a while until we start integrating so now we go okay well okay our um our rate of change of population with respect to time is we have the constant of variation but now we know it's to square root of P and this looks a lot better because this is something that's a difference of equation that's separate one we can solve that man not too bad you remember that that we have a differential equation it's respect to time so we're gonna move our P's DP are constants DT in this case our independent variable is T so we'll have this one over the square root of P DP equals 2 DT and let's take an integral on both sides on the right hand side be something nice we just have 2t plus it's some sort of arbitrary constant on the left hand side we have this well you might want to think about this as P to the negative 1/2 so let's see with with that we're gonna add one that's P to the one-half over 2 exponent one-half that's 2 square root people I want to do this on your phone P to the positive one half over one-half so I'm gonna get to square root of P now what will we do after that well it's probably good idea to solve for P if you've done that many times before so if we go ahead and we we start solving for P let's see square root of P would be divided by 2 we get this T plus C over 2 not a problem maybe we square both sides we could do that but we do notice something that's up there right now we notice that there's a there's a constant there and if you remember before we get too heavy into this it might be a good idea to solve for C right now we did that even in the last video with a crazy hard stuff we solve for the constant that arbitrary constant first wait a minute help how much so sort of the art is very constant because this tells you the initial value you can always use that to solve your initial need for your arbitrary constant we did it basically in every population we probably have ever done so I might I might go back and say you know what I don't want to do that because if I solve this for P right now without getting that arbitrary constant I'm gonna to go backwards so let's take this and say the initial population population at time 0 is 100 let's plug that in let's say that our populations 100 when our time is 0 and we're going to get let's see 2 times 10 is 20 C equals 20 this is going to give us something a lot nicer because when we solve for P will be done we won't have to go back and solve for that C again so let's rewrite this to square equals now we know that's 2t plus that arbitrary constant no longer arbitrary this was an initial value probably told us the initial value is 100 and squirrels and now look how much nicer is when you start dividing by 2 we can get a a constant that we we know understand and don't have to solve for again so we're gonna get T I'm sorry we're gonna get t plus 10 and if we square both sides we'll get to the population with respect to time is given by this equation T plus 10 squared so let's see we've looked at you read it very carefully we wrote down exactly what a time of change means we wrote down what proportional means new or down with the square root of P means we've got an initial value to problem we wrote down that increasing is is relating to that rate of change it's saying what the rate of change is we were able to solve for that constant of variation we did our integration we were able to solve for the function P our population P we all to give it an arbitrary concept by using the exact same initial value that P of 0 equals 100 and now we have a formula for that that population of squirrels so now we can answer this last question and the way we do this is saying okay well how many are there in one year it's almost always this case where they're going to give you a time you find the population or they give you a population you have to find the time it takes to get there so in this case it says I'm giving you one year how many squirrels that they're gonna be so the population of one year oh wait a minute this is 20 per month so 20 20 per month but I'm giving you I'm giving you 1 year is this going to be accurate if I put in a why is that gonna be accurate is the time unit the same the answer is no it's not be very careful if you're getting the wrong answer in the back of the book can you going back plug it in one man I followed you Leonard yeah well it might be the plug it in different units of time you see if our time rate of change is based on months and they're giving you years we have to realize that one year is 12 months so I'm not gonna be plugging in one I'm gonna be plugging in 12 that's gonna give us something quite different so when we look at it ago right let's see that would be the population after one year or 12 months he's 22 squared looks like I got 484 schools so when we look at it start thinking what would happen if our time did increase a lot and we found out how many schools there are in man 20 years or something is there anything here that's going to slow it down is there anything here that says after certain amount of time or based on the population we're going to be reaching a plateau or or are we going off the scales or are we dropping down to zero and if we look at this basically amount of water population the initial population is check it out I'm not aware of initial population is if it's positive in any way shape or form then this is going to be a positive number this is gonna be a positive number and this is gonna be a positive number so we would have some sort of positive constant we'd solvent pee this would be some sort of time plus a positive constant squared well if this goes further and further and further if this gets increasing to infinity this is going off the charts this would be a population explosion so there's nothing that's that's limiting this we don't even have really a threshold the threshold would be like zero the only way that you would go to extinction is if you didn't start with anything here so if you started with a zero population then you have a constant would be zero but there'd be nothing to start okay so if there's no way that we could ever increase that it won't even make sense but if we start with any population all and we say this is what's happening here just arbitrary increasing at 20 22 Scrolls per month then we're gonna be increasing forever there's nothing that's going to really make this not go to infinity its increasing without bound so let's look at the next example all right so last example for this video just again to get a few but just understanding how to set these problems up even let's talk about rabbits no rabbits do so the time rate of change of a rabbit populations portion of the square of Pico what's what's that mean again the time rate of change is this rate of the population with respect to time so we're talking about a derivative here at time equals zero so whenever this this was studied there is 12 rabbits and then there was 24 rabbits and 10 years after that when will there be 48 rabbits and then we're going to talk about like what I want you to get in the last video in this video is what's going to happen in the future is this going to climb without bound what's good what's gonna happen after that ok well let's let's talk about it so let's try to diagnose every bit about it we'll put it together do a our integration will learn that we can't solve for that cave of the bat let's see why that is so the time rate of change over rabbit population is proportional to square of P what that means is that the way that the population is with respect to time is proportional that's a K times the square of P so now the square root we're gonna have K times P squared let's see how this really affects an integration compare the last problem also look for this other stuff is there an initial value at time equals 0 are there an initial number of rabbits yeah 12 so when there's the start of this problem there are 12 rabbits altogether let's look for this isn't telling you how the population is increasing at that time no it's not is it giving you an another another value so we basically need two of these things one to solve our arbitrary constant and when to solve for R K R our variation coefficient so it says it says that there's there's 12 at the time equals 0 it's not a there's 24 10 years after that oh so it's given us another value so we're looking at this we're trying to identify what they're giving you they're giving you a derivative of population for the sake of time they're giving you that it's proportional that's a K times they're giving you that it's the square of P okay that's P squared they're giving you an initial population of 12 they're giving you a population some time period after that starting to sound very familiar we've done already so after 10 years the population has doubled let's go ahead and since we can't solve for that K right now since we don't know that that's the problem in the previous example we knew what the rate of change was we don't have that now we're going to find it by doing a derivative let's write our integration doing our separable variables here your integration and then let the find out a little bit later so let's start that let's say hey that's a that's a differential equation it is separable it's group our peas DP are constants DT so if we divide everything by P squared DP leave our constants DT and when we integrate let's see what we have we have a integral of P to the negative 2 that's let's add 1 it's negative 1 divided by the new one it's negative 1 that's negative 1 over P equals K T plus some sort of arbitrary constant looks kind of nasty let's up let's fix this a little bit let's go ahead and let's multiply everything by negative so 1 over P equals negative KT minus C do you really want to deal with that - I don't really want to deal with that - either also one other thing that we could do this right now we could wait a little bit we could solve for that constant couldn't we so typically what you've seen me do is before we start doing things like man let's let's multiply both sides by P divided by this or just reciprocate and give this is 1 over arbitrary constant - Katie I'm saying that this could be written as positive C just just Rhea all this C sub one and then that would be a positive C you could do that and you can solve for C but do you see how much time did you see how much time you'd be wasting right now if you're gonna solve for the arbitrary constant right now you're gonna have to undo basically all that work you did so I'm showing you this to say when you do your integral and we've seen this from one of the first sections we did there's a long time to feel like 30 videos ago but one of the first stages we did as soon as you do your integral for integration by parts if you have an initial value it will solve for your arbitrary constant and once all for Kate but it will solve for your C so here's the process go and really read your problem very carefully get your your difference equation write down every piece of information that you know see if you can solve for that K if you're given the rate of change you can if you're not then the process is do your integration to solve your differential equation and soon as as soon as you get this arbitrary constant soon as you do your integration and you get the arbitrary constant its easiest to solve for that now and it's always solvable by your initial value so this guy then after we solve for our constant we can use this second piece of information to solve for your constant variation so again do the integration solve for y or your arbitrary constant your C by using your initial value problem and then solve for your K by using the other piece though what happens later we'll solve that carefully so let's do that let's say hey you know what when our time was zero we had 12 bunnies so negative 1 over 12 equals this whole thing zero that's why we that's why we use the initial value to solve for C because the time deserves itself out equals C so our C is negative 1/12 let's rewrite that so plus negative 12 minus 1/12 now what what now well we just mentioned that if we use our initial value to solve for our scene we can use the next piece of information of software ok so we're gonna do that we're gonna say that now that we know that after 20 years there were 24 bucks says we can plug in 24 for P when we plug in 10 for T and after having solved for that C it leaves us just one more variable so negative 1 over 24 equals K times 10 or 10 K minus 1 12 let's go ahead in that let's add 1 12 to both sides so if we add 1 12 let's see that would be 2 twenty-fourths we're going to get 1 over 24 equals 10 K and if we divide both sides by 10 we're going to get K equals 1 over 2 3 might not look that great but at least we don't have to constants any longer we don't have an arbitrary constant we know this thing 1:12 we don't have our zucchini where we know it's 1 over 240 so what we're gonna do is after we've done an integration we solve for our arbitrary constant no longer arbitrary use initial value for that we solve for a constant variation we now know what that constant is we're going to rewrite this right now so we found C we rewrote it we found Kate we're going to rewrite it again now before we go any further we're about to reciprocate this you can't reciprocate two fractions you can't do that when they're being subtracted or when they're being added so we're gonna take the time we're gonna make a common denominator we're gonna make this one fraction so let's see negative 1 of the P and then the right hand side this right here let's see 1 over 12 and I'm trying to get to 14 to be multiplied by one so 20 over to 14 so t minus 20 over 240-volt know we're due now let's change that so I don't like that let's multiply both sides by a negative so negative 1 or divided by native doesn't remember so 1 over P is going to give us if we multiply both sides by negative let it just affect the numerator or denominator but not both so on the numerator we get positive one repeat here but we get negative T plus 20 or 20 minus T we're just reversing that changing the signs over 240 and now we can reciprocate both sides so our population with respect to time and that time is in year so we're having them back go ahead time is in years is 240 over 20 my esteem and now I ask the question says alright hey can we answer this now I told you last time that when you get down to your population so solving your differential equation you got your population model and it's going to ask you one or two things usually it's gonna say well how much of the what quantity what's your population after certain time or how long does it take to get to a certain population and that's what this one says when will there be 48 bunnies well a wind is what's the time the 48 bunnies is what's your population so if there's 48 buddies how long did it take to get there it's a matter of solving for T now so you've multiplied both sides by that 20 minus T and divided by 48 or if you remember this is a that can be used a portion you can cross multiply no problem me personally I like doing that whole switcheroo thing like if you were to multiply by 20 minus T and divide by 48 you'd get 20 minus T equals 240 over 48 and then if we subtract 20 so 20 minus 28 that's when we subtract that 20 we're going to have 15 but negative 15 oh good thing we divide by negative so T equals 15 now we think about the units this was 15 years everything was in terms of years for us which was nice so in this case there's some slow producing bunnies but if this is true for this population maybe there's a heavy predation maybe it's not growing that rapidly what's gonna happen here is that this population is going to grow and grow and grow and to the point where we have 48 rabbits in 15 years now this is what I want you to get out of this too what's gonna happen at first I hope that explains 1/3 of the to understand how to set these word problems out but the idea the last example was what are we getting out after this what is this population going to do and I want you to look at the time look at that right here what happens as we get closer and closer to 20 years so as we get closer and closer to 20 years well let's see that denominator gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller doesn't it so 20 minus minus 15 would give us a 5 after 48 buddies how about 20 minus 19 what happens in 19 years well in 19 years we got 240 divided by 1 that's 240 bunnies so in four more years this is going to really start that phony it's gonna start exploding what about in like nineteen point nine years nineteen one that's gonna see 20 minus nineteen point nine is point one 240 divided by 0.1 is two thousand four hundred bunnies so it took a long time to get there this is a very slow growth at the beginning man I don't know anything that starts up growing really slow and then it just starts starts exploding like that I don't have anything looks like that that's because that's exactly what this is it's crazy fast growth is what this is this is doing for us so somehow we are going to be starting off super slow but at some point we're going to be exploding as this gets really close to 20 years this population starts really getting crazy crazy big to the point where it's it's reaching infinity we don't even we can't even go anywhere you can't you can't actually get to 20 years it's undefined it's going so fast as I'm to find that population is of doom State population what that means is that you reach such a such an expansive population there's not even room for it anymore like it's it's infinity this is this approaches twenty years this is going to approach infinity do you see it are you seeing that if this approaches twenty years so this approaches twenty this is getting really close to zero to forty divided by something really close to zero is going to positive infinity from the left-hand side it's gonna go to positive infinity that's a doomsday situation where this population is getting so big there's not even room for there's definitely not food for it so I hope that makes sense I hope that you're I'm taking you to think about what's going on just answering the question they've answer the questions 15 years but what's happening after that's important we've talked about the logistic equation we've talked about that the extinction versus explosion that's an explosion idea but now we're we're just getting some basic concepts I'm trying to mirror what we've already learned in the last video so that later on when we get to those examples you're much much better suited to deal with it so I hope this makes sense I hope now yeah a great way to start setting up some word problems and our understanding what can happen in these explosion ideas right now so we'll talk about more of this next time we'll get heavy into it with a logistic equation in a little while okay I hope you enjoyed it I'll see you the next video you 

Transcript for: Birth Rates and Death Rates in Differential Equations (Differential Equations 33)
hey and welcome to another video I hope you don't well I'll be ready to get started in some other applications of differential equations towards populations so if you remember from two videos ago I went through and I gave you basically a general explanation all the theory behind population modeling as it relates to birth rates and death rates and we did the whole thing we talked about explosion we talked about extinction we talked about the logistic equation and then I gave you a video with just a couple examples to illustrate just how to set up some basic problems of differential equations that involve populations now in this video we're working our way back to the logistic equation and explosion extinction so the way that this this is structured is we did all the theory and then we do some basic examples now we're going to go a little bit more in depth I'm going to show you how birth rates and death rates play into differential equations because we haven't really done that yet we did the theory behind it but what we haven't done as any hardcore examples about it so we're going to talk about that right now I'm going to give you three examples on how to set up a differential equation when you are given birth rates and death rates because honestly that's the hardest part it's just saying these things up so I'll walk you through what to be looking for how to use your initial conditions how to use a some sort of a change in a population to get another said to solve for your C and to solve for your K or your two concepts that you're gonna have I'm also going to talk about how to how to distinguish between directly proportional and inversely proportional and what that means as far as a fraction or a product is concerned when you're going through birth rates and death rates then I'm gonna go through and just we're gonna solve the differential equation the solving parts are not going to be that bad in the next video we're going to be talking more specifically about the logistic equation and some of these the models involving that and so we'll actually have a video before that we're we're gonna refresh what exactly partial fractions are because when we get to some of these harder examples they involve a lot of partial fractions so next video is going to be about these partial fractions just exploring how that relates to differential equations because frankly we forget this stuff so this is what this video is about like really just talking about birth rates and death rates and how they affect our population model with difference of equations so if you remember from two videos ago we talked about how logically and mathematically how the population changes with respect to time shouldn't be this difference in birth rates and death rates as proportional to a population that's what this means remember beta was our birth rate per population unit per unit of time so like five births per thousand people per year or whatever that is and death rates are the same so we're gonna look at that but what I want you to remember is that when you're going through these if it's not just a straight up the way the population changes is proportional to the population itself if they're giving you birth rates and death rates we always really want to start here so if they're saying the birth rate is this the death rate is this whatever that is even if it's constant you can come back and plug this in so we know the way population changes with respect to time is birth rate minus death rate times population that quantity times population that really should make sense the difference between birth rates and death rates if it's portion of the population shows how the population is changing over time so we're always going to try to come back to here and say what's our birth rate what's our death rate plug it in and we have a usually a fairly basic differential equation that we can solve pretty easily so we're gonna just do three examples I'll model how to do this I'll model exactly what I'm thinking about when I'm going through it and hopefully we'll help you out with some of your your examples that you have to do so a certain population stop sperm in reproducing but it's death rate remains inversely proportional to the square root of the population already that's a lot of words there were 900 whatever these things are at the start and of our time period and 441 after six weeks when will there be none no is there going to be none at some point well it should make sense that if something stops reproducing and we're assuming remember under this if it's from two videos ago we're assuming there's no hardcourt immigration or exodus a--'s so nothing's coming into the population that isn't being born there and nothing's leaving the population isn't dying there so think about like a body of water where they're not stalking it they're not pulling out from it it's just the fish that are reproducing or frogs or everyone's so the population stops reproducing all right but if death rate remains inversely proportional to the square root of the population what we want to be looking for because you know that this is our model for all of our population growth sorry rates of change of population with respect to time involving birth rates and death rates we want to look for birth rate and our death rate first and so we're going through this cone okay certain population stops reproducing what's that telling you well if it stops reproducing its birth rate is zero well that's that's nice we can already put a zero right there we're gonna write this stuff down where say all right first birth rate is zero but our death rate remains inversely proportional to the square root of the population now how would you how would you know that where's that coming from they would have done some sort of a modeling discovering what the deaths of these this specie was over amount of times okay it's really close to inversely proportional to the square root of ovulation so that will be given to you don't to come up with that but it is something that we can model right now so we figured out our birth rate or birth rate is zero it's stopped reproducing our death rate our Delta is let's see inversely proportional to the square root of the population and I want to talk about inversely versus just straight a proportional if something's proportional or directly proportional it means that you have a product of some sort of variation constant constant variation times whatever variable you have so if we would have read proportional to or directly proportional to that would be a K times something when we read inversely proportional that's going to be a division concept so when we see inversely proportional the first thing I want you think of is direct proportional or just proportional means K times and inverse means K / okay / so what this is is as the population is growing the death rate is declining that's a division concept can you see it that we have a constant divided by some number that's growing if K is a constant of variation it's not changing and this number gets bigger and bigger and bigger our death we should decline decline decline as the proportion at the if the death rate remains inversely proportional to the square root of population well that means that as the population gets bigger our death rates should go down and that's what this is saying to us so again proportional K times inversely proportional K divided by so we know that death rate is K divided by the square root of the population I'm going to tell you it's really easy to do things like this oh yeah the square root obviously it's not a square root but it's really common so make sure that we're reading this take some time and really think about it go back because if you don't have this right the rest of your work is irrelevant so your birth rate zero stop reproducing death rate inversely proportional okay K divided by K what Oh square root of the population so we're gonna say no no no not P squared square root of the population and that right there is going to set up a very nice differential equation for us that's pretty much all you need to get started so we have redness really clearly the first couple sentences are typically going to fill that out for you if you're given birth rates and death rates you go that's how it should look birth rate is ever death rate is whatever we know that proportional is K times in versus K divided by very careful how you're setting that up and then we're gonna substitute now what about the rest of the stuff the rest of the stuff the initial condition and then this amount after certain amount of time the initial condition is going to so make a note of this the initial condition is going to solve for your see your arbitrary constant your see that you get upon integrating the next piece that how much you have after certain amount of time that will solve for your K so putting this whole thing together your population change with respect to time dealing with birth rates and death rates will be modeled on that find your birth rate and your death rate in terms of P or a constant that's fine if it says held constant rate just put a K it's okay plug it in solve your differential equation and then as soon as you integrate as soon as you can agree then use your initial condition to solve for C and then use your later Candace so this population change of the certain mount of time to solve your K and then you can answer any question that you want so we're gonna try that right now so we've looked at we said that's it okay we got our birth rate we've got our death rate per unit of population for union time and now that lets us substitute into here so I'm gonna have this population change with respect to time is the birth rate minus the death rate times the population we just plug this in zero K over square root P times P and we can simplify this this would be negative K square root of P or if you want to want to write it better 0 minus this of course we have a negative K T to the one half would be fine as well that's totally fine it really doesn't matter now what do you see well we see the reason why we practiced about 30 videos of just doing differential equations because this is going to be something that falls into one of those categories this is a separable differential equation so we are gonna group our peas DP on one side and are constants D whatever that other independent variable is in this case T on the other side so k is a constant we're gonna leave negative K where it is that's a constant we said that's a constant of variation and it's going to be found by using our population is varying so let's move our peas DP that'll be P to the negative 1/2 we divide both sides by this P to the one-half we would say that population can't be 0 obviously a population mu 0 that's a really important problem to get it just a singular solution there so wouldn't be very very good and then on the right hand side we'd have our K DT I hope that makes sense I'm going to go fairly quickly through some of these basic integrals that are in solving differential equations techniques like separable equations we've done it just a heck of a lot of times so get your peas DPH your constants DT let's integrate both sides and notice that on the left hand side I'm adding 1/2 dividing by 1/2 that's going to be 2 square root P equals negative KT plus your arbitrary constant now you're kind of want to solve for P and I know that you want to do that right now but I'm going to tell you that when you start solving for P it's a whole lot harder to find your C and your K in general as you keep moving forward so as soon as you can you want to solve for the constant and your K so both of these constants why we couldn't do it here because I think I gave you an example a long time ago a long time ago like last video where you could because they gave you the rate at which the population is changing you're not generally going to be given that so we don't know what that rate is what we do know is we know that our initial population was 900 at time zero and we know that there were 441 after six weeks so that's something that we really should write down and I did all this work first but you you might want to consider write it up here first so on hindsight I would say find your birth rate find your death rate find an initial condition so what happens at time zero when we started this situation this observation there was 900 units of whatever than this this species was and after six weeks never caught on in 41 that's something we might want to write down first now I didn't just to show you that this cannot be used here do not start plugging this junk in please wait until you integrate and get right here so again all the way through that's gonna be your population change with respect to time if you're dealing with birth rates and death rates so when we go through this we read it very carefully find your birth rate and find your death rate then write down your initial condition and how much your population is after cert amount of time that's how the population has buried keep that in mind we use our knowledge of differential equations to plug this in and simplify and solve the differential equation and then right here as soon as you integrate give it a try try solving for your C and then solve for years okay in that order the reason why it's got to be in that order is because your initial condition is you can plug in zero forty and kill off that K which you don't know if you try to solve for K first you'd have too many variables that wouldn't really work that well so plug in your initial condition time of zero and a population and it's going to solve for C very nicely then plug that in turn right back around and use that how your population has buried two so for your constant of variation so let's try it right now so we've done our integration we go came right here don't sell for P that doesn't do everything to solve for C if you did that let's plug in P is zero equals 900 so P of 0 equals nine and I would see mm that means that this is going to change to two times the square root of nine hundred so when T is zero we had nine hundred units of population we don't know what the K is but that's fine that's why we're using the initial condition first at time of zero because that's going to zero times any constant give you zero let's see and if we do all the work on two times 30 is 60 so C is 60 take that constant and use that right now to rewrite this so we know that 2 square root P equals negative KT plus 60 so all we've done is we've done our difference the quiz all tour difference equation and then solve our arbitrary constant like we've done many many many many times with initial conditions that's what your initial condition does it solves for your artery constant then we're gonna turn right back around as soon as we can and solve for that K so we need to find that out as well the constant of variation is typically found how your population is varying after certain amount of time so once we've found our C first zero because it kills off that K I'm going to say all right well at times 6 and we're going to keep in the back of our mind that this means six weeks eight times six we had 441 years of population okay all right so let's see we had 441 units of population after six weeks and because we sold first that's not 60 because we saw for our C we're now it will solve for that K so doing just a little bit of math square root of 441 is 21 I believe so 2 times 21 equals well that's negative 6k plus 60 and that's really easy for us to solve that says let's just multiply it's gonna be 42 we subtract 60 from both sides we get that 18 but it's negative and then k equals positive 3 so k equals positive 3 that means that our debt let's see let's think about that so our death rate was K divided by the square root of P so that means as the populations growing that death rate is declining but it's still positive things are still dying now now we can plug that in and solve for P so we've done everything we found an arbitrary constant it was 60 we found that a constant variation was 3 we should have an idea but what that means and now when we substitute that in we know that 2 square root P equals negative 3t well it's 60 no question question do you understand how the birth rate and death rate was found you understand how the initial condition salts with arbitrary constant should know and how the how the the population varies how we find the constant variation once you've done that these are application problems so these are looking for an answer they're looking for an answer to some question when will the with the wait will there be nine in other words when that's time will the population be zero she can't make sense to you that if the birthrate is zero and the death rate is positive which we see that it is that K is positive and the population is positive so your death rate is positive if your birthrate zero and things are still dying you're eventually going to have nothing so if that birthrate doesn't change and the death rate is held to be what this is your population is going to die out there will be none so when is that gonna happen when's the population zero it's very tempting to solve this for P I know it's really it's really tempting to be like okay I got invited by to square both sides why why do that if we're trying to find out when that's a time now unless it says specifically solved for the population model well you could do that you could divide everything by to square both sides and you find the population based on time but if we are asking this question and other good like this so dividing by two negative three times T plus 30 and then square both sides and you could get the population but model based on time that's that's totally fine if they actually a different question like what's the population after nine weeks or whatever weeks they want good that's that's totally fine but if they're asking when is the population going to be zero well that's a trying to solve for T so we want to solve for T does it benefit us to solve for B not really because we'd have to undo all of that work anyhow so if you want to find out T when the population equals zero that's what we're asking right when does the population zero it's a lot easier to plug in zero here and solve for T then plug in zero here and solve for T because you have to do all the work you did in solvent repeating so I'm gonna do that right here and say all right well that means that if our population is zero supposed to be a zero then we're gonna have negative 3t plus 60 equals zero adding 3 to both sides and / 3 3 20 what's that Dean that means then you think back to what this says with the variation told us here this population vary and so that we went from 900 to 441 in six weeks so that a unit of time for T is given to us in that problem somewhere so that says that according to this modelling the way that this population is changing is that there's going to be none left unless something changes there's going to be none left of 20 weeks I'm trying to make this as streamlined as possible so you understand exactly what you're looking for because word problems we all know this where problems can be a real bear and then mostly it's the setup so when you're dealing with population models I did all the theory two videos ago I did some very basic ones last video where we said okay population the rate of change of population spec time is just proportional to the population somehow now when we start dealing with death rates and birth rates we're going back to a previous video saying all of them should be able to be modeled like this so find your birth rate find your death rate in terms of P or constants then you have a differential equation it's typically okay to solve you solve that differential equation right away use your initial condition to solve for C and if you can use your how the population is buried to solve your constant variation right after that in that work and then we can answer virtually any question they ask us we can solve a population model we can solve for when the population is a certain amount if it's sulfur what population is after certain amount of time hope that makes sense so I'm going to come back to more examples I would say there any more difficult but we're gonna have a different birth rate than zero and see how that works we'll talk about how if you have a birth rate and a death rate that is based on a constant of variation they're not the same constant variation explore that in just a minute let's try another one so we have a certain population and it has a birth rate and a death rate that are both University proportional to population at the beginning when we first started the observation there was 100 units of whatever this specie is bunnies or something and then 169 after six months so it's growing obviously the birth rate should be pacing the death rate how many within one year all right well what do we know we know that because we're given birth rates and death rates the way the population is changing with respect to time the rate of change of population with respect to time should be based on a difference between birth rate and death rate times the population so we discovered that two videos ago now we're just exploring that so let's first look for how about this on purpose because this is the Mobley's kind of lobby's problems let's look for the birth rate so since the birth rate and the death rate are both inversely proportional to the populations and remember what inversely means inversely means K divided by so a constant variation divided by so the birth rate is inversely that's K divided by proportional to the population oh you know what I meant to write a squared popper square root inversely proportional to square root of population then the reason why I wanted that is so I want to I want you to consider the difference we know this problem the last problem less problem birth rate was a constant zero and death rate was proportional to the square root of population now I want to consider what happens if both of these are proportional to the square inversely proportional to the square root of population so last time it was just the death rate that was inversely proportional to the square of population this time it's both birth rate and death rate that are inversely proportional to the square root of the population so sorry about that so the birth rate is inversely proportional that's K divided by the square root of the population all right well that's the square root of P well they're definitely the death rates the same the death rate is inversely proportional K divided by to the square root of the population now if we try to put this in here we know that the way the population changes the specter time is birth rate minus death rate okay we got that we read through this we know that the birth rate and the death rate are both inversely proportional that's K divided by 2 the square root of the population that's divided by the square root of P and we can substitute this in here that would be K over square root P for the birth rate minus K over square root P for the death rate times P go that's 0 and you would be right if they were the same constant of variation go how can they be different well your birth rates and death rates aren't always the same and in fact if our population is growing look at that we had a hundred then we had 169 your birth rate is outstripping your death rate so these case can't be the same otherwise the population wouldn't change we just get 0 and the rate of change your population to be 0 and after 6 months you'd have a hundred after a billion years you have a hundred in one change and so our birth rate and death rates can't be the same as these KS are different so to show that go you know what mrs. K sub 1 this is case of two and that was showing that your birth rates and your death rates don't have to be the same in fact they can't be if our populations so we've gone through we've understood what our birth rates and death rates are we were very careful writing those we've made our substitution we now have a differential equation that we're going to work with in just a minute but before we go any further we're not going to use this information yet but we're gonna write down right now we're gonna write down the initial condition so there were a hundred at time zero and after six months so how our population is buried after six months there were 169 of this particular species we want to write all that down so that we're completely done with this probably should do our math okay so we look at their birth rate death rate gotta substitute it now let's solve our difference in equation before we go any further though write down our initial condition and how our population is very depper certain amount of time we're gonna use this as soon as possible right after we solve our differential equation so what world can we do well because both our birth rates and death rates are based on being inversely proportional to the square root of that population it's given us a common denominator we can combine this so case of 1 minus case of 2 all over square root of population times the population and you can see right now we're gonna do basically the same thing we're gonna simplify this square root population one other thing you're gonna see a lot of is it true that a constant minus a constant gives you a constant is that true yeah and so a lot of times what we're gonna do is we're going to take this different constants of variation and say you know since we're based on the same inversely proportional to the square root of population idea we can define a different K to stand for that constant and that makes our math a little bit more concise it's not going to affect your problem at all while that's gonna do is make it a little bit nicer when you start plugging in numbers your initial condition and then your constant variation information it's going to make it a little more succinct and so let's go ahead and make the same difference in equation with respect to time and we'll have K square root P just like we had before but notice the negative right there you could also could make this just like before this like less example K T times P to the one-half power and now we have something that's separable you really should try this from here on out so get your P's DP your constants DT integrate plug in your initial condition right after you do that to solve your C then plug in your varying puddler the information on how your population is varying to solve for your constant of variation right after that and then we'll see what we'll see what we have after that so peas DP K constant D team if we integrate we get exactly the same thing we did before there's 2 square root P and then on the right hand side let's see we get this KT plus C I want to talk about something real quick before we get I told you that right now we're gonna do it in just a minute I'm just gonna give you a little aside here we're gonna plug in our initial condition or software see there even plug in our varying how our populations vary in software RK but once in a while you're gonna be asked to show something so if you're ever asked to show with the population model is based on an initial condition where the initial condition is changeable you what do you mean what if I didn't tell you there was a hundred items what if I wanted to move this model to different populations or the same species so in other words yeah this population is started with 100 what Evers but what if I wanted to model this on a different population where we knew the same dynamics and that same dynamics were going to happen but that initial condition was like a thousand or 1500 or two and but and we knew the same things was going to happen well then oftentimes what we do as we say if I melt if I don't know an actual initial starting population so the initial population if I don't know that I call it P Sub Zero and then your constant will be based on that piece of zero and so how we would show this you can say all right I plug in 0 for T I plug in P Sub Zero for P so there'd be 2 square root of P sub 0 equals zero plus C and then we can have something that's at least at least we have this arbitrary constant we can write up there so c1 equals 2 squared P Sub Zero we go right if I want to solve this now 2 square root P would equal K times T plus 2 square root of 0 we can solve for that arbitrary constant in terms of an initial population whatever that population happens to be then what we can do after that well we can't really solve for K can't wait because in order to solve for K we need to know an initial population and so what you could do here is just say well if I wanted if I wanted to solve for the population model I divide everything by 2 and square both sides and we can find a model for the population but notice you would need to know some more information before you go any further so we said can you find out a population model yes but to get more specific you need to know about a specific population you would need to know the initial population and you could just strain a plug in it right there that is the initial population so if we move to a different area want to apply this model to a different population we need to know where we start and then we'd also need to know how the population is varying after certain amount of time so initial population we go here what is solve for that k you need to know how the population is varying a little bit after that then we could get more specific but at least we can find a population model right now so could you plug in 100 right here yes could you plug in 640 and then population of 169 and solve for K after you've done that of course it's a lot harder to do from there but if we were going to apply this model to some of the population that's nice to have because we can now plug in different specific starting and changing points in that population and get a working model format I hope that makes sense to you that we can still solve this for P we just have a couple of arbitrary non-arbitrary we have a couple constants in there that would be based on whatever population we're dealing with so can you still solve for P yes and get a model of course this based on initial population uh-huh and somehow it constant variation yeah you can totally do that what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna race this I'm gonna come back up here and then we're going to do what this particular problem is calling for we want to find out whatever C is based on this initial condition whatever our K is based on how our population is varying after 6 months so we're going to do an answer this particular collection so right here we'd say Y solve for P if we're dealing with this one population we would say that the population is 100 at a time of 0 and we would get to C is 20 we now know C and because we're solving for K and we were able to plug in 6 for time and 169 for population based on how that's varying let's see 2 times 13 that's 26 6 equals 6 K okay is a very convenient one and now we're looked like that right back in know what I said here that we really are playing it here we found that so one time all the way through we look for birth rate death rate you know too bad that's how our model should be you plug it in we do our substitution we get this difference in equation we know that we have a constant variation that we can combine a couple constants if possible it's not a problem we solve our difference of equation if we need to solve for P I showed you how to do that with an initial population if we don't if we're answering specific questions on a specific population like we are here find your C first within an actual condition find your case second with how the population is varying and then we have this model to square root of the population equals time plus 20 where time is in months and now we answer the question we're gonna say we're gonna see whether it's gonna benefit us to solve for P or not so how many is there going to be in one year how many how many is a population after certain amount of time so would it benefit as a so to solve for P yeah yeah would because we're trying to solve the population anyhow so let's divide everything by 2 and then square both sides so divided by 2 we get T over 2 plus 10 square both sides of 80 over 2 plus 10 quantity squared this is the population based on a given time now we're gonna find the time after 1 so we plug in 1 right it's real careful if this isn't 6 months we're gonna plug in 12 because 12 months is 1 year so the population after 12 months is 12 divided by 2 plus 10 and they squared our population after 12 months 16 so 256 so 256 whatever this species is man I hope that makes sense I hope you've seen the interplay between birth rates and death rates that if you have two different if you have two concentration they are different otherwise your population won't change it generally won't change if your based on the same very same way or varying with the population so could they be different proportionalities yeah they can and would changing those constants are the same but you can't assume that they are the same oh that makes sense you don't just assume there's the same constant variation in this case your population wouldn't change at all and we know that it's growing so that can't that can't work so I hope it makes sense that the integration should be very nice for us right now the separable differential equation should be really really nice and then knowing when to plug in for your constant C and when to plug in for your constant K is crucial so we got one more we're almost done we'll be right back last one for the video so we're dealing with another population I know I've had the same thing three times we're dealing with this a slightly different way I want to show you in this example but because we have proportional where I can have a K divided by K times we'll talk about a doomsday versus extinction here so I want to show you how the K being positive will lead to a doomsday or to a population explosions what we call that or if our K would be negative we deal with an extinction scenario so I'll show you where that comes from so let's explore this let's pay attention to that that last a little bit I'm going to solve for P I'm going to show you the model here the population model based on K and the initial population and then we'll deal with this specific example so certain population has birth rate and death rate that are both proportional to population there are six when we initially saw and nine out of ten months when will the population explosion happen how do I know there's going to be a population explosion well proportional is climbing and climbing and climbing but if our population has grown after an initial condition condition that means our birthrate is outstripping our death rate and it's going to explode at some point based on that portion ality so we're going to see that at play right now so we've read through we're going to go ahead we're going to say all right hey this is dealing birth rates and death rates and a changing population let's try to model with this our birth rate says proportional to population when you proportionately is directly proportional or varies directly means K times so our birth rate is K times population and so is our death rate it says they're both proportional to the population so we're gonna call one case of 1 in 1 case of tooth and now we're ready to go ahead and find our initial condition and how our population is changing after certain amount of time so have we start there was 9 at the initial opposite observations so at times ooh sorry 6 there is 6 whatever these are at the initial observation after 10 months or months here there were 9 certainly doesn't think it seemed like there's gonna be a population explosion right you're like after 10 months alone three of them but it will happen eventually now that we've found our birth rate and our death rate in terms of our population now that we have our initial condition and how our population is varying after a certain amount of time let's substitute this and find a differential equation that models it so we know that our birth rate K sub 1 times population - our death rate case of 2 times population times population might be a real good idea to factor out that P sort of what we did before and we simply simplify it with the P so let's do that let's we factor the P we're going to get it the case of 1 minus K sub 2 times P squared because I'm cancelled get K squared now let's redefine it like we did before in the last example and say that instead of case of 1 minus case of 2 let's call this K and I want to make an important point here based on what those k's are determines whether you are going to have an explosion or an extinction in this particular case if that K is positive you're going to grow and the change in population will be positive and grow grow grow grow grow this can be negative grow without bound it will not be a ballot here you will get a population explosion they call that a doomsday because at some point population is just so massively large there's not enough space or food or whatever for this particular species if that K is negative then this would decline and always decline decline decline decline decline it wouldn't go to zero that would be an extinction event and so we'll see that right now so so wait a minute wait how would the kv+ that K would be positive because these are the same population at the same time that K would be positive if the birth rate is greater than the death rate that's the only way they could happen so the only way that birth rate is different from death right here is if the case are different so the K will be positive if birth rate is greater than death rate K will be negative if birth rate is less than death rate it's only way that's going to happen we're gonna consider both of those in just a minute so hang on to that so we're gonna call this K we're gonna solve our differences equation we're gonna prove our peas DP are constants DT and we're going to integrate so on the left-hand side we're going to add 1 divided by negative 1 so negative 1 over P on the right hand side we're gonna be have a KT plus C again and I'm going to do two things I will be coming back to this and using it but because I want us to explore extinction vs. explosion so explosion versus extinction I want to solve this for P the way it is so I'm going to do a little aside right here we're going to talk all the way through that then we're going to see this actually happen with this information so if we solve that for P the first thing I might want to do if I'm gonna solve that for P man I might just I might just solve for the constant right now this is this this arbitrary constant by saying that at Oh times zero I'm going to have an initial population so you'll notice I do this a lot right I solve for that arbitrary constant C like every time if I can and it's always going to end up being some form of an initial population so I'm going to plug in 0 for T and P Sub Zero for P based on this right here so P Sub Zero 13 at time 0 lets us solve for C we know that C is negative 1 over P sub 0 let's plug that back in right there okay now you know I don't like that negative maybe we change all the sons also I know I'm gonna try to reciprocate this so we have we're going to need to find a common denominator so we're gonna multiply this by P Sub Zero over P Sub Zero these are the same a vision multiply P Sub Zero a piece of 0 now that we have that common denominator we're going to combine that fraction and we've written it all out of order so it's a 1 minus P sub 0 K T all the P sub 0 and if we reciprocate both sides so you think about cross multiply divided if you want to you our population due to time is based on the initial population divided by 1 minus the initial population times K positive variation comparing the birth rates and death rates times T now I need you to see this if your kay is positive notice how your time is always positive in initial population is always positive otherwise this is a meaningless problem and if you Mitchell population is zero then this will be zero because it'd be zero divided by one minus zero you would get no pup you would have no population how could you have a population after a short amount of time if you don't start with the population doesn't make sense so if our K is positive stick with me if our K is positive that means our birth rate is greater than death rate our population should be growing right if our K is positive that means that we have a positive here a positive here and positive here one minus that number is going to get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller while your initial population that number doesn't change that's a constant so remember that was C right they came from C so you have a constant being divided by a denominator it's shrinking you were going to get a population explosion do you see the map the population approaches infinity as T approaches infinity if K is a positive number so that this actually know as T approaches what would that be because we want this to get closer to 1 right so if T is approaching 1 or P sub 0 k if T is approaching this number then look at that if T is 1 over P sub 0 sometimes K this would get closer and closer to 1 to think about it if this is getting closer to 1 divided by P sub 0 K then this is getting closer and closer and closer and closer to 1 then 1 minus of that number is getting closer and closer and closer and closer to 0 then constant over something's get closer closer to 0 is getting really close to positive infinity so K is positive one more time if K is positive it means birth rates are good with death rates that means K is positive that means that this is getting really close to 1 this would get really close to zero this whole fraction close to infinity positive infinity that's a population explosion that T as the time approaches that value one of the pieces times K whatever that happens to be that's when you are gonna get the population explosion and show you that in just a minute promise i'ma show you that's an actual example in just a minute now what if your K were negative told you as we talk about that right now so what if your your death rate is outpacing your birth rate that would mean birth weights listen decorate your cave would be zero if your K is zero here sorry I think I don't mean K is negative if you can see negative that's a positive and a positive and a negative number one minus a negative is a positive this would be growing and growing and growing and growing and that's T approached infinity after a long time love whatever that is as T approaches infinity this number we need to getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger this number was say the same your population would go to zero are you seeing it so if your K is positive then as T approaches one of the piece of zero K your population is exploding but if K is negative then as T approaches infinity K is negative you're subtracting and negative if that can't change and that can't change and that's the only thing that's changing then as T approaches infinity this approaches infinity your fraction approaches constant over and affinity constant over something approach infinity would give you something very close to zero your population quote zero this is the difference between an explosion and an extinction it's all based on your K in this case so this says yeah your birth room mam's gotta make sense I mean are you seeing a sync if your birth rates are bigger than your death rates you're gonna grow obviously you're gonna grow how much you're gonna grow it's based on whether you're bound it or not logistic or not you're not bounded by anything you're saying that this shows you you're not bounded this says that if as your K is positive and your T is approaching 1 over P sub 0 K you're getting really close to 0 here when you're getting close to zero your constant divided by something close as your as exploding if your case negative so you're perfect you're less than your death rates well that's a negative number and as T approaches infinity you're saying 1 plus some number that's going to infinity a constant divided by 1 lose some number going to infinity it's going to go to 0 you're gonna get extinction I hope you're seeing that I hope you're seeing the infinitely became like a calculus one idea like going to different infinities as your T approaches different numbers based on a constant that's positive or negative that's a count one idea but it's so interesting to see this of populations is really interesting to see why we get population explosions and why we get population extinctions mathematically logically it makes sense birth rates are grim and death rates for richer listen that rates make sense but seeing that mathematically with your with your limits is pretty neat and that's exactly what we're doing so I'm gonna erase this real quick and what I'm gonna do is we're gonna now use this information and I'm gonna show you why that works I'm gonna show you what this does so coming back up here and saying hey you know what now that we have this negative 1 over P equals K T let's see and say hey how do I solve for C my initial condition would be data so the population is 6 when my time is 0 C is negative 1/6 wait a minute C is negative 1 over the initial population yes it is ok so negative 1 over P equals K times T a minus 1/6 we can now use how the populations vary and to find our constant variation so when the population has had 10 months to grow we have 9 you know let's go ahead and add 1/6 right now so let's see negative 1/9 plus 1/6 negative to 18 plus 3 should be 118 and if we divide by 10 K equals 1 over 180 wait a minute didn't we say the K should be positive here yes in fact we did we said that because our population is growing it shouldn't make sense that the birthrate has outpaced the death rate so the difference between those two needs to be a positive number and in fact that's what we have here so we know we know right now based on what we just learned about this that if our K is positive we are going to get an explosion we're all being able to answer this question we are going to get explosion we just talked about why big versus the limits we talked about however we're doing taking a constant a constant they're both positive and the teasing closer to 1 over that number you're subtracting 1 minus something close to 1 you're going to get something close to zero you're going to get a positive explosion that's gonna go to infinity this shows that our K is positive now let's let's rewrite that so we're gonna put this right here like before just like we do over there let's change all our signs so change a sign positive change the sign positive change sign - I've made this T over 180 let's get a common denominator so let's see that would be multiplied by 30 if we make one fraction there we're going to get this one over P equals 30 minus T over way reciprocate and we have a specific function that models this specific population now use your calculus 1 prints think about this for a second as T gets closer to what number will this population go bananas as T gets closer to look you're subtracting so 30 minus let's say 0 30 minus 0 you should get 630 - let's say ten thirty minus 10 would give you twenty one 80/20 would give you no my guess it works now what if we did 30 minus like hello 30 miles 29 30 minus 29 would give you 180 over 30 minus 29 wouldn't give you 32 by 180 divided by one that give you a 180 whatever the species is after 29 years 29 sorry 29 months two months what about twenty nine point nine months so 29 month and twenty nine twenty ninth month is pretty important so twenty nine months we're a hundred eighty whatever these are @ 29.9 you have now 180 divided by point one that's 1800 what about twenty nine point nine nine point zero one that's now 18,000 so as T approaches what month what number what month is this exploding like crazy well as T approaches 30 right here this is a positive number as T is climbing it's going to be a closer and closer and closer and closer and closer to 30 it's gonna closer to that well as it's getting closer to 30 as time goes on time starts at 0 goes positive then this is going to start exploding until we hit 30 and then we get an infinity and undefined idea we can't get past that so right here as T approaches 30 our population is approaching infinity now I told you that was gonna I was gonna make sense ago uh can't even think about that what is 1 over P sub 0 K P sub 0 was 6 K was 1 over 108 P sub 0 is 6 K is 1 over 180 if you do that let's see 1 it's multiplying but listen let's just so that's a complex fraction so T would be 180 over 6 T would be 30 as T approaches 30 the fat is going to go to infinity we showed it we just showed it right here and now we see that we see it in the math we see it as a formula if you wanna call that formula but I want you to logically understand what we talked about I want to understand that if your K is positive your T goes to infinity you're gonna explosion with these cases if your K is negative or any an extinction so if this was like a 6 and this was like a 3 your K would be negative right here you would see that as T approaches infinity you're gonna go to 0 you can try that for yourself man that's that's kind of cool if you want to see the exact model of that if you wants it doesn't look you take the same Leonard let me get the same thing by doing this if you divide everything by 30 then we incentivize one over 30 30 and then you can read that so that would be six over one minus one thirtieth teen as T approaches 30 as T approaches 31 over 30 times something approaching one over 30 is getting really close to one well I'm finding something really close to one it's getting close to 0-6 to buy this buy something really close to zero is getting really close to infinity try the other one for yourself dude do one where you're your population is decreasing like like like this call that three and see what happens see what would happen just for fun you 1/3 right there one-third plus one-sixth some negative one-third plus one-sixth negative two sixths plus one six is negative 1 6 multiplied by 10 giving cave equals negative one over 60 right there we see the negative K we know what's going to happen we're going to the extinction of bed this would be so it's still positive one six but we would get a positive T over 60 then this would give us a 10 plus T over 60 getting a common denominator 10 over 60 so 10 plus T over 60 when we reciprocate that would go straight up right there let's see if that works yeah we divided by 10 no this this model so if you want to do that you can divide everything by 10 gets 6 equals 1 plus T orbital and I would say your initial population 6 1 what apply plans that why is it plus there'd be - nope is your case negative that change that I'm gonna go back up to here because it's easier to remember right right now so Jake take a look man this is you icing on the cake pretty cool what's happening there what's happening your initial population starts at 6 well I can change the system to see the 6 that sounded not a big deal we're looking at it as your key it's bigger and bigger and bigger what's happening to this fraction well that's staying the same this says I'm not subtracting anything as T moves for T of 1 well you would let's pretend that T of 10 maybe T of 0 would give me 60 of 10 would give you 360 divided by 20 is 3 how about four how about sorry I would 11 how about 12 about 1300 1400 15 how about infinity as T gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger we're dividing 60 by something that's growing positively larger and larger and larger you have a constant over something going to that's gonna go to zero and now we've explained this both of these ideas with actual numbers I hope that makes sense I hope you're seeing the interplay between the limits of like calculus one these populations and these differential equations this is awesome this is really cool so I hope you've enjoyed it I hope I've made some of these population models understandable for you as they relate to birth rates and death rates I'm gonna see you for the next video where we're just going to talk about partial fractions because in the next video after that we deal with a lot of them so get prepared for it if you don't need help on partial fractions feel free to skip it but I will show you how they relate to differential equations so I'll see you for the next video on that you 

Transcript for: Using Partial Fractions in Differential Equations (Differential Equations 34)
hey again welcome to another video in this video we're gonna take a sidestep so I know we've been talking about modeling populations and we certainly will talk about more modeling in the next video but the next video has a lot of partial fractions in it and so what I'm gonna do is kind of an optional video for you if you are very comfortable with partial fractions grapes go on take care of another video but if you need a refresher and you're not used to seeing partial fractions and differential equations and sometimes we just get away from those we don't see them very often I'm doing this video for that reason so you get us comfortable with partial fractions in differential equations some algebraic techniques that can help us like moving some negatives around that make things just slightly easier so I'm going to show you my techniques on how to do that I'll show you some shortcuts when dealing with linear factors which we mostly get in these population models and then I'll move on so if you want to maybe just practice with me make sure that we still understand partial fractions how to deal with some negatives and some explanation will come up so this is going to be as quick as I can make it go through three examples just the bare bones on how we go through partial fractions again so kind of a refresher on partial fractions and differential equations so let's suppose we have a differential equation we have DX DT so deep in a variable X infinite variable t equals X minus x squared and then X sub 0 equals student so we got some initial condition on it what I want you to remember is that these are going to be separable but when we separate them they're not going to create some integrals that are very easy or very nice they're gonna create integrals that you need to deal with partial fractions and so sometimes setting these up it's very nice to put things in order and factor so your first term is positive so what we're gonna do before we even start is set this up like DX DT equals negative x squared plus X and factor out and negative x so X minus 1 let's make sure negative x squared plus X that's really good after we do that we're gonna see that this is a separable separable difference equation could you have seen that right here yes because X is your dependent variable and T is your independent variable you can group your X is the X and constants DT but sometimes that negative screws us up a little bit not that it's any different I mean you can slowly do this that ways get everything on one side right now and keep a constant on the right that's that's fine but going through it sometimes we get some sign errors now is it is a big deal no no and in fact as we move forward with this I'm gonna be factoring out a negative again and multiplying both sides by negative but I've seen a lot of students when they're just forgotten some partial fractions really make a lot of sign errors in this screws of everything so I'm gonna do it this way you can choose your own way to go on this one but what I'm gonna do is I'm going to move my X's DX so 1 over x times X minus 1 DX equals negative DT and when we integrate that sorry when we get ready to integrate that we're gonna see that on the left hand side this is set up really nicely do a partial fraction that's why I'm factoring first here instead of putting everything on one side and trying to struggle through so I'm factoring saying okay I I see that those two are those are some linear factors that's gonna be partial fractions now we're gonna spend some time right now to talk about how you do partial fractions I know you've seen it but it's it's it's my getting a long time so how partial fractions work it says you're gonna take this fraction and we're gonna understand that we can write this as a sum of two different fractions here's how you set this up for every factor you were going to get a fraction so two factors two fractions and then for every numerator do you have a degree lower than your denominator so if we have a linear a linear denominator you're going to that constant it had been a quadratic number you would have had a linear numerator so the fractions equal factors factor equals fractions and when we have linear factors you're going to have constant numerators and then the whole process is really just fighting the common it's not magic but this says is if I give a common denominator my denominators equal but my denominators then my numerators would have to be equal so the whole process is really just find a common denominator multiply this fraction by X minus one multiply this fraction by X and then if you had found the common denominator your numerator would be this your other numerator is one and because your denominators have article and you've found a common term and put this together your numerous also have to be equal and then so it's so moving forward past that what's very nice about our Lanier's is that you can oftentimes plug in a number like zero to make one term zero solve with other coefficient or one make this term zero so for this coefficient that's really nice with linear so it's a nice little trick that we do here we'll say what if x is 0 if X is zero then this would still be 1 0 minus 180 times negative 1 so 0 minus 1 is negative 1 plus this whole term would be 0 and it allows you to solve for a very nicely it would be negative 1 now what if X word 1 well if X were 1 then this would still be 1 this whole term would be 0 and this would be just B and be lit equal 1 and what that does for us says one time through they haven't put in order factors so you see that you got a couple linear factors here you go okay when I make a separable difference of equation out of this I know that I'm gonna have partial fractions it happens a lot in the next video so we have such partial fractions we know that we're basically just finding the common denominator and setting our numerators equal then we plug in a number that's going to create a term equal 0 solve another coefficient so we've done that and says you can now rewrite this fraction you can rewrite this as negative 1 over X plus 1 over X minus 1 we're going to do that right now a was- one got it over X B was one over X minus one home I'm not an empty vector in a billions DX equals integral of negative 1 DT so on the left hand side left hand sides really nicely just have a basic integral on the right hand side even nicer we're gonna get negative a-team plus some sort of a constant now think through what's gonna happen we're gonna get a couple natural logarithms we're gonna be putting that together do you remember that when you have logarithms added or subtracted you can combine them and so on the left hand side we are going to combine that on the right hand side we're gonna put a C sub 1 because eventually we're gonna have to be written that logarithm that's going to be an exponential and so when we have at C sub 1 we're gonna wrap that up as e to the C sub 1 probably a plus and minus a new with the absolute value and that whole thing is going to be another arbitrary constant so we're gonna do we're going to do that most of the time for these partial fractions on the left hand side hey that's gonna be negative Ln absolute value of x plus Ln absolute value X minus 1 there's not really any necessary use so maybe something very basic and this is what I was just talking about when you have two logarithms being added or subtracted the positive or the plus goes on our numerator so X minus 1 and this thing being subtracted creates this quotient inside one logarithm where we have the numerator from our positive or plus Ln and the negative gives us our denominator that minus Ln X gives us X in the denominator equals negative T plus C someone has something pretty good now we can take an exponential on both sides so here and here yes we're going to get absolute value of X minus 1 over X on the right hand side e to the negative T times e to the seasoned why don't you remember that how we can when we take an exponential to this entire function over there we have e to the negative T but times is e sub 1 well if we wrap up this absolute value as a plus and by this then this whole thing we've done this for many times we can define that to be it's like an e start to be a C so that's our constant so X minus 1 over x equals C e to the negative T now pause I know that you want to solve for X I do - we're gonna solve for X but do you remember that with these logarithms that we take an X mention both sides we wrap up that hole we see the 1 e to the C sub 1 plus some eyes with a scene right now is a really good time to plug in an initial value or an initial condition or whatever they've given you because if we start solving for x we're gonna have to eventually solve for C and it's gonna take us a lot of work to undo what we just did so if we take this X of 0 equals 2 that means that T our independent variable 0 and X is 2 this is much nicer salt because if you plug in 0 here this whole thing's in one that's going to be B C equals 2 months 1 over 2 that's a lot nicer than having to solve for X and then put that in and have a result for C that's crazy so when you're going through these plug ins see basically as soon as you can since you have a nice arbitrary constant not here so much not there for sure because that that's garbage right that's that's nasty but as soon as you read the redefine your arbitrary constant now's the time so 2 minus 1 over 2 equals C times e to the 0 or 1 this is gonna say that C is 1/2 now we plug that in right here so X minus 1 over the X looks pretty good there rid of 1/2 e to the negative T this is where we want to solve for X now I mentioned something a while ago I said I might have the fact we're gonna negative here's when I would do that so I'm trying to explain so now that you have to okay I'm try to explain the Leonard way of doing this what I'm always looking for when I'm going through these integrals partial fractions is I'm really trying to make sure that my negative fraction has only one term if if not then okay but I'm trying to make sure that has only one term why because if that's gonna be a natural logarithm and that's gonna be a natural on them I want the single term to end up on the denominator because I know we're gonna be doing exponential I know we're going to be multiplying to get rid of that denominator if this has two terms you'd have to multiply it distribute it subtractive factored divide it here because from a one time we will multiply subtractive factor divide it so it saves us one step is it really important it's not I'm going to show you the last example that if we do it differently have this reverse it's not a huge deal but you will have to distribute subtract you'll add an extra step there so one time just to make sure that we're we're golden on this a lot of times we're getting some partial fractions that happens when we have a constant divided you don't have to have a constant but here it's going to be constant divided by some linear factors so we factor we see that we do our partial fractions we're basically doing a common denominator we're sitting our numerators equal it's going to solve for those coefficients for separating fractions and we're going to get a lot of natural logarithms try if you want to try if you can to make sure that your negative logarithm has one term that's really helpful so we group them as one logarithm we exponential both sides we get rid of that we wrap up our arbitrary constant as a plus a minus e to the C sub 1 equals C and right there we plug our initial value problem that lets us solve for our C or that we're pretty much good to go we're going to multiply both sides by X we're going to group our X's on one side and our constants on the other so maybe adding one and subtracting this term and then we're going to factor X we're going to factor X because we're grouping the terms that have X in them on one side of purpose so that we could factor it and then divide and so we're going to divide this that doesn't look that great we get some complex fractions we have a negative explore out there so we're gonna do a couple things to make this maybe a little bit nicer number one we might choose to multiply both the numerator and denominator by two so we multiply by two well it's gonna distribute but it's gonna kill off that one-half that would be pretty nice so X as a function of T we have two over two minus e to the negative T that's perfectly appropriate that is fine but you might also see this you might see some textbooks some people say yeah I'd really prefer not to have that even though your T here so because that's technically a complex fraction you do have 1 over e to the T we can multiply by e to a positive team and get our function of X with respect that in in terms of T would be 2 e to the T over remember you still distribute here to even t minus 1 e to the negative T times me the positive T would be 1 e to the 0 either 0 is 1 so you might get a better than notice how to look completely different right I mean they they look very very different but they are the same exact thing so that's about all I want to do on this problem we've used our initial value problem we've done some partial fractions this is how they locked a lot of those these next differential equations for population modeling is going to work it's gonna say hey you have some linear factors it's still separable ninasam your factors under constant that's a partial fraction so make sure you're seeing partial fractions try this to get your term on your denominator to be a single if sorry that negative know meant to be a single term so you're done with your single term it does help a little bit just makes makes it so that right here when you multiply you want to distribute again it's not a big deal it's just a deal other than that we're solving this like normal and then we're typically wrapping this up if we can avoid negative exponents we try to avoid negative expose there's two more I'm gonna come back up here and do a couple more just to get us really really good at this hope this making sense I hope this is refreshing your memory let's try another one so we're going to start here another difference of equation says that we'll like at a quadratic that's not going to be partial fractions right because that's like a creek that's like a tan inverse no sign immerse really that right there maybe be more appropriate to write this in a good order no no what's gonna happen I'm gonna write this as negative x squared plus 1 we're gonna factor out the negative and we're going to see a difference of squares but when I do that when I leave the native on the right hand side I am going to factor a negative from what we get so I will be changing it back if you can see that this is 1 minus x times 1 plus X and you fine with it and do your partial fraction from there great do it but over the last 14 years man I've seen a lot of students mess that up first thing I see it and secondly mess this up with some sign errors you can get the wrong a and B and so I'm not gonna do it that way now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna do the way I would normally normally teach it to avoid the sign there's and the only reason it works just like I've shown you that's fine if you have your own way of doing it that's totally ok it's just to get you some some techniques that have seemed to work for me really well so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to rewrite this as negative x squared plus 1 I'm gonna factor that negative I'm going to factor this right now so that I see the linear factor so I'm not screwed up on something like a it's a trick Sun or something weird and now what we see this is acceptable difference of equation we can group our exes the exes and our negative 1 DT so I'm gonna move my exes to the left hand side on the right hand side we just get negative 1 DT and when we see our integral right here when we see this on the left hand side you have to be seen as part of a fraction the Yui yep there's nothing I can do with that that is why I put this in order that's why I factored appropriately so I'm seeing two linear factors I'm seeing I can separate this fraction into two different fractions two factors two fractions both Linear's constant numerator so I'm going to do that why again why I chose to put this in this order factor the negative is because I see a lot of sign errors happen if I don't do that again it's not it's not a huge deal but it just needs a deal so let's try and separate this by partial fractions we know that two factors means we're gonna get two fractions linear factors means that we're gonna get constant numerators now we're finding the comment another so one would equal a times X plus one plus B times X minus one and what that gives us is says if you found common denominators your numerators would have to be equal so we're gonna take that word and run with it I'm gonna say hey what if fun what if X was one notice how zero doesn't help us but if X was one this would be zero this would be one plus one this would still be one so we have 1 would equal a times one plus one plus zero if X is one this whole term would be zero so any would there be one half now extra negative one vector negative one this would be zero this would be negative two so this term is zero this would be B times negative two and B would equal negative one half so that allows us to split up that fraction and say all right well if it is one half of these negative one half then this this fraction becomes two different fractions one over two times X minus one minus coz B is a negative minus one over two times X plus one and this is all DX equals integral of negative one DT so a couple other things look what might you do well personally I probably factor out the 1/2 I probably multiply both sides honestly before I even did anything it's probably the factor out this that 1/2 also if you don't want to deal with this negative you can factor a negative 1/2 I'll show you that right now just to show you some things that we can do so if i factor out a negative 1/2 then this would be negative 1 or X minus 1 plus 1 over X plus 1 notice things the factor a negative 1 happen either should be a positive 1/2 negative 1/2 if we multiply both sides by negative 2 then this would give us an integral of 2 DT or 2 times integral of DT so we've avoided a fraction we've avoided a 2 we don't we won't have any 1/2 L ends that's kind of nice to deal with that on the right hand side that would no matter what will you do by the way so if you didn't see that it's fine I'm just showing some small techniques here then this would still work out to 2dt imagine that if you had a a 1/2 and 1/2 e digit integration you have a 1/2 ln a 1/2 ln you've multiplied by 2 anyhow and that would still be a 2t what's these the 1 C sub 1 because we know we're going to be dealing with some logarithms we're dealing with logarithms means we're gonna have an exponential we're gonna be changing at arbitrary constants so on the left hand side we'll have a no need for a you sub it pretty loud basically so but no need for any coefficient changes will have a negative Ln absolute value of X minus 1 plus Ln absolute value of x plus 1 and we talked about just a minute ago how when you have a logarithms added together the same base or subtracted we can make this one logarithm with the positive or plus on the numerator and the minus or negative on the denominator now we're ready to take both sides 2 as an exponent on deep so we do it alright e to the both sides here on the left hand side and we're gonna do a couple things because we should be literally just did it we're going to have X plus 1 over X minus 1 on the right hand side you know that you'll have e to the 2t times e to the C sub 1 and we're going to put the absolute value equals plus and minus that and we'll call all of that our arbitrary constant so X plus 1 over X minus 1 equals arbitrary constant C e to the 2t should you solve for X right now know also made a comment a little while ago that I really want to try to set these up so that my denominator has a single term well I couldn't do that both of these fractions have two terms in them so it really didn't matter about our negative I just factored a native because I didn't want that one to be negative I wanted to deal with an with a positive exponent that's only reason why we did it could you have got here without doing what I did without changing this around could you have just factored this yes if you see that that spectable is a different squares great do it if you see that that Specter with different squares and it still leads you to partial fractions that's great okay totally fine to do that I've just seen a lot of students get really jacked up about this like all that's not a partial fraction I don't see so I've learned that if I write this in order make them factor a negative they'll see difference of squares better they'll see linear factors better they won't get messed up with negatives sign errors won't happen the A's and the B's are much more consistently found that way and then I will get the correct coefficients out of them because imagine this imagine if you screwed up that sign this whole thing is smoked okay your problem is done so that's why I've done that huge deal no not if you but I've also said well I want that to be positive so notice I'm factoring a negative I wouldn't have had to do this if I didn't set this up this way so i factor the negative it's basically undoing what I've just done and then I want a positive exponent on my exponential so I've got that that looks really good goes ready to change that the very end last problem if you remember e on both sides they're wrapped up my arbitrary constant as a giant C and right now is where you'd want to plug in that initial value so we're gonna plug in x equals 3 when T equals 0 that's really nice to do right here because if I play in T equals 0 this is 1 and if X is 3 we get 3 plus 1 over 3 minus 1 equals C that's 2 so 4 over 3 minus 1 that would be man just to this it's pretty nice let's rewrite it so we'll have X plus 1 over X minus 1 equals to e to the positive 2 T and now it's just about solving for x so here's what's gonna have to happen when we have more than one term on the denominator we are going to multiply both sides by the denominator but we're gonna have to distribute collect our X terms on one side non X terms on the other side factor and and divide so I'm going to be multiplying both sides by X minus 1 I'm going to be distributing we're going to group our X terms on the left Arnon X terms on the right there's a lot of negative splitting around we're going to factor our X and now since we factor since our group our X terms are infected actually now we divide it so X is a function of t equals negative 1 minus 2 e to the positive 2t over 1 minus 2 e to the positive 2 team that's a lot of negatives one thing that we could do if that's not looking that great to you you can factor out a negative from your denominator or numerator and distribute it through the opposite so I'm gonna factor it negative out of this well that's going to do is that's going to create this this is negative 2 e to the 2t minus 1 and then I'll run that through the numerator so this should be that of the numerator and our function can look quite a bit different here we get a positive 2 e to the 2t plus 1 over 2 e to the 2t minus 1 that might look a lot nicer for you a little bit easier to plug numbers in kind of see what's going on with that so if your problem is not looking exactly the same a lot of negatives sometimes it's nice to do I hope it's making sense I hope that you're seeing some of the nuance of appropriately working with partial fractions again these things are optional that I'm doing I don't want you to say well I've done it different my whole life that's fine guys I'm just showing you the way that I do it cuz it works really well for a lot of people so we have one more and I will be right back with it ok so here we go last one just a recap of how how partial fractions work especially in differential equations now I could give you just the integral of partial fractions as a just link a video and I can do that too if you want but in in setting these up there are some things that we want to deal with the first before setting out to do that integral partial fractions becomes stemming from these differential equations number one to recognize me so we have a differential equation we have two linear factors already it's already factored for you I would say that's I'm going to change that but they're already kind of setting this up as something that is going to be done with partial fractions so if we're seeing separable hopefully you've seen they're separately you know X's the XS constants DT but what I want to notice is that that might screw up some science for us so I'm going to change that real quick what I'm going to do is I'm going to factor a negative in form and write this in a what I would say slightly better order no it doesn't really make a difference moving forward it doesn't make a difference but for for the students have helped it seems to make a lot of sense we're going to our X's DX and are constants DT and we are ready to integrate it's just that sensibly wrote this as two linear factors and since we saw that this is separable now we have one over that well that right there shows us so that's going to be a partial fraction a partial fraction decomposition so when we when we set this up as a linear we've set this up as something recognizable when a group are excess DX it's going to be more apparent if you take care of some some work beforehand so now we're going yes that's for sure partial fraction milk creating trig stubs or anything weird now we say all right let's separate this fraction we know that there are two factors so that's going to give us two fractions we know that they're both millennia absorbable our numerators have to be constants one degree below that we know that in order to do partial fraction decomposition all we're really doing is finding a common denominator and setting our numerators equal so if we were to find a common denominator it would be a times X minus 5 and it would be B times X and that would have to equal the numerator one then we also further stand that we can plug in some numbers like 0 and if that's 0 then 1 would equal so 1 would change any times negative 5 and a would equal negative 1/5 that's kind of nice if X was 5 then this whole term would be 0 and 1 would equal B times 5 or B would equal 1/5 now we've seen this very similar problem before so when we let me break this up when we decompose this into some partial fractions here then we're going to have this integral changes to let's see a is negative 1/5 so that would be negative 1/5 X plus B is 1/5 do not distribute that 1/5 times X minus 5 DX and then on the right hand side we get this 3dt now the reason why I said don't distribute that those both have a factor of 1/5 and we're gonna factor that out also I told you this and for me this is great this looks really good because my single term the the denominator with the single term has a negative in front of it so think about what's gonna happen we're gonna factor a 1/5 right we'd multiply both sides by 5 that defines going to 15 over there on the left hand side I'm gonna get two logarithms one of those negatives and that logarithm that's negative is going to have a single term inside X that's great because when I put this together as a fraction I'd have two terms over one term that's a simple multiply combined there collects some some terms with the the accident and then factor and divide that's easy what I'm gonna do is show you how to do it if you if you're not practicing that in that method so I'm gonna do something a little bit different I'm gonna factor a negative one-fifth I'm gonna show you how to deal with an Ln when you have two terms on the denominator how you'll need to multiply distribute collect factor and then re divide so I'm doing this on purpose even though this is this looks really good to me I would keep it this way all I would normally do is factor a 1/5 like this and say hey this this would be negative 1 over X this would be PI plus 1 over X minus 5 if you find what I'm going to do is I'm going to factor a negative to show you what happens when you have two terms of the divisor so negative one-fifth would create a positive one over X minus a 1 over X minus 5 let's verify that multiplying you get negative and you get positive this now what what is nice is that when I multiply both sides by negative 5 and this I'm not gonna have to deal with a negative exponent that I'm gonna get when I take both sides as an exponential on that either way we would have been fine though on the left-hand side we're gonna get ailment absolute value of X we're gonna get minus Ln absolute value of X minus 5 mil problem should be very comfortable that on the right hand side we get a 15 T 1 Z sub 1 we know that we're gonna be changing that C sub 1 now let's combine these and you can see what I'm talking about right now I said that when you have a subtraction and two terms on your denominator eventually that's going to become your denominator when you combine these into a single logarithm by the quotient rule on the right hand side that 15 T plus C sub 1 that still looks fine right here we're saying hey we've done this three times in a room now let's take both sides as exponents on that extra function on the left hand side we just get x over X plus -5 on the right hand side we're going to get a plus or minus e to the C sub 1 times e to the 15 T and this is what we're gonna call that seam let's move up here do a little more work on it double check looks pretty good to me what do I do now I don't know I don't solve for X right now I use my initial value after you redefine your constant that exponential rate constant after you've done that now is a real good time to plug in that initial value problem or the initial condition initial population we're doing population problems so 0:48 for X and since we're playing at zero for T 15 times 0 0 e to the 0 is 1 that's awesome that means C is the Third's and let's rewrite it so since C is just this constant 8/3 we know x equals R sorry X over X minus 5 was 8/3 e to the 1500 now this is what I was talking about we are gonna have to multiply it by that two number but now that duck denominator has two terms so we're gonna have to multiply by X minus five we're gonna have to distribute that we're gonna have to get our extras on one side constants on non X's on the other side so stuck with T's in it factor and then divide it it's just one extra step but it is it is an extra step so happy for having not factored a negative we wouldn't have to do that we were to multiply by X our exponent would have been negative though and so I guess maybe you would have you consider that to I think it's easier to deal with but I guess it adds a step two so either way you go well I am gonna do I am gonna multiply both sides by three though because I don't like that fraction so let me multiply both sides by 3 we get a 3x over X minus 5 equals 8 either 15 T that is nicer now let's multiply both sides by X minus 5 and we're forced to distribute we have to do that so when we distribute this we're gonna have a 3x equals 8x e to the 15 minus 40 e to the 15 and now what we're gonna do we're going to group our X's on one side and we're going to factor that excel and then we're going to divide so when we factor that x3 minus 80 the 52 equals negative 40 in the 15 t and dividing we have a function of X in terms of teeth that's negative 40 e to the 15 T all over 3 minus 8 e to the 15 T now what do you what do you think you do do you think you'd leave like that do you think you'd deal with a negative most people say they're gonna deal with a negative right here you're gonna take this negative and from the 40 and distribute through your denominator and change a couple sides with that so this should really look like 40 me to 15 t over positive a 15-3 do not please do not simplify the 40th day please don't simplify the game the 15 to you or you think you can't do that stuff not less you can factor and we can't Factor anything here so I hope that's made sense I hope that this has refresh your memory on not just partial fractions but how to deal with them in differential equations that were really looking to make some some factors first that way when we put this as a several difference equation in separate variables that's more easy to see this partial fraction I hope I made the case on why you might want to necessary why you might might want to have it in honor of a single term it's just a little bit easier to deal with in a lot of cases so other than that what we're gonna do next time is I'm gonna take these ideas that we've done and since we're really really good at these partial fractions now we're gonna apply them some population models and see how they work so I'll see you for the next video on that I hope you've been enjoying this exploration of some more real-life examples with population stuff we're gonna get back to that in the next video have a great day you 

Transcript for: Population Growth and Decline (Differential Equations 35)
hi it's time to get to another video on some population modeling so we're going to look back at our logistic equation we're gonna look at population explosions and population extinctions we're going to look at these these limiting populations and carrying capacities in terms of just three examples so we have man we've done a lot we learned about how death rates and birth rates affect population growth we've learned how we can explode and go extinct or or reach a limiting population or a carrying capacity depend on what problem we have and so we're going to take a look at these three examples just go through real quickly make sure that we're seeing how to use partial fractions appropriately and and seeing a good interpretation of these things so before we begin though I want to remind you that while these two setups look very very similar and you're gonna get both of these in this this video they're decidedly different on your end result of what you can possibly have for your population so if you haven't watched like three videos ago I encourage you to do that when we talk about the differences here and explore them at length and go through the proofs of why this one right here reaches a plateau this limiting population or carrying capacity and why this one right here explodes or becomes extinct I go into the derivation of that so take a look at that if you haven't that's like three videos ago when we talk about logistic equation and all that entails and population doomsday and extinction so what I want you to get out of this is that when we're taking a look at these yes we're gonna be answering some actual questions stemming from these problems absolutely but more than that I want you to look at what would happen if we went forever all right so what if time goes beyond the the the link that we're talking about I want you to really think about that like what would happen to our populations would they reach a point where they can't grow anymore would they reach a point where they can't decline anymore would they do you know where you start explode until there's no more room or become extinct if there's no much so I want to look at that beyond just the scope of the problem ever trying to get you to think critically about this so hopefully hopefully we can do that so let's take a look at this and let's the first thing we want to notice is that if we have a population that's changing with respect to time according to this I want to look at it right now do you see how this form fits what we've already talked about right here so right now when we say hey the way the populations change it with respect to time is based on this logistic equation or a form of it look how we have this M this M 200 what that says since that is coming before our pm and since this is based on a logistic equation where we have probably a birth rate that's or some linearly proportional to the population that right there that is called either our limiting capacity no sorry limiting population or carrying capacity what's gonna happen with this problem so when we get done this is like this not like this one it's like this one where we have a constant - or population what's gonna happen is we are going to get at the very end that depending on where we start if we start below that 200 we will eventually gain to it but we will never grow more than 200 if we start above that 200 we will decline to a little to never fall below that 200 so so let's look at this at time zero our population was 100 hmm that's below 200 what's gonna happen we're gonna see this after you solve our differential equation is this population will be growing absolutely it even says right here it's growing one per your positive one so it says that and the population was growing at one per year so so think about this if we cannot get higher than 200 we start at 100 and we are growing we are going to see after we solve a different differential equation that there's absolutely no way we're gonna get above 200 we were below it there's nobody to bother had me started above it we would have been declining we would get to it not not below it so we're gonna explore that after we solved the the basic problem so what's the population between 60 years that's the basic problem but again I want you to think past that so let's take a look at it and set it up solve our equation and then we'll we'll see some partial fractions in there as well so the first thing we want to do is identify what our initial conditions are maybe to see if we have a rate of and solve for R K as quickly as possible so let's see our initial conditions given to us right there we know that this is something we're going to use and we're gonna solve we're gonna use that to solve for our arbitrary constant however it's also telling us something right here so according to to our population model our population chain of the spending time with this we had a hundred at the start and we're growing at one per year whenever you see that whenever you see that growing or the rate of change or time rate of change what that means is that this is immediately giving you back its name your population is growing that's that's a rate of change with respect to time at one per year well this is according to years when we're talking about years and years then that growth rate is telling you that the derivative of P with the spring time is one okay let's write that down so population at time zero is 100 that's pretty clear but also the rate of change of our population with respect to time at Year Zero is positive one again that means our populations growing we start below our cap basically our limiting population we start below our cap and we're growing we are going to reach it now since we have our population circle population population and simply we have a rate of change of our population seconds line we can plug in 100 and 101 install 4 okay this happens happens occasionally where we're given our rate of change and they would have studied this said hey we're growing at whatever per year consistently are at this time so let's plug this in let's solve for our concert variation we're going to try to solve our conservation as soon as possible most of the time you'd go ahead and do your integral and you'd solve for your arbitrary constant use your initial condition and then you'd have one of two things either you have your rate of change in the beginning which is case you've solved for K which we're going to do here or if you don't have this if you do not have your rate of change it has to give you what your population did in a period of time after this and so there's really two two cases either I have to give you your rate population specs time or have to say in five years we had a hundred whatever twenty whatever these populations are so it have to give you how the population is varying for you to figure out your constant of variation in this case so we're gonna have to have to have one of those two things in this case I haven't given you initial condition I've given you the rate of change I haven't given you how the population has actually changed in a certain amount of time I've given me this so we can sell for a cave right now that's great so let's plug this in so our rate of change of population strikes time is one we're solving for K we know our initial population is 100 to keep in mind to you that this was at time zero and this is also at time zero it's gotta match up so our population is changing with respect to time when we first started this at growth of one per year maybe there's one thousand per year and this is a hundred thousand units of population I'm just paring down the numbers for us but these have to not jump so we say our growth rate is one per year at Year Zero we had a hundred at Year Zero now we just fill our model out so our population was one hundred initial population and we're growing at one per year again you either have to have the growth rate or you have to have how that population is varying up to certain amount of times so it's either you solve for K now if you have the growth rate if you don't you're forced to do your differential equation and then use your initial condition to solve for the arbitrary constant C and then how the population changed for a period of time to solve for your K that makes sense we've done that we've done both of these cases already let's solve for that case so let's see let's see that's a hundred that's a hundred so that's 10,000 I'll divide by 10,000 let's see two zeroes two zeroes for zero okay yeah so 10,000 so we're able to solve for a cake because I gave you the initial condition and how the population was growing let's plug that in right now so we're gonna change model right now and to say since we solve for arcade the rate of change of our population with respect to time is now 1 over 10,000 P 200 - fine and as soon as we do that we have this differential equation and we know that that separation of variables and because we practice those partial fractions which were certainly going to get last video we're pretty set up for it what I didn't want to do I didn't want to get here like hey remember Corrections and I meant to go redo that so partial fractions are real important I gave you that video last time to make sure that I just really killed it to make sure that we we were good here so since we have this step this difference equation since it's separation of variables let's move our P and 200 minus P on the left so P DP our constant DT if you hadn't had that rate of change of population so if I had not given you this what would have happened is this would be okay right now it actually would be a big deal we've done several problems like that you would have done your integration then what you would have done you use your initial condition to solve your arbitrary constant that we're about to get and then you would have to have some sort of population change to solve for that Batcave so in our case we go alright hey you know what we take an integral no problem we can do that on the right hand side pretty easy we're gonna get T over 10,000 plus C that constant on the left hand side though well man we're gonna have to do partial fractions do you see it but that's there's another way to go about it we're gonna have to set do partial fraction decomposition and how do we do that is we say this would be since we have two linear factors a over the first one here that's a constant I'll plus B over the second linear we practice this a ton in the last video not an issue we would say get a common denominator and if you get a common denominator your numerators we have to be equal because your denominators are to be equal in this equation so one would equal a times 200 minus P plus B times P we're just finding a common denominator I had teachers say well you got to do the cover-up method and doing this with you're trying to become a denominator that's all you're really doing and then plug in P equals zero it's going to get rid of this term and so once you get a was one over 200 plug in P equals 200 if you plug in P equals 200 this will be 0 that will be 200 and we will divide by 200 get 1 over 200 so let's rewrite this and see what it does is since this integral is 1 over P times 200 minus P we now know that that's separated by these two fractions a is 1 over 200 B is also 1 over 2 Klenner what I'm gonna do is I'm going to write this as 1 over 200 times P 1 over 200 times 200 minus P I'm not going to distribute it we're going to immediately factor out that 1 over 200 so let's do that right now so 1 over 200 P plus 1 over 200 minus P times 200 let's factor that 1 over 200 that's exactly what this was same exact thing let's factor that how we saw that a lot last video to that that that constant that we get is often times the same or off by a sign so 1 over 200 integral of 1 over P plus 1 over 200 - P DP I'm also gonna do one more thing you saw a little I would say a trig but something that's gonna make our math a little bit easier I really don't want to have to deal with with chain rules or you subs when doing these integrals so what I might do here I might pull that negative out right here so I'm gonna factor this negative someone write this as negative P plus 200 I'm gonna factor that maybe seems to be negative out and also I want this guy to be negative not this one that way when I group my ll ends that were about to get I have a single term on the denominator rather than two terms because that way we don't have to distribute as much and you're gonna see that in just a minute so what I want to do is I'm gonna write that says hey man 1 over P great plus 1 over negative P plus 200 I'm gonna do all my work here then I'm gonna race it to show you why we're getting what I'm about to get after that I'm gonna factor out this this negative which would give us that this negative P plus 200 or foot pull up at negative P minus 200 but I really don't want this guy to be negative because we're not getting my L ends which we're gonna get right now upon our integration I really want to have to divide by this and not this so I'm a factor than negative out of the entire integral super necessary no but I find it helps so I'm gonna write this so bad I have positive on the denominator positive variable minus a constant rather than the other way around I'm also going to write this so that my single term fractions over single terms on the denominator fractions are negative and my my dual term are my binomials are plus so positive or plus so what our integral becomes basically I mean I'm going to just erase all this but what we ended up doing is we rewrote this factor negative factor to negative so negative 1 over 200 and then negative 1 over P plus 1 over P and minus 200 just a little bit of algebraic manipulation but I find it helps we're actually almost done what we're gonna do is we're gonna integrate both sides now on the right hand side pretty easy we're gonna get T over 10,000 plus some sort of arbitrary constant might look like and C sub 1 why what am I about to get what am I about to get over here so we're gonna integrate right what am I about to get well I'm gonna get some L ends how do you undo L ends you you do that e to the Ln thing and you compose inverse functions are gonna cancel but on the right hand side I'll have plus or minus e to the C sub 1 we're gonna wrap all of that up into our constant so on the left hand side this is negative 1 over 200 leave it we're going to get this negative Ln absolute value P plus Ln absolute value of P minus 200 do you see why we might have wanted to write this with that PV and positive that way we don't have to forget our flow don't have a chance of forgetting to do a use of and and pulling out that negative so when we spend the time to do some algebra here and say yeah I really I really don't want that to be a minus because if I would have done it there it's not a huge deal but I would have had negative Ln 1 over 200 minus P I would have had to do that use of in my head I don't have to be that so in writing these with our P positive we avoid a sign error and you guys to know that sign errors are like the number one mistake that we get so be careful with that also the reason why we factored out the negative here is so that when we combine these elements which we're about to write now we're going to get Ln of P minus 200 over P and not P over P minus 200 that's going to save us a multiplication distribution collecting terms instead we'll just have to multiply and collect terms it saves us one step again is it super super important that you do it exactly my late no I'm not trying to get you to do a big step in my way I'm trying to think about what way works best for you so for me this works very well after that man what would I do now I'd probably collect these like I said it was going to so negative one over 200 Ln P minus 200 over P equals T over 10,000 plus C sub 1 now what well I can't do that Ethan yet not until I multiply by negative 200 so let's do that let's multiply everything by negative 200 I'm gonna get rid of this I'd have to distribute so we'll have them Ln absolute value P minus 200 no problem over P God and absolute value equals when I multiplied by negative 200 let's see that's going to be negative T over 50 minus 200 C sub 1 now I have told you in the past that you plug in your initial condition to solve for that C as soon as you can now what I mean by as soon as you can as soon as it's nice to do so where you don't have to change your arbitrary constant anymore so we're gonna plug in this initial condition but we're not gonna do it until after we wrap up our C so you think about sometimes you plug it in sometimes you don't when you do that I explain that a long time ago but if you don't remember that's okay when we plug in this initial condition is if we don't have natural log we do it right away if we do have natural log so when you're gonna have to exponentiate both sides you said take both as an exponent onto that e you wait until you wrap up that plus or minus e to the C sub whatever wrap that whole thing up as that gigantic see and then you do it so when you have the natural logarithm you wait just a bit other than that you man you normally just plug it in right away so I'm not gonna be solving for C now I'm not going to plug that in it's incredibly messy what we're gonna do is we're gonna wait just a little bit longer so when we say hey now I've got this Ln so wrapping this up we did some work with our signs no problem to make this a little bit easier to see to make it so that later when I multiply it just have to multiply by P and not P minus 200 I don't have this you said with a negative sign in there I don't the worry about that I wrapped up my L ends I have my constant over here with a C sub 1 and now we're gonna say because we got the Ln we're gonna have e on both sides this e Ln is gone but remember what we can do we can take the plus and minus we can say this part right here would be e to the negative T over 50 that's no problem but this would be times remember when you add exponents it came from common bases so that when they separate the addition or subtraction I have these common bases being multiplied together this right here eetu the negative 2 or 50 great times e to the negative 200 C sub 1 and then we can write the absolute value of plus or minus so plus or minus e to the negative 200 C sub 1 this entire piece of jungle right there that's one big constant so we're gonna say let's call that C that's a concept called see this is what I'm saying when I say plugin you're plugging your initial value as soon as you can but when you can depend on what you have if you have a natural logarithm you wait you wait until right here you go okay now I've wrapped that that up as a seed this is where you don't want to plug in your initial value so when we plug this in we go okay now my initial value said at time zero I had 100 units of population like 100,000 so 100,000 units population I'm going to plug in that 100 now when T is zero so I look at 100 when time is zero let's see negative zero zero or 5008 of the zeros 1 c times 1 is 1 on the left hand side you get negative 100 over 1/3 that's negative 1 so C is negative 1 that makes sense all right I'm gonna have to racist but we're pretty close to done so one time just to make sure that we're crystal clear we looked at this and said right now that right there is a limiting population so we started below this number below this M that's a limited population our population cannot outpace that what we're looking for is what's the population in 60 years great no problem so since we had our initial population and a rate of change we were able to plug this and install 4k that's first that happens sometimes doesn't happen all the time if you're not given that that rate of change which you will be given is an initial condition that you used to solve for C after doing your all your integration with a k then you plug in find your seat then you use how the population is varied after say like 3 years or something and then you'd be able to solve for that K so that would come right after this you plug that in and you'd have to solve for K next so we did all that work we use some partial fraction decomposition and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna plug this in that C equals negative 1 we're going to answer our questions so P minus 200 over P equals negative 1 e to the negative T over 50 now I will show you how to solve for 4p right now because if you look at our question we're not asking and really I want you to think about what they're asking you okay so if it asks us something like when will the population equal 175 when will the population be 95 percent of your limiting population so will the world's that mean multiply that number times four point nine five and you would figure out the nine five you figure out 95% of this limiting population is you okay if I'm asked us out find the time when we reach a population even if it's like 95 percent of that number the living population two hundred ninety five percent would be whatever that is I would plug it in right now I wouldn't take the time to solve RP because if I'm trying to find the time when I reach the population plugging the population it's a lot easier then change the sign take an L n divided by negative fifty and you you have it so if you're asked to find the time from a pop to get a certain population don't waste your time solving for P right now let that be a waste of time because you're trying to solve for T that's going backwards in our case we're gonna has to do that we're saying what's the population so we want to solve for population after sixty years that that's an amount of time so we are gonna solve for P but keep that in mind so I think the next example asked how long is it take to get to this certain population we're not gonna be taking a time to solve for T at least not for that reason so let's go ahead let's multiply both sides by ki this is the reason why I wanted this single variable on the denominator because it's a little easier to multiply I just have to multiply by P instead of two terms and then distribute so P minus 200 equals negative PE the negative T over 50 then we're gonna group our peace and our our non P terms that way we can factor P and divide so I'm going to add and add so T plus PE to the negative T over 50 equals positive 200 because we're adding to Leonard we're adding P P to the negative T over 50 we factor our P and we divide and we get that the population at any given time is 200 over 1 plus e to the negative T over 50 home now we can answer the question but I'm gonna ask you something after that so don't just stop when we answer this question answer the question says what's the population in 60 years that's that's very easy because we have T is in years this is in years T is a number plug in 60 we get 200 over 1 plus e to negative sixty fifty it's six bits and if I've done it right it's about a hundred fifty three hundred fifty forty million Wow sorry her 54 whatever these needs are so about 154 well I think I said thousands ten it doesn't really matter what it is but you get about 150 four units of population whatever those units are I hope that makes sense I hope I've explained well enough the interplay between the partial fractions and maybe some good ideas on how to structure them so that you're not dealing with signs and you subs and multiplying and distributing all that stuff hopefully that makes sense to you secondly what I really want to get out of it yes answer the question so okay hey what's the population in sixty years 154 notice how its approaching bat number two but I want you to go further than that I want you to think about it look back right you're back right here true or false an exponential is always positive true or false no matter what that number is is that true Exponential's look like this when you have a negative like you do T is always positive right it's always time exponentially like this they're declining but they have a horizontal asymptote at light at y equals zero so they're never gonna be equal zero they're never gonna even be negative so you're going to get this it's gonna get really close to zero so wait a minute as time goes on this gets really really close this number gets really really close to zero but it's still positive so you have one plus some number this can't be negative so you have one plus something that's getting close to zero the smallest the smallest this denominator can ever be is 1 that means the largest as fraction could ever be as 200 that means your population is limited it has a limiting population of 200 there's no way to get above that it's impossible no matter how far that goes is that not man if that goes further that's just getting closer closer to zero that means your populations getting closer and closer to 200 do you see it do you see how having a model like this with this number positive and first that number right there is your limiting population if you start below it or your carrying capacity if you start above it's it's going to limit to that somehow I hope that makes sense I'm already seeing that right now that this right here is positive and you can never get more than 200 if you started above that you could never get less than 200 the sign will change there but that's about all you get so anyhow I hope that makes sense what we're gonna do now is we're going to talk about two more where we introduced a birth rate and death rate and see how that changes a problem a little bit all right let's start another one so a certain population has a birth rate up now send a little more familiar Oh point zero zero one according to population so it is proportional to the population and a constant death rate Delta all right so there are 100 units at year 2000 and scrolling at eight units per year let's diagnose exactly what's going on so firstly we have a birthrate we have a constant death rate this is giving us birth rate and death rate I hope to remember this but whenever we're given a birth rate death rate we can start our population model population with respect to time would be given by this difference in birth rate minus death rate times the population that's great also if the death rate is constant it shouldn't be based on the population so this should not have a P the birthrate however does so the birthday says hey it's proportion to the population so I'm just kind of getting a feel for it thinking model my thinking here taking all right certain birthrate and a certain population has a birth rate and death rate I'm going to start with this cool can i plug something in for the birth rate yes I'm gonna be doing that so birth rate is point zero zero one p it is based on the population awesome that's gonna go here the death rate is constant it should not have a P in it it's just gonna be a number but I know what it is there are 100 units at year 2000 and what's that mean does that mean that should put P of mm equals 100 the answer is no no this this year is when we started looking at this and so what we're going to do is we're going to say that the population at time zero is 100 it just so happens that time zero was was the year 2000 so what that means is that when we look at how long it took double we're going to get an answer in year say it's 80 years I don't know what's going to be so if it's 80 years then we'd say it's gonna double in the year 2018 so we shouldn't add that on to that so basically we subtract 2000 and then we would get an answer we add the 2,000 back that's that's essentially where we're doing well okay so so we got this we have we know our population laws based on this okay got our birth rate we have our and idea of a death rate we know there are a hundred units at year it's called zero and oh it's growing great what does that mean what's the growing mean well that's that's it that's true that's exactly that means the population is growing that's the rate of change of population with respect to time in years it's growing at eight units per year and it says that that's at the time when we knew our initial population so at the year 2000 or at t equals zero we have a growth rate of eight units of population per year so one time make sure we got it we're looking at it saying birth rate and death rate start here start there with unless they specifically tell you otherwise start there with birth rates and death rates okay what's our birth rate we're gonna plug that in what's our death rate I don't know and leave it there we'll talk about that in a minute there are a hundred units at year 2000 let's call that your zero understanding that our answer at the end is gonna be based on the fact that year 2000 is called your zero year and we're growing at Oh growing growing means the the rate of change of population with respect to time add that same here is a how long it use for year how long does it take to double okay so how long is it taking don't what's that mean are we looking for a population given a time or a time given the population if we start at 100 the double would be 200 I find the time when we reach 200 so what this translates to in write down now time to reach population equal 200 notice what I'm doing what I'm doing is I'm trying to get a real good solid grasp on the problem before I start what I don't do I don't just arbitrarily throw up a formula and try to work with it that's crazy what I'm trying to do is get everything we know about this written down so I know we're based on that formula because it has birth rates and death rates and that's our model for birth rates and death rates according to population change I know that we have a hundred units at the start I know we're growing at so are the derivative of P with respect to time is eight I also know that I'm looking for a time here so what what's the time to reach a population of double or 200 even since we started at 100 now we're gonna start plugging things in so since we're gonna do that let's see let's start with our birth rate we don't know a death rate that's interesting but wait a minute we also don't have a cave well let's see what would that cave in when we looked back at the when we looked at those those equations first I will first start of this video we have that K times P and then parentheses with either P - amber and minus P what that K came from that Kant came from the birth rate death rate idea so somewhere in there is a death rate we'll wait a minute well what if we did this instead of trying to solve for some K - something there could we use this information to solve for the death rate if it's if K is coming from that idea anyway can we solve for a console wait a minute all that's great death rate is constant it's a constant death rate if they're giving you the initial population you can plug in 100 you and they're giving you how the population is respecting change of expected time 8 you can play an 8 you can plug in 100 and 100 and you can solve for the constant death rate that's the constant of it's not really the constant variation here but it is a concept of we can solve for so when they're giving you when they're giving you how something's growing it's a real pretty it's real good indication so you're gonna be using that right at the back to solve for some sort of a constant we're gonna do that right now so since we're going to solve for that concept let's say hey the way the population is changing with respect to time at time 0 is 8 units per year at year 0 so same exact period of time here starting at year 2000 we had a population of 100 we had a death rate that I don't know we're about to find out and the same exact initial population so when we start dividing now let's see that 36.0 let's divide we could do might be a little bit nicer if we just distribute so we don't dig you up eight or 100 what if we just distribute this remember this is one thing term so you don't distribute 3 times 2 times 100 times 0.01 movemove would be point 1 point 1 times 100 minus 100 d'etre but then point 1 times 100 moved twice would be 10 so 8 equals 10 minus 100 times a death rate so let's see if we do if we subtract so he some either subtract 8 add 100 Delta or subtract 10 and then divide by negative honor doesn't matter subtracting 10 we get negative 2 and divided by negative 100 we get 1 over 50 or point 0 2 since we already have a decimal so we get point 0 2 so two levels that we can plug it in let's go ahead and do that we're going to plug in that point 0 2 and then we're going to look at this as a as our nice differential equation so point 0 2 so our population is changing with respect to time according to our model 0.001 population minus 0.02 all times population you know else I might do because you know we're gonna do right we're gonna we're gonna try to get this separable differential equation which it already is but I want to keep my constants on the right hand side that point zero zero one and that point zero two that's really nasty so I'm gonna rewrite it just a little bit because I don't want to have to deal with partial fractions involving those crazy coefficients I don't think you want to do that either so we're going to factor out whatever constant has the smaller number let's set the smaller number so the larger number of digits after the decimal so we're gonna divide and factor out point zero zero one I'm also going to write the P first so dreaming about P with respect to time let's go ahead and let's factor that zero point zero zero one I'll write my P first I'm factoring that out so this P is right here I'm not factoring a Peter I'm factoring just a constant point zero zero one that would give us a P minus 0.02 divided by point zero zero one so to music to 20 oh yeah man this and that that's what's with 20 so when we divide point zero zero two by point zero zero one point zero two by point zero zero one we get 20 so we've all we've done we wrote in this P first we factor two point zero zero one out of that why because now when we have this several difference equation and I hope you see it's real nice we're going to write our P's DP we're gonna write our constant DT that's 1,000 and now we're ready to integrate you see that nice the nicest of that now that we when we factor that one over a thousand it made it real real nice for us to groom bar P over F sorry one over P times P minus twenty now we can integrate you should be do this on your own you really should be integrating saying that's partial fractions I know how to do that now on the right hand side T over a thousand plus C sub one you'll understand that with partial fractions you're going to get natural logarithms so when we do our integral and get that T over one thousand plus C sub one I'm not gonna solve for that C I'm not gonna plug in my initial value I'm gonna wait until I wrap up that as plus and minus e to the constant that's making sense you like yeah I get that you you're doing a great job okay you're really understanding it because you've seen this so many times and now you're you're really flowing with it so great if that's you with partial fractions we go okay well you know what we can write this as a decomposition of two fractions with linear denominators that it gives us constant numerators so if you find a common denominator one equals a times t minus 20 plus B times P that says if you let P equal zero let's see that's zero that's zero negative eight would be 1 over negative 20 if P equals 20 that's zero B would be 1 over 20 and as you see before often times you keep the same constants with this let's go ahead let's rewrite up that integral as 1 over knit well negative 1 over 20 P plus 1 over 20 times P minus 20 so this becomes negative 1 over 20 this becomes 1 over 20 times this denominator and just like before we're gonna factor out that one over 20 now should i factor a negative from here what do you think chef after a negative from that P minus 20 or do I like the P being positive I like the P being positive should i factor out a negative from here and change this to a minus and this to a plus no because I don't like this being 1 over P and having that P go to the denominator right come on my Ellen's are you seeing this makes sense to you so I'm gonna leave this as a minus because I want a single term on the denominator of my natural logarithm that we're about to get I'm gonna leave this as positive because I like to not have to use a use of to change my sign when I do that integral of 1 over t minus 20 so I'm gonna leave them the signs where they are I'm just gonna factor out the 1 over 20 it looks pretty clean but we're about ready to integrate right now so we're going to leave that 1 over 20 so this is 1 over 20 you all know how to take an integral of 1 over P but it is negative so negative Ln absolute value P plus since we don't have a negative coefficient since we just have P minus 20 you have a very trivial u so because that DPD you would be positive 1 you don't even show it you go yeah this is going to be plus Ln absolute value P minus 20 no need to worry about sign that's why we like that equals on the right hand side T over 1,000 plus C sub 1 why see sublime we're about to multiply everything by 20 we're about to group our natural logarithms as Ln of P minus 12 absolute value P minus 20 over P we're about to take both sides to that he is an exponent both sides we're about to wrap up a plus and minus e sea sublime as twenty see someone as a arbitrary constant so we're going to wait we're gonna wait to use our initial value would you really want to plug in that right now and try to solve for C no I I don't I don't I don't know yet so we're gonna wait if you have to if you have an L n wait just a little bit so plug in C as soon as you can but that also means as soon as it's really nice to do so a lot of times its first but if you have natural logarithm you are going to wait so I'm going to group these right up here I'm also going to multiply by 20 so let's let me show that here I'm going to multiply both sides by 20 so we get this let me make sure you guys are following my board work too I'm going to multiply by 20 I'm going to cancel out my 20s on the left hand side I'm going to get this negative Ln absolute value P plus Ln absolute value of P minus 20 on the right hand side we're going to distribute so let's see that's 1 over T or 50 plus 20 C sub 1 net will group them this is really nice we're going to get this Ln of we know that when we subtract logarithms or add logarithms we can make one logarithm with a quotient where they're positive or added logarithms create this argument on the numerator and then the subtracted or negative is on the denominator we're ready for it now when we do that e let's see e and both of these act as exponents on that e exponential function we are going to get let's see on the right hand side this gives us an e to the T over 15 this gives us x e to the 20 C sub 1 the absolute values give us a plus and minus and we get this P minus 20 over P this whole piece right there it's still a constant this is what we define to be our arbitrary constant C so if you're having a right C sub 1 wait to plug in your initial value if you're not if you're not gonna have to change it then right when you integrate you plug in your initial value solve for your seat but if you have an extra logarithm in wait till right here so t minus 20 over P equals arbitrary constant e to the T over 15 and now we can do it so now we say hey you know what our initial population we're going to use that again and if you remember that we sort of do that when we had a sulphur K we use our initial population of salt for arbitrary constant C but then since that was in there we solved for our K after that well we we had to kind of use it twice well we're using it twice here we used it once the software constant death rate that was that point zero two that we got a while back and we're going to use it again to solve our arbitrary constant C so let's put it in so at time zero or the year 2000 we had 100 units of population whatever they were well that means that our population is 100 wintertime is zero this whole thing is 1 so C equals what we get 80 4/5 so when we rewrite this yeah you know what population minus 20 over population is equal to this 4/5 e to the T over 50 so we have set it up we have solved for our constant because they gave a how our populations change of expected time that was what allowed us to do that otherwise that would have an estate and we would have had to have some sort of a change in population after a certain amount of time to solve for that later so had you not had this he would have done all this work with Delta in there and then you would be plugged in your initial condition to solve for your seat right there but there to still be that Delta somewhere and you have to have the way your population is changing after certain amount of time to solve for that and be a little bit more tricky we did that two videos ago that's a little more tricky so now think about the next part of it we've done all this work how long does it take to double your population or what's the time needed to reach P equals 200 what you want to solve for P right now stop asking me that it's asking us all for time so solving the answering the basic question is when what's the time when our P's gonna be 200 fine T when P was 200 you don't need to solve for P right now plug in the two hundred for P and you can easily solve for T so when we do that two hundred and minus 20 over 200 times sorry equals 4/5 either than the T over 50 that's 180 over 200 that's 9/10 if we multiply by 5/4 from both sides its 90s now what you got to yell it if we do Ln on both sides right now so nine eggs and a nice even 50 let me say hey we're solving for T you box you solve for P and that's asking for time to reach certain population plug in right now you save yourself a tremendous amount of work if you're only worrying about solving the question they're asking you which I'm not much more worrying about other things than that but if you're only worried about solving the question they're asking you then do the easiest way possible so yeah I just want to find T when the population is 200 great plug in now solve it all the way down we would have this Ln of 9 8 equals T over 15 if we multiply both sides by 15 our time is 50 times Ln 9/8 I got about see what's his years I get about five point nine years so according to our model it's going to take about five point nine years for us to reach that now am I only concerned about it well not really I mean I'd like to do a little bit more with that so so let's see what if I solve for what if I solve for B remember what I want you thinking of I want you to think of what's gonna happen in the population after after certain amount of time so after time goes on further than this so what about twenty years what about what about that like how what would be happening here so I'm a racist we've answered a question we know the population is gonna double in five point nine years wait a minute what did years that would be 2005-2006 in this case so we started year 2000 and we have a hundred units we're going eight units per year we did this families take a double six years roughly so about 2006 we can expect this population to have doubled and then some now I want to go back in on assault repeating so if you're only interested in something the question you're done okay you're absolutely done I want you thinking further than that so what would happen if we did solve with you let's multiply both sides by P let's group our P terms and our non P terms let's factor our P let's divide there's a little goodness so what is going to happen well think about this look at your denominator and you tell me is this always positive is e to some power always positive sure it is and it should be increasing that since the time is positive we are going to be increasing it's going to be growing four-fifths of that it's still going to be positive but one minus a positive number gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller until it gets well very close to two zero isn't it so one minus a number so one minus some positive number is going to be like okay 0.9 and point maybe point point zero not even point zero zero zero zero zero one how about point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one it's gonna be really close to zero that 20 is gonna start exploding in business so as time goes on we are going to get explosion out of this that's what's gonna happen if we started yeah we're gonna get explosion out of it had we had a negative growth we would have got extinction out of it so on or modern man that wouldn't have changed signs so one Romana right now because we have this positive number and one minus it we're gonna get one minus and small positive numbers but those numbers you can keep increasing increased increasing until get really really really really close to zero 20 does a constant 20 divided by something really really really close to zero it's going to start exploding this will get a population explosion as we keep on going it has to happen that way how we had negative growth we would have got this population decline and where that negative growth would come from is how we started if our initial population would have been above a threshold or below a threshold that would determine that so that we got well it's kind of telling you how this growing but had we got something less than 20 and declining we would have dumped this thing we've just gone straight to zero so anyway I hope that makes sense I hope you're seeing that I hope you're seeing that as four fifths e to the T over 50 approaches 1 our population approaches infinity as this number approaches one so as that gets bigger and bigger and bigger closer to one let's add two approaches zero t over something approaching stairs sorry 20 over something approaching zero is approaching infinity man I hope that makes sense I hope I'm explaining that not not just the answer the questions I'm going way beyond that I want you to see the modeling so I want you to be putting this together with what limits do so you can see what these populations are actually supposed to do in however many years that's going to take figure that out to you yeah we could so as this approaches 1 that would mean that as 4/5 e to the T over 50 it's getting really close to equaling 1 well what would that mean multiply both sides by 5/4 taking Ln of both sides and multiply by 50 then T would be let's see multiply both sides by 5/4 you get 5/4 ln would get rid of that e multiplying by 50 if you put that in your calculator as T approaches that number whatever that is your population is going to approach infinity so as we get closer and closer to whatever number that that one is you're going to get closer and fattie so just doing this off the top of my head here we've got 11 0.16 years so if this goes on unimpeded at the year 2011 point one six after eleven point one six years we are going to get very very close to an infinite population so I hope you've seen the connection on these I hope I'm making it make sense we've got one more to do okay I hope you're still with me I hope you still have your attention I hope that you're following these these examples because this is the last time I can make some connections for you between the last four videos that we've done so we're gonna do one more it's quite similar we'll talk about how this is going to be a doomsday or explosion situation we'll talk about I'll make a connection between why the formula gave you the very beginning the video and this one makes sense and that this is going to model that so we certain population has a birthrate that's proportional to population and a constant death rate but it's giving it to you there are 200 units a year 2100 and growing at 2 units per year when does doomsday occur so it's telling you this is going to have a population explosion let's see why in order to start this I'm gonna go quite quickly through it this is just something that I want to make a connection to so if you can do yourself this great how do we start this assay we need a birth rate and death rate oh right we're given something regarding that so the way our populations change with respect to time is going to be based on this difference between birth rate and death rate times a population but we know a couple other things about it they said our birth rate is proportional to our population it didn't give us the rate of portion ality it didn't give us our constant of variation but it said it is proportional so we have a constant of variation times our p we also know that our death rate is constant and saying that we're dying at a point zero one units of population per sorry point zero one deaths per unit of population per unit of time at our time is in years let's say this is in thousands of units of population so we had 200,000 things at year 2100 and we're going at 2,000 per year so we'd have point zero one thousand deaths per thousand people per year or units of whatever this is we also know that at time zero which is twenty one hundred we had 200 units and we were off this is awesome we were growing at two units per years so this would be 200 growing it I guess I don't need it up here to 200 units of time zero that were growing at two units per year hope this all makes sense to you that we have a birth minutes proportion we talk about that we have a death ray this constant great we can plug in it we have two units at the start beating those 21 interviews in time of zero we're growing at that's a derivative with respect to time at time zero so same time of two units per year let's plug this in and see what we can do so since we have this birth rate that is proportional to the population and a depth ring that is constant we can make some substitutions but more than that let me ask you are we going to be able to solve for K right now number K is just a constant just like we saw for our Delta last time okay is it constant can we do it well are you given an initial population sure are you given the way the population has changing with respect to time at that initial time if the answer is yes you plug it in now if answer's no then what would happen is that you'd be given this what the population is after a certain amount of time if you're not given this rate of change then you solve this the way it is all the way down you solve your arbitrary constant using the initial condition and then you use how your population varied after certain amount of time those two videos ago that we did those problems right now we're given that rate or given this population so we can plug that in this is we're growing at two units at time zero when our population was 200 at time zero let's see / that that's 1 over 100 to Burger King well that's 1 over 100 so if I add that that's gonna be 2 over 100 so 200 or 150 and if we divide by 200 three four zeros k is 1 over 10,000 yeah yeah that right what's that say what mmm that means that we can plug in this 110,000 right there that's exact we're gonna do that's all we did remember that using your initial condition solves for arbitrary constant we're gonna do that yet to come but it also is incorporated along with how your populations changing either direct derivative to plug it in or a high in population exchange understood amount of time we use that later so somehow we're gonna use that away the population is changing sulfur artery constant in conjunction with the initial population let's plug that in right there so we have this 1 over 10,000 - you can write it as 1 over 100 if you want to you doesn't really matter wonderful 100 times P much like the last example I had those in decimals last time but right now I have them in interactions doesn't matter what we're gonna do is do a little bit of rewriting you see right now that's separable it's a several different differential equation we are about to group our peas DP and are constants DT but these constants are really nasty of work within partial fractions so we are going to factor that out we're gonna factor out the one that is smaller so we're factor out the smaller number one over 10,000 is smaller than 1/100 so we're gonna factor that and we're going to right RP first so we're gonna have something that looks like that or writing RP first we're gonna factor out one over 10,000 well that's gonna leave us with in here is P so factoring out from right here one over 10,000 leave us a P first - let's see 1 over 100 divided by 1 over 10,000 so that's a complex fraction multiplied by the reciprocal you're gonna get what's a good no pause here's where I get to make the connection we have just written this in certain form so you can see something I want you to to backtrack hopefully took notes on it any at the very very beginning I give you one of two things I give you either this one of them is a limited population somehow you're gonna reach that if the P is less than M you'll get to M eventually if P is greater than M you'll get two and eventually it's somehow you're gonna get there here and this called your threshold if P is above your M you're gonna explode if P is below your M you're gonna sink you go extinct this right now look at this here's your 100 years our M that 100 is a threshold if we had a population below that we would be declining forever to 0 if we have a population above that we're going to be exploded let's look at our population it says that we started with 200 units if we start with 200 units that's above 100 this is going to have a positive growth and it's going to become explosion and you're going to get some sort of a doomsday scenario where you explode the population no more room no more food that's what I wanted you to see I want to see the connection between setting the stuff with birth rates and death rates and what we get is modeled by one of these two things here so logistic and then explosion extinction so when we get this P minus some sort of a threshold number if we start above that number you are going to go extinct that's right well you're gonna go to an explosion if you start below that you're going to go to an extinction event anyhow let's work this out and see that that actually plays out for us now that we've written this a lot better let's group our P's DP I'd really like for you to do this on your own do your integration do your partial fractions over here on the left hand side and see what you get out of it you pause the video or something since we have these two linear factors that's going to create two fractions factors equal fractions and partial fraction decomposition linear denominators constant numerators we're gonna find a common denominator we're gonna say what if P was zero home if P was zero gone it would be negative 1 over 100 if P is 100 gone B would be 1 over 100 and we see everything the same thing several times now so we're going to rewrite our our fractions as negative 1 over 100 P plus 1 over 100 but P minus 100 and this is perfect man so exactly the one I'm gonna factor out the 1 over 100 of course because that's that common coefficient that we can factor out but I like how this is a minus sign notice that minus sign I have a single term plus sign I have two terms that P is positive I'm not gonna have to you have a you so with a negative in there this is exactly how I want it so let's factor out that negative 1 or what I started that positive 100 not negative and then we'll go ahead and integrate you know we said look not with so big it's y'all crunchy over there if we integrate we're gonna still have this one over 100 but we're going to get negative Ln X of 90 people plus Ln absolute value B minus 1 I'm reelin equals t over 10,000 plus C but I need to see someone for hopefully an obvious reason right now let's multiply everything by 100 that's going to clear out this fraction I'll be grouping these two melons together with a less single logarithm with a quotient inside that denominator on the right hand side will also be multiplied by 100 so we're gonna get this Ln absolute value P minus 1 I'm a positive or plus on the table over P negative or minus on the bottom of equals x 100 let's see typically two users as T over 100 plus 100 C sub 1 now we're ready to have those as an exponent its this P minus 100 over P gives us this plus or minus e to the 100 C sub 1 times e to the T over 100 that looks really good this whole thing we're going to call that C just our arbitrary constants so P minus 100 over P equals arbitrary constant times e to the T one better what do you use to get rid of an arbitrary constant well you're just rebelling so we're gonna plug that in right now so as soon as you can you can't really do it right here not easily so as soon as you can with logarithms means when you get rid of all rules and now we plug that and we say hey at the beginning of this scenario at 2001 or twenty one one year 2100 you had hasn't happened yet unless you're watching this video wait after I made it she's awesome see but at the Year Zero here you had 200 units so P of 0 is 200 you brought that down right there as well so P of 0 that's 200 so 200 minus 100 over 200 equals C times 1 because 0 over 100 is 0 e to the 0 is 1 so we're gonna get 100 over 200 it's 1/2 C is 1/2 very close let's erase some stuff and finish it up so coming back here since we solve for our seat we now know that P minus 100 over B equals 1/2 e to the T over 100 we're going to multiply by B we're going to group our P terms and group our non key terms and office decided to factor out the P and then we're going to divide so multiplying by P grouping our P terms and our non P terms factoring that P and dividing and knows what it does tells us right up top that right there is your threshold start above that you're going to increase forever start below that you're gonna decrease forever on the denominator when does our doomsday event happen at what time would this start getting read or would this become really really really close to infinity this whole population becomes close to infinity when this becomes close to zero so as 1 minus 1 over 2 e to the T over 100 approaches zero our population is going to approach infinity having to solve something like this set it equal to what you're trying to approach so 1 minus 1/2 e to the T over 100 8.0 add to both sides multiplied by 2 to see the logarithm multiplied by 100 and let's think about it as t approaches this number this whole thing is going to approach zero isn't it so as T approaches and when I did this already about sixty nine point three years as T approaches sixty nine years what's going to happen as T approaches sixty nine this old piece is going to approach one this whole piece is gonna approach it to zero one that one hundred divided by something that's approaching zero is approaching infinity as T approaches sixty nine years our population is going to approach infinity it's going to start the absolutely exploding does that make sense to do you get it are you seeing the math involved and understand the limit idea understanding that this is a man is so valuable it's really neat to be able to model populations like this and say hey what's gonna happen in the future are we going to go dooms there we're gonna go extinct there we're going to have a carrying capacity or limiting population and we can judge it all by the form of our function after we get after you know differential equations set up it really is modeled by that M minus P or P minus m it shows us exactly what's going to happen so I hope I've made those connections for you in the last four videos what we're going to do in the future is we're gonna talk about how harvesting and planting like stocking populations can affect our population grow so they'll be kinda interesting we're we're quite close to being done with it we'll move on to acceleration and velocity a little bit then we're gonna start talking about many years linear systems and things so a little bit back to probably what you're used to so anyway I hope you've enjoyed this so far and see some applications I'm really I'm trying to make you see that this stuff is not useless this is not just some garbage that we put on the board this is actually applicable to a lot of real life stuff so hopefully I'm making those connections are you enjoying it I hope you've enjoyed the videos I will see you for the next video when we talked a little bit more about populations of equilibrium stability stability fun holes and spouts things like that how harvesting and stalking can affected but I'll see you have a wonderful day and see you soon you 

Transcript for: Equilibrium Solutions and Stability of Differential Equations (Differential Equations 36)
hey welcome to another video I hope that you are ready to start wrapping up this stuff about population modeling because we only have about three more videos this one and two more and then we're going to move on to acceleration and some oscillation type problems so in order to wrap this up we're going to talk about how you know when something is going to go to a number as far as a population or explode and so we're going to talk about something called equilibrium Solutions we'll talk about critical points we'll talk about stability funnels spouts and then we'll move on and talk about harvesting and and stocking populations in another video so today's video I really want to get the point across to as as to how you would know when our population is going to explode or go to a number when you're not based on something like the logistic equation or an explosion Extinction model when we're not we can't immediately see that and so we're going to discuss that in this video today so let's get right to it let's look at a differential equation like uh the derivative of s x with respect to time is x - 4 now here's the premise to this question what if your initial let's say this is a population of X so maybe X is our population with respect to time what if your initial population or your initial x value was was four well what would what would that do because if you plug in a four right there four - 4 is is zero wait a second if 4 - 4 is z that means that the way you're X changes with respect to time would be zero there would be zero change that's the the the way that our population would be changed with respective time wouldn't change our population of X or whatever X is would not be changing in in general if our derivative with respect of time is zero then obviously nothing would change here the rate of change is zero nothing's changing when that happens so when you have this value this point like four in this case or whatever is making your derivative zero just like in calculus one we call that a critical point do you remember that when you took a first derivative and you set it equal to zero and you said he where this where the slope changes from positive to negative we we have this horizontal tangent you go the slope is zero when the first derivative is equal to zero we have what's called a critical point and lots of important things happen at critical points same thing here if we have a a model the way that something change with respect to time and if this equals z at any point we gain what's called a critical point we have a critical point here so in specifically xal 4 is called a critical point often times we'll also hear it called an equilibrium solution and why that is if you have an initial value of four so X Sub 0 equals 4 and you plug that in here you can't possibly get a change from your population if we're going to call this population or your X function if you want to call it that there will be no change it will stay the same forever and ever and ever and ever so if we start exactly at four there's going to hold this equilibrium nothing will change from that you can't gain you can't lose it's going to be at a no change a zero sum sort of an equation so one one time just to recap this one with our differential equations I'm trying to teach you when we will stay at the same level when we will explode when we will go to a carrying capacity or vice versa become extinct or come to a eliminate population or when we're going to stay the same I'm I'm going to talk about that to start there anytime your derivative is zero you have what's called a critical point we know that from calculus one here what that's going to mean is that if you start at that critical point exactly then you would have a change in your population whatever your function is of zero your rate of change is zero it cannot change that solution of the critical point is often times called an equilibrium solution because you are at equilibrium nothing's gaining nothing's losing so an equilibrium solution so how do we find them just like in calculus one it's a very simple idea because your dxdt is a derivative that's fantastic this is a derivative so if our DX DT our derivative of x with respect to time is some function of X which that's what we have here if that's some function of X then where your derivative equals zero man see this where your derivative this is the derivative where your derivative is equal zero it's going to give you these critical points so running through this if you want to find critical points all you got to do is set your function equal to zero because that function is the derivative here and critical points are found by setting your first derivative equal to zero so we're going to set our first derivative our function of X which is our differential equation we're going to set it equal to zero that's going to give us critical points so let's consider a critical point like xal c a critical point we just went through it but if x sub Z if your initial X is the critical point itself we call that an equilibrium solution nothing's going to change our derivative would be zero you can't gain you can't lose we are horizontal right there so this would be an equilibrium solution yeah I suppose that's not all that exciting it kind of makes sense right so if you if you got a derivative of x with respect to time and and you know that's your derivative your first derivative of some function and you say hey uh I plug in some number that's going to make it zero obviously we're not changing from that that's that's not a a a hugely surprising thing we're going to stay at the same level forever because the Der of zero says we can't increase we can't decrease our population stays the same or whatever your function of X is stays the same forever the interesting things happen when your initial condition is above or below that critical point so let's talk about what happen if our initial condition is greater than C or less than C some interesting things are going to happen so wait wait a second if our initial condition is greater than C then really only two things could possibly happen now I'm not talking specifically about this one differential equation but in general here's what could happen if we start here's our here's our critical point if we start above that then only two things could happen either we explode forever or we shrink to C if we start below that c we either gain to C or we become extinct or go to some lower critical point so we're either getting two or away from that that critical point that should kind of make sense there's only two ways to go if you got a critical point you start at it you're not going to change because your derivative would be zero it's an equilibrium solution if we start above it we will either explode or we will shrink to C if you start below it you're either going to gain to C or you're going to fall or go away from C if you want to kind of spout out of that or drop to a lower critical point or go extinct so if we have a initial condition greater than C we will either explode or Shrink to that c what if it's less than C well we can either gain to C or we can become extinct if this is the only critical point these are the only outcomes so just to make sure we got that derivatives mean rate of change obviously so if we set our first derivative equal to zero we have what a call critical points and if we have an initial condition that is that critical point nothing's going to change slope would be zero function can't change you have an equilibrium solution the interesting thing happens when our initial condition is above or below that critical point if we're above we're either going to become extinct or Shrink to that critical point if we're below we're either going to gain to that critical point or become extinct question is how which one's which and what's beautiful about this because that's a first DED because it represents the rate of change we can do the first derivative test or a sign analysis test or just look what the slope is doing and it will tell us exactly what's happening around those critical points so if our first derivative is this function that we're talking about so this is a derivative I know looks a little different than the first derivative test from calcul this one because there's no Prime but keep in mind this is the first derivative of some function x what we're going to do is we're going to Simply put our critical points on a number line and do sort of a modified sign analysis test so we'll look at this and just plug in a number plug in something greater than C and see what your function is doing see what your first derivative is doing and there's really four cases so sign analysis test first derivative test whatever it is there's really only four cases if we plug in a number greater than C and we get a negative and we plug in a number less than C to our first driven right here and we get a positive what's happening is that our function would be decreasing if we have an initial condition greater than C it will be decreasing but but if we have an initial condition less than C our function would be increasing right there we have what is called a stable critical point what that means is that around that critical point in the neighborhood around that that you would have numbers whether you're less than or greater than you're going to ultimately go to that critical point that's called stability or that's a a stable critical point so if we start above it it's going to drop to it if we start below it it's going to gain to it this is what we call stable and how would it look I'm going to draw that right here how would St table look if we have an initial condition less than our critical point so down here somewhere this says that we would be gaining so we'd say okay so you're testing this you're you're looking your first derivative you found your critical points you have them on some sort of a sign analysis or number line plug in a number less than that and you get a positive plug in a number less than that and you get a positive wait a minute positive positive slope the function is increasing we would get something that looks like this well wait a minute if you plug in something higher you have a negative negative means negative slope means your function is decreasing we would get something that looks like this soor it's kind of messy but we have this kind of convergence both of our our sides here so we have a a stable critical point if we have both whether we're positive or negative above or below that critical point we end up getting to it like an ASM toote right there what you call that is a funnel so everything's funneling to that number of C that's what stable means that's what the picture would look like so what are the other options well uh what if you had this critical point and you plug in a number greater than that and you get a positive so that means me that let's see if we plug a number greater than our critical point we got a positive that that means increasing so positive slope means increasing U that would be a function going away from that critical point gaining away from it remember you're above it and you're increasing or what if we plugged in a number less than our critical point to our first derivative and we got we got a negative well that would be decreasing that's away from that critical point that situ situation right there is called unstable an unstable critical point is where your function tends to go away from that number it's like it's fleeing the scene all right this is like gravity this is like I'm the stable means I'm going to I'm going to go right to it no matter what unstable means I'm going to go away from it no matter what and you can see it right here if you have a if you got some number that's starting above your C and you find out that the first deriva is positive that means that you are increasing now you're going to gain away from that number you're going to get something something that looks like this or below so if we have something that's negative we plug in a number less than our critical point in first Der we get something negative then for every initial condition less than that critical point we would have a negative slope negative slope means function is decreasing so I'm starting here and it's decreasing that's going to look like this that is what we call an unstable critical point and a lot of people refer to that as a spout so spout says I'm going away from it kind of U going out from funnel means going into spout means going out from this particular critical point I hope this is making sense I hope that you're seeing the relationship I hope made it very clear that what an equilibrium solution really means is that your slope's not changing if your slope's not CH if your slope is zero um if your slope is zero that means your function can't change if your slope is positive your function is increasing if your slope is negative your function is decreasing and then compared to our critical point how that interacts how your slope interacts around your critical point will tell you whether you have what's called a stable critical point or a funnel or unstable critical point or a spell going to or going away from that critical point in a neighborhood around it the other two conditions are called semi-stable and let's take a look at it for a second what if you plug in a number greater than your C and you get a plus and you plug in a number less than you see and you get a plus oh wait a minute what's that mean what's that mean uh slope would be positive so we would be increasing slope would be positive so it' be increasing that seems really weird this is called a semi-stable critical point because if we start below our C initial condition below C we're going to have a posi so we will be increasing we're going to get to that c eventually so we're going to look like this so it looks something like that but if we're above that c we're going to be also increasing so it's kind of a a a half funnel for those values below and a half spout for those values above this would be increasing still so we start above C we have a positive slope that'd be increasing still we'd get something that looks like this and so we have this below C you'd get to it above C you'd leave it that's called semi-stable likewise what if you plugged in a value above C and Below C got negative that means that we'd have a negative so that means our function be decreasing in both of these cases well it's still semi-stable but it look a little bit different for those values above C you'd have a negative slope the function would decrease but it would decrease until you get to C so it's going to look like this that middle one's a little funky sorry so it's going to decrease until you get there but if you have something below C some initial condition below that critical point you're still decreasing the function still dropping so you'd have this same sort of idea where you have a a sort of a both a funnel and spout in the same idea for those values initial condition starting above C you'd be dropping to it for those below C you'd be going to Extinction now I do want to say one thing about this this is for only one critical point so in the future when we have one or two or three critical points which we're going to see at some points you could have another critical point up here in which case this would gain and then get to it so around this one critical point we talk about whether we're leaving it or getting to it that's sort of the idea here so I'm only showing you one critical point but keep in mind if I've got another one I could leave from one critical point and drop to another that's perfectly acceptable or but it is my lowest critical point if I leave it if if I'm below it and I leave it if I spout out of it I'd be going to Extinction if I have my highest critical point and I leave it I'm going to be going to explosion I hope that makes sense I hope I've made it very clear um the interplay between critical points and this funnel spout the stable unstable and semi-stable cases these are both called semi-stable what I'm going to do now is I'm going to come back up here and we're just going to walk through this I'm going to leave this on the board we're going to see what case this actually is so what we talked about so far is that a first derivative is a slope when you set a first derivative equal to zero you get critical points and now we're using this in terms of our population or our modeling situations to say what's the graph going to do around there if that's a differential equation what would the function look like well it would depend on our initial condition and that's exactly what we're saying if our initial condition is four we have just this equilibrium solution if our initial condition is above my critical point I'm going to be in SE one of several cases I'm either going to drop to it or leave it leave it or drop to it depending on what my first dtive is actually doing same thing for our initial conditions less than C so we're looking at this saying it is a first derivative but since I don't know my parent function I'm kind of guessing at what it's going to look like and it's based on our initial condition what it's actually going to do hope this makes sense I'm going to come back up here and show you what this does okay so here we go now number one we'd say this right here is a differential equation it means a first derivative so if x - 4 = 0 then that's going to say our slope is zero that's called a critical point so we're going to say that x = 4 is our critical point what we do after that is we do what's called a sign analysis test or you can hear a phase diagram or a first derivative test all the same thing we're going to say our function r f ofx which is x - 4 right now is creating for us some sort of a a phase diagram based on a critical point of four so we just take our four you put on a number line and then we're going to plug in just like every first R test ever a number greater than four and a number less than four and see what our sign is I've given you a very simple case we'll deal with some much more advanced cases in this video but let's plug in a number like five if I plug in five to my first derivative remember our function is x - 4 I'm going to get a positive now I don't care that it's going to be one I care that it's positive so this would be a positive slope it says that we are increasing now now get this the slope is positive slope is not increasing the slope is linear you can see that the slope is just linear x - 4 here's what this says it says that because the slope is positive if I give it an initial condition greater than four my slope will be positive that family of Curves would be a family of Curves where all the slopes would be positive that means that the family of Curves all of them would be an increasing function again because this represents the slope I'm finding critical points if I plug in a number greater than that four it's that initial condition is more than four it's going to create for me positive slopes on a f or give me a family of curve that all has positive slopes and this this is coming from a family of Curves with positive slopes positive slopes means a family of Curves each one of which would be increasing just like this so five is more than four five is more than a critical point we are getting a family curves with positive slopes on that condition all of which would be increasing now plug in something like three or zero that'd be fine too 3 - 4 is NE 1 I don't care about the on so much I care that it's negative so so think about that if I give myself an initial condition of three or something less than my critical point like 3 2 1 Zer whatever that means that I'm getting a family of Curves here all of whom would have negative slopes that would be all decreasing all of these will be tracking away from that four think in your head is that stable or unstable we're going away from it it's it's spouting water it's going to get away from me this should be unstable in fact it's going to look like this that's exactly what we just said here you have a critical point C it's going to look like this at xal 4 if we start above it we are exploding if we start below it we are extincting if we start at it we stay the same there's no other critical point so so get this like this is the only critical point right it's the only place where our slope could equal zero that's it so if we start above that we are going to get a population explosion if this model's population or function explosion if we start below that we're going to get a population Extinction or function Extinction it's going to go to zero this has to make sense right now I hope I hope you've seen it are you seeing the stability versus instability or unstability um of this we we're using first we using the idea of slope we're saying positive means increasing negative means decreasing and showing where that is in relation to our critical point to determine whether we have a spout or a funnel stable versus unstable now can we go a little bit further and actually solve the differential equation well of course we can we're going to see why this is the way it is based on our differential equation so because we have some separable a separable equation here and we get our X's DXs and our constants DT and take this integral and exponent on both sides we've done this so many times I'm going qu kind of quick here and this whole thing is C and if we replace that with c replace that with with t do you remember this hope you remember as soon as you get that arbitrary constant especially when we have Ln now we're going to plug in an initial condition you go what do you mean an initial condition well let's just say that at X of Z you have some sort of an initial condition just use that use the x sub Z so that x sub Z is happening at time Z okay so e to the 0 power is 1 this C would equal x Sub 0 - 4 and if we plug that in so we have this x - 4 = x0 - 4 e t and just add our four and take a look at what this would do depending on what our initial I hope I didn't go too fast by the way this is just a separable difference of equation we're saying our initial condition is x sub 0 so when we solve for our C we have X Sub 0 when T is0 then C is x sub 0- 4 we've taken this plugged it in right there it's right there and we' just added four but look at what happens look how this is a vertical shift of four that means everything happens around that four this right here is this number so it's shifted up four units from the from x equals so from y equals z so four actually x equals z from four units up now take a look at this right here look what would happen if x sub Z is more than four if x0 is more than four you have a positive number a positive number times the exponential man e to the T it's the same exponential you know so if this is more than four you have a positive exponential it's going to grow that's exactly what that says it says uh you start at four and then add a function to it that is growing that is this now what if this is less than four if this number your initial condition is less than four then something less minus 4 would be something less than four minus 4 would be negative so you you start at four and say you'd subtra oh my gosh wait a minute e t that that would look like this CU it's a reflection across the um the yal Z line so x-axis so if this is negative remember e to the T some sort of negative e to the T it's not a dropping like this it's a reflection of your exponential so instead of climbing you'd reflect it youd be dropping that's what these say if your initial condition is less than four you have a negative exponential so go up to four and then do a negative exponential that's why this looks the way that it does this is just a really nice way to see it so like when we go through our next set of examples in the next video what's going to happen is I'm going to do a lot of them just by finding my critical points and making these graphs it's very nice for a few of them we're going to go all the way down and solve our differential equation and say do you see why this is do you see that that four is this critical point do you see that depending on depending on what your initial condition is we get a positive exponential if it's above four a positive exponential if it's below four a negative exponential it's going to spout away from that that's an unstable critical point this right now should be making a lot of sense to you I hope I've explain it well enough um obviously I think it's really cool so it's it's very interesting to me um that this stuff works and that you do your differential equation and models exactly what we saw with our first R of test so we're going to come back we're going to do one more example all the way through I'll explain the same things and then we'll be done all right so one more we're going to work our way through it I'm going to try not to go too fast to make sure that we we really really understand this but next time we're going to do a lot of examples too so right now I just need the overview of what's going to happen to be there we're going to get stability or unstability an unstable critical point um for each of these cases sometimes we can get semi we'll see that in next video how that looks but um what needs to be there right now is what how the first derivative differential equation is the first Der first order differential equation how that relates to increas and decreasing depending on your initial condition that is what is key is is that you understand that because we don't have the actual function X we have the derivative of that function that when we go back to it we're getting a family of Curves and that family of Curves is dependent on what our initial condition actually is that arbitrary constant it's so arbitrary if you have an initial condition is it because you solve for that and it says oh this is giving me a specific curve and where that specific curve is and how it behaves depends on that initial condition of X that's a big deal and we're seeing that in the course of our our graphing here we're seeing how that initial condition drastically changes what happens so let's go through it um we're noticing we got a first derivative differential equation SP of time and we have x 3 - x and we say well wait a minute so if we've got 3 - X and that's equal to the first derivative of our function then this itself that's a derivative and so we say we can find critical points all the time by setting our derivative equal to zero and solving so we have a critical point very easily of xal 3 now now get this not always if you're above the critical point do you gain you can't say that and so I I wanted to make that clear when I first introduced this concept in the first like 10 15 minutes but I really can't do it by looking at x - 4 because if we were above that we were gaining below that we were decreasing and you saw that on the first derivative but in general you can't make that statement you can't say every time I'm above a critical point I'm gaining that's not true because if I plug in a number like four I'm going to get a negative slope I'm decreasing that's that's why I said at the beginning that where our critical point is if you start above it you can either increase or Shrink to that critical point you start below it you can either increase to it or go away from that critical point it all depends on how your first derivative behaves that's why we have to do the S analysis test we can't just arbitrarily say oh you're above it you're going to climb forever that's not true right now we're sort of putting together the log the logistic with the EXP explosion Extinction ideas in a more general term here so when we look at this they go uh yeah our critical point is three let's go ahead take the time and do a first derivative test so our function is 3 - x we've got a critical point of three all that needs to happen right now since we do not have our function itself we just need to understand what our slope of our function is doing this is the slope of our function so if we start with a value greater than three like four 3 - 4 so our function here it's 3 - x if we start with four we're going to get we are understanding that for every value above three without exception there's only one critical point there's only one possible point where the sign of our function can change it's three every value of above that three is going to have a negative slope every single value initial condition above that is going to give you a family of Curves with negative slopes every Curve will have a negative slope every Curve will be decreasing get that I'm going say it again it's so important that there's only one critical point here there's only one number where our slope is going to change signs and that number is three every in every single initial condition greater than three is going to give you a curve remember this is a SL of a curve every initial condition greater than three is going to give you a curve that has a negative slope that means every single initial greater than three is going to give you a curve that is decreasing these are all going to be decreasing now do the same thing with a number less than your critical point like two or one or zero it doesn't really matter plug in two 3 - 2 is postive 1 so this is your slope all right this is your your slope it's not your function it's telling you that your initial condition is the the function you get is dependent on your initial condition so if I plug in a number less than three if I have an initial condition less than three what's that's saying is that that whole family of Curves every single initial condition less than three is going to give me a function whose slope this is slope is positive whose function is increasing that right there is giving us what's called called a stable critical point it is going to look just like this this is how this is going to look we're going to have some sort of a graph where the family of Curves depends on what your initial condition is if we have an initial condition that's greater than three we are going to get functions that are decreasing if we have initial conditions less than this we're going to get functions that are increasing we're going to get what's called a funnel things no matter where we start we're going to funnel into something near that one number as time goes on do you see it am I explaining well enough the interplay between the first derivative test what critical points are from like I don't know how many semesters ago that was um in into what your family of Curves has to be doing and the fact that it's based on your initial condition that's huge because in Cal one you sort of U sort of go backwards don't you you have a function and you take a derivative and then you say oh the function is doing this well here we're saying I have the derivative of the function what could the function be doing oh well that's that's a that's a different question what that means is that I'm doing my my first derivative test but I'm using it to model my function not the other way around not to to kind of gain my function not saying this is how the function looks but this is all the possible functions we would we would ever get and more than that it depends on where I start so if I'm starting above in this particular case I'm getting a family of curves that is all decreasing for every initial condition greater than three for every initial condition less than three I'm getting family curves all of whom are increasing and we put that together we have this final idea let's see how that plays out when we actually do our um our solving of our differential equation so You' seen me do a few different techniques and and give you a lot of different options over the last two three videos on how you structure these I've done things like factored out negatives when appropriate I've left them in there I've tried to give you a variety of ways to do it that way at least one of them are will stick in this case I'm I'm pulling out that negative and the reason why we we do that it's not super important I think I mentioned that many times is because when you start taking integrals I don't want you to take an integral of this and accidentally give me this oops because that's a problem you need a u sub and you'd get a negative so the reason why you'll see me do things like factor out a negative when it doesn't appear like it actually need to is just for that reason so in our case we have this Ln absolute value xus 3 we've got - t + C sub 1 we have an Ln we're going to wait to plug in our initial condition until we take that both sides as a exponent exponent on E we have x - 3 = this plus or minus E to the C sub 1 * e t we've done this many many times this right here is our constant but we also know that constants are always our arbitary constants are always found by an initial condition so what is our initial condition well we don't have a specific one remember what we're doing we're trying to be General we're trying to show the picture of our curves depending on our initial condition so when you get done with this you should be able to plug in any number and say hey for numbers greater than this number I'm going to explode or Shrink two for numbers less than number I'm going to well maybe come extinct or um gain two whatever that number is so we're going to use this initial condition to create a model of our general solution here whatever our initial condition happens to be let's plug it in when I plug in t = 0 I get X Sub 0 that gives us one so our c is x sub 0us 3 now when when we substitute that back in right here that's an x - 3 = x Sub 0 - 3 e to the T I'm going to take just a side step for a moment and I'm going to tell you on some of the harder examples that we're going to cover sometimes I will solve for C right now I'll I'll hold this off to the side but I'll leave the C in here and I'll solve this for x and then I'll plug the C back in because doing this on much more advanced examples can get really really really messy and so you'll see me go okay plug in plug in your initial condition now leave your seat just remember what that is solve for x and then plug in your c letter otherwise especially with fractions it gets it gets pretty crazy so I'm going to show you some of those techniques in the next video as well man we're almost done we're quite there so we have noticed that's a that's a slope this is the slope of every single function of x that whole family of Curves and we have determined that what that slope is the sign of that slope depends on a critical point where that slope equals zero is where your signs could change things above zero are positive below zero are negative so that critical point is is critical it tells us where our slope is positive and therefore increasing or negative and therefore decreasing and so what we've determined because that slope because that represents the slopes of every General the general solution or every family of curves that would have this as a slope we're saying saying that everything above that value of three is going to give us a family of curves that is decreasing every every value or sorry every initial condition less than three is going to give us a family of Curves who are increasing so we have a picture like this now let's make sure that what we've solved on our differential equation actually models this so we have the slope of the function right here guys this is the function this is every possible function that would have this as a slope this is your general solution solution and it's based on whatever your initial condition is now let's look that three hey that's a vertical shift that says that I'm going to have some important stuff happening at that horizontal ASM toote that equilibrium solution of xal 3 that's important if my initial condition is three I get a horizontal line now what if my initial condition is more than three more than three well three something more than 3 minus 3 would be positive but this is an exponential with a negative expon that looks like this those are droppies remember that e t looks like that wait that that's what this looks like so if I have an initial condition greater than three I will get positive positive decaying exponential just like it shows if I have something less than three I would get let's see again something less than three minus three that would be a negative a negative decaying exponential so a decaying exponential flipped over so wait a minute if I take a negative so remember this is negative negatives reflect about the xais it would look like this this would be e to the t e to the that's negative e to the t e to T is a decaying exponential e to the t almost looks like a logarithm here but it's not but it's a reflected decaying exponential it says that you're just taking this and flipping it over that's all it says it says that you're going to be looking just like this for every value starting less than three that's what this means this would be a stable critical point this is called a funnel it's exactly what we get right here which I I prised the last two I'm going to do in another video so when we get there um right now I I really would encourage you to go back through and try these two on your own they take maybe five minutes once you understand it it's not that that hard my job today was to explain to how the interplay the how this is slope and therefore represents a slope of some parent function some general equation some general solution and to show you that depending on your initial condition you're going to get a different type of curve something increases or decreases depending on what your initial condition is so I hope I've done a good job of that I hope I've explained and you should understand what U man it sounded like a lot when I first introduced it you should understand now what an equilibrium solution is something that makes your slope zero it's also called a critical point you should understand that depending on whether we are greater than or less than that critical point determines whether we have an unstable leaving or stable coming to that critical point or both leaving and coming to or coming to and leaving stable unstable and semi-stable cases so we've talked about equilibrium Solutions we've talked about stable versus unstable we've talked about funnels and spouts and I hope that I've shown you the interplay on how the differential equations actually show that but could you imagine could you imagine not actually doing this getting all the way down it's wouldn't it be hard for you to see that it would be hard for me to see that this looks exactly like that without this first so this is really important your first derivative test is huge it shows you what's actually going on around those critical points then your differential equation says oh yeah now that I know what that picture is I'm able to kind of see it so I hope that makes sense because this is what we're going to do for the last three examples in the next video I'm just going to show you the pictures of them because we'll have a very good interpretation of what's going on so I will see you for the next video when we talk about a few more examples and and kind of refresh around stability and unstability being stable and unstable spouse funnels and we'll talk about semi-stable have a great day I'll see you for that 

Transcript for: Stability of Critical Points (Differential Equations 37)
hi welcome to another video in this video we're going to explore stability of critical points a little bit more in depth we'll deal with some part of problems we'll talk about how in the world you can have a spout and a funnel in the same problem so we're going to take a look at four examples first going all the way through we'll start with critical points we'll talk about whether they're stable or unstable how that should look on a graph and then we'll go ahead and solve the differential equation behind it and try to see that they make the same exact graph after that we'll deal with three examples where we just take a look at the the first derivative test or kind of sign analysis test for this differential equation as far as the critical points concern and just go straight through the graph just to get a real clear picture what these things are doing so let's start with the first example we have a differential equation DX DT where X is our dependent variable t is our independent variable x squared minus 4x and what we learned in the last video was that when we're talking about a difference of equation that right there is a first-order differential equation or a first derivative which means that that's a first derivative so if we ever want to find critical points just like calculus one all we've got to do is take this function which is the first derivative of some higher function and do the first derivative test on that function itself so if we're looking for critical points all we've got to do is say hey our function here is x squared minus 4x and if we set that equal to zero we're gonna find critical points very easily if that's this same function and this function is a first derivative then setting a first derivative equal to zero gives us critical points so let's take this and say hey if we factor out an X makes a lot easier by the zero product property to find our critical points we get zero and we get positive 4 so our critical points are zero and positive 4 now there's no way for us to say right off the bat that then those are stable or unstable without doing some sort of a sign analysis test or just a first derivative test the way it showed you last video to do that is do very something very similar to what we had in like a calculus one or even calculus two level class where we take our critical points we put them in order on some sort of a number line and we basically say hey if that's the first derivative where this is positive our function will be increasing where this is negative our function will be decreasing and where this is 0 our function will be constant or horizontal so we know that from from our first of our calculus 1 days that this function is only going to be 0 at 0 or 4 which means that our function itself the higher fo to the parent function here is going to have a peak or a kind of anti peak or a valley at 0 and 4 that's where our slope will be 0 now anywhere else our function is going to be climbing or Thorman if this function is continuous so what we're going to do is say since this is based on our function f of X let's plug in something something in this range like negative 1 1 and 5 and let's see what happens and this is going to tell us whether our critical points of 0 and 4 are stable no its stable means stable means that on both sides of that critical point our function is tending to go towards it unstable means away from it semi-stable is from one side right we're going towards it for another side where we're leaving it and that's what say my stable is we're gonna see that in the next few examples so let's plug in a number like I don't know negative 1 now remember that this is a slope all we're caring about is whether it's positive or negative we don't care about the actual value we care whether our function is increasing or decreasing on this interval since this represents a slope this is a first derivative this represents a slope it'll tell us if the slope is positive whether it functions increasing or negative whether functions decreasing so when it's like a negative 1 okay I'll write negative 1 enter function negative 1 squared is 1 4 times negative 1 is negative 4 1 plus 4 is 5 now I don't care about the 5 but I care about the fact that it's positive what that means is that our slope is pause so remember our parent function this would be the slope for sole function of our parent function our slope would be positive for this interval our function therefore so if I were to solve this I'm going to get the parent function a higher function our attention function our function here would be increasing so since our slope is positive our function is increasing and if you want to show a little bit more work you say hey for X values less than zero this means that our function is positive and you can show that does it really matter i I'm not sure it kind of depends on on if you're a particular class which your instructor wants for me personally I'd say this is good enough this say it says what you're plugging in this says that for this interval our function our soap is positive inner function is increasing now how about the one if we plug in something like 1 if I plug in 1 to my derivative here to my first derivative to the function that represents the first derivative or our slope well 1 minus 4 is negative that means that for this interval between 0 and 4 since 0 of 4 on the only two places where our slope can change sign every value in here is going to have the same output it's either going to be positive or negative so I don't have to go plug in a lot of different numbers we've already found where we have our zeros our critical points is zero and for every number between years 7 from our calculus 1 days it's going to have the same sign and so when I plug in 1 and say hey that's negative that means if my slope for my potential function is negative in this interval then all of that family of functions them about to find are decreasing now I said something there that you need to kind of remember a little bit since this is a first derivative since this is a differential equation it's it's a first derivative for a whole family of curves and similar to what we're doing this is pretty profound what we're saying is that for all of those functions for which visit the slope all of them are going to be increasing from negative infinity to zero all of them are going to be decreasing from zero to four and then if you plug in five and you okay five squared minus that's 25 minus 20 that's another positive it's positive five all of them are going to be increasing from 4 to infinity and that's fantastic we don't know exactly what our function is because it's going to this is defense solving this differential equation is going to give us a general solution a family of curves but depending on what our initial condition is we be able to find this particular solution what this is saying is that all of our general solutions or our general solution all of our curves here are going to be increasing on the interval of negative theta 0 decrease on an interval of 0 to 4 and increasing from our interval from 4 to infinity that that's pretty cool that means that this goes increasing forever now so if that represents the thing in their general solution here we can say that for every single particular solution in that general solution so solving our difference equation all of them are going to have a stable critical point at x equals 0 notice how our function no matter what it's going to be as a positive slope and a negative so they're going to increase and decrease around that x equals 0 that's called a stable critical point but round 4 we did something different we say that around 4 if we're below that our function is decreasing or slope is negative or if function is increasing above that or so is positive and we're tending to go away from that that's called unstable now how is it gonna look let me come over here I want to show you and then we're gonna go ahead and solve this differential equation we're gonna see that it gives us the same exact graph so if I have these two critical points x equals 0 and x equals 4 I want to make sure I put them in order here's what's going to happen with our stable critical points our general solution is going to no matter where we start our general solutions going to tend towards it for unstable critical points no matter where we start our general solution is going to go away from it and so when we have two or more critical points these things sort of interplay off one another so if I start below x equals 0 what this says is that if I start let null is let's put all this together ok this is a first derivative this says that this is the slope for every potential function that has this as a slope that means that I'm going to have some arbitrary constants or not and the arbitrary constant is going to give us sort of this initial value dependent function if my initial value starts below x equals 0 I'm going to be increasing if I start bellowing to equal zero this is going to give us a picture of our general solution based on this so if I start below X equals 0 I'm going to be increasing my function is going to be increasing it's going to go like a funnel it's going to funnel into this from below so I'm going to funnel into x equals zero it says I have to increase where am I gonna increase in telling you 2x equals zero now what about what about above that if I start above x equals zero or between 0 & 4 I'm going to be decreasing and that says Fulda this says I'm gonna go away from x equals 4 I'm gonna go towards X x equals zero so no matter where I start between here I'm going to be moving away from x equals 4 but towards x equals zero so this says if this is our slope it says you're decreasing on this interval no matter what your initial value is your function will be decreasing kind of depends on where I start but where I start I'm sorry no matter where I start I'm going to be decreasing some help now above 4 I will be having a positive so for every single particular solution depending on what our initial value is I'm going to be increasing so where I start doesn't really matter as far as what I'm doing it'll give us a particular type of curve but it says matter where you start up here you're going to have a positive slope you're going to be increasing and we can get a very clear picture of our general solution with just this work so I said earlier in the last three examples I'm just gonna be doing this I'm just going to show you this these curves I'm gonna practice doing some difference of equations so you see some more advanced techniques but in general this this is really all all that we kind of need to get a clear picture of it so what we're doing taking a first derivative doing the first derivative test allowing that to give us a general solution or picture of our general solution so let's do it it says below see below zero I'm stable so that means I should get a funnel here so if I start below here we should get a funnel notice how I have several curves why do you have several curves well this is a picture of our general solutions so without a particular initial value we can't get a particular solution all we can say is that all of these curves are going to be increasing depending on the value less than zero our initial value starts less than zero you are going to be increasing now what if our initial value starts between zero and four you're going to be decreasing so we're gonna have several types of curves here we're gonna get some that look that look like this and as we get closer to our 4 we're gonna get curves this that look like going away and coming to that zero this is called a funnel when we when we get towards a value from both sides that critical point this is funneling to that x equals zero we're leaving this for that spout or leaving this or spouting away from the floor funneling into the zero so when I said that we have a general solution here this could be man you could be any of these curves down here any of these curves up here or any of the ones we're about to get up here depending on what your initial value is so if our initial value starts less than zero we're going to climb to it if our initial value starts between zero and four we're gonna go away from the four and towards the zero far initial value start to above four we're going to be leaving that four and it's a fairly clear picture on that this is not a computer program unfortunately it not the computer um that's probably fortunate but it'll give you a depend on how well I can draw these these things a clearer picture of what our general solution is again there's not just one curve here because what our particular solution depends on is a starting point an initial value if our initial value is somewhere down here we're gonna climb to zero so we're between here we're gonna fall to zero so we're above here we're gonna go away from that for this is what stability and instability disability looks like for critical points we go to it and what's called a funnel or away from it in what's called a spell I hope that makes sense to you now what we're gonna do is we're going to go through and we're gonna solve this differential equation and it looks like we're gonna have some partial fractions here so acceptable and difference equation partial fractions will go through fairly quickly because I've done it so many times with you but what I really want to get at is two main ideas number one main idea is this function is a slope function for some sort of potential function or some sort of parent function or something haven't found yet sometimes we haven't found so when I do a first root of test I don't take another two that would be a second derivative test so I'm not really concerned about concavity I will tell you this a little bit better but I'm not concerned about that I'm concerned that this is a first derivative it will directly give me critical points set equal to zero that's important being able to do a first derivative test is is pretty pretty big second thing when I take this and I make a graph from it what I'm taking is a picture of our derivatives our first derivatives and letting that tell me what our general solution is doing whether we're increasing or decreasing on an interval that's going to give us a fairly clear picture of a general solution it means you're going to get lots of curves because we're saying that we don't have a particular solution or sorry a particular initial value so we can't get a particular solution you have to have an initial starting spot to say whether you're down here and climbing between here and falling up here in climate you have to know that otherwise we get a picture of a general solution that's a lots of curves as a family of curves so just be aware of what we're doing when we're doing this okay first frame is slow and when we when we start getting a graph of those family of curves or given general solution we're gonna see that in our solving or difference equations so let's do it so we know that this is factorable we've already done that and it to be separate our variables here and we take an integral of both sides right hand side very easy left hand side we're gonna have partial fractions so 1 over X X minus 4 remember that linear factors factors give up as fractions linear gives us a constant numerator we're getting a a common denominator here so we're gonna multiply X minus 4 and X and since we have an equation here with its the same denominators that's why you find a common denominator our numerators would also have to be equal and so when we find a common denominator and it alters our numerators we just have to set our numerators equal then we do some fancy stuff like hey what if I what if X were zero if X were zero that this would be zero this would be negative four and one would have to equal a times negative four giving us a equals negative one-fourth or if X is four and this would be zero but this would be B times four so one would have to equal B times four and B would give us one-fourth of them and now we can rewrite this as something that's a little easier to take an integral of we'd say hey this whole fraction is a over X B over X minus four if it is one negative one-fourth that's negative 1 over 4x plus 1 over 4 times X minus 4 DX and you see me do this a few different ways I've always factored out this this denominator here this is 1/4 sometimes I'll factor the negative sometimes I won't and if you're wondering why I do that I've explained a couple times but I like my single term denominator to be negative that way when I make my Ln I combine these two natural logarithms into one I have a single term on the denominator that's that's kind of nice next thing what I'll do is once I factor that out this 1/4 you've seen me go ahead and integrate right now you've also seen me multiply by 4 that's really up to you I'm gonna multiply by 4 right now because I I just want to get rid of that do you have to know it doesn't really matter because that arbitrary constant whether you multiply by 4 now and call whatever you get on immigration C or integrate now and multiply C times 4 you still get an arbitrary constant it doesn't really matter but it's a little cleaner to multiply by 4 right now clear this out so I'm gonna multiply by 4 on both sides I'm also going to integrate so when we get the integral negative 1 over plus one over X minus four equals four times an integral of DT so just multiplying by four on the left hand side yeah we're gonna get a negative Ln absolute value of x we'll get another Ln absolute value of X minus four on the right hand side at least simply get four T plus C sub one you see that many times we're going to call that C sub one because we're about to combine these natural logarithms using X 1 on both sides and that right there is gonna change we're gonna get plus or minus e to the C sub 1 or wrap all that up that's as C if you didn't multiply it by 4 and I've done it both ways if you didn't multiply it by 4 right here you have a 1/4 and you've multiplied by forward now giving us a 40 plus 4 C sub 1 for C sub 1 doesn't matter it's still arbitrary constant so let's combine our logarithms exponent on both sides when we do that we're gonna wrap up a plus and minus e to the C sub 1 times e to the 14 and this whole thing is going to become our C or arbitrary constant so X minus 4 over x equals C e to the 14 now let's poss remember this thing that what we're doing you've heard me mention that this is a first derivative tells us slope of a general solution okay that tells us what our general solution is doing as far as increasing or decreasing and we learn that it depends on the initial value that's what we get a whole bunch of potential curves potential functions here they're either increasing decreasing or increasing depending on what our initial condition is well we better find out in an in tradition or at least have way to show that in our work so with that arbitrary constant let's make it represent our initial conditions what's our initial condition well when we know our initial condition would be some value at time zero so whatever x value is at time zero let's call it X sub zero plug that in and it will allow you to solve for your arbitrary concert right now that arbitrary constant will be this value that depends on an initial condition it will tell us where we start and what our curve looks like depending on that and so when we do this we okay let's let's allow X of 0 to be X of 0 so the x value at time 0 right there that squeezie row it's going to be X of 0 let's plug that in so X is 0 minus 4 over X of 0 equals C times e to the 4 times 0 so when T is 0 our x value is X of 0 notice that what this is going to allow us to do is create this general solution where all we need to know is what our value starts out think of it as population what our population starts at and then we can plug it in and it'll tell us where we are what our particular solution is so our C value since this is 1 equals x at 0 minus 4 over X is 0 now this is super nasty I don't really want to go plugging this in because can you see it I got a fraction of the deal with all that junk so here's what I'm to do what I'm going to do is I'm gonna keep this as a C as long as I can and at the very end well whenever I can't keep it as a C reasonably anymore I'm gonna now put this in so I'm thinking of this in my head thinking C is this I'm just gonna not plug it in right now because otherwise I have a lot of complex fractions I have a lot of common denominators I have to find I might have to do that later but for now just for ease of working with it I'm gonna keep this as a seat and I want to solve for X as much as I can so what that means for us is I'm going to multiply both sides by X going to get X's on one side are constant on the other I'm a factor in X and then divide so I'm going to multiply the X right now I'm going to group my X's on one side nan X terms on the other we're going to back through an X we're gonna divide remember that this X is a function of T it is a function at this point we can't go any further without using this but do you see what happened now maybe you want to try it if you want to you can plug this in right here and go through it but your X sub zero's and your X's I see a lot of students get those confused and they if you drop that initial value this X of zero starts looking a lot like an X and then you go Oh chunky fine s that up my problems pretty much smoke so this is my preference my preference is trying to keep it as a see of course everything I talked about different equations stays where it is don't don't relearn anything here what I'm showing is as soon as it's possible you do solve for your arbitrary constant we've done that we're just not plugging it in yet if we're being smart about saying this is what it is let's solve for X boom and then we can plug in our initial values so once we've done that we go locate this right here this is X sub zero months for X sub zero no matter that doesn't that doesn't that doesn't look so great and not only that it's not what's in the back of my book or wherever you got this problem or whatever you're working on you're right but you can see what it does it says instead of working on with a complex fraction or some sort of fraction all the way through this problem and having to distribute within factor with it it allows you to say well now that I have a simple complex fraction the very end I can do things like hey how do you how do you simplify complex fractions well you've multiplied by the LCD or least common denominator those comes another way which is just X of 0 and if you remember that you're going to distribute that then our function becomes for X of 0 distribute x0 - these are going to cancel when I distribute now I do I absolutely have to put a parenthesis around this because it is multiplied by e to the 14 but that's it that's a lot nicer than working with this fraction all the way through so one time then we'll talk about that is one time all the way through you start with different equation first order difference equation and you are starting with the slope of some sort of higher functions of parent function potential function if your start with the slope do a first derivative test it tells you what your function is doing it tells you that for certain intervals you are positive slope negative so positive so increasing decreasing and increasing that will actually give you a picture of what your general solution do lots of different curves here because we're talking in general it requires these things you know have a general solution right arbitrary constant gives you general solution this is giving you a general solution you need it particular in initial value to get a particular solution that's why we have this arbitrary constant salt for an initial condition or initial value problem when we use that this says depending on what your initial population is your initial starting amount is it's going to give you one of these curves not all of them one of them is gentleness everything that could possibly happen this is every slope you could possibly have this is every general every particular solution you could possibly have it's called a general solution finding one of them requires a single value so if our values let's let's take a look just to make sure we're really clear if our value is less than zero that would be negative if it's like negative one or something this would be a negative let's see this would be negative one this would be a negative oval wait this is positive isn't it so something positive this right here is something less than zero maybe pause this would be something be the more less so they define but adding that you're going to get a negative over negative that's a positive you were going to get something that is I'm sorry so the slope would be positive the function itself will be negative but getting closer and closer and closer to zero if we start between 0 and 4 so something like like 1 then be positive that would be positive that would be negative depend on what that value is something between zero and four are slow believe negative however so we're going to be constantly are consistently dropping toward zero as we continue with it to be a decreasing function and lastly we start above four we're getting something that's increasing so this this right here is modeled by this graph right here that we've drawn it depends on what your initial condition is you only get a particular solution I hope that makes sense that we're gonna do a few more I'm not going to go as in-depth on my explanation as I've just done with you we're gonna basically get this good picture practice doing our differential equations and we move on that so hang on seen an example in just a second alright here we go let's take a look at this first order differential equation which means we're dealing with a slope this is a slope of some sort a slope a function of some sort of a potential function that we've got now what we're gonna do we're gonna say this is our function then this represents the first derivative and therefore we can do a first derivative test to find out the critical points let's try it so our function looks like we might be able to factor it there's a good clue there for us it's a difference of squares if you do it right and set it equal to zero is exactly how we find critical points or critical points are two and negative two by the zero product property let's do a first derivative test now we always want to make sure these are in order because it doesn't represent a number line for us but we're going to plug in values that say hey if this is a slope then everything in this interval is going to have every potential function this interval so you have the same slope positive or negative same thing here safely here these are the only places x equals negative 2 and x equals 2 those critical points where slope can change signs that's it and so what we're gonna work on is hey let's plug in something like negative 3 see what the slope is doing if we plug in negative 3 to our function here see that's 9 minus 4 that's positive don't really care that it's what the actual value is but what I do care about is that this is positive let's increasing L at zero zero minus four is negative and how about three three minus three squared minus four is positive so this tells us that our function itself by playing in just a single value here they're all gonna have the same value of sign of slope so positive negative positive says we're going to be increasing decreasing increasing no matter where we start if our initial value is in this this interval our parent potential higher whatever function is going to be increasing it's going to be decreasing it is this interval is going to be increasing here right now you should tell me which of these are stable and which of these are unstable we should know that this is stable this is unstable you should have a picture in your head of what is going on right now you should understand that right here this is going to be a funnel things are going towards this functions going towards negative two this is spell things are going away from positive two so when we take a look at it this is funneling towards and spouting away we have this final idea and spy idea again this is what our function should look like depend on where we start we're going to get one of these curves something increasing to negative two or decreasing to negative two something increasing away from two away from two so we have this funnel and spout ID let's solve a differential equation let's see if we can get a general solution that is modeled by this picture of our general solution this hey let's solve it kind of fun to solve anyway so we already know that this is factorable let's go ahead and let's keep this factor especially when I know that I'm getting some some functions they're gonna be solved by partial fractions I leave it factored so a little bit easier that way let's group these variables so separate our variables here if we integrate both sides we immediately see we're going to have some project partial fractions so let's take a look at that right over here and say hey you know what if I take a look at my partial fractions and let the number of factors equal the number of fractions that I get I understand that linear denominators give us constant numerators say that if I find a common denominator here we're going to say that one our numerators would have to be equal would have to equal a times X plus 2 plus B times X minus 2 plug in 2 and negative 2 it's gonna allow you to solve for a and B very nicely so x equals 2 that would be 0 that would be 4 it would have to be 1/4 likewise if X is negative 2 that would be 0 that would be no you to B would be negative 1/4 I know I've done that very quickly but that's why I gave you a whole video on how to deal with partial fractions because this should be at this point very very understandable the only thing I'm really trying to teach you is that that's a first riveted let the slope tell you what your general solution is doing start increasing and decreasing learn with stable and unstable mean be able to get a picture of your general solution without even have them doing work that's pretty cool so this will give you a population model really for where where I start matters by below or between or above it's going to show you what your particular solution is without even doing work hard work so now that we're able to say that our a is 1/4 or B is negative 1/4 we can alter our integral so we've got this integral of negative 1 over 4 let's see a was with the X minus 2 so a is 1/4 that would be a positive and then X minus 2 minus 1 over 4x plus 2 now I don't really care about the factor out that negative because I'm gonna have two terms no matter what I'm just gonna factor out the 1/4 you see me do this unless example will multiply by 4 and then we'll integrate so we factor the 1/4 and we multiply both sides makes it just a little bit cleaner and we integrate we're gonna have a natural logarithm x - 2 - on that natural logarithm absolute value X plus 2 equals 4t plus C sub 1 we're gonna do the same exact thing as last time we're going to group this as a single natural logarithm we know that subtraction gives us a quotient where everything's subtracted or negative goes in the denominator everything positive or plus goes in the numerator and we get this 4t + C sub 1 same exact thing I'm going to try to do all of it at once right now we're gonna take an exponent on both sides we'll wrap up a plus or minus e to the C sub 1 as a arbitrary constant so absolute value E and C sub 1 are all going to be C but we'll still have an e to the 14 on the left hand side we simply get X minus 2 and X plus 2 so we're taking both of these as an exponent on that natural number we're saying that this would separate into two different factors e to the C sub 1 and E to the 14 but either she said one is constant and absolute value can wrap that up as a plus or minus so plus M is either C sub one is a constant now what do I do now do I want to solve for X now or do I want to find my arbitrary constant now arbitrary constant soon as you can it's not great here as a horrible but here is really nice so if I plug in X of zero gives me some initial conditions some initial value problem well then when T is zero our x value is just our initial condition that's gonna let us solve for C but I'm not gonna plug it in here yet what I'm gonna do is I'm going to save this to the end and see what I can do is for our solving for x before I have to plug that in so now let's see that would be X sub zero minus 2 over X is here plus two equals C times e to the 4 times zero this whole thing is 1 and this it gives us our seat so RC but I'm gonna hang on to in my head C is X of 0 minus 2 over X of 0 plus 2 now I actually haven't done it this way on my notes what see if it works let's see if I can just solve for X here look at this and then later plug that in because if I tried it the first time doing it with this and that's crazy there's a lot of little nuanced math in there with common denominators that can really get you kind of all jacked up and so we're going to solve this for X as much as it's possible with the arbitrary constant that's not so arbitrary we're just going to treat it that way until the very end so let's try this so from here I would have to let's see I'd have to multiply both sides by X plus 2 I have to distribute we're gonna group our X terms on one side non X's on the other factor and divide so it's gonna look kind of nasty at first even though we don't have that with this thing it's incredibly nasty so let's first multiply both sides by X plus 2 that's gotta be in parentheses which means that I have to distribute that I'm going to group my X terms on one side mine on X terms on the other we're going to factor you can factor here too if you really want to the cloud think it's very necessary and we're going to divide it so our function of X in terms of T well of our independent variable T gives us a bat we go okay all right so so now well now what you do right here's where I would plug this in and do the same technique I just showed you so you're going to get a complex fraction right now and we're just going to simply multiply both the numerator and denominator by whatever LCD is of that complex fraction so from right here you alright let's let's make sure I've done everything right I've multiplied by X plus 2 got it I've distributed this looks pretty good I've got my X terms by subtracting my non-answers by adding on different sides I factored I mess a sign up looks the same here okay I've divided and now we're ready to go ahead and plug in that arbitrary constant that we've solved for and this right here contains our initial value so depending our initial value it's going to give us a different function that's why there's so many curves over here to pay our initial value it's going to give us a different function so two plus let's to be more room so that's C that is this thing now we're going to take that and say instead of the C since I've worked this all the way down to Salford X this is X at 0 minus 2 over X and 0 plus 2 and like well it's down here but now instead of having to have worked with bad distributed with that I'm just going to have to multiply both the numerator and another by X sub 0 plus 2 yes it will distribute it's still going to be a little bit nasty but it's a little bit nicer to work with and and to have it there the whole way through that so X sub 0 plus 2 over X sub 0 plus 2 when we distribute what's going to happen I need to distribute this whole expression to the 2 to the 1 it's going to cancel here so when I distribute this times this are X sub T X of T is going to give us 2 X sub 0 plus 4 because we're distributing this is going to get multiplied by the 2 that means that you're distributing to onto X to the sub 0 and 2 times 2 when we distribute to this whole entire term here are factors X sub 0 plus 2 and X sub 0 plus 2 they're going to cancel so we do get this but then we get a plus 2 X sub 0 minus 2 e to the 14 over what what happens here we would distribute x sub 0 plus 2 times 1 that's going to give us an X sub 0 plus 2 1 times X sub 0 is X 0 1 times 2 is 2 minus X sub 0 plus 2 e to the 14 that is about as good as we can give if you want to leave this factor as 2 times X sub 0 plus 2 it would look like this that's fine too it doesn't really matter it might be a little nicer since you can see it here but honestly it's it's it's really up to you so what this is this is your general solution notice how this solution depends on where you start so if I start with a value of less than negative 2 I'm going to get an increasing graph when I start with a value between negative 2 & 2 I'm going to get a decreasing graph if I start with the value above 2 I'm gonna get an increase in graph what if I start with a value at 2 at negative 2 those are called equilibrium solutions nothing would change so anyway I hope this is making sense I hope you've really started to see how this picture gives us this and we have to do a whole lot of work to find the general solution which our first derivative test model squared obviously for sin yell so hang on for a couple more examples we'll go quickly through them like we've been doing and then we'll start just doing the pictures okay let's go on a few others now I've shown you a couple times so that we can have funnels and spells in the same problem but what I haven't shown you is when we what a semi-stable critical point looks like and what the graph would look like so we're gonna do that with this we'll talk about I completely unstable critical point in the next example and then we'll go ahead and do with a combination of some of them so let's take a look at the derivative of X with respect to time is X minus T by X minus 2 squared so a first order differential equation represents our slope let's find the critical points now when our function this set equal to zero we really just get one critical point x equals two is the only critical point we have so when we have these repeated factors well zero product property says just take your your factor itself set equal to zero it has a multiplicity what multiplicity means is the degree of the factor that's giving you that 0 so that multiplicities even if you remember what multiplicity actually does it means that on both sides of that critical point you're going to get this symmetry so they will have the same value either both increasing both decreasing which means if we take this critical point and put it on our number line matter what I plug in it's going to have the same sign it's going to actually have the same value dependent no matter really as far as our science concerned about what we're plugging in so this is our first derivative represents of slope if I plug in something like 3 or something like 1 I'm gonna square both of them I'm going to get a positive our slope here is positive saying that our general solution is going to contain functions that are all increasing so whether I start below 2 or above 2 I'm increasing notice what's happening if I start below to my function is going to increase until always but increase until I get to 2 because they're above 2 it's gonna increase paths that this is called semi-stable in one interval and increasing to my critical point but in another interval I'm increasing away from it so we're not funneling to we're not spouting away this is semi-stable it's sort of like a funnel on one side and a spout on the other now what that's gonna look like for us is if I have one critical point if I start with an initial value of low - this says that every single one of my particular solutions or my general solution is going to be increasing so we're going to get this increasing all of these are gonna be an increasing functions if I start below - but start above - him going to be increasing so I'm gonna get increasing functions if I start a bug - notice how from below it looks like a funnel from above it looks like a spell that's what semi-stable would look like I'm going to be increasing to point or exploding if I if I have this initial value above that now what would that look like the population what that means here is that we would either get a leveling off this limiting population or I would get this explosion this doomsday scenario depinna where I start so that x equals to that equilibrium solution is real important start below that I'm gonna reach it above that I'm gonna explode in population now let's see what our solving of our differential equation actually looks like we don't have any partial fractions that's nice place you have something fairly simple if I treat this like the separable differential equation it is and get my 1 over X minus 2 squared DX on one side and our DT on the other and we get agree you can look at this as a simple u sub if you need to and say hey you would be X minus 2 but the derivative of X minus 2 is just 1 so you can just cover it up and say the derivative is not going to give us any sort of a constant that we need to divide by then we would say let's see you the new YouTube I add one that the the negative one over negative one and put my you back in there that X minus 2 so this would all become negative 1 over X minus 2 you to the negative 1 over sorry yeah over negative 1 so that'd be a negative sign and then we get X minus 2 to the negative 1 power or 1 over X minus 2 on the right hand side we just get T plus C now it's great juxtaposition of what we're about to do you see in the previous few examples like for a lot when we had partial fractions and lots of L lands we combine those we took the exponential on both sides and then we solved for that arbitrary constant here we don't have to do that you should be solving for your arbitrary constant now there's no e there's no C sub 1 it's fine do it right now so when I say that our initial value happens at time 0 and would give us an initial value of x of 0 our X would be X of 0 when R T is 0 and that was a salt or arbitrary constant right now since our arbitrary constant is based on our initial condition where we take 1 negative 1 over an initial value minus 2 we're going to hang on to that for a second we're going to solve this for X remember for putting this in our heads and saying this is what C is but I would solve for X first so how in the world would I solve for X now I might change signs might do that you don't have to I would do that if I change signs so starting from here multiply both sides by negative 1 then 1 over X minus 2 would give us negative t minus C now something you can't do because this C is already defined don't go changing that sign right now that's gonna mess everything up so this see is this thing right here you're going to start changing this and saying oh let's just make that plus e you would have to define this as C sub one you'd have to have some sort of a C equals C sub one C equals negative C sub one and then you go ahead and do that but you have to backwards map it so my encouragement to you is don't don't do that don't change that sign because it gets very confusing and sometimes we'll mess some signs up if we do that so I'm gonna just leave this as minus C understanding I already solved for that this this is the thing right now okay if you'd have had that in there wouldn't you be changing that sign yeah of course you would so don't be taking this and wrapping that up as a general arbitrary constant right now because you already saw work you're just holding on to it until the very end I hope you get that now because I have 1 over X minus 2 equals negative t minus C I can make this basically reciprocate both sides I can say that X minus 2 therefore we equal 1 over negative t minus C if we add 2 we could but add 2 we get 2 plus 1 over negative t minus C here's a good time to do one of two things either you can factor out a negative and change the sign no - I'm not going to do that or you can plug in C right now I am gonna do that why I'm not factoring the negative is because that's negative and waiting to do is subtract that negative it's gonna change to plus anyhow and that's really what I want so I'm gonna do it that way so here's our general solution in terms of T we have to plus 1 over negative t minus C but I know what C is C is that negative 1 over X sub 0 minus 2 so let's let's simplify this a bit what in the world do we do now that's a complex fraction well we know that we're going to multiply by the LCD or the only number that's that's here what we don't do we don't multiply this here and then accidentally distributed to here that's that's not something we need to do that - that - is fine just leave it now in a moment once we take care of this we are gonna find a common denominator we're gonna make one fraction out of it but you don't distribute this X is 0-2 you know distribute it to it so when I multiplied by X of 0 minus 2 over X - 0 - 2 it's just to this fraction so this thing it's multiplied times 1 this thing yes it gets distributed here so X of T is - don't distribute here plus X of 0 - 2 / when we distribute this we're going to get negative T X of 0 - 2 + 1 that's going to cancel that denominator I might reverse these just a bit now you can leave it just like that my preferences - if you have to if it doesn't look quite right to you you have to find a common denominator for this - so you'd be multiplying times this denominator it's self and then you can combine this this fraction I'm not going to do that reason why I'm not going to do that is this this shows really clearly where that numbers come from this says hey you're starting with a shift up remember that constantly shift up of two and then depending on what your initial value is you're going to get a increasing curve with two different concavities yeah probably so we have this increase we have this increase but only until we get to that - and I like that - there because it shows us that that vertical shift so anyhow I hope that that's making sense that mod this is our general solution it is based on initial value and so is this so we'll deal with one more all the way through we'll change that exponent and see what happens and then we'll talk to us about the pictures all right we're different all the way through now we've changed just one loud to small things we're gonna give a completely different look at solving of a differential equation and a completely different look of what our general solution is so that's a first derivative that's a difference of equation first short of your equation represents the slope of some sort of potential functions that means that if that's a slope function we can do a first derivative test to solve for critical points and again we just get one critical point our multiplicity is odd what's that mean that means that on both sides of this critical point we're gonna get opposites so odd multiplicity says that you are reflected about the origin and even means you're freaked about the like a y-axis sort of idea and so here we're gonna go all right if our critical point is one we do this on a first derivative test or a sign analysis or whatever you want to call it I plug in zero I'm gonna get a negative well plug in - I'm gonna get a positive saying our function is doing two different things to the left or on the interval from negative a to one all of our particular solutions or a general solution there going to be decreasing or so that will all be negative they're greater than one we're all going to be increasing or are so good positive which says that every particular solution if we start above one it's going to be with an issue value is going to be increasing that right there is a completely unstable critical point what that means is that for below x equals one we're going to be decreasing and above one we're going to get functions that are increasing now they might look different than this but in general that's exactly what we're gonna get so that right there says that we're going to get a spout now let's go ahead and solve this differential equation see if we can see that as far as our general solutions is here again we have the separable differential equation where we can group our X's on one side DX are constants DT and take an integral of both sides we have this u sub again well we can imagine a derivative of x minus 1 is just 1 so it's kind of a trivial U sub I like to cover that up and say okay if that's a if that's a uu to the negative third power I would add one that's U to the negative 2 over negative 2 so I'm going to get this negative 2 over U or X minus 1 to the negative 2 or squared equals T oh sorry let's see I think I have a too long spot so let me just do like you said with integral of u the negative third power D you would give us us you to the negative 2 over negative 2 yeah I see I'd mess my denominator up that would give us this X minus 1 to the negative 2 over negative 2 or negative 1 over 2x minus 1 squared if that right there's what we get from our left integral so negative 1/2 X minus 1 squared equals T plus C now I'm going to do a C sub 1 for just one reason I don't really want to deal with an initial condition or an arbitrary constant it has a 2 in it and so what we can do here it's because you have a lot of cancelling out of it what we can do here is you multiply both sides by 2 right now we can even get rid of that negative as long as you don't solve for the arbitrary constant first this is something that you can redefine as an arbitrary constant of C you can't do that if you solve for your arbitrary constant first so there there's some nuances in how we do this you've seen me solve for the arbitrary constant like right away with an initial value problem you've seen me do some stuff with logarithm so you've seen me wait a little bit it's really up to you look at the problem say the problems see what's going to benefit you because I'm going to hang on to a the C to the very end I want it to be as simple as possible so I'm getting rid of my negative I'm getting rid of that too I'm going to say let's call this thing the arbitrary constant and now when I solve for it when I say hey my initial value would happen at a time of zero that's gonna say that when T is zero this thing still goes to zero even though it's not just T it's native to T but who cares it's still going to zero I'm going to get 1 over X of 0 minus 1 squared and that's gonna be negative 2 times 0 plus C that says that our C it's no longer arbitrary it's based on an initial value it's 1 over X of 0 minus 1 squared now we're gonna solve for X but we're gonna wait to plug that in that's going to be like our our little secret guy over here that we're gonna solve for X from here but we're going to wait to plug in C that's right here till the very end now one thing I don't want to do I don't want to start going back up here and solve for X except for you to find that right so I've modified this problem to get an arbitrary constant I've solved for this C so you have to use this to solve for X you can't be going back because you're talking about different constants there you'd be altering altering this constant its it would no long be the same so since I based my arbitrary constant find that initial value from this particular formula I'm going to use this particular formula to solve for X what that means if we have something very similar we've done we're going to reciprocate both sides so here we have this X minus 1 squared would equal 1 over C minus 2 T so I switch this around we reciprocated both sides now we've got to take a square root we've got to add one and you know what happens when you take a square root on both sides shouldn't you have a plus and minus yeah you should when you take a square root on both sides you should have plus and minus positive negative square root that's what these graphs are kind of look like I hope that you're seeing the horizont of the vertical shift here's not one here's a square root function that's positive or negative it's going to give us a different look here and this is just an approximation what it looks like this is the actual graph and now we're ready to plug in back the arbitrary constant that's not arbitrary longer so a couple things at scene number one I don't need the square root of one I can simplify that I'm not sure I've wanted yet I'll tell you why in just a moment so I'm going to leave that the square root because we're going to end up getting based on this see say 1 over X of 0 minus 1 squared - - teeth the reason why I'm not simplifying that one is because if I if I did I'd have to go ahead and make this under a square root anyhow what I'm going to do is I'm going to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the LCD of that complex fraction that's going to multiply it by one and since I left this in the square root it's really easy to see that this square root that square should cancel that's kind of nice and we'll leave it just like that this will distribute cancel here but I'm gonna have this minus 2t or two exit zero minus one squared times T so using just a little bit of simplification here we're going to still have a 1 so plus and minus will still have a square root but inside that square root we're gonna have an X of zero minus one squared all over distribute it'll cancel but will give us a one not a 0 so one cancel minus two X of zero minus one squared and we'd still have a team let me check my work here I multiply it by one I get that it's going to cancel I've multiplied a distribution on this expression of cancel that got two X of zero minus one squared times T that looks really good now we're going to talk about one last thing and get a 1 plus or minus would have an X so 0 minus 1 all over a big square root of 1 minus 2 X of 0 minus 1 squared that's a hot as good as we can get if you go any further you have to get a common denominator so it looking really nasty we really don't want to do that but this shows us what's gonna really be going on with our our general solution so what we've done is we've used some general curves to represent what's going to happen around our our critical points whether we're spouting or funneling or semi-stable or not but when we solve this we get that actual look of our curves so I hope that's making sense I'm drawing these just on the top yeah just kind of given you a look of it the curse and cells are gonna be different which is why it's important to solve these all the way down and say hey this is what it really really looks like okay it depends on what your initial value is if it's less than one yes we're going to be decreasing but how we're decreasing might not look exactly like that if we have an initial condition created in one yes we're going to be increasing but how we're increasing might not look exactly like that this is what those curves will look like depending on what your initial value is I hope that makes sense I'm going to come back in just a moment we're gonna do three very quick examples on just getting critical points showing you whether they're stable semi stable unstable and what the graph should look like so they'll be very very quick I'll be right back alright last three we're just gonna get approximations of what our general solution looks like and keep that in mind the the pictures we're getting are approximations so we're getting a general feel for how our general solution would look the curves themselves will look decidedly different quickly through these just to get a picture of whether the following spouting or semi-stable when we talk about solving a differential equation itself and getting the general the general solution it will give you the picture of those graphs for real all right I'm just giving you a picture of how it could look just the going away or going to some sort of a critical point so please keep that in mind these are approximations of our general solution but they're valuable they can allow you to check your work real quick what they can also do is tell you what should happen in a in a model of some sort of a population so it is useful to be able to understand that this gives you a picture of a kind of approximation of a general solution we're gonna do them very quickly the idea here is let's find critical points let's determine whether we're increasing or decreasing line intervals it's going to give us a look of a general solution or about that so since this is the first derivative all we've got to do is set our first derivative equal to zero to do a first derivative test now we're going to be factoring a lot because by factoring our slope is based on a quadratic which it is here then a zero product property says that our critical point would be four and one if we put them in order and we do a first derivative test let's plug in some values now we can do a couple things about this to make this easier you can plug in three values like 0 2 & 5 or you can use multiplicity to show what's gonna happen you see when you solve quadratic what's gonna have to happen so that is a quadratic right what's gonna have to happen is if you cross a zero quadratics look like that two of these are going to be positive and the middle one is going to be negative or the minimums gonna be positive the outside you're gonna be negative they have to alternate in other words so we can do that two ways well with multiplicity or one with understanding quadratics so if you plug in zero and you say hey when I plug in 0 I get a positive then this has to alternate and this has to alternate and you can try this on your own plug in 2 I'd see 9 so start leaning to 4 minus 10 plus will be negative decreasing plug in 5 25 positive we'd be increasing you can do that you'd also look at multiplicity since this is a factor with a power one and in fact over the power one multiplicity says that on opposite sides of that zero that critical point you will have different signs which means that here we have different signs positive and negative that tells us one side of the increasing one decreasing here you'd have different signs if that's decreasing on the other side is increasing you can use some of those things from like a college algebra class to do this very quickly sufficient forget about that stuff but it is still it very useful anyhow this is what whether you're going to plug in three numbers use multiplicity use the fact that's but paraboloids have just talked about all three parabolas alternate their continuous functions or use multiplicity we talked about opposite signs for odd powered or for multiplicity that's odd well to talk about discipline three numbers zero two and five anyway you go about it this interval is going to give us particular solutions all which are increasing this interval is going to give us particular solutions all which are decreasing this interval gives us particular solutions all legit increasing we have a stable and unstable critical point a funnel and a spout you've seen it before everything would be increasing starting with an initial value less than 1 between 1/4 we'd be decreasing so typically these things look like this and then above that we would be increasing and we can see this funnel idea and this spell idea around those particular critical points that's a very very loose approximation of what a general solution would be for that differential equation but it gives us an idea since it says ultimately hey if your initial value is greater than 4 just think about what's gonna happen your population it's gonna explode what happens if your population is between 1 and 4 it doesn't matter where you are and after certain amount of time you're going to drop to 1 the population is going to have a carrying capacity of 1 if you start below 1 you're going to increase until you - once you have a limiting population of 1 so that's valuable how it actually happens you need to solve the difference equation to model a particular solution based on this value but the general gives you a general look and our approximation that says here's what's gonna happen ultimately the next one so what happens if I just change the signs well let me ask you that what happens if you change a parabola to have a negative sign in front of it upward opening parabola is positive in front down by opening parabolas with negative friends so instead of a increase decrease increase we should get a decrease increase decrease the signs will still alternate it's still a parabola when we factor this thing you're still going to have multiplicity 1 which means an opposite sides of that zero office size that critical point you will have different signs so we are going to have to prove a point two and five notice how this sign hasn't absolutely nothing to do with these factors ok these factors are set equal to zero themselves by the zero power property you don't take this sign and change these values now what it says for our first derivative test they said if I pull against something like zero again which we talk about three ways to think about it this is a parabola so you have to have alternating signs this would be multiplicity 1 and multiplicity 1 so on opposite sides of your critical point you'd have different values or just plug in three numbers plug in something like zero now when you do it do do it anywhere do do it in any of these I would say probably here's the easiest zero plus zero minus 10 that's a negative you are going to be have a negative slope for every particular solution that has an initial value less than two and say that again it's very important very worried the slope of every particular solution on this interval or the soap of every particular solution depend on whether your initial condition is less than two is going to be negative every one of those particular solutions will be decreasing this will alternate so plug in three see negative nine twenty one and negative positive every one of these particular solutions if your initial value starts between two to five not at two or five those are equilibrium solutions and that they will change at those values but every particular solution with an initial value between two and five whether the positive slope it will be increasing and lastly plug in something like six your plug in six negative 36 or two that's going to be negative so every particular solution with the initial value greater than five is going to be negative so or be decreasing this says that that is an unstable critical point that's a spout this is a stable critical point that's a funnel and what's going to give us is this approximation of a general solution saying hey start below two what's going to happen you're kind of decrease start between two and five what's going to happen you're going to increase start above five what's gonna happen you're going to decrease we're going to get this spout for the bottom prove a point and a funnel for the top critical point and again this can tell you what a population we do in order function we'll be doing it all depends on where you start start below two you're going to go extinct start between two and five your population is going to grow until you reach the vibe that's going to be a limiting population start above file your population is going to decline until you reach to five that's a carrying capacity and so this gives us a model what is going to happen without having to solve a differential equation now to find the actual curve so then you can really model you have to solve that and get in particular solution depending on your initial value so I hope it's making sense I hope that you're with me on hey critical points mean something right now you certain some facts of parabolas or multiplicity or just plugging numbers to find out what your general solution would be looking like okay last one but this is kind of similar to the last problem we did before these two except instead of something minus 2 we have a 2 minus the variable so let's see what happens with that one without having to do any solving with separable equations here well we would know that if this is our function and it represents a slope so we have only one critical point two now that's it let's see that's a cubic how to cubic look they don't care it's a multiplicity three our slope is cubic multiplicity 3 says that on different sides of our odd multiplicity different sides of a critical one will have different values so on one side will be positive and the other side will be negative they will be different not the same so if we take a look at my first derivative test and I plug in something like zero to my function I plug in zero I'm going to get a positive which says that every solution with an initial value less than two is going to be increasing positive so it's increasing greater than two something like three because of multiplicity because of the the cubic I'm going to have a different value at a different sign here so plug in three I'm going to get a negative it says that every particular solution of this differential equation has a mission of ID greater than two it's going to be decreasing every single one of them that gives us a stable critical point that's going to give us a funnel what that looks like for us that's Gandhi is that at x equals two through x equals two come on letter x equals two we have an equilibrium solution if we start an initial value of two that population whatever this is this function will not change let me start below that it will increase until we reach two if we start above that it will decrease until we reach two that's it it's as much as we need to go on this one so I hope that I've made it very clear on the interplay between a first derivative and a differential first order differential equation that they're they're representing the same thing but going backwards from a differential equation you're not quite sure exactly what you're your original function looks like and so we get a general solution and it's dependent on what our initial value is very dependent on that we can get an approximation by just doing the first derivative test but to get the real picture we got to go ahead and solve our differential equation and we'd have to know an initial value because that's gonna dictate what a graph is actually doing also I hope that I can refresh your memory on how to deal with some of your sign analysis understanding multiplicity and the shape of your graphs so I hope it's made sense I know it's a long video I hope that you were with me the whole time next time what we'll talk about is we'll take a look at some some different examples as as far as harvesting and stalking is concerned and how that affects what's what's going on we'll talk about bifurcation point what that even means for right now if you've understood how to get these graphs from your differential equation you're doing creative so I'll see you for another video hope you're doing well see you soon you 

Transcript for: Harvesting Populations in Differential Equations (Differential Equations 38)
hey welcome to the last video on population models for these differential equations in this video we're going to talk about how harvesting and stalking affect critical points and affect your population growth and really determine what's gonna happen and so obviously this kind of real-world applicable because in in like our ecology and biology and our systems of life in the world we really don't want to be harvesting too much and but we also want to be overstocking because things might die out and so we're gonna look at maybe how this stuff works and so we'll take a look at our difference equations we'll see how our models are affected by harvesting and stocking and a little bit of fun so before we get there though I need to remind you of a couple things the first is there's a difference between the logistic and explosion explosion extinction differential equations we took a look at that there's slight differences but they really affect what's going on and so what I plan on doing in this video is showing you how when we start harvesting or stalking on the list logistic equation or harvesting and stalking on the explosion and extinction equation we're going to get some different things these are basically opposites and so we'll take a look at how that affects our critical points we'll take a look at how the critical points will affect our population so before before we go anywhere do you remember with the logistic equation that everything really depends on your initial value and these differences having this M first or last determines whether we're going to have a funnel or have a spout that's what that's what happened so let's take a look really quick about what goes on here let's suppose that our initial value of x is greater than M let's suppose this is greater than M what's gonna happen with our critical points here well if you remember we weren't able to really talk about it before but if you remember with critical points in the last couple videos all we kind of do to find critical points is set this equal to zero and solve for X ok well if we do that then we're gonna get two critical points you can see it right here this is zero we get x equals zero we get x equals M those are the two critical points now with populations x equals 0 or X initial value less than 0 is basically meaningless if we have no initial population we're not gonna get anywhere from there we're not gonna get anything from a negative population either that doesn't make logical sense and so when we take a look at our critical points here x equals 0 is basically irrelevant yeah if you started stalking from 0 well then you would have a population growth but starting at 0 not doing anything from it on just the logistic equation is going to go nowhere so the only really relevant critical point that we would have is M if we set this equal to zero and solve by the zero product property and say hey if x equals M we have a critical point then some really interesting thing is going to happen around that M if our initial value starts at M we get a horizontal line we get this equilibrium solution nothing's gonna change we're not gonna grow we're not gonna shrink remember that M would be positive and K would be positive here so if that's the case nothing happens honestly I'm just kind of recap in a few videos right here but if we start above M if our initial value is above and look what happens if our X sub 0 is above M this is obviously positive this is positive this is positive if this is more than M we would get a negative number here positive times a positive times a negative is a negative our slope of our function would be decreasing every general of general solution for anything higher than this would be decreasing we would have these decreasing curves so depend on what our initial value is if it's more than M we're going to get decrease so negative decrease we would have to look like this something along that now what if our initial value is less than M if our initial a is less than M positive positive something less than M is going to create a positive number here we would get increase our slope would be positive every single particular solution would be increasing and we get like a definition of a funnel here this is what the logistic equation does for so so one time on this because you need to get what's going on with these two how they're different before we start looking at how harvesting and stocking affects it so with the logistic equation one more time if we have this and first this constant first then what we have is what's called a limiting population in equilibrium solution and a limiting population if we start above that we're going to decrease we can see it right here this is a positive minus something bigger than it that'd be a negative number we're going to get a decrease if we start plug low that we're going to get a positive number something positive minus something less than as a positive we'd get an increase this is how logistic equation works it would have one relevant critical value right there that would just be M that's the equilibrium solution this limiting population now what if we change what if we say hey we have a X minus M it looks just so similar but we get a completely different picture this is an explosion and extinction equation again katelyn be positive and that's positive so let's take a look at it if we set this equal to zero find our critical points we'd really still get to zero and M will let that sound just like that one it is just like it and the fact that zero doesn't really mean anything here either if we start with zero population obviously zero times anything is going to give you zero our population is not going to change gonna stay horizontal there is no change there if it's negative that doesn't make any sense as far as a population model goes we can't have a negative puppet you can't Oh someone population doesn't make sense but if we have something greater than zero so X would be greater than zero K is positive M is positive well if our X is equal to M like gimmick it no change this equilibrium solution there however look at what happens when X is greater than M if X is more than M then something bigger than M minus M would give you a positive positive times positive times positive if we start above M we explode take a look at bellowing if we start below it positive times a positive now something less than M minus M would give us a negative number so positive times a positive times a negative would give us a negative so a decreasing function that's the definition of a spell we get a stable critical point or an unstable critical point depending on whether we're talking about the logistic or explosion extinction equations I hope this is making sense this is basically all the videos that we've done leading up to this so we've talked about logistic and explosive extinction we talked about critical points now we're kind of in a plane all of them so one less time all the way through differential equations that model populations don't make sense if our population is negative so we don't have to worry about this less than zero case if that's true then everything is based on our initial condition for here if our initial population is more than a mileage istic we decrease and increase if it's less than them the opposite is true if we switch this that should make sense to you all this is that's different from here here is a negative sign that means that above instead of negative we get positive but low instead of positive we get negative and we get this completely different picture which is what separates the logistic equation from the explosion and extinction equation so that that's what's that's what's going on right now we're just taking a look at equilibrium solutions and how our critical points basically give us those and how this is completely dependent on our initial value whether we're going to have a limiting population or a threshold solutions with that's called the threshold solution says if I've above that I'm going to explode go away from it but below that I'm going to go extinct go away from that so it's it's that spell idea again I hope that's making sense now what we're gonna do after this we're gonna say in real life well what happens to populations we we typically stock them or or we we harvest from them this happens a lot like in lakes where people go out fishing they take some fish or we stock with fish that we can we don't over fish it we want to have responsible harvest and responsible stocking so that we can have these populations of species sustainable really and so let's take a look at what happens when we start subtracting or adding to to these these equations we're gonna take a look at logistic first we'll see how the harvesting or stocking affects it we'll take a look at critical points and how this is a very simplistic model this is going to give us some really different stuff so we're gonna take a look at critical points we'll learn a couple new words like bifurcation point what the world that means that would be good to go so let's suppose that we have the which ones this one see that's this is logistics so this is a logistic equation and we're taken away from it or we're stalking so what how can it be both if your H is positive then subtracting H would be in harvesting we'd be taking things out of its population if our H is negative that would be stocking so this can count for both the harvesting and stocking here on the logistic equation also keep in mind that H has to be constant and that's constant per unit of time so of our time period is per year or per day or per month then that harvesting is how many items you're taking out per year or per month or per day and it's not going to change so we're gonna consider that to be a constant just like our our growth rates and death rates were number of items there are a number of population per thousand per year this is how many years you're harvesting our stocking per year per day whatever that is so let's take a look and say if this know wait a minute if that's a differential equation let's find our critical points how we find critical points all the time is we set them equal to zero so here's what I want to do with this now that we've kind of recap this I know I went quickly through it what I want to do with this is I want to use what we know about finding critical points I want to solve them for X and I want to look at what's going to happen with this H how that age affects our critical points and what would happen with it so what we're gonna do is rinse that is equal to zero we're gonna find our critical points I'm going to use a differential equation - I'm sorry a quadratic formula to show you that it's possible and then show you how that depends on your harvesting or stocking and the little top is exactly what these pictures would look like so let's let's start man let's find some critical points how we do that as we said our difference of equation our function equal to zero do you remember that you remember that this is this is a first derivative so studying a first derivative equal to zero is probably find critical points so let's set this equal to zero and let's solve that for X because that's exactly how we do find critical points so let me set this equal to zero and say I'm going to solve this for X well we might want to distribute now you're in the right neighborhood so if we distribute here I'm gonna go there first so negative K x squared plus M K X - H don't distribute to there it gives us a quadratic equation in terms of X and that's something that we can solve so finding critical points here not as easy as logistic this one's really easy man I mean we set this equal to zero you get to zero which would have a zero population that would not change or you get M and that gives you your two critical points obviously some things are going to happen around there that are important we get an equilibrium solution above that we talked about the slope we talked about how if our initial value is above M then we would get a negative slope or a decreasing function the general solution for everything above or the particular solution for everything above here would be decreasing contrary to below so if we have a initial value below and we get a positive so than increasing everything flips or the explosion extinction I thought that later so if we say all right this is a differential equation its logistic but we're harvesting and we distribute we don't have something as easy to solve that age starts messing with us and so we go well I don't just have some very simple critical points that I can I can find with logistic I'd have to do something more fancy let's do the quadratic formula and solve this one thing I might do before I might factor out that that negative this will make things a little bit nicer so if i factor out this negative and get KX squared minus NK x plus h I'm gonna do the quadratic formula on that piece right there but keep in mind I have a negative right now so what I'm planning on doing is solving the quadratic formulas showing you that it's possible I'm gonna come back up here I'm going to use the the solutions to the quadratic formula to show you that this is factorable and then show you factors including that negative so let's uh let's go right from here so X would be equal negative B so our K is our a some BS or C negative B well if our B is negative and cake we have negative negative okay maybe it'd be plus or minus square root B squared minus 4 times a times C all over 2 times 8 all right let's see a SRK got that C is H and let's see here is K okay just a little bit of fancy work good see ya see that this is possible so let's see x equals negative x + 8 is a positive so we're gonna get this MK plus or minus square root we get M Squared k square- core KH all over 2k we're going to do one other thing before we start talking about it we're going to factor out a K squared from ear so how we're gonna do that is if we divided by K squared and K squared factored that out this is going to become 4 k 8 well 4 KH divided by K squared can give us 4 H over K so think about that maybe try not on your own if i factor out a K squared this is going to cancel out the K I have a K on the denominator so it looks like this and we can see that if we distributed we get M squared K squared we get 4 HK squared over K Kay's you cancel leaving this ik and the numerator all over 2 K now the nice thing about products and square roots is that we can simplify them we can split them apart so we factored out that K squared so that we could simplify it what that means is that we're gonna get x equals MK plus or minus the square root of K squared is K but we still have a square root with M squared minus 4 H over K all over 2k that's also pretty nice because we can simplify these case if we factor out the K and simplify that means that every term here and every term of the denominator we can divide by K we simplify it we get and plus or minus square root of M squared minus four H over K all over two and you know who cares this is really important and I want you to notice what's up there right now when we started this we said logistic equation has a constant and a constant so this actually concept in the concept you can do very much the same thing get a different sign in there that's not all that would happen only thing of it happen different here than here is that negative won't be there so all right so we went through we did quadratic form we to the very end and look at the quadratic form of what it gave us it said your critical points the the things that really matter here your equilibrium solutions depend on let's see that's a constant that's a constant that's a constant the four is a constant the two is a constant the only thing up here that is a variable that can affect anything is how you were harvesting or stocking that right there that H whatever that H happens to be is going to determine your critical points do you see it do you see how that age really really affects stuff constant constant constant constant constant constant variable the H is only thing is gonna fix critical points here now how does it work well let's suppose that the inside of your square root your radicand let's suppose that's positive so let's suppose your H is small enough you're harvesting you're harvesting few enough creatures or other population whatever it is you're harvesting feeling of creatures that this is positive if this is positive then what you get out of it you get a constant plus or minus some other real constant divided by two you get two solutions man this goes all the way back to like an intermediate algebra when you first start using quadratic form and they go hey if your discriminant is positive you get two real answers exactly and it still matters if you're harvesting few enough out of your population that this is positive the square root of a positive number is a real number that means you're adding and subtracting a real number you will get two critical points now let's suppose that this H is such a number that the inside of your square root is zero remember that with your parabolas your parabola is if you have this square root at zero you get plus or minus zero you get one solution give this vertex that's wherever the vertex is so if this H is such a number that you get zero inside that radical then an plus or minus zero over two would be one critical point and you would get a semi stable equilibrium solution we're above it you'd either go to it or go away from it below you go either to it or away from it and depends on whether you start with logistic or explosion extinction we look at that in a second - what if your H you're harvesting so much that this inside your radical is negative wait a minute what's the square root of a negative number well it's not a real number that means that you even have no real solutions that means you would have no critical points you are either going to explode or become extended there will be no equilibrium solution at all remember that no critical points no equilibrium solution so solving the quadratic formula shows us that our critical points are heavily dependent on our stocking and harvesting number so let's let's go through each of these cases let's suppose that that this is positive so I'm going to erase this we're going to come back up right to here no could you fast we're getting excited about this pretty cool so suppose that N squared minus four H over K is positive if that's positive we just went through it one more time if this is positive then we're going to add and subtract a real number we'll get two critical points we'll get two critical points that means we get two solutions X would equal two different numbers here two critical points that means that we could factor this do you remember that like solutions equal roots equal factors if you have a solution or real solution you have a factor to this which means that we could let's call these critical points or good enough letters and and Candis Cayne don't wanna use age can use down P N and P so if we have two critical points N and P then what would happen is that we can factor this so X would equal and and X equal P two critical points do you remember that if we have solutions if we have roots of it zeros then roots or zeros equal factors man if you say x equals n some sort of some sort of solution some number here that we have X to equal eight a critical point and or an end a critical point P by adding and subtracting a real number then x equals and says yeah just subtract 10x minus n would be a factor if x equals P another critical point the next - Pete would be its factor let's factor this thing then so if our inside of our square root is positive and we get two critical points then we get to factors to this guy this thing right here let's factor that then zero two equal two factors X minus N and X minus P I'm gonna stop right there this can get real confusing a lot of theory it's pretty hopefully well explained to you but this is gonna be a little weird we're talking out a lot of different letters so one more time I know I've done this three times already but it's really important that you get it logistic equation has your M first explosion extinction has your M last this is going to create a funnel this is gonna create a spout for you we talked about why couple times already if we say now we're harvesting then our critical points are no longer found easy it's not as easy as this because this is already factored for you set it equal to 0 u 0 M 0 M that's a piece of cake when we start subtracting or adding some negative subtracting then we start altering it or altering our critical points that are harder to find and we use the quadratic formula so as soon as you start subtracting you go right we'll distribute you have a quadratic equation if we factor in a negative and use a quadratic formula then the whether or not we get critical points even and what they are depends on your honor H if our H is such that the inside is positive we were going to add and subtract and get two critical points now those critical points whatever they are x equals N and P they are going to be equilibrium solutions for us like all of our critical points are there going to be equilibrium solutions well they also create factors they tell you that this could be some number that you can take our quadratic equation that we did the formula on and you can factor it so if we factored and say hey there's our negative I told you even come back to it and we factor this as critical point factor as the factors we know they have to be and we say all right [Music] then if I distribute a negative not to both remember this negative search to one or the other doesn't matter which I distribute the negative that we get positive and minus X X minus P and what we end up getting is a combination of both of these ideas this is fantastic if you understand if you understood that when X is bigger than M you decrease when X is less than n you increase when X is more than them you increase and with X is less than n your decrease then this puts both of these together it says look looking look at it we have the N minus X that's very much a logistic equation idea I mean X minus P that's very much this explosion extinction idea so what goes on here is we say all right so we have n and we have P you're gonna ask well which one why eyes and above py speed above and they're arbitrary letters that we're using so one of them is gonna be on so the let's call and the greater list let's say that let's define that so that nmp 4-h small enough is going to give us something where MMPR between 0 & M that's going to make this work a little bit better for us that way we can say ok and it's the bigger critical point and P is a smaller one so that we can put them on a graph appropriately and let's distribute the negative to the one that has the end it's going to make it look like the logistic equation for us if they were reversed we would distribute this to the P and have that big it would be a bigger critical point so anyhow this right here says that if your X is greater than Y or n then we would get some sort of a negative now with P being less than n excellent well are let's see if X is what I just said if X is greater than n up here our initial value is greater than n then this would be negative but if X is greater than and it's also greater than P this would be positive negative times a positive the positive says we would be decreasing how about between an NP if X so 0 is less than n this right here is positive if X of 0 is greater than P so between here then this is positive we get something that is increasing if X is less than P okay X is less than P that's a positive sure because n is greater than then that X this would be a negative X is less than P the Sevilla native so positive times a negative is a negative this is what is going to happen if you start harvesting from a logistic equation that's what's gonna happen so we remember we did we took a logistic equation said I'm gonna harvest from it and I'm gonna harvest in such a way that this becomes positive well what's what do you mean that how would that be positive what would H have to be for that to be positive well H could be negative so you're stalking this number should be positive isn't it because if you're if you're adding to this if you're subtracting and theyyou so you're basically you're adding to this then this would be positive positive plus deposits getting the positive so if we're stalking or we're not harvesting enough to make this zero or negative then we're gonna get a picture just like this it should make sense because what we're really doing is 40 minus a this idea of logistic explosion extinction if we start harvesting so if we have harvests in such a way that this is positive we are going to get this picture we're going to get something that has a equal of the solution at two critical points on the top one we're going to have a funnel on the bottom we're gonna have a spout if we start above and will shrink to it if we start between P and n will grow to n if we start below P we're gonna go extinct is does that make sense I hope that makes it make sense on your initial your initial conditions so if we have this H that's if we have an H that's that's constant over time and we have an initial population what's gonna happen to our puppets long run it's going to depend on that initial population here's what I mean like that so let's suppose that we starts talking but there's not enough to begin with to support any sort of death rate or something like that and no matter what if we start below this a certain threshold solution this certain threshold then we're going to decrease we're gonna go extinct because we're we don't have enough of a population to support what's what's there anyhow and the stockings or harvesting is not going to help us at all if we're between P and n then we have some sort of a threshold where when we're above it we're going to increase so we have an ethical population to start with that it's supported the death rate that's happening and the stocking is going to increase it so that would be some sort of an increase until we get to n if we have something greater than that then we have a lot of population right so it's something something greater than and our stocking up harvesting is going to decrease that until we get to this equilibria version of n so we have this threshold solution equilibrium at a threshold where we're going away from it equilibrium but a limiting population where we're going to go to it I hope that makes sense to you because we're gonna consider two more cases right now so we looked at how what happens when this is positive so H is small enough that this is positive either we're stocking over not harvesting too much does that make sense stalking is kind of anti harvesting so we're in the long run now now you might have a question what if what if we're stalking that we're also fishing well you would look at the net so you look at what is going on in the long run you're stalking a thousand fish people are pulling out 1,500 well then you would be harvesting 500 does that make sense so we look at harvesting and stalking as a net a net gain loss so if we're harvesting few enough fish that this is positive we get two critical points and you're gonna get a fun waterspout I'm gonna talk about a little bit if we start harvesting your stocking starting with the explosion extinction you switch a switch around now what happens if we get zero so just like the discriminant tells you if this equals zero you're going to get one critical point your critical point is going to be exactly M a plus or minus zero over two you get one critical point and that critical point happens at let's see if that's zero and one or two it's going to happen around that critical point well if we look at one critical point of M over two well we're going to be decreasing and decreasing we get a semi stable critical point I think I mentioned that at the very beginning that we're going to get a fun one spout if we have one critical point we get the semi stable what now what happens if this is negative if that's negative but we have no real solution we would have no critical point we have no equilibrium solution and we're going to do one of two things that kind of where we start we're either going to explode in population or we're going to go extinct in population so if this is so big that this becomes negative then your population is going to go extinct we're basically going to give this picture somehow we're going to have an extinct population you're gonna decrease now you'd be a little bit different than that but the long story made real short is that when you start looking at harvesting or stocking you don't have something simple like critical points that are easy to find this quadratic formula we use says that your points depend on H if you have a small enough H we're gonna get two critical points if you have an H that gets you a well zero inside your radical you get one critical point and it's gonna be semi stable and if you have an H it's so big so you're harvesting so much this is negative you're outpatient your population your population is going to go extinct you're not stopping enough to when you're sucking off you're harvesting so much in net that you're going to go extinct there's no critical points at all what I want to do right now is go through an actual example to show you how all of this works alright so these are fairly quick because we kind of done all the work up here already all we're talking about is critical points and how that age how the harvesting is talking to fix that so what I'm gonna do right now is I'm going to show you that this is this Sam you second model we've already done a lot of the work could you just identify your K and your M and plug it in yep we're gonna do that and I'm gonna go through the quadratic formula again with this to show you that that's probably a little easier to do than doing quadratic formula for the beginning so if that right there is a differential equation and it's modeled really on the logistic equation that we are harvesting from remember that negative harvesting is stocking so it's the same thing this is just a logistic equation that we are harvesting from so let's identify what the K is and what the ana is our K here is this number in front then our K is 110 and our M 10 which it noticed this is important this right this number right here's gonna be five if when we're done and your bottom like two is gonna be five that's going to be an equilibrium solution that's gonna be a critical point it's going to be a very important point for us actually so so with these two numbers could we just say hey since this is the solution to this type of equation could we say that our critical points are going to be at 10 plus or minus 100 that's 10 squared minus 4 H you don't know H is or try to see how H go affects this over 110 don't pretend you over - then our critical points would be 10 plus or minus 100 - 4 th all over 2 you can do a little more work with this if you want to but this really matter you get back there at the 10 and simplify that a little bit but we don't we don't have to our critical points are going to be exactly what that is so I hope you know what let's do a different way if you wanted to do quadratic formula from here which you can totally do then what we would do is we simplified this we would distribute one negative x yeah and set equal to zero maybe multiply everything through by ten or probably factored out him that he could factor out the 110 ball so factor out a negative and do the quadratic formula so let's see negative B plus or minus B squared minus four times a times C ten H all over two times a all right well that's ten plus or minus 100 minus or th all over two which way is easier it kind of depends if you've already done this work with the quadratic formula from the general logistic equation upon which we're harvesting that's really easy to plug in your M in your cake obviously if not it's a lot easier to do the quadratic formula from right here so we just simplify the governor of a fraction we do the quadratic formula and you end up getting exactly the same thing now that's great but that's just a little bit of algebra finding what the critical points would be the important thing what I want you to get you want to get you to understand is that your critical points aren't dependent on your H so let's look at it the big deal here is when this is zero positive or negative so let's set this equal to zero and let's see what this number becomes so I'm taking a look at this 100 minus 4 th and saying when that's zero that that right there that that value we have a name for in just a minute that value of H is really important if we have something above that we're going to get two critical points if we have something below that was sorry if you have something above that we're going to get no critical points equal to zero we're gonna get one critical when sequel's you're really good I'm critical point if this is negative so needs to blow that value were going to get two critical points I think it said that completely backwards at first time and so let's take a look at it and as we go through so we're looking at the same whatever this H is is a really really important number we have a name for it in just a minute but in this H so let's solve for it right now if this H is divided by 48 pads if our H is exactly five house what's gonna help me if this is exactly five halves this is zero let's say the H is more than five halves if H is more than five halves this is negative if H is less than five house this is positive this H what I want to get you to see is this H is a huge number for us obviously in real life how much we are harvesting is incredibly important if we want things to survive if you take too much of something it's gonna die that's just the fact of it you take too much of something no matter what you you take too much of something matter what your population is it's gonna die out if you take too much of something depend on what your population is it's gonna die out how parents gonna reach a level so so our harvesting in real life in this real life application what I've done the last like 13 videos it's getting into these points this stuff is real and and as as people who are kind of in charge of certain arenas of life we make sure that we're in a sustainable area like fishing game does this is sort of thing a lot if you never know what fishing game is they're the department that kind of monitors how much you can finish where you can finish what you can finish what you can hunt what you can do so anyhow the point and I don't want to get all into that but the point of this is that how much you're harvesting really or how much you're stocking really affects what's happening with your populations so let's suppose that H is greater than five hats if you're harvesting more than two and a half parts of your population per year two and a half whatever to have hundreds to have thousands to millions whatever happens to be two and a half units of population per unit of time if you're harvesting more than that then if you're harvesting more than that this is going to be negative you have no critical points your population will done so if RH is too much for harvesting too much we will not have a critical point so this is this values of this five house it's like your your breaking point the name for it it's called a bifurcation point if you're harvesting more than that then this is negative do you see it they're harvesting more than that this is negative you have no critical points because you have no real numbers and your population will decline a negative thing really think it's going to go this early if H equals five halves you have one critical point what's going to happen if H equals five halves you have one critical point you can see it right here the critical point would be 10 divided by two oh my gosh we can that M over two you would get 10 over 2 or simply by default but what's gonna happen with that if you have your harvesting set at exactly two and a half units of population per unit of time eventually you're going to people your initial your initial population if you start something you're going to equal five and you start above that the critical point or you're going to go extinct the view of the hood so if you're harvesting exactly five halves then your what your population is going to do ultimately depends on what you so if we started above five then harvesting is going to say I'm going to shrink to that that limiting popular that limiting population it's kind of a threshold and lemonade solution all at once so it's a nice table critical point if I start above that five my harvesting is going to say okay if I start above that it's going to decrease naturally that would be the case so it's so suppose suppose you have like a lot of population but you're harvesting more than they can more than the rate of which they can grow that at the same rate so what's going to happen as your population is going to decline so if you're harvesting that amount it's gonna decline until you reach this thing that eight consisting so why why would that that be the case maybe there's so many up here that they're eating a lot of food which is they're dying off but you're also harvesting so eventually that that's gonna level out so you you're harvesting enough so that they're not killing any to themselves by eating all the food that's there so that would level out that's fine now what if you have less than than five but you harvest the same amount well if you have less than that that the initial population of five then or your population initial elevations I survive then your harvesting so much that they can't breed fast enough and that's going to go extinct so again if we have something if we're harvesting too much data if we're harvesting just right at five halves this right at two and a half years population per unit time then it depends on what your initial condition is if we did initially started about you if you're above you're gonna string two if you're below this five this group point you're going to go extinct let's say that we're harvesting less than five halves which includes negative values of harvesting or stalking then we get to critical points for whatever those critical points happen to be and you could you could find them pretty easily we have a big one we have a small one and the for harvesting less than two and a half units population per unit we're going to be in a stable and unstable critical point we're going to get a limiting population or a threshold of limiting solution with limited population or a threshold solution so if we start below the bottom critical point you're going to go extinct whether you stock or not whether you're harvesting or stopping there's not enough population to support it that's going to go extinct if you start between MMP your stocking or harvesting there's enough birth rates or whatever is happening here it's going to grow the population only to a point until where maybe there's so many that we start having competition for food and they're dying off themselves we start above that they're either whether you're harvesting or stalking there's too many to support there's not enough food whatever the assistance system is doing here they're gonna die off to that end this is what is going to happen this is why harvesting is so important to this model we saw logistic harvesting is going to certainly affect that I hope you've explained the nature of how you're harvesting affects your critical points this is a huge deal what this value five-halves as two and a half is it's called a bifurcation point and what that means is that it affects the quality of your outcome so if you're above equal to or below that bifurcation point whatever your partnership something is it's going to affect you ultimately your outcome and it's a big deal so it affects the number of critical points and affects what's happened around those critical points and if X was happening to populations so that that name when you hear that bifurcation point that's what's talking about where what we're harvesters talking is really affecting what's going on let's go through one more example where we can go all the way through to I'll deal with a not a logistic start will deal with a explosive extinctions beginning and we'll talk about how stalking would affect that all right last one let's take a look at this differential equation let's see what it really looks like would you think the best logistic or explosion extinction it doesn't look like this this is logistic where we have a fixed positive number we're subtracting from it this is explosion extinction so we can do this right there we are either going to explode or we're gonna go extinct around that five thank you man you should be able to see it you should see that five would be a critical point that above five exploded below five extinct now what's talking deal stocking stock here well if this is different what's happening is we don't have an M minus X we have an X minus M and we're sort of anti stocking so we're opposite of stocking us are uh anti Hurston we're opposite of harvesting this would be a stocking solution where where you stalking not stalking sounds sick so we're doing this for putting digs in just so you know there's another one somewhere so anyway we are we're stalking on lake we're stalking something we're putting creatures into some sort of a habitat is it always good not necessarily it doesn't have to always be good it could be bad it could be good but so what we're doing is a reverse or an anti harvesting what we can expect to happen is for these pictures to all reverse themselves that's what's going to happen well let's see let's see about it so we are gonna solve this I want to do the the quadratic equation from scratch because I'm dealing with this I'm gonna do it from just this one example here and let's go ahead and see what happens so when we set this equal to zero and we distribute now you don't have a good turn let's type equals zero first you worth a hundred multiply everything by 100 that's gonna be cancel that and 100's and distribute we see something different right off the bat we see that there's no negative out front and what that what that did do you remember that what I did what that did is that that negative reversed one of the one of the critical value the the fact that at that critical point in it he was the the end that we reversed well it's not going to happen here so we're looking at a slightly different sort of a picture and when we do our differential equation oh let's see negative 5 negative 5 squared 4 times a times C 2 times a and simplify that's what your critical points are going to be for this differential equation and if X references in our population our population really depends on how much you're stalking if that s is excuse me to positive that s is to positive number this will give you a negative you have no critical points how can you stop and go instinct you wouldn't these would be reversed so if you are stalking to such a point now let's be free let's figure out what that bifurcation point is so 2025 minus 400 equals zero that's going to give us a bifurcation point this this value that when we're above below or equal to it affects the outcome of our population and X would equal 1/16 that doesn't mean that means that that's 1/16 of a unit of population per unit time so our units population are in like hundreds maybe that 116 to 100 per pot the per unit of time that we would be putting into this population anti harvesting all right well what's what's going on here if we are above 1/16 greater than that if we're stalking more than 1/16 of the unit of population per unit time and this here would be negative we'd have no critical points a radicand negative discriminant would be negative or we have no critical points and we would have if there's no critical points there's no equilibrium solution you've got to get that we wouldn't have this picture we would have the reverse we would be exploding which says if we're stalking too much sounds like stalking starts as much as you can well that's not true if we stalk so much in a lake or some sort of system all the foods can be gone well once they reproduce to a point that's why this doesn't go extinct all it kind of has this gradual thing is okay we're going to grow and then it's gonna grow exponentially not be good um what's gonna happen is they're gonna eat all the food there's no food left even though the population looks like it's going to explode it doesn't explode forever does it that's called a doomsday thing if you had this body of water and it has a finite amount of food and or food that reproduces but only supports a certain level fish and you start stalking it with fish they're gonna eat all the food and they're gonna reproduce a lot but so much that they're gonna end up dying out from starvation that's what would happen if we over stock so I don't want to do that so if we stalk so much that this is and it's so big enough that this is negative we have no critical points our population does explode but then it goes so far what if we stock exactly equal to the bifurcation point then we have one critical point and that critical point would be five as well if we have five halves let's see what's going to happen then what our population does is based on our initial values so we're where we start if we start above two and a half our population is going to explode low doesn't make sense even if you have a fairly large population and then you start stocking it oh and a harvesting it's going to explode or even though your stock in it maybe there's not enough to support it no that's wrong awesome awesome let me start below that your stocking enough to support it so whatever we have as far as our initial population is going to determine what happens to our population as a whole with our buy fruit with a stocking equal to your bifurcation depends on your initial condition if you're above your critical point you can explode not a great thing if you're below a critical point you're going to reach reach to whatever that limiting population is that's that sort of threshold it's a threshold solution for something above your critical point and in limited population for some people it's a semi stable and lastly what if our stocking is less than our bifurcation point of 116 there were in two ribbons and that picture is going to reverse so what would happen is we would have a this two critical points PNN but our picture is going to be different what I wanted you to see is that much much like the logistic and explosion extinction gave us different original pictures general solutions so does it when were harvesting and stopping so if we starts talking to this explosion extinction the equation we're gonna get pictures that are very similar to logistic just just reversed I just wanted to make sense to you I wanted to make sense that when we start stalking or harvesting it really is important that bifurcation value that it's really important to watch that especially in like real-life situations where we don't we really don't want explosion of species we don't want extinction of species we need a harvest in stock responsibly according to the difference equations to make sure that that that happens so hopefully made it clear that the bifurcation point is valuable sometimes we have if we stock or harvest too much we start exploding or extinct in a matter what if we stock or harvest exactly equal to a bifurcation point really depends on your initial condition was going to have at your population and as does it if you have stalking or harvesting less than an amount it really depends on where you start so stalking less than 1/16 if we start below our critical value we're going to reach it between we're going to drop to it above we're going to exclude and if it really just depends on your initial condition so I hope that makes sense we wrapped up population we talked a ton about it at this point what really should be making sense is the the connection between critical points that we saw last time last few videos and now populations so those those critical those critical points of equilibrium solutions being above and below really really affects what your population is doing and whatever your population is and then harvesting and stalking can do the same thing so I hope it explained by vacation to you critical points the interplay between that we're gonna move on after this so other fun things I hope that you're having a great great time with the videos still and I'll see you next time you
