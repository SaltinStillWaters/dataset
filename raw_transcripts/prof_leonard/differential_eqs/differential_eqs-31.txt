Transcript for: Integrating Factor for Exact Differential Equations (Differential Equations 30)
hey there and welcome to another video our last video in fact on exact differential equations and we're going to talk about it so let me preface this with saying if you haven't watched the last two videos on what exact differential equations are and how to solve them you really need to do that because I'm not going to go explain what those are again uh what we're going to do is look at a very specific technique on how to solve some differential equations that aren't exact yet and we'll talk about an integrating fact and we'll learn that if we can make an integrating factor with just X's or just y's it's very easy very nice and will'll change something that's not quite an exact differential equation is something that is now you might have remembered we've used integrating factors before we did on some previous differential equations um several times but now we're going to apply them to exact differential equations and see what they look like so again watch those videos if you haven't done it then come back and see this one it's very interesting uh but you need a lot of background because I'm going to be using some terminology that if you haven't really heard or seen of exact difference of equations is not going to make a lot of sense so we're going to jump right into it and explore what this is um I'm going to go through a lot of theory at the beginning then three examples to show you exactly how to work it so what if you got a differential equation and it looks like it should be exact and that's why I say what if an exact differential equation isn't exactly exact what if you have this and these are not equal so what if you took the partial derivative of n with respect to Y and the partial derivative of n with respect to X and it's not coming out the same so the mixed partials are not the same saying this is not an exact differential equation from some sort of potential function that's continuous and differentiable on some sort of a region so what if that's not true can we make it true can we multiply by something that says Hey What If I multiply on both sides by some function of X and Y properly defined to make this thing an exact differential equation of some sort of potential function so well is that possible let's find out let's see if it's possible theoretically it should be possible all the time so what if we multiply [Music] by some function let's call it U on both sides so as to make this a differential equation that is exact and so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to show you that what we want to happen kind of drives what we um what we're looking for to make this exact this equation into an exact differential equation so let's let's start looking that at that so if we multiply both sides by some function of U I'm going to get a u here and a u here by distribution and 0 times some function of X and Y still going to be zero so our function U * MDX plus our function U this can be in terms of X and Y right now we'll talk about that later time ndy still equals z what we call that U of X this function in terms of um sorry U of X and Y this function in terms of X and Y or what we're going to learn later is that with both x's and y's this would be very very difficult so we're going to look at the cases where what if you can get exactly just X's or exactly just y's that's a lot nicer so what that U of X and Y is called is called an integrating factor it's something that U that lets us slightly change the form of a differential equation from what it is into what we want it to be now we did it several times before in a different few different sections but now we're going to use it for exact so very quick recap just make sure you you're with me I know that You' just watched the videoos so you should be uh just make sure so we have this thing that we really want to be an exact difference with the equation and if it is the mixed partials have to be equal if you check it and they're not equal that means that is not an exact differential equation or total differential of some sort of potential function so we're thinking how do we make it possible let's multiply by something that forces this to be possible is that even possible can we even do that well let's think about what we want to happen what we want to happen from our new form so this theoretical function that we multiplied let's let's think about what we want to happen what we want to happen is for this to be sort of our new M and for this to be sort of our new n so we still want the partial derivative of this entire piece with respect to Y we want that equal to this entire piece when we take a partial derivative with respect to X does that make sense to you I mean do do you get that that if we multiply by some sort of a function to make it exact it's still going to meet the properties of being an exact differential equation which means I need my mixed partials to be equal I need to be able to take this first piece and this just stands for some function of x's and y's okay I need to have this partial derivative with respect to Y to equal this partial derivative with respect to X and then we can guarantee that that was some sort of an exact differ of equation I still need that to happen so I still need to be able to take the partial derivative of this piece this function in terms of oh YY look x's and y's I still need this partial with respect to Y to equal this partial with respect to X in order to guarantee that this is of the form of an exact differential equation it guarantees it's coming from some potential function that we can find so now what in the world would that looks pretty crazy first of all and at the end of this I'm going to give you some better notation but right now it's important to see that this is in terms of X and Y both of them and so we're going to have to deal with some partial derivatives what we're going to go on and do in a minute because there there really shouldn't be any any suspense here in math what we're going to do is we're going to see that at the end of this if I say that kind of in the middle if I say that well what if this was just with respect to or just in terms of X would make it better or just in terms of Y would it make it better we're going to see yes and so we can simplify this a little bit but for right now to get the the feel of it here's what we would want we would need for the partial here with Y to be the partial here with X to guarantee exact now now what do you see what do you see do you see that you have a product and do you see that you have a product you're going to need to use the product rule so what we're what we're trying to do is we we're trying to solve for you we're trying to get some function of U that we will be able to know explicitly we're trying to find that um but in order to get down to the U it's all wrapped up in partial derivatives it's wrapped up with all sorts of stuff so let's take the partial derivative of this side with respect to Y this side with respect to X because that's what we want to be equal let's do it so the product rule says hey let's take the the um let's take the derivative of the first I'm going to drop the x's and y's but this still is a function of X and Y right now partial derivative of U with respect to Y so derivative of the first times the second plus the first which is just our U time the second the partial derivative of M with respect to Y we're just using a product rule derivative the first * the second plus the first times the derivative of the second do the same thing on the right hand side the partial derivative of the first time the second plus the 1 which is just U function of U time the partial derivative of n with respect to X so we've said this is what we need to have happen for an exact differential equation to be exact for some potential function we said well let's try to solve for you and that's what we're doing right now we're trying to solve for you okay uh well if I'm trying to do that then maybe I I need to actually perform the the partial derivative here and do the product rule all right so if I'm trying to solve for you it makes sense to maybe let's group our 's on one side and group everything else that doesn't have 's on the other side so we can Factor so let's do that let's subtract this over here subtract this over here so moving some things around I'm going to keep my U * the partial derivative of M with respect to Y that's going to stay there minus the U * the partial derivative of n with respect to X that's going to stay there on the right hand side so I kept this I subtracted this from both sides I'm going to keep this on the right hand side partial derivative of U with respect to x * n uh minus this partial of with respect to y * and just some algebraic manipulation we grouping our 's so 's on one side everything else on the other you're going to subtract two terms here now let's let's try to factor so if we factor out the U partial M with respect to Yus partial n with respect to X on the right hand side same thing we're not going to change that but we are going to talk about it right now why do we need to talk about this cuz that looks really nasty now theoretically yeah you could solve for you couldn't you just by dividing but but look at what's happening You' got a whole bunch of parcels all with you all with 's in them you got a u that is going to be solved it's really really ugly theoretically possible yeah um but very very difficult to actually make work effectively and often and so what we're looking for is man what what if we and granted this is a special case but what if we were what if we were able to find a u with just X's so if I look up here and say well what if I just what if I don't have a y so exact no multiply sure it would look like this now what do I want to have happen partial here with Y partial here with X but what if I chose a u that didn't have any y's in it so what if our U only had X's would that make a difference would that would that help us what if you only had X so so no y's think about what would happen if I took a partial derivative of this with respect to Y and this with respect to X but you only had x's and had no y's whatsoever this would still be valid that'd be fine because M can have x's and y's this would be fine this will be valad because n can have x's and y's partial derivative of U with respect to X would be fine because youu would only have X's but look at this the partial derivative of U with respect to Y If U only has X's you remember this man I hope you remember this that if you only has X's no Y at all and you take a partial derivative of a function that has no y's with respect to Y everything would be held constant it'd be like saying hey um take the derivative of this with respect to Y and you're going to go uh zero zero and zero zero exactly so if we choose a u that has just X's then this piece becomes zero 0 * m is still zero we basically annihilate that whole entire term you get do you get that do you understand that if U has just x's and no y's but the partial derivative of U with respect to Y would have to be zero that's an important concept to understand so we're understanding that if U has X's that thing's gone that's pretty cool that's going to simplify this a little bit later what I'm going to say is what if we had chosen to have U equals only y instead of x's well then this piece would be zero and so I'm going to give you two different formulas one of which occurs with what we're doing now if you use only x's and no y's but the other one would be what if you came back to here I'm not going to show both and what if you had y's but not X's then this would be zero and we're just going to basically flip-flop a couple things it's not going to be that bad I promise it's not this is just all the theory behind it because when you see this formula in your textbook for the first time you go what in the world is that it's it's not that bad what you're doing is you're saying I need this to happen for exact difference of equations let's solve for you as much as we can and let's make a restriction on it let's say to make this nicer to make this possible really for us let's assume you only has X's then this is zero what do I what do I do now well hopefully you're with me still if not go back and rewatch that minute what do we do now now we make one other little alteration and it's right here and this is important for you to get if you only has x's and no y's Not only would the partial Dera of U with respect to Y be zero because there's no y's all the X beeld constant but the partial derivative of U with respect to X is no longer a partial because U only has X's you're literally finding the derivative of U with respect to X not a partial derivative do you guys do you get that so like if that if that doesn't have any y's you don't need to take a partial it's just literally hey take the derivative with respect to x no problem 3x2 + 1 that's not a partial derivative so this becomes DX that that's nice what why that ice that didn't seem so nice to me it looks about the same garbage well hey if you if you only has X's you just got rid of a whole term you didn't know how to deal with but secondly you changed a partial derivative of U with respect to X because it could have had y's into a derivative of U with respect to X because if you guarantee it only has X's then that's now not a partial you why is that important let's rewrite it let's look at it also keep in mind we're trying to come up with a formula we're not trying to get one U for everything but a formula on how to find U and so we're going to have some ugliness that's actually very nice notice this too I want you to see it when when they give you this different formula that this is found already and this is found already when you check to see if your mixed partials are equal so you go hey you know what this you would have checked that wouldn't you and this you would have checked that too so that that's already on your paper not even hard to find on the right hand side we get DX * n now keep in mind what n is n is not really a variable and this is sometimes where students get a little bit confused on the notation keep in mind that M and N are functions of X and Y so it's not a variable like P or something that you would say I need to do separable equations here separate my variabl n right now is a function of X and Y all right so what the variables are that we're treating are X and U because if you look at this and this is just brilliant right now this is a first derivative of U our variable our de independent sorry our dependent variable of X our independent variable so so wait a minute wait a minute if that's a variable and that's a derivative you're you're telling me this is a this is a differential equation yeah yeah because we held x constant and I know there's a lot of theory here but because we held x constant we were able to change this partial into a a real first derivative and if you solve for that first derivative you can get I mean look at it if you got the first derivative of U with respect to X and you got a u over here and all of this other stuff is in terms of x's and y's then can't you do this by a separation of variables can we get our U on one side or xdx on the other side remember n and all this stuff has x's in it let's just group that and let's see what happens so what I'm going to do right now is I'm I'm going to switch sides because we typically in every example we've had we've had our Udu sorry um D DX on one side our derivative on one side and all the things on the other side um so I'm going to switch that before I start moving a whole bunch of things around okay I'm going to go through it one more time because every time my teachers in front of real students well I guess you are students right uh sorry every time I teach this in front of students who are watching this for the first time um there's always a question about about that they go why why why is this possible so last time all the way through all the way through because you need to get it in order for you to understand why this equation I'm about to give you Works um so what if exacts not exact what if your mixed partials are not equal multiply by something okay great what do you want you want the mixed partials of this new differential equation to be equal that's what you want to happen what we're solving for is the U that will force this to happen and we go okay um product rule no problem maybe group our use because we're trying to solve for you awesome all right we get this we look at and go that's really hard that's really difficult because I have partial Dera of you with respect to two different variables and then we say well what if we consider two cases case one where there are only X's then a partial derivative with Y would be zero and this would no longer be part the second case is what if you only had y's this would be zero this would be not a partial and that would give us our second equation I'm going give you just a moment so all right well oh my gosh if that's not a partial that's a first Der with respect to X I have a differential equation and now we're solving it we're saying all right this is awesome just like day one with separable equations so all right what do we do well we get our DX on one side and and then what we're going to look at is say let's try to get our U's du and all of our X or stuff that has X's DX on other side so so we got U oh there's a u maybe we divide both sides by U and then we want all the junk that has X's that has X's that could have X's this could have X's so we're going to keep this Over N DX I'm looking at it it's a first order differential equation this is my treated as my dependent variable this is my treated as my independent so I'm getting my u du/ u I'm getting my everything that could possibly have X's all of these X's this could have an X so all of these X's DX understand this is where the question comes from does what is n is n a variable no no n is a function all right and N is this little piece that has x's in it potentially and so we're going to have that this is a function that has potentially x's and so are the partial derivatives so we group everything that has X is DX we group our U du we go oh my gosh man this is like close to day one which is really neat that something as advanced as this is is from day one we do an integral of both sides and we say hey Ln equals this integral and I'm not going to Sol there's no way to solve it right now I don't know what these functions are remember we're getting a formula and so we're keeping it as general as possible the only thing that we've said the only restriction we've said is that well what what's the only thing we've said about this process so far we said that my U only has X's so remember that my U only has X's I'm going to check for that in our first example they go okay that's that's still really nasty um I've got this lnu how do I get get rid of the uh the Ln and you go oh yeah I would need an exponential and man this is me cool when you do an exponential we would on both sides so e e you would get U equals e to the integral of nasty stuff you go you know um that looks really familiar do you remember do you remember you remember remember integrating factor of row and it was um e to the integral of PX do you remember that e to the that looks very similar so here's what we've done we've said this is the U that's going to be necessary to actually make this thing turn into an exact differential equation of some potential function because our mixed partials would be equal if equals this that's rad that's awesome um the only restriction here that you need to write down and you really need to understand this is this is for a u with no y's X's only a you with no y only X how it would change and then I'm going to give you a shortened version of this how it would change is this if you had for um for no X's only y's we'd still get a e we'd still get an integral all that happens is that you would actually flip flop these and that would be an M hopefully that makes sense maybe you can walk yourself through that you'd still have an M you'd have an m and not an N so this would be zero this would not youd end up dividing by m do you see it also you'd have this uh because that's a negative we'd have to flip something around to get that not being a negative so you'd end up dividing byga M or you'd solve this in a different different order than I did and then these would be out of order so for a u with no x's and only y's we change this and that would be an m and of course we'd have a Dy why well that if this was zero this wasn't if we had only y's and no X's uh well then gone and then this would be a d Dy and we'd integrate with respect to Y obviously because we'd have only y's where we had only X's here this is for no y's sorry no X's only y's now the process is actually pretty easy um what we're going to be doing is we're going to look at this and say hey let's check our mixed partials if they're exact we're done if they're not exact let's do a comparison let's see if this gives us only X's or this gives us only y's and so we're going to do two different things we're going to subtract partial of M with respect to Y minus partial of n respect to X M over n and see what that gives us if it has both x's and y's it's not a good choice and then we're going to reverse it and do partial n with respect to xus partial n with respect to Y and divide it by m and if that gives us either well we'll see which one gives us just the variable we're looking for and whatever one works that's the one we're going to go with with our integrating Factor we'll take e to the integral of that and then we multiply the whole exact different we make it an exact differential equation through that multiplication now I promised you I was going to make this a bit easier but I want to make sure you see it I want to make sure that you're okay through here so if you're not you really need to understand the product rule the hey make um U X's only get rid of a couple things that changes to an actual derivative with respect to X that's an important important concept it's no longer partial and we do the reverse for this one so how to make the formula easier cuz man when you look in the textbook uh this is basically what they're what they're going to give you right here they say that's that's what you do and that's true but maybe to make it a little nicer what exactly is the partial derivative of n with respect to Y um it's the thing that you check right here it's the same thing so when you even check it's your first step to see whether or not you have an exact differential equation you are doing this right off the bat so it's not extra work minus and you're doing this right here that is what that is so you're checking your mixed partials right at the bat so to find your integrating Factor really all you do is you subtract them and you divide by the thing where you got your your last partial so partial y minus partial X and then divide by partial of n respect to Yus partial n with respect to x/ by the n and then this right here if this is in terms of x's only you take an integral with respect to X and you take e to that for X's or for y's what would happen well then our integrating Factor would be e to some integral but it's the same thing in reverse right there this is your mixed partials right there this is the partial der of n respect to x minus the partial der of M with respect to Y divided by the M this time and then with respect to why that's how I really would like you to think of it I don't want this to be crazy hard I I gave you the crazy hard stuff to show you why it works to show you that we guaranteed that it worked this is a this is really a proof If we um if we show that there are no no y's or vice versa there are no X's that this is going to be an integrating Factor that's going to make this work we we guaranteed it because we said let's multiply by it let's show that's what we want to happen then we solve for the thing that's going to make it happen we solve for the thing that's going to force this to be an exact difference equation really neat stuff and we said if this is true with no x no y's or no X's then we can find that it will be an exact differential equation some potential function and we can go and solve it with the techniques we already know so the solving part of this is going to be very very fast I spent a long time going through that that proof for you but now how you think about it should not be this difficult how you think about it should be I'm going to check my mixed partials so this is the thought process I'm going to check my mixed partials um if they're equal I'm I'm good okay I'm going to use the techniques I learned in the last two videos if they're not equal what I'm going to do is I'm going to start with this one X's are generally easier for us to kind of think about I'm going to start with this one I'm going to subtract my partials I'm going to divide by n I'm going to see if it gives me something with only X's if it does I'm going to multiply everything by E to that e to the interal of that um if it doesn't then I'm going to do it this way I'm going to say okay let's reverse it let's subtract them in an opposite order and let's divide by m this time and if that gives me something that only y's I'm going to integrate e to that multiply my my function or my difference of equation and get an exact difference of equation is going to work so what I'm going to do I'm going to rewrite these on the board we're go through three examples just one at a time U the checking is the hardest part the integrating Factor understanding um which one you use it once we get done with the videos will be very obvious but at first it's kind of difficult to see that and so we're going to spend some time on that and I'll be right back all right I'm ready I hope you're ready let's go through this and let's learn how to change something that's not an exact differ differential equation into one that is so let's take a look at it is it an ex exact differential equation you can't say that just by looking at the form that's not the way this works we have to check the mixed partials to make sure it's coming from some some sort of potential function that is continuous and differentiable in some sort of region right now it's not and let let's show that so I'm not going to write out the MN partial derivatives explicitly we did that in the last few videos and that should be very very comfortable with you what we're looking for now is we're looking to understand how to get this to fit that exact differential equation model so I might write something like that would be my M and that would be my n If This Were an exact differen equation we're going to check the partials right now so is the partial derivative of M with respect to Y which is 2x equal to the partial derivative of n with respect to X which is -6 x and you go yeah no those those are those are clearly not the same what that means this is not an exact differential equation these are not equal also if you like the notation of partial derivative M with respect to y or partial derivative n with respect to X that's fine it just gets a little bit cumbersome to right but that's exactly what these things mean if you like that formula better that's that's fine with me I personally because we have to write it a lot uh I'm going to use the the M subscript y to represent the partial of M with respect to Y and N subscript X to represent partial of m n with respect to to X so these aren't the same so Y what man that's not exact difference to equation how in the world can I make it work can I find an integrated factor and went through the whole process so here's the idea we're going to start with this one and we're just going to see hey if I do this am I going to get a function with only X's if so then I use that if not not I'm going to do this one and say if I do this do I get a function with only y's and if so then I use this so it's kind of like a check I start with this one because we're more comfortable with u with respect to X sort of things so I'm going to start with that one let's check to see if the first the derivative of n with respect to Y minus the partial with respect to X of n Over N let's see let's see what that is so for us all we're doing we're not doing anything new all we're doing is saying let's take this piece minus this piece / this piece 2x - -6x / y^2 - 3x^2 some of you will get very good at this very quick and you'll be able to do it in your head and it's not that hard because when you look at it you all all you're checking for is whether you're going to end in all X's here is there any way to get rid of that y like at all well no then there's this is not a good choice because no matter what you do and don't try too it's hard for me a Matthew to say don't try too hard but don't try to so hard to make this work into only X's without I mean just some simple factoring should do it if it's going to be possible so that would be 8X that would be something with a y That's not going to cancel you cannot factor that very easily and so we say no this is not a good choice for us so not exact but this is not giving us a function of U that's just in terms of X so let's try the other one let's let's do so X only did not work nope so let's try y only if we're going to have a function of Y only it's got to fit this model where i' have partial of n with respect to x minus partial of n with respect to Y / M so in other words you have flip-flop it this P sorry U this piece minus this piece divid by this piece and like I said sometimes you're just going to look at it and say hey this is going to work out real nicely because what we want and this is not an X this is a no what we want is for everything except for our y to cancel so here you want only X's here you want only y's and we see that that's going to work so this gives us us -8x over 2x y oh my gosh that's nice this is 4 over y now listen this is not your integrating Factor what you have to do is say all right now now that I've determined that there is a function in terms of just y as a matter of fact this right here says that's only in y's I can straight up integrate that you found the inside of that integral so what we know is that if our e if our sorry r u is e to the integral of thetive of n respect to xus of n respect to Y all over M Dy you've now found this piece that piece right there that is4 y so this is not your integrating Factor but what it does it gives you the ability to integrate pretty easily it's going to look very similar to linear with respect to y That's the only variable we have that would be well4 Ln y e to the Ln 1 no no it's not Ln to 1 y 4 and so we're going to get u = 1 over y 4 we've done this many times I know I'm going through it fairly quickly but this is really old stuff as far as doing this piece of it so again uh since it's our first example you checked you just check it's the same thing you do anyway right so check to see if you have an exact differential equation mix partials if you don't if you do don't do any of this garbage man if you don't try this minus this over this if it's only X's you're good if it's not try this minus this over that so the opposite way exactly if that's only y's you're good integrate take e to that and that right there so this is the inside integrate got it take e to that simplify that right there is your integrating Factor let's see how this plays out so if that's your integrated Factor where we started was is right here and if we multiply everything multiply everything by that integrating Factor man not4 y but e to the integral of that that's how the integrating Factor works we just found the inside piece integrate e to that gives us integrating factor of 1 y 4 let's multiply everything by 1 over y 4th again you're going to get that statement of make domain restrictions where appropriate or assume that what what you need to have is not um is not zero so we know why can't be zero and if we if we distribute everything here we're going to get this 2x over y 3r plus I'm Distributing here and here remember this would distribute here but you multiply through that 1 y^ 2us 3x^2 over y 4 and yes you need parentheses here DX Dy and still Z you know what you should do now just for your own edification just to see it take the next partials again this is your new M with respect to Y let's see that would be 2x y3r I bring down3 that's -6 x y4 would be over y 4 and this would be your new n with respect to X that would be zero look at that with respect to X that would be 6X y 4th what the heck that actually works this guarantees you that integrating Factor because we proved it that guarantees you that if you can make the first one with x's only or the second one with y's only it's going to make an exact differential equation for you that's awesome theoretically if you use both variables it happens all the time um but here you go hey that that worked that's now an exact differential equation and you go through it exactly the same way that you learned in last two videos so the way that we go through this is that we look at which one of these would be easier to integrate are you going to integrate this with respect to X or this with respect to Y this looks way easier to integrate with respect to X so we're going to pick that one remember what this is this now is the integral of the function we're looking for sorry the derivative of the function we're looking for with respect to X which means that our function itself well that's the integral of this with respect to X and that's really nice that means that we're going to get x2 over YB but we're also going to get some sort of a function that could have y's in it remember that that man this is the first Der of a function with respect to X and exact difference of equation guarantees that so if I do an integral and undo the X part so with respect to X I'm going to get a very easy integral to do but I'm going to get a a function of Y sorry it's not derivative yet think the next step a a function of Y that if I took a partial derivative of this this would go to zero since this is based on a partial der F respect to X we have to show that any constants that any terms that had y's in them would be held constant now the next step is let's take a partial derivative of f with respect to Y well that would be that whole - 3x^2 y 4 plus the first derivative of G with respect to Y and the reason why we do that we integrate M with respect to X take a derivative with respect to Y and set it equal to and because that's exactly what this means this means hey this is the partial derivative of f with respect to Y okay this is the function of F that we're looking for take the Der respect to Y but when we do that we know that that also has to equal this piece also has to equal our new um n if you will so those things being equal if we subtract or add that - 3x^2 y 4 this is gone and our first derivative of the function of Y that we don't even know we know the first derivative now we know that this is 1 y^2 so how do we under how we under derivatives Let's do an integral so the first derivative of G with respect to Y is 1 y^2 if we integrate with respect to Y then the function of G we're looking for the missing function from right here well let's see um y-2 add once1 over the new exponent so that's going to be -1 over y we don't need the plus C because this is going to be a function of X and Y equal to a constant anyway and it would just absorb any other arbitrary constant terms that you would have so we don't really need to show that what we do need to show is that our function that we had after understanding it's not exact X's only don't work for an integrating Factor y's only do work so we took this in the proper order we got4 y we integrated we took e to that we found an integrating Factor we multiplied everything by it it became exact we said all right that's fantastic uh what's easier to solve well solving solving an integral with respect to X here was easier so we took our M notice how the integrating Factor being y's only had nothing to do with what we chose over here all it did it made an exact differential equation force it does not affect the rest of it it's just a first step from here you do everything the same as what I've already taught you so we say this integral is easier take the um the integral of M that's M with respect to X great function of Y derivative with respect to Y great equal to n solve for for the derivative of the piece you don't know integrate we found the piece now we go back to the function we already knew but we now know what that function that missing piece in terms of Y only is it always going to be in terms of Y only yes that the G will be in terms of Y only and we know that's equal to a constant so we'd have this x^2 YB - 1 y = c and if you had an initial value that's where you plug it in I think that's about all I I really need to show you the next two we're going to go through probably a little bit quicker because I did sort of re-explain some of this stuff um but the long story made real short is don't confuse finding an integrating factor with actually performing the solving of an exact differential equation this is just setting have the proper form for you find the thing you need to multiply to make it happen after that from right here you're basically ignoring this you're saying that's not a substitution you just multiplied by something um so this works exactly like the last two videos pick the part that's easier to integrate either M with respect to X or n with respect to Y integrate the easier one whatever you integrate with respect to you're going to have a function in the opposite variable that you don't know that would be held constant a partial derivative take a derivative with respect to that variable a partial and set it equal to the piece that you didn't opposite of the piece that you just integrated so with M for an integral equal to n with the derivative and then we solve for that missing piece that's about it I'll come back with a couple more I'd really like you to try the next one on your own so when I start introducing it maybe pause and and try it okay let's give it a shot hopefully you can pause right now and try that yourself uh well actually hang on wait before you hope you haven't pause it already um before you do before you do that because exact difference of equations have have a plus between the two components that you have um you might see some people asking you to do this first while not extremely necessary you might see this and what that tells you is that okay just remember that when you take the partial derivative of this this piece it's including that sign and that's why they would have you do that so now you should pause it I want you to just test see whether that's an exact difference in equation or not and if it is great you're done if not see if you can find the integrating factor of course we're going to start that right now so how to go about doing it if this were an exact differential equation which it isn't actually um then what would happen is that this would be an m and that would be an n and we would say okay the first thing we do is we test it let's test the partial derivative of M with respect to Y and the partial derivative of n with respect to X N with respect to Y is one n with respect to X is negative one and you go man I I really can't Le can you just please change it to a minus no would ruin all the fun guys so so no you can't do that right that this is not exactly the same and for an exact differential equation the mixed partials would have to be exactly the same that's why it's so important to understand that that sign goes with that term that's why I introduced that to you so is this an exact differential equation no can we find can we find an integrating factor to make it exact and yes that's our next step that's what we're going to try to do right now so what we're going to do is we're going to do a little test and we're going to take this piece minus this piece over this or this piece over this piece I said minus I made a mistake this minus this over this or this minus this over that in your head do you see it right now do you see that uh this minus this over that will have no y's this minus this over this will have both x's and y's what's the best choice this this over that if you're not clear on that one maybe think about that for a second or just try both so we're going to start with 4 X's partial of M minus partial partial of M with respect to Y partial of M with respect to X All Over N the original not this the original saw that a lot with a lot of students they'll be like hey this divid by this sorry this minus this over that or this minus this minus this over just that number make sure you're going back to your actual n so when we're doing this we're taking the one minus the1 which is not zero over the N thatx don't don't do this minus this over that that's that's not what that's asking you for that's asking for the partial derivatives over the original piece n that's what that's saying uh which says that's that's actually really nice that's 2X or -2X ask yourself is that your integrating Factor no but what what we're doing is to find an integrating Factor we're going to have to integrate and take e to that to find the factor so long story made real short that's not exact it shows it right here let's take our mixed partials put them in a relationship that's going to work for us and say hey if I have only X's that's awesome I'm done don't do the next one why do the next one this will work just fine for us if you did the next one you'd take 1- 1 would be -2 but you'd have to divide it by m and that's going to have both x's and y's it wouldn't work for you anyway so find one of those things that's either X's by taking first the Der respect to Yus der respect to X All Over N or flipping that around that should be only y's so for us we go yeah our R uu is really nice it's an e to the integral of -2X DX that gives us this e to the 2 Ln X that gives us and you can probably see this e to Ln 1^2 or just X2 so our U is just X2 let's see how that flies what we're going to be doing that's not true what we're going to be doing is we're going to multiply this entire differential equation by 1x^2 and it is going to change it into an exact differenti equation so let's let's do it x 4 - x + y all DX plusx Dy equals z we know that and we're going to take and multiply all of this distribute through everywhere where we need to by our integrating factor of 1x^2 and let's see how that that works out for us so I'm going to move up there and get x2 we're going to get -1x we're going to get yx2 DX plus let's see X it's 1X Dy and still equal to Zer you multiply by zero function of x x cannot be zero here um X is uh well yeah X cannot be zero here and so let's go ahead let's see let's test it let's see if it's actually an exact differential equation by finding mixed partials this is our new M and that's our new n well let we try it the partial derivative of M with respect to Y zero cool 0 1/x^2 partial derivative of n with respect to x uh let's see this would be -1 x to the1 let's bring down 1 be postive one subtract one2 but move it down that would be positive 1 overx oh my gosh it worked hey it's going to work it's good promise proved it so if those are the same that means the mixed partials are equal I use different notation just to make you aware of that to reinforce that we're dealing with the same thing this is M sub y it's the same exact idea um I just wanted you to to see it to reinforce that concept so now that we're over this this this is now basically a besides the domain issues we have to impose on this is basically irrelevant and we do this process from here down exactly like any other exact differential equation we pick the piece that's easier to integr so what would you pick would you want to integrate this with respect to X or this with respect to y yeah that's a lot easier so our our derivative with respect to Y this is our n this is -1x that's exactly what that means so if this is an exact differential equation which we just said that it was then this piece has to be the partial derivative of f respect to Y let's integrate with respect to Y which means our function in terms of X and Y is going to be an integral of -1x Dy not DX you know that a lot of students get confused here right they go oh yeah that's going to be oh that's a negative L and X it's not you're integrating with respect to Y look if your partial derivative of f with respect to Y is this piece you're undoing the Y derivative der respect to Y so you're taking an integral with respect to Y now what what is that actually it's it's a really nice thing it's just well if -1x should be held constant it'd be like let's say -2 you would get -2 y so we're going to get YX but we are going to get a function that could have x's in it because under a partial derivative with respect to Y all of these X terms would be completely gone so we took an integral of this with respect to Y we Ted on a y and we also said a constant all terms that would have X's would be held constant under a partial derivative with respect to Y let's take the partial derivative of f with respect to x what we're going to do is when we take the partial derivative of f respect to X we're going to know that since this is the function we're looking for the partial derivative of that function with respect to X the variable opposite this one has to be set equal to that piece you see this is the partial derivative of f with respect to X so we're going to take it and set it equal to that partial respect to X that's a POS y x^2 but the first derivative of H with respect to X we did take a derivative that that piece has to be equal to our M because that's how m is defined m is the partial F respect of x all of your terms with Y in it have to cancel here just like all your terms with x's have to cancel in last example so these two they have to go away if they don't you've done something wrong so the first derivative of that piece that we're looking for that has only X's hey only X's we get x^2 - 1X and how we undo these derivatives is with integrals so the H of X is the integral of x^2 - 1X DX which means we're going to get3 X Cub minus Ln X now I'm going to not have that absolute value there because we can drop it from over here that's where the X came from that's what I was talking about a little while ago U when we talked about how your your integrating Factor really doesn't affect how you do the problem but it could affect your domain so watch out for that we'd say things like assume uh positive or not zero where necessary because we have the x s on our integrating Factor that's going to keep that positive for us and man that's it we're just going to put this back in the function so we integrated n with respect to Y then deriv respect to X that equal to n m so n integrate derivative M we solve that and we know that our function of X and Y it was here where we had a function that was X's that we didn't know we just found that function of x's and we know that has to be equal to a constant a couple other things that you can do um sometimes sometimes you will see this solve for y so is this okay to leave it like this I would say sure that's of the proper form but sometimes you're going to see that solve for y so let's practice that right now uh what we might try to do is multiply everything time x so if we multiply everything time x we would get just NE y 1/3x 4 - x l and x and then CX a constant X and if we add our Y and subtract our constant X which subtracting that constant you know what we're going to do right we're subtract CX we're going to change that minus C into just a plus anyway we would get this I'm I'm flip-flopping sides here I'm adding my y I'm subtracting my CX which is just fine so 1/3 x 4 - x Ln X plus C of X and and then when when sorry c times x when you get to the back of the book and you say wait a minute why is that a plus when the heck it's because they're saying let's suppose that C equals c and then you will see probably this because it's arbitrary and the sign doesn't matter for us man I hope that makes sense I hope that you're with me on the fact that once you find your integrating factor and use it you will get an exact differ equation it's going to happen and you solve it the same exact way you pick whatever's easiest M with respect to X or n with respect to Y whatever one you choose you're going to be integrating getting a constant that has the opposite variable taking a derivative with respect to that variable and setting it equal to the opposite piece you just uh to the the thing that you just integrated so if you picked M first you take a der respect to Y and you equal to N You Pick N first you integrate respect to Y take a der respect to X that equal to M and then that's the rest of it pretty nice um we're going to come back with one more I hope that's making sense I hope I'm explaining it well enough to you understand it's always my goal here so hang on for just a moment you know what I need to correct something I I I had this wrong in my head um after thinking about it this integrating Factor does affect the domain but only on the integrating Factor the fact that that x s doesn't need the absolute value I was wrong over here so I want to correct this right now um when we get down to here and we say hey this doesn't need an absolute value it's because we're squaring that we're squaring that X and the absolute value squared no matter what that X is is going to be positive but I was wrong here so when we get down to this this integral we can't assume that that X is always positive and so what we would say is we need the absolute value of that the absolute value is necessary my mistake I'm sorry but I noticed it right when I was about to do the next example and so we would follow that all the way down and you're going to end with an absolute value of x there my apologies on that one I I had my brain not straight so I hope that makes sense now maybe that clears something up for you um I do try to leave these mistakes um on the videos for the the main reason to show that it it's going to happen it does happen and hopefully you're learning from those mistakes so I I make them too obviously I just did because we can start thinking a little bit wrong um but that's why it's important to go back and check your work and so you look at you go okay let me go through this one more time that's what I did I I paused for a second I turned off the video I looked and said wait a minute no that that's positive that's positive because of that power two but that doesn't affect this Ln of X and so we need the absolute value there because those two things are not this is not guaranteeing over here is not guaranteeing the x is positive we need to make sure that the Ln has only positives in it so again hope that makes sense hope you you're learning from my mistakes as well okay we'll be back with one more example let's take a look at this one do you see the first thing you might do the first thing you're probably thinking I'm going to check mix partials and you're absolutely right but right before that you might take the time to write this as uh the the proper form if it were an exact differential equation which means that really should be a plus and we saw last last example that that that sort of impacts our um our mixed partials to make sure we're taking that sign with it so you might see this a lot let's just write this as the proper form if it were an exact differential equation it would look like this and we can we can now see that all right let's define it let's say that this is M and this is n and yeah and now you check your mixed partials and let's see what happens so if we take our mixed partial derivatives n with respect to Y we're going to get 2 y + 2x this with respect to Y is 2 y this to Y is 2X and then partial derivative of n with respect to X is -2X he said those aren't the same yeah exactly right so if those are not the same that is not an exact difference of equation some potential function F right now we are going to find an integrating factor to make it happen try it now actually what I encourage you to do try it in your head H at least check if you took this minus this and divided by that so this minus this that would be 2 y + 4x over that is there any possible chance that's going to get rid of your y the answer is no that's not going to work so I'm going to show that to you but you can eliminate that right now this is not going to be an integrating factor with just X's this is going to be if possible an integrative factor with just y's but here's how we here's how we show it so for maybe just X's we' say let's take first Der or the Dera of M with respect to y That's 2 y + 2x minus the derivative of n with respect to X it's -2X and we would divide that by n so that's here that's x^2 since this gives us 2 y + 4x over x^2 that Y is not going to simplify for us nothing there you're going to have both x's and y's this is not one we want to deal with so we're going to say no that's not the way to go let's do the next one let's just switch this around and divide by something else so let's try for y that would be -2X so we're doing the derivative of n with respect to x minus derivative of n with respect to Y yes you need parentheses so we're taking this minus this whole piece minus both terms here and dividing it by n that doesn't look very nice well let's simplify let's see what what can happen um what if we do simplify it this will be -2X - 2x that's -4x - 2 y over well let's see y^2 + 2x y that's not too bad maybe we try to factor that so let's factor out a -2 and get 2x + y let's factor out a y and get y + 2x you go I know about commity of addition I know that these are EX the same and I can simplify them and that gives us a function that's just in terms of Y that's what we're looking for folks we don't want to mess around with both variables so we try the X first if you have both variables no forget it reverse do the opposite subtraction divided by the opposite piece and so we'd say either this minus this over this or this minus this over that and that's exactly what we're doing here and so when we got that -2 y that's not your Integra Factor but it's the way we find it so r u is e to the integral of -2 y Dy U is e to the -2 Ln y we know that this is going to be e to the Ln 1 y^ 2 and then U is just 1 y^2 so we're going to get 1 y^2 that's what we're going to multiply our differential equation by to make it exact that's an integrating Factor so what we had Let's see we had this y^2 plus 2xy d DX are you with me hope I hope you're with me plus this x² Dy = 0 and we're saying that wasn't exact but but because we had this nice proof over here we can take this and we can multiply by an integrating Factor this time with just y's in it we tried X's it didn't work we tried y's it did and that is 1 over y^2 so we're going to distribute and that's going to distribute through to all of our terms in that factor which means we're going to get 1 y s * y remember we're Distributing here here and it's going to distribute through so one + 2x y that would be R DX plus x^2 over y^2 that's next to our Dy and still zero can you follow it can you do it because right now we're going to check to see if that's an exact difference of equation and it's going to be but what that's going to say to us is that we're going to start basically like two problems in one find your integrating Factor verify that this is your new M and this is your new n verify that those things I'm going to use different notation here to keep you comfortable with it that those things the partial of M with respect to Y and the partial of n with respect to X make sure those things are equal because that is telling you that you did it right that's a way check your work so you don't just do this and then go for the integration you do this you check man you check what your mixed partials are you got to use them anyway because what you're going to end up doing is you're going to integrate one of these right then you take a derivative and set it equal to these pieces down here your partial derivatives anyhow so you got to find them anyway you may as well check right now to make sure you've done this part right so this part's not a waste of time so the partial derivative of M with respect to Y that actually is a constant so zero this is going to give us a -2 x over y^2 and the partial derivative of n with respect to X is -2X over y^2 hey hey it worked of course it's going to work it has to work if you've done this right if not it's going to show up right here and then you go oh man I probably made a mistake back here let's check that and let's see if that I get my integrating Factor right this is awesome now we take a look at it and you tell me meth think it to me right now in your head which one's easier for you to look at would you want to integrate this with respect to X or would you want to integrate this with respect to y I don't see that there's much of a difference really this you'd have two terms this you I don't think it makes a difference I'll pick that one today so if I'm going to integrate so if I know that the derivative of f with respect to Y is n so this is your n if I know that n is the derivative of partial D of f with respect to Y then that is this x^2 y^2 then our function is the integral of that but just watch out this is the partial of f with respect to Y you're undoing a partial with respect to Y that means an integral with respect to y okay let's do with respect to Y uh integral of x^2 y -2 Dy what world is that let's see that's that we um we add one so that would be1 divide by the new X of1 so our function is going to look like this we're going to have this x^2 y1 over1 we're going to clean that up of course but we do have a constant we do have a constant in terms of X so that partial would say any terms of X are gone that's why we have a constant they could have X in it because we got this from a partial derivative with respect to Y so let's uh let's make this a little nicer so our our function says that would be x^2 over y and plus h of X okay now what now that we have the function itself so th this is our this is our answer it really is there's just a piece we don't know so if this is really our answer we have a piece we don't know let's use some part of this to figure out piece so we know that we used n with respect to y we got our function let's take a partial derivative of f respect to X and that's got to set equal to our M so try that partial derivative of f with respect to X okay respect to X that would be a 2X y plus h Prime of X the derivative of all that function of X that we don't know and that's got to equal man this piece is what m is so that's got to be 1 + 2x y that's got to be that if we subtract that 2x over y kind of cool we get the first derivative of H with respect to X is just one those pieces are gone let's see how we undo derivatives well we we do integrals so let's integrate with respect to X we just get X that's nice so let's see we integrated we found we actually found our function right here we were done we found our function the problem is there's a piece we didn't know we took a derivative with respect to X partial and that let us set equal to M we got rid of everything that had y's in it we integrated the function of X that was remaining and we have H of xal X let's plug that back in so our function is that's x^2 y plus xals some constant all right well that means that x y + x = c that right there is a potential function that would give us this exact differential equation it's fantastic uh the other thing that I want to talk about is sometimes I'll make you solve that for y so if they do that you'd have to subtract X and then we can multiply both sides by y divide both sides by C- x one thing I do want to mention here we don't we're not going to cover explicitly now but we'll talk about it later um is that when you use this type of a solving technique um this integrating factors sometimes you can get extra Solutions sometimes those work and sometimes those don't and sometimes you can miss Solutions like singular Solutions so be careful of those um that if you're if you're seeing some things like I'm not so sure we talked about singular Solutions a while ago I I mentioned a blur about it and I'm going to do a video on it about exactly how to find those um a little bit later but I want you to just be aware right now that sometimes you can gain Solutions or not find all of the solutions with these techniques we talked about that a while back how some of our techniques don't give us everything like singular Solutions of like zero um for instance so be careful of that um just wanted to say a blur about it but I hope this video was enjoyable for you I hope you learned this new techniques a lot of a lot of classes that i' I've seen teachers teach they don't even talk about this so hopefully that was kind of neat for you to see how a different type of integrating Factor worked I mentioned how there were other integrating factors besides just doing the ones with um with what we've done so far and now I got to show to you so that that's fun okay hope you enjoyed it hope it made sense and I will see you guys for another video coming up soon when we talk start talking about some some real life applications have a good day
