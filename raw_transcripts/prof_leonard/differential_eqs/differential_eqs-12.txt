Transcript for: Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions (Differential Equations 11)
last video before we get on to techniques of solving differential equations which is gonna be rad 16 awesome me a lot of fun and we we have a lot of techniques so this this last one is just showing when you're gonna have solutions to a differential equation and when those solutions are gonna be unique so it's just a little subsection here it's important but after this we really don't go through and do a lot of it so I want to just kind of it explain it to you on where it's coming from it is important sometimes classes just glossed right over this so let's talk a little bit about when you're gonna even have solutions what those solutions mean and when they're gonna be unique so let's talk more about differential equations when we talk about solutions we're almost always talking about solutions through a point and if you remember back to our slope our slope fields slope fields represented a general solution and they were important we like general solutions but when we talk about specific solutions we're talking about those solutions through a point it took a specific initial value of a point for us to determine what what that one curve was that we wanted that went through that point and they gave us a specific particular solution on that slope field I hope you remember that you didn't watch the video go back and watch so field so solutions to differential equations are most often considered at points that gives us specific things we can work with otherwise we're left with this broad idea which does give us information about our scenario but it doesn't allow us to zoom in on one specific case so we did I talked about slope fields how we need at that point for a particular solution so there are going to be three cases for us to have solution or well three cases that can happen when we consider solutions to a differential equation at a point case number one there's no solution so in case number one if we have a differential equation and we're looking for a solution at a specific point it might not exist there's cases for that no here's what that does mean that doesn't mean that differential equation has no solution that's not true if you look at the slope field like we have been studying solutions to differential equation there's a whole lot of solutions to that differential equation it just depends on what point you want to pick for us to get in particular so where a differential equation might have tons of solutions there might not be a particular solution through one point there's a difference there so a differential equation can have lots and lots and lots of solutions just none that go through a certain point that's important number two it could have infinitely many solutions through that point so case one got a differential equation you got a point there's just nothing to go through the point no solutions go to the point or you can have a differential equation got lots of solutions you pick a point and there's infinitely many that go through there sometimes it happens of the equilibrium solutions so in tons are infinitely many solutions to that differential equation that happened to go through that point that happens to case three is the one that we really want to grab ahold of and see when this happens so case three you have a difference of the equation you have a particular violence or an initial condition a point and we find one unique solution to that differential equation in the neighborhood of that point we're going to talk a lot so this is this first part of this videos a lot of me talking explaining what the neighborhood means why we need the neighborhood what continuity has to do with it why that means differentiability since we're dealing with derivatives what that has to do with being a unique solution in a neighborhood around that so a little recap before we get into it first thing the differential equations are these equations that have derivatives we know that we are going to consider solutions to be at points that get lets us go from a general to a particular solution remember so fields that's what we need to get that particular there's three cases case one you could have a differential equation that just doesn't have a particular solution that goes the point you are suggesting that's case one even though other points have solutions that's fine that one point does not yield a particular solution that's case one case two you could have a difference of equation where you can Center a specific point and infinitely many go through there it's not unique case three is what we really like to Zone in on whether we have one unique solution to a differential equation at let's just say at a point but really when it comes down to is in a neighborhood around that point here's why here's why we need that so we'll talk more about this as we get on to our cases over here when we have existence and when we have uniqueness but for a curve to be continuous I'm just throwing this right now so that you understand where it company comes about for a curve to be continuous at a point that's really hard to say that you have a curve continuous at a point if you don't consider a little bit before that point and a little bit after that point that's called a neighborhood so if you have a point on a graph I say is that is that point continuous that doesn't make any sense because you need to know if there's points before that and points after that so you know if there's a little bit of the function that leads up to that point and a little bit of function after that point to say at that point we had some before it was not an endpoint and we had some after it was not an endpoint the big thing here is that continuity isn't really exaggerated or really emphasize that continuity is an open idea it's a that's as important as if it says for occurred to be continuous we need a little bit ahead and a little bit behind that point for an open interval to exist for us to get to it and leave it that excludes this idea of endpoints and that's what this is saying it sounds really like funky like a neighborhood but for one unique solution with the case of one unique solution to a difference of equation it's in a neighborhood of that point because that that point itself must be contained something it's continuous for us to have differentiability since we're talking about derivatives we need differential something to be differentiable and for that to exist we have to have continuity you have to be able to get there and leave there for us to say there's one to one unique slope at that point you remember that from calculus one this is it right here I'm gonna get to it later I'll refresh it when we get there but at every point before that one you can say hey there's one specific slope to this curve at that point but as soon as you get here an endpoint you go well we can draw infinitely many slopes through that through that one point if we consider the points before like in one side limit yes we can go ahead and say yeah well since this but at that point itself if you don't have any where you're going from going to you can't talk about that being continuous and for that reason we can't give it a this idea of being different differentiable at that point without the preceding ones like a one side limit and it needs we need this continuity for our cases of existence and uniqueness to be there so long sermon goes for when we're looking at unique solutions so one solution that happens to be unique we're looking at continuity we're looking at a neighborhood were saying you need to be able to get there and leave there for company exists and therefore for these two things to take place so one of the things we're talking about for a differential equation let's say we got a derivative of Y with respect to X that's equal to a function of x and y and in the neutral value so we got a differential equation like we know love we have an initial value okay that's a point we consider solutions to be at points here's what's going to happen if our function so we just look at this if that's continuous around the point that we are checking so around our initial condition you can't just say this this function is continuous for everything it might be it might be continuous for all points but specifically rezoning on solutions around a particular point an initial condition so if our functions continuous around that point or more specifically around the open interval the x-value that gives us that point this says specifically around the x-value that's given us the point so if we have a function that's continuous around that x-value so here's the the big thing the only thing you really need to remember is your x value for whatever that point is cannot be an endpoint for the interval that you're continuous on it cannot be an endpoint no endpoints are allowed continuity is an open idea continuity says you need a little bit ahead and a little bit behind whatever point you're checking so whatever x value that gives you that point you look at that x value and you say is that at an endpoint of where my continuity starts or ends if it is you're not continuous there if it is that's failing this okay that's not okay so if our functions continuous around that point an open interval so a is not an endpoint of continuity then at least one solution exists on that open interval that's cooled so we know that we have existence now I didn't say anything about being unique it said that if your function is continuous around the point so open interval a or whatever this value is is not on an endpoint of continuity that's the only thing you really need to remember here then you have at least one solution if f of X Y so if our function is not continuous for open interval so either you have that that point so x equals a might be like creating zero on the denominator of fraction or negative inside of the square root or at an endpoint of continuity I'll show you some in just a minute then a solution is not guaranteed to the differential equation at that point remember early remember that we can have a differential equation with lots of solutions at lots other points but at this point doesn't have one that's what that's what we're saying so if your function is continuous around an open interval so that x equals a so a isn't a zero on a denominator it's not a negative inside of a longer than or zero and a longer that's not a negative square root and it's not at the endpoint of an interval of continuity then we can guarantee there's a solution but if it's not so if this function is not continuous for an open interval then we cannot guarantee a solution a differential equation at that point again no end points x equals a cannot at the endpoint of the interval of continuity that would be like this this functions all the way continuous a really good fantastic style continuous and then we get here oh crap well if that is the point that we are checking and we're saying does this differential equation have a solution through that point we would need to be continuous in an open interval around the x value that gives us that this remember open I didn't get there leave there if that's not the case then we cannot guarantee that a solution exists for that difference equation at that point we've failed to be continuous I'm sorry we failed to yea be continuous on an open interval at that point the endpoint fails us can't have an employment so that's that guarantees that we have at least one solution now that means that were in one of these two right where one of those two cases if we've simply satisfied that the second thing would be uniqueness now in order to do a uniqueness for a difference equation or solution to a differential equation through a point you need to be able to take a partial derivative if you're not familiar with that I've explained that in calculus 3 you can go it's not hard and I can explain here we're going through it but basically it just considered all the X's to be constants so if you had X Y and you take a derivative it would not be a product rule you would just take the derivative and treat X like 3 or something so it's not hard super easy if this is also continuous around that point so if the partial derivative of your function with respect to Y is also continuous around that point an open interval around the x value that gives that point then the solution to that differential equation around that point so in that neighborhood of that that x value that gives that point is unique one more time all the way through we're looking at the net points there's three cases we really want the last one to be the case that we're looking at so here's it has to happen but the function has to be continuous around that point you're checking it's got to be continuous in the neighborhood x equals a cannot be a point of discontinuity and it cannot be an endpoint of an interval continuity that's it it's all you really need that statement listen to that a couple times back guarantees the solution exists at least one for the solution to be unique you do the same check just with a partial derivative with respective line so you take the partial derivative with respect to Y just make sure that it's still continuous around that point so x equals a does not create a discontinuity for you and it's not at the endpoint of an interval of continuity and if those two things are met then you have one solution that's unique to that differential equation in the neighborhood at that point do your continuity that that's it that's that's it sounds a lot worse than it is the main things are that you got different equations at points check these check continuity check the continuity of the partial derivative just make sure that x equals a is not at an endpoint or isn't creating a discontinuity for you and you're good to go so we're gonna go through several examples they're all very very quick they're not hard things to do I'll show you that and then we'll move on let's get started some example shall we so again all we're doing here we're not solving we're not solving we're not so we don't any techniques for that yet what we're doing right now is is just checking to see whether is solutions even gonna exist to the differential differential equation at that point that's given so we're checking to see existence and if there's existence then we check to see if there the solution that exists is unique or not so let's try that so a differential equation dy/dx equals 2x squared y squared and we're checking to see whether that differential equation has a solution and whether the solutions UV at the point that's given by Y of 1 equals negative 1 first thing I always like to do I like to point out so X is 1 and Y is negative 1 that's important X value or Y value we'll talk about why that's important just a bit so the first thing we do just stitch and it's not that hard to check for just existence well we're gonna do is we're gonna look at just the function so the function of that we're looking at is this part on the right hand side so you solve your your difference equation for dy over DX and that right there is your function we want to make sure that that function is continuous at the point that we are checking or more specifically around the x-value that gives us the point that we're checking now if you remember about discontinuities you remember there's really only three places that we had got worried about for discontinuities they are denominators on so fractions that have variables on them or the denominator could equal zero we don't have any fractions or square roots fourth roots sixth roots even roots where we could have negatives inside we don't have any radicals or logarithms where you have a 0 or negatives you're having logarithms in fact that's that looks a lot like a polynomial sort of a derivative function and so we know what those are continuous everywhere there's not a value of X or Y that you can plug in there that's going to create a problem for you so that function is continuous everywhere since it is continuous everywhere it's gotta be continuous around x equals 1 remember we're always checking around the x value we're looking at that so hey is that is that continuous we can check the Y value tube with the ideas on the X so we check our point we're going hey is it continuous around that that point you could plug it in if you want it works just fine there's nothing wrong with this there's no discontinuities anywhere that's continuous everywhere specifically around our point that we're checking so that's continuous everywhere and that everywhere includes our point the neighborhood around that point then we've just shown we've proven that that differential equation is going to have at least one solution that goes through that point I hope that makes sense to you now we're going to check to see whether that solution is unique so we go further so this is part one part one said that's continuous around that point everywhere includes that point part two says now take the partial derivative of that function with respect to Y if we do that you need to get in the habit of partial derivatives pretty pretty quick when it treats all X variables as constants so you're not taking a derivative of that there's no product rule here don't worry about that all we're doing is saying hey just pretend that's a constant move that two in front so we'd be multiplying it 4x squared Y so just take the derivative of the Y component here and match it again through the product and we do the same exact thing it does that have square root as well no does it have fractions no no variables on the denominator does it have logarithms no it's continuous everywhere so those two things combined the first one says this functions continuous and the neighborhood that point that means that we have a solution that it would at least we have one solution to that difference of equation through that point this says furthermore now that our partial derivative of F with respect to Y is also continuous this is continuous from this point this is also continuous from this point not only does a solution exist that's one what the solution is unique that's two so these two parts together say that that differential equation has one unique solution in the neighborhood of that point one unique solution to that differential equation in the neighborhood at that point let's keep on going so no tooth we now have differential equation equal dy/dx equals x times ln y the first student we're going to do or going to look at the point our point is 1 comma 1 so x equals 1 y equals 1 we're going to make sure that when we check continuity we're continuous around that point even if other discontinuities exist i don't care i'm care that we're continuous in the neighborhood an open interval around that point so our function i always write out the function our function is x ln y and when we think about that we think that well that's continuous everywhere for x there's not problem with our X's but our Y's have to be positive here you can't have a logarithm with zero or negative so all right this is going to be continuous as long as our Y's are positive no zeros no negatives look at our point there's two things we check for two things you check for number one is our is our x value okay yeah X's there's no problem edges though is our Y value okay what I mean by that is is it falling inside the open interval here what that means is it couldn't have been an endpoint so 0 would have been a problem but is this Y value in this interval of continuity yeah sure the open interval of 0 to infinity 1 falls in there so two things we check for does our X work yes those are Y fall in the open interval of continuity it's business continuous for y is greater than 0 yeah that falls in that open interval that's awesome that's what we want so this statement right here says that we have at least one solution to this differential equation in the neighborhood of that point now we check the part derivative partial derivatives leave X's alone treat them as constant and takes a derivative of the function of one derivative Ln Y is 1 over Y so let's think about where this is continuous this is continuous for any X X is not a problem here but Y we just need to know that Y can't be 0 so this is continuous for y doesn't equal 0 so all this really comes down to is look at your function look at where it's continuous what problems you have make sure your point is literally inside that not an endpoint inside the interval continuity that guarantees existence now take the partial derivative do the same exact thing look at where this is continuous this is continuous for anything where we don't have 0 y is not 0 so we've fallen this interval of continuity as well so this continuity says existence this continuity says the existence is also unique so there's one unique solution here as well I hope you're picking that up that's important it's important to understand that when we're checking this all our chickens come Duty you just need to make sure that the point you're checking which it makes sense with why we're checking points you can't just say continuous everywhere all the time when this is not continuous everywhere this is not continuous everywhere which is why we look for specific points to say whether a differential equation has a solution or not it's based on continuity around that point so we look at continuity we just make sure that our X values and our Y values for those points don't cause any problems they're not they're not in the areas of discontinuity and they're not at the endpoints for continuity if there's one thing I can stress no endpoints allowed that's not ok so do the next two so you're going to get the habit of doing this really quickly you go okay our function XY is a cube root of Y cube roots of Y are continuous everywhere zero is not a problem negatives are not a problem positives are not a problem so that's continuous everywhere the point we're checking is x equals zero y -1 there's not even an x value I can't even plug in X's that's fine don't worry about it this is if this is continuous everywhere then we're clearly continuous in the neighborhood at that point that's great what this says is that this guarantees that we are going to have a solution lots of weird curly even when we take the partial derivative there's only wise up there so we'd have Y to the 1/3 power if we do the derivative of that we get one over three Y to the 2/3 power well that's continuous everywhere ever let's continuous everywhere except where y equals zero so now look at our point X was zero I don't care about the extras not even X's up here is a continuous in the interval of y equals 1 or around y equals 1 yes 1 is not equal to 0 there's an open interval that surrounds 1 for which we continuous so we're not going all the way to 0 like you can think but it's open for just past 0 continuous from 0 to infinity absolutely it's also continuous or negative infinity to 0 the only place it's not continuous is when y equals 0 so if this falls in these open intervals you're good together as long as we are not at an endpoint that means that we're satisfying the second Artemis so this was continuous everywhere but that falls in everywhere this is continuous for why doesn't equal zero this is why doesn't equal zero as long as our point falls in that interval we are rock solid so not only does a solution exist it's also unique so we have one unique solution now this is the same exact problem obviously but we have a different point I want to I want you to see how this works so first part would be exactly the same we still have the same exact function of x and y it's a cube root of Y we still have the point over here but it's a different point at 0 0 this is still continuous everywhere no matter where there were zero or not it doesn't matter this is continuous paper what that does that says that this differential equation has at least one solution through that point you need to get that a solution does exist now we check uniqueness obviously the same thing and obviously same continuity this function is only continuous on this open interval it is not continuous at y equals zero so it's that's an interval of discontinuity so we already know that a solution exists but when we check in the neighborhood of this point well let's check to see whether that solution is unique you know there's at least one let's see if it's a unique we plug in zero zero or we look at the continuity or we consider this this interval around zero zero like oh well no that zero would be an endpoint we cannot be continuous at influence or another way to consider it is that zero right there that zero for y literally causes a discontinuity if you have a value that's causing a discontinuity you're obviously not continuous there so this fails uniqueness so we have and we it feels unique is we have more than one solution so we have at least one solution here but it's not necessarily we can't guarantee uniqueness [Music] so we're checking look at the function seeing whether we're continuous around that point if we are awesome at least one solution if we if we take the partial derivative and we're still continuous around that point then that solution is unique let's try the next one so where the world is that continuous it's think about that there's one that you really should focus in on it's this one because this will throw you for a loop if you're not paying attention so where are square roots okay where are square roots continuous well they're continuous as long as the inside is not negative so as long as inside zero or more I'm gonna make a mistake here on purpose I want you to watch very carefully there's the mistake that's a mistake right there the insides got to be positive we know how to do domain right we know that square roots have to have a radicand the inside part that's always positive we know it's got to be greater than or equal to zero but for continuity to happen you can't have the equals part equals always means a bracket it means closed so don't be closed-minded man just be open-minded all right so we can't have that was the board so when we have this we think the insides gonna be positive but it's continuous on the open interval where Y minus sorry X minus y it's got to be strictly greater than zero if we allow it to be equal that's literally the endpoint we cannot allow endpoints getting negative five six thousand times we can't allow influence go a little further that means X has to be greater than Y add Y to both sides so we need a point where X is literally greater than Y look at your point now our point is 2 point 2 is X greater than Y no if we allow the equals to say well what about zero that's fine as soon as you do that you now have an end point of continuity and that is breaking the law for continuity you cannot have that so because this two this two two because that crew that is the end point of our continuity that doesn't even go together you can't have any points for continuity so because that's where this function even starts to work it's an endpoint you cannot allow that so when we say this is continuous for X minus y is greater than zero or dis including that endpoint then X would have to be greater than Y does your point fit back does your point fit in your continuity answer's no the X is equal to Y the X is not greater than Y therefore we cannot guarantee existence if we can't guarantee the existence we certainly can't guarantee uniqueness and you can see that if you really want to so if we do the the partial derivative we're gonna run into the same exact situation so if we look at this we have a one half target chain rule going on here so one half inside to the negative one half times the derivative of the inside well the derivative of this with respect to Y that's a constant I'm good as zero times negative 1 that's the same situation we can't even allow zeros here at all but this would say this is only continuous where X is greater than Y that would be the interval of continuity not don't get a confuse an interval of where it exists your domain this would exist for the point at the point - - it is the the function would exist there at - - but not continuous there why would you check a point if it didn't even exist and they sense so obviously this point exists on this function you would just get zero you have an input of 2 - you have zero fine but when we check for continuity we're not continuous on that entire interval we're continuous on the open interval not the closed interval you must not include two importance so we can't guarantee existence we also can't guarantee that that's unique that makes sense because we don't even know there is a solution now let's try the next one so maybe you can try this if you haven't already give that a try positive video see if you can do that same exact thing same exact continuity but now we look back at a point we think that the point 2 1 that's your x value that's your Y value does that point fit in continuity so all of this stuff comes down to check the continuity to define the continuity it must be open no equal signs gotta have open intervals here you can have to be open and then check to see if that point is on your open interval if it is good just make sure that it fits your continuity so we know this is continuous for X is greater than Y not exists yes that exists when x equals y but continuous for the open interval of X just slightly bigger than Y if X is bigger than Y that's fitting our model for continuity and that's guaranteeing that this particular differential equation has a solution at least one solution in the neighborhood of that point look at the comparison here we mentioned earlier but this is the first time we really see it we can have the same exact differential equation one of which is guaranteed to have a solution at a point and one of which is it is not at a different point so that's why we always consider solutions to differential equations at points where that existence and we were talking about uniqueness so let's see if this is unique using the same thing here well if this is continuous around our point that we know there are solutions unique and when we look at it we say well this has to this is continuous where X is written white and same exact thing we can't even allowed like equals for existence here we literally meet because we have to zero in the denominator that would be a problem so we literally need X to be greater than Y X is greater than Y so we have one unique solution I'm going to put three more on the board in just a moment and I would suggest you try them on your own if you can the idea is check the original just make sure that whatever you've defined for your continuity first that's accurate and second that your point fits it secondly take into a partial derivative and do exactly the same thing don't include endpoints if your point you're checking is at an end point of continuity that is not too long you cannot have an end point for continuity so let me go do those three other problems and then we'll call it good so I'm giving you three more island after I show you what to do on the first thing I would really recommend you try all three on your own if you can there's one thing these look a little weird to you if they do look weird remember that when we're checking our continuity you have to have it over the form dy over DX equals some function XY so these two don't fit so when you get something like that the first thing I'd like you to do just divide both sides by water get rid of that Y so that's multiplied you'd have to have dy over DX equals x minus 1 divided by the line that's the function you should check and then you'll you'll be a lot easier so yeah that's kind of discontinuous at y equals zero whatever same thing would happen here so I would highly recommend you pause the video give these three of trying to the best you can to do two things find the function like we've done see where it's discontinuous and where it is continuous and see if the point satisfies that you must not have endpoints this must not create an any point for your continuity they can't do that then you take a partial derivative and do exactly the same thing so I'm gonna get going on it but you should pause the video and try to begin so for us we've already determined that that's the differential equation we are checking to see whether that has a solution at that particular point so I always make sure I'm setting up the problem correctly dy over DX equals some function x and y I'm also always writing down my point the point is zero one so I'm going to check to see where this is continuous this is continuous for any x value X is not a problem you're plugging anything you'll be fine but the Y is a problem Y cannot be 0 if it helps you to see the open interval actually write out the open interval so we write out negative infinity to 0 and then again from 0 to infinity as long as this Y value so X is good any X's so we could also write to UM need a little lazy we could write down continuous for any X so X would be all real numbers and continuous for why that doesn't equal 0 here's your interval for that so all we're checking is is this somewhere in this open interval it certainly is so this guarantees that this differential equation has at least one solution around that point then we take the partial derivative of F with respect to Y well what that gives us is this is you can do it several different ways but this would be like X minus 1 times y to the negative 1 power you want to take the derivative that this actually constantly three or something we'd have negative let's call it three y to the negative two so that would give us negative x plus one over Y square that's what that would give us and now we take continuity for this as well well nothing's really changed has it X can be all real numbers so this is continuous for all X values it's continuous for y as long as Y is not zero and you can do exactly the same interval in either case we see that yeah it's insane check continuity so this function is continuous around that point this partial derivative is also continuous around that point so this is guaranteed us uniqueness for msre existence and uniqueness so this is one there will exist one unique solution to that differential equation around that point because we check continuity for role of the function and the parts of it are you kidding that I hope you're getting this the second one let's look at how it changes same exact thing we would solve for our dy over DX we know that our partial derivative would be exactly the same as what we just had and now we're checking our point not zero one but one zero well when you check that if you see it automatically this is continuous for y does not equal zero if y equals zero you can show a problem that Y is causing the discontinuity you're done so this does not guarantee us that the solution exists same thing happens here this can't be continuous if Y is zero our Y is zero and say it's not continuous so we've failed continuity in both the existence and the uniqueness so we can't guarantee existence and we certainly can't guarantee is just uniqueness I hope that's that's making sense as well last one fairly straightforward we have our differential equation we've got our point zero zero all that it takes us to do is check our function now 1 plus y squared you can't have a zero in the logarithm you also can have negatives but one plus y squared can't ever equal zero and it can't ever equal a negative so this is continuous everywhere continuous everywhere it includes the point that we're checking now the partial partial derivative well a logarithm says you do one over the inside times the derivative of the inside by the chain rule the derivative of the inside is 2y 1 goes to 0 y squared goes to Y so our partial derivative is that now because our 1 1 plus y squared can't ever equal zero we don't have any discontinuities here either you can't ever add one plus a positive and get zero doesn't make sense so this is continuous everywhere as well and for that reason it's continuous around that point rather neighborhood at that point so function itself continuous around the point partial derivative continues another point again we get one unique solution I hope that makes sense I hope now that we fleshed out the idea it's not that big of a deal to you we're really just checking continuity around the point that you're given taking partial derivative do the same thing if you have both then you have existence and uniqueness if you have existence it doesn't guarantee uniqueness you get a check the partial as well okay that that's about it now next video we started getting on into how to solve differential equations you
