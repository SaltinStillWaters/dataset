Transcript for: Mixture Problems in Linear Differential Equations (Differential Equations 19)
welcome back we're going to take a look at applications of some of these linear first-order differential equations and one very cool kind of important application for us is mixture problems so these ideas are what would happen if you had this this container all of this let's assume it's a liquid that has a mixture or some sort of solution in there like solve their pollutant or acid or with something in there and and you're not only are you pumping stuff into it with a different concentration but stuff is also leaving it and it's really mixed up so it's very good so the concentration leaving is representative of the concentration the tank in that moment of time so it's very well mixed well if these problems ask how long would it take to get a certain concentration in the tank or what would the concentrate concentration going to take be after certain amount of time so we're going to take a look at three examples on how to how to do these these types of problems kind of cool and they all revolve around these linear first-order difference equation so let's take a look about what we're gonna be doing and then take a look at our examples um so mixture problems how this solution changes over time which is what differential equations study in the first place is how things change over time if X is our solution so the amount of the solution at a certain time so that intz and the time how much salt is there how much acid is there how much pollutant is there well let's try to model this so I'm gonna walk you through where these equations come from because sometimes when you look at this in the book you go here is what does that mean let's let's see how that's created so if we think about how much solution so X the amount of solution is gonna be in our tank after a certain amount of time well that really relates to how much we're putting in and how much we're taking out so firstly let's think that the change of the amount that's there over time would be a change in incremental change of that amount over time well what would that over that be able to how would you how do you see you see the change of how much is in there so we have this this take of stuff and it's got a certain mixture let's say I don't know 5% salt or whatever and you're gonna start pouring stuff into there another another concentration it's going to start changing how much salt is in the tanks so this idea is imagine that you have this this vat of stuff and it has a certain concentration you start pouring in this other solution that has a different concentration what's in your tank is going to change if you start pouring in a weaker solution it's going to start having a weaker concentration do you start pouring in a stronger solution is going on a stronger concentration and that's also imagine you're pouring something out so at every moment in time you're getting additional or well your concentration is changing in your tank it's either you're gaining some of this amount or you're losing some of this amount of whatever you're talking about salt or acid or whatever well how that's changing if we can make this if we can make this change equal to something we can understand and if we can make this into a differential equation that by solving the differential equation how will this solution is changing over time we can find an equation for the solution itself but you guys see what I'm talking about so this right here would be the change in solution we're wanting to find a function for the amount of a solution so let's think about how this would change no what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna walk through what's it called the verbal model if you've watched all my videos which means you've lost like a thousand videos you've seen me do verbal models for word problems a lot that's how they always start so how would we look at how are our actual amount of solution is changing well there really would be a difference in the amount that you put in minus the amount you take out well that should make some sense I mean we have the the way that our amount of salt is changing is pretty closely approximated with how much we are pouring of the salt so that makes your point in and that make sure we're pointing out the difference between those two things is how our salt is changing notice how this is not how much is there it's how it's changing so then the amount of salt that you start with that that's in there and that would stay completely consistent if you didn't pour anything in and did for anything else this would stay exactly the same how it's changing is a comparison of how much is actually coming in - how much you're actually pouring out that's got to make sense before we go any further so amount in - amount out is not how much is there amount in - how amount how this how what's there is changing how what's there the amount of the solution is changing now let's talk about the amount in amount out that's going to depend on two things the amount of salt that you're actually pouring in so the salt in what you form the salt of the concentrations you pouring in it depends on how fast you're pouring in and what the concentration of what you're pouring in is for instance let's say this you're pouring in this salt solution we call it a brine pour in a brine at one gallon a minute well if you pour in at one gallon a minute and let's say it's five percent salt that would be like it's just a real pretty mild salt solution you pour that at what I say one gallon of one gallon a minute or versus five gallons a minute for the same solution well you'd gain salt a lot quicker porn a five gallon cement than you would one gallon a minute also you gain sold a lot quicker if you pour it in a 50% solution versus a five percent solution so the amount in is really a function of two things it's a function of the rate at which you're putting it in and the concentration of what you're putting into that tank or bridge or bad or what if you want siddur so the way that the amount of our solution is changing is the amount in but that's a rate times the concentration in times of time how fast you put it in what's the concentration of what you put in which means that's what what percent what proportion of what you're actually pouring in this VAT is is really salt or acid or pollutant times how much time you're putting the sins and this is a rate in a concentration in and a time for how long that how long you're actually pouring that in - how much you're pouring out so we're not just pouring it in this situation we're actually letting fluid let's Simpsons fluid leave the container well the amount out would be same idea how fast are you live in this drain out what's the concentration of what you're letting drain out for how long you're doing it well that's another rate tons of concentration times of time let's keep on going let's call these things some variables right now what I've done is a just in a verbal model and I'm man I hope it makes sense I'm gonna recap it here in just a couple minutes but keep on going let's call the rate in R sub I let's call the concentration C sub I and let's call the change of time this incremental change in time what's happening if I look at the change in every quarter second or second or tenth of a second - rate out arson Oh concentration out and the change in time delta T well we got to look at a couple things before we go any further first is whether they understand it and second is what of these four things are constant which of those four things are constant so first thing we're trying to model and changing amount in ace in a mixture how we model a change in a mountain to make sure it's going to end up being a differential equation what we want to do is create a differential equation so that when we undo that when we solve that differential equation we find a function that would tell us the amount of that substance in the tank or that or whatever at a certain amount of time this is our goal our goal is find an equation that will tell us how much is there at a certain point in time how are we gonna do it well the only thing we know about right now is how it's changing how does that amount changing well the only way that that amount can change is if I'm pouring something into it or draining something out of it or both and the way that would change would be you're adding something some amount of solution and you're taking some out well how much you're actually adding so the rate of change of our our salt here let's call it salt for now the rate of change of our solution or salt would be well the rate of how much you're pouring in times the concentration of what's your point in - the rate that you're pouring out times the concentration point out that this has certain made some sense you right now this is and this is the amount of salt that you're actually getting in this is the amount of salt that you're actually getting out so we're calling those variables and now let's talk about what are held constant well we're gonna hold rate in constant why it's really hard to do without that it'd be like this like hey I'm sold okay Jim I want you to I want you to pour this this solution in and like let's say it's a five percent salt solution once you pour this five percent salt solution in and like five gallons a minute there you go okay no problem man I got that so it's pouring in five gallons a minute and and you go hey Jim you still pouring that five gallons a minute goes no no no no important - why cuz cuz I wanted to go dude you just screw everything up because my mouth is now off so I have to have Jim pouring in that solution at five gallons a minute for the entire length of this problem otherwise we'd have to do several different problems and add them all up together okay so that rate in we're going to hold that to be constant also the concentration in it Jim's pouring in a five percent salt solution and then he just decides to change it to twenty five percent that's gonna drastically affect our math or how much salts actually in there so we're gonna hold the rate in at constant and the concentration in at constant the other thing that we're gonna hold it constant is the rate outlet so if you open the floodgate to a lake or you open the valve on on a tank or something we're gonna assume that that's pouring out at the same rate all the time otherwise for the same thing like Jim's born in if two gallons a minute versus five it's gonna really be too hard for us to salt with this model could we do it yeah but we probably need several problems to several different scenarios and add them all up to do that so we don't wanna do that so for our examples here we have to hold the rate in a constant your pouring in the same rate we have to hold the concentration in at constant what you're pouring in all has the same concentration and then we have to hold the rate out what's your what's leaving the tank how fast it's leaving the tank is constant what's not constant what we can't hold constant is the concentration out you see in last year to the Container and what's your point it has exactly the same concentration what you point out is always changing if you have this pure water and you start pouring a concentration with salt in it this is going to start getting more and more salty more and more salty until you start draining stuff out so that concentration out is always changing now there is one thing we're going to zoom about this we're gonna assume that in this bath or this lake or whatever is very well mixed so there's this mixer going crazy so as soon as you add something to it it's immediately perfectly mixed realistic I don't know but it otherwise remember that trade up we have in differential equations where we want to make it practical but doable this is one of the things we have to assume to make it practical otherwise it was an doable otherwise when we start considering that it's not well mixed we have different concentrations in the same vat very hard to deal with so rate in held the same concentration inhale the same I hope you understand why we kind of have to do that otherwise we'd have several different problems we have to add up right out held the same so you're letting it drain the same rate but the concentration how it is changing because what you're adding into it and what you're pouring out of it affect how much is actually there let's talk a bit more about that the concentration element if it's not constant what's in based on what would the concentration out be based on how are you finding concentration all the time is you compare how much salt or how much actual contaminant pollutant salt acid is in the container divided by how much volume is in the container at that time now what I mean what do we mean about at that time well in your container the volumes are only going to stay the same if we're pouring and we're pouring out at the same exact rates so R sub I equals barsen out R sub oh then yeah you sure your volume would be constant and we're gonna see that in the very first two examples that we do but if your value if your rate in is quicker than your rate out your volume in is slower than your rate out or letting a decrease it's gonna it's gonna change and it's gonna get lower so our concentration out is based on two things how much actual salt or solution is there divided by the volume that you currently have at that moment of time so the concentration out well mixture but always changing its based on how much is there divided by how you're distributing it in this volume at a certain amount of time let's go ahead and let's change this let's change this and just put C sub o let's make that X over V Oh so ammount how they mount and is changing - how they mount out is changing but they're not how rate that's the same concentration how is X / V with respect to t man that looks a whole lot like stuff from calc 1 I wonder if we could divide everything so both sides by delta T since the delta T is not 0 so delta T would be a legit change in time you're not dividing by 0 you're saying after the seconds or days little teeny bit that means we're not dividing by 0 and we need an approximation for how the amount of the solution is changing over time an incremental change very little when you deal with incremental change what's your what you're getting is an approximation this goes all the way back to calc 1 if we're looking at little chunks of time so after this amount of time in this amount of time in this amount of time we're missing the ability to give instantaneous amount of time because those chunks may be what you're measuring falls in between the amount that you're actually considering here what solves that for us is a limit to memory man I hope you remember remember remember our limits how what happens with that increment is that that gets really really really really really really really really really close without becoming 0 and it says that one of those increments that they're getting smaller you're getting more and more accurate measurement and that limit lets us do that so instead of Delta x over delta T we start taking taking limits and we changes to a derivative of X with respect to D a differential and then it's no longer an approximation that limit says man you're so close together that makes no difference it's still at zero but it's so close so close that you no longer approximating theories of our theories of calculus that we study in calc one tell us that this is now exact I've dropped the respect to T because this says it the derivative of X with respect to D oh my gosh a differential equation a first-order difference equation a look at your independent variable its T look at your dependent variable its X you have X to the first power and you're a function of T your independent variable sure X is also a function of T but that's taking the place of our Y like we did in the last last video we had dy DX and then we want to see why the first power now we have D X DT we want to see X to the first power this is a first-order differential equation it happens to be a linear first-order differential equation if we just add this to both sides and maybe this will help you see a little bit better we have equation differential equation first derivative so first order differential equation linear we have our dependent variable right here raised to the first power what's in front of that a function that's a function of T a function of our independent variable equals functions that are constant that's cool this is a first-order linear first order differential equation we're gonna use exactly the same techniques to solve it my whole goal for this first part was just to get you familiar with the formula because sometimes we're given that we go that looks like crap I have no idea what's going on here's what's going on hopefully I've done a good job of explaining what's going on with these mixture problems you were trying to find you're trying to find an equation it gives you how much salt is in a vat with respect to time if we solve this differential equation we're gonna find an equation that gives us how much salts are installed we find X of T how much salt is in the bath after certain amount of time how we're getting around that idea of solving that directly is saying I don't really know how to solve it directly let's find a differential equation let's look at how that salt is changing well the amount of salt is changing in that we say how much we're getting in - how much we're getting out okay how much we get in it how does that how's that I'm not beginning and changing well that would be the rate in terms of concentration how fast you're pouring in and the concentration of what you're pouring in - how the facts are pouring out and the concentration of what's your for now that difference there would be how that salt amount is changing okay cool let's call some variables let's look at what's constant you're pouring it into constant rate Watson your concentration of which appointed not changing constant the rate at which you point out constant not changing the concentration of what's your point out can't be constant unless what you're pouring in matches exactly what you're pouring out and then this is a very boring problem because nothing ever changes you're like give me 30 of those please so nothing changes that's just done that's how it works so the concentration well the concentration out would be in that moment of time how does that VAT have in it how much salt is in that VAT / how much volume is in that event at that moment of time notice if you're right in right now are different the volume is growing or decreasing the amount of salt that's in there is always changing if your concentrations are changing so the concentration outlets believing your your tank or your VAT is a comparison of how much salts there divided by how much volume is there that's the concentrations how we find the concentration for everything so let's put that there okay we got that now that looks a lot like we could divide by the increment of T divided by delta T okay cool now we have an approximation for how the salt is changing over time let's do a limit let's do our calculus one that's now a derivative so the way that X is changing with respect to time instantaneously is how the Mount is changing - the amount L we have that down then we subtract on both sides and we get a linear first-order difference equation and that's where that formula comes from let's I'm gonna erase the board and we're going to do three examples we're gonna kind of go from easy ones to some harder ones and then we'll call it good so now that we have hopefully a good feel for how a mixture problem is going to work let's look through three examples so the first one very basic we're just gonna get our feet wet with this no pun intended by water or sugar water here but what I'm going to do is I'm going to start with this in this example and show you how that comes about from it so we're gonna I'm gonna kind of repeat myself a little bit here because I really want to get the idea it is worthless for someone to be able to do the math without understand what's behind it so let's look at this situation we've got this thousand liter tank and it's really well stirred so if we put something in there we're gonna assume that it's stirred up perfectly like instantaneous 3000 liter tank and it contains 100 kilograms of sugar so is this this mixture that has 100 kilograms of sugar in a thousand liters well that's a concentration isn't it now we're gonna pump in some pure water so Jim man Jim's were messing up today alright he put in a hundred kilograms instead of ten so Jim just way over dinner with the sugar he's a sweet guy but I mean come on all right so we got a hundred kilograms we want ten so what's Jim what Jim is gonna do he's gonna drain some of it but he's gonna start over so he's gonna drain some of it and you're gonna pour in pure water what's it gonna do if you start pouring pour pure water and draining out what the the current concentration is well then you're gonna start losing sugar aren't you you're pouring something pure you're taking out something has sugar in your concentration is gonna drop our question is how long is it gonna take for us to get this mixture that it has only ten kilograms in the tank so we want to find a formula again suspense is not good for math so we want to find a formula for the amount of sugar and set it equal to ten then we can solve for T how long that's going to take let's start by identifying what our variables are we need to know a rate in the concentration in a rate out and something for the concentration out so let's talk about the rate in rate in is how fast are you pouring into whatever you're born in in our case we're pouring in this pure water at five liters per second let's call that five our units match up we're talking about liters so we get five liters greater seconds so when we solve this RT is going to be in terms of seconds what else me well the concentration in concentration we're pumping in pure water how much sugar is in pure water well if it's pure water nothing no sure so how much actual sugar is being put into this none zero sugar in what we're putting in so the concentration would be zero how about the rate out rate out is also five so whatever this mixture is at that moment in time we're pumping out five liters per second concentration out we don't know if that is so as far as a concentration out no it doesn't say what that is in fact that's part of this this problem here is that that concentration is always changing so let's think how that's changing how the concentration changes is how much sugars in there at a moment in time divided by how much of volume is in there and that's not changing because what we're pouring in one poor now this is the same does it make sense that if you pour in five liters per second into this thousand liter tank and you take out five liters per second at any moment in time you're still gonna have a thousand liters so our concentration is X over V our X is going to change with respect to time but let's think about our V RV that we just mentioned it if you've got a thousand liter tank you're pouring in and taking out at the same rate that volume is constant so our volume here it's just going to be 1,000 well let's start putting this putting this all together if we take our variables and plug them in down here R sub I that's five C sub I that's zero minus R sub out five times C sub out that's x over 1,000 if times how much time is changing if we divide both sides by delta T notice how this whole thing is zero that's completely gone well we would get Delta X delta T is equal to negative 5x over 1,000 that's an approximation that's about right if we let our calculus report for us we get a differential equation if we add that to both sides oh my gosh better indeed I did get our dependent variable X here let's make sure X is with our DX over DT equals zero the only reason why I did this I'm not going to really do it after this so much is to show you that what you get from here by just using your logic of in out and all that stuff that the x over B is exactly what you did here by what most textbooks would give you as a form and so just use this why because we know how to deal with calc 1 that's why let's check it out could you actually get the same exact thing sure you get a DX DT get DX DT you got the rate out the rate out is 5 right out is 5 you get the volume volume is a thousand volumes a thousand you have an X next you have a rate in times concentration in that's five times zero oh you got a zero same exact stuff now comes our knowledge of hey then its chemical this is a linear first order differential equation can we solve it sure we know how to do our integrating factor of Rho of X we know that that's going to be e to the integral of whatever is in front of our X I prefer writing like that where we have 5 over 1000 you might even just do 1 over 200 so that might be a little bit nicer and we know all about this I'm not going to recover it again because I've done that many many times but this is the result with product rule we're trying to multiply everything by something that's going to show that so how that something works you want something repeats that's e to the whatever the integral of this is this has to be the derivative that exponent so 1 over 200 I also made a little bit of a mistake it's right here that should be a teeth because this right here needs to be a function of T naught X and it's going to happen to you two you're going to start putting the X everywhere because we're used to that being an independent variable it's not here it's T so we're gonna find Rho of T that's going to be knee to the integral of 1 over 200 DT well that's just going to be T over 200 we don't need a plus C that's totally fine that we deal and if we multiply everything by that so we have a DX DT no problem we've got a plus 1 over 200 and we have an equals 0 and if we multiply both sides by e to the T over 200 we don't work for your own X on the right hand side 0 times anything is 0 on the left hand side this is now the result of some sort of product rule on a product and let's double check is this the derivative of this and sure enough it is e to the T over 200 comes back the derivative of T over 200 is 1 over 200 we have our X so this is the result of some sort of product rule which we're going to write over on the right hand side so the derivative with respect to T of this product we're getting this piece this would on a product rule that the first does not get a derivative so this is a result of something not being so that one think if you pass this is the result of that product rule where we don't take a derivative of the first factor this is the result of the product or we don't take a derivative of the second factor so that's going to be our X on the right hand side we get zero now if that's is a derivative then an integral is going to undo that derivative let's do an integral with respect to T on both sides on the left hand side integrals are new derivatives no problem we get e to the T over 200 times X on the right hand side we don't get 0 remember that this is with respect to T sure but you're gonna have a see a constant now it's about time for us to use an initial value like I might give an initial value you sure are the very first sentence says a thousand liter tank that contains 100 kilograms of sugar so at the start that's what this X of T means this X of T means how much sugar is in there at a certain amount of time so for us well at time zero we have a hundred kilograms of sugar so remember what we're doing we're trying to find a formula that tells us how much sugars in that tank at any given time at time zero we had a hundred kilograms so if we plug in T equals zero X has to be 100 e to the zero is 1 1 times 100 to 100 C equals 100 and if we rewrite that we're going to give something that we can easily solve for X so I know that we kind of switch variables around and instead of Y we have X as our dependent variable but that's that's kind of the idea of working with that X is that that X should be this equation that says how much the amount is of whatever our solution is over a certain amount of time the way we're structuring this is let's think about how that solution is changing well that's solution in - solution out gives us a nice difference of equation we solve it we solve the difference equations which represents how the solution is changing and find out the amount of the solution at a given amount given time that's greater let's multiply both sides by e to the negative 2t over 200 and we would get X of T equals 100 e to the negative T over 200 Y negative does that make sense of the exponent is negative you have a vat of sugar and your poignant pure water you also draining out the solution it drain out sugar this right here should decrease our sugar amount should decrease exponentially it's exponential decay that's kind of cool do you see the interplay between how our sugars changing and the amount of sugar in the tank so how our sugars changing that's a difference of equation it says how long should the amount of sugar how that amount is changing is out in - out no problem when I solve the differential equation it's giving me that so that the solution for how much sugar is actually that for a given amount of time that's it now we can answer the question when winds a time when will there be 10 kilograms okay if X represents how much there is when will this equal 10 that's what we're asking so when will there be 10 kilograms solve for the time that gives us 10 kilograms if we divide both sides by 100 if we do an Ln on both sides and if we multiply both sides by negative 200 no what did I get about 460 seconds how I know its seconds is because that was what our team was defined for so this was five liters per second so that change is also in seconds yeah I hope that makes sense I hope it makes sense that we're really relating this how our solution is changing to a differential equation and then I'm doing that to find what our amount is after certain amount of time it's pretty cool that we can even do it we see an integrating factor just so we can do with any linear first order differential equation and then we can solve by understanding that yes we have an initial condition initial value and then when we're when we modify our function that we found we can typically either find how much is there after certain amount of time or how long it's going to take for us to get that amount and that's what we did in this case so we've got two more let's work on the mouth let's start a new problem so you have a swimming pool and through someone's air gyms you have this this pool that's eight thousand cubic feet of water but it has a twenty five percent chlorine solution to it concentration that's a lot of chlorine so the kids are getting out my eyes man Jim so you decide that you're going to just change it over time and you're gonna add 502 cubic feet of 5% solution why would you eat pure water maybe you live in a town that has like a lot of chlorine in your water and a gas about a percent so you add 500 cubic feet of 5% solution a day so just putting a hose in that hopefully you're gonna drain this water somewhere else not waste it but and you drain the same amount so you're gonna drain out exactly the amounts to put in question how much is your what is your volume I'm going to do is your volume gonna change or you're going I'm going to remain constant if you're adding and subtracting the same amount so for an import out the same L it's going to remain constant so when will there be a 10% concentration let's go ahead and figure this out so the first thing we want to do is identify what's the rate in what's the rate out what's the concentration in what's an expression for the concentration out the rate in says the word we have 500 cubic feet of 5% a day so what if we get this our time is going to be in days so right in 500 right now 500 no problem says out of the same exact same that now amount out so that's the same rate out concentration in says we have five percent let's make that point zero five we know percentages work like that for decimals concentration out we don't know it's working at a minute but the volume because we're adding in and subtracting out of the same amount our volume is always going to be 8,000 8,000 cubic feet now the concentration out what we've been learning is that the concentration out is a relationship between how much chlorines in there divided by the volume of our tank or in our case how much chlorines in there divided by 8,000 because that volume isn't gonna change in this scenario let's start putting that into our differential equation that we know we're gonna get so dxdt how our chlorines changing with respect to time notice this is how it's changing how Florian's changing the spec the time the rate of change of chlorine in the strength of time if we undo this derivative we get the amount of chlorine with respect to time that's the idea the position of the chlorine how much we have so the rate in says we're gonna have okay 500 times the concentration in that's 5% minus the rate out that's 500 times the concentration out that's how much is they are compared to how much we have how much chlorines there compared to how much of volume we're taking out that's always gonna be 8,000 well let's simplify some things looks like we get 25 this 25 yeah 25 minus 116 X that is a linear first order differential equation if we add 116 X to both sides we know something that we can work with I would encourage you to try on your own right now if you have it if you haven't tried it try it man stop the video figure out what your integrating factor if you have to figure out what row of X has to be integrate 116 take e to the integral of 1/16 and then multiply that everywhere we're gonna do it now but you might want to pause this and try there you go so for us wrote e so this is with respect to time is e to the integral of 1/16 DT that means that we're going to get e to the T over 16 really similar last problem the only difference here is that we had a concentration in that wasn't zero let's multiply that everywhere so we have e to the T over 16 DX DT we've got 1/16 e to the T over 16 which is really clear to see that this is the derivative of this that's great that's perfect for us times X we don't forget that equals 25 e to the T over 16 also in this case because we had a concentration in this isn't zero now what we do know about these differential equations that are linear is that this is the result of a product rule on some derivative with respect to T of this term times that term this factor times X that's and then leave the first alone derivative the second spaghettini cool driven first with respect to T got it leave the second loan not a problem on the right hand side we have exactly the same thing and this lets us take an integral with respect to T on the left hand side integrals undo derivatives that's awesome we get e to the T over 16 times x equals on the right hand side well let's see we'd have u equals T over 16 so once we're you have to multiply both sides by 6 over 2 multiplied by 16 so if you equals T over 16 D u equals DT over 16 that means 16 D u equals DT so let's let's put that in there 1625 let's see 4 times 45 is 100 times for the beam 400 plus C you can do a couple things right now if you really wanted to you can solve for that that X but I would solve for C right now so solving for C you're going to have to have an initial value now a lot of times it's not specifically given to you you got to find it in the mixture problem so let's go back to the beginning this is we've got a swimming pool and our pool has 8,000 cubic feet of water and it has a 25% solution of chlorine do you realize that at this point we have an equation that's giving us the amount of chlorines not the rate of change of the chlorine it's the amount of the chlorine at a certain time I don't want me to start at the start of this at time 0 the amount of chlorine says well you had 8,000 cubic feet times a 25% 0.25 times of 25% concentration what that means is that the amount at time 0 was how much total fluid you had but there's only 25 percent of its chlorine multiply that man to better make sense to you right now that at the start of this in your swimming pool there's actually 200 cubic feet of chlorine if that's 25 percent makeup of that pool so 8,000 cubic feet 25% of it was chlorine that means that you had 8,000 times 0.25 that's 2,000 cubic feet of chlorine is chlorine that's 2,000 cubic beautiful ring that's your initial value so if we plug in 0 for T we know that X is two thousand one times 2000 equals 400 times 1 plus C equals 1600 and if we admit this we get plus 1600 now let's multiply both sides which means all three terms by e to the negative 16 sorry e to the negative T over 16 this will be gone this will be gone this will gain an e to the negative T over 16 can we walk through this one time with you we start off with labeling everything that we possibly can we understand that we're creating a differential equation which gives us the rate of change of the chlorine with respect to time solving that differential equation says now we're no longer talking about the rate we're talking about the amount of chlorine with respect to time that's given by this stay standing from our initial value saying we had eight thousand cubic feet of water okay 25% of its chlorine that's two thousand cubic feet cubic feet of flooring that we started with so at least set that equal and then we solve we get a function that says this right here is going to tell you how much chlorine is there with respect to time now we answer the question how moms are gonna take he'll find the team how long is it gonna take find the team when until there would be a 10% now we are putting in taking out the same amount of fluid same amount of mixture here we want 10% of this to be chlorine at the end so we want the amount of chlorine to be 10% of the volume of the fluid okay how much fluids in there what's the volume does it has it ever changed no it's 8,000 so we want 10% of that to be the amount so if X of T represents the amount of chlorine that's actually in there we want 10% of 8,000 to be fluorine does that make sense to you I hope that that makes sense to you but you go right well or here I want 10% of my volume to be chlorine I want 800 cubic feet so the question comes down to and this is this is why this one was I'm doing this example is because when you get the concentrations and the percentages you're gonna have to multiply by the amounts there so to find your initial value 25 percent was chlorine okay multiply but when you buy you want 10 percent to be Florida okay multiply what's there 8,000 times 10 percent 0.10 that gives you you want 889 cubic feet so the question boils down to if this shows you how much chlorine is actually there for certain time we want to find out when this is going to equal 800 cubic feet so when is our chlorine ex going to be 800 and that's pretty easy to solve I would encourage you to do on your own I mean we'd have to subtract 400 we'd have to divide by 1600 so here we have 400 over 1600 that's 1/4 taking Ln so Ln of 1/4 equals negative T over 16 multiplied by negative 16 so T equals negative 16 Ln of 1/4 what's our T in minutes hours years days well because we're draining this in per day this is going to be about twenty two point two days is it making sense to you hope it is I hope that you're understanding the relationship between differential equation is the rate undo that you find the amount that's so cool and we're just using the techniques that we've already known or have we have one more problem we're going to go through a little bit more advanced because our volumes gonna be changing I have to show you how to do that and then we'll be done okay one more so we have another situation we got this tank of a brine solution now it's a 400 gallon tank but you have a hundred gallons full so it's not full of this brine with 50 pounds of salt in it so you probably had some water and you put in 50 pounds of salt and you're going to fill it up with this this other brine until it's full so the question is if you add that has 1 pound per gallon and you're filling this at 5 gallons a second and you're out flowing it at 3 gallons a second how much salt is in the tank when the tank is full we're gonna go ahead and do this problem but before we even start it I want to ask two questions number one I want to ask what's the what's the expression for the volume and the tank because this volume is changes not like the other two examples this is probably the biggest part of the problem here is the volume and then when is the tank full so let's do the volume first as far as our volume is concerned our volume starts at how much how much is the air when we start the problem well we have a third of gallons right now now look at what is happening we're adding at five gallons a second we're subtracting at three gallons a second if we're adding more than we're subtracting our volume is increasing so it's not subtracting it's adding how much is it adding per second well well we have a hundred 100 gallons in there right now but we're gonna add five gallons in - three gallons out for every T seconds you guys get that we're in time right now we're at I this for seconds so let's start the situation at zero seconds so when T is zero we had 100 gallons after every second that passes I've added five I've subtracted three that's a total of adding two so our volume is a relationship that says you have a hundred gallons plus two gallons per second that needs to make sense think through this work right now when you started have 100 gallons and as every second passes you've added five subtract three magnifies up a to three out of five you're adding two gallons or every second that's a big deal so when we get to filling out our concentration out we'll just have x over that now when is the tank full well if you are gaining two gallons for every second how much do we need to gain in order for us to have a full tank well we want to have 400 gallons at the end right now we have 100 so we need to fill up 300 how many gallons are we adding every second five in three out for a tea - so when's this going to be fulsome the time would equal 300 gallons / - thousands per second notice even how to use work we'd get 150 seconds these are two really important piece of information that we want to do first that when we get to them later we have the right stuff for us so we get this former gallon tank it's 100 gallons full great let's see we have filling up five gallons a second in three down the second out that's two gallons a second 300 gallons to make up we have two gallons a second that's 150 seconds volume the volume is this relationship between we had 100 and we're adding 2 gallons a second this is the same idea used in two different ways so the next thing we're gonna do maybe we put our initial value right now to that how much salt was there at the very beginning of it so this hundred gallon tank has 50 pounds of salt so be before those last two examples we did our initial value second now that we know we have to have it we have our volume expression we know when our tank is going to be full we want to figure that out first how much is the salts in there when it's full and then we need an initial value so at time of zero right when the stock starts how much salt and remember X is how much of the actual item is in there how much salt is in there the dx/dt is how is that amount changing when we gonna do that with derivatives we get how much salts in there this is gonna help us solve for an arbitrary constant here we go c0 is 850 pounds of salt I'm gonna pause for just a second to make sure that you get this so we had this situation where not only is our concentration out changing our volume is also changing so this is a little different than the previous two examples or saying here that we want to fill this tank up and we want to determine how much salt is in there when we fill it when we fill it up it's going to be in 150 seconds so we get all done we're going to be plugging in 150 40 instead of solving for T we're doing something different we're trying to figure out what how much salts in there after that amount of time now we also know where we start we need an initial value to solve for an arbitrary constant worried to get when we go through a process of solving or differential equation lastly our volume well our volume is now relationship it's now related to our time so let's fill out what we can the rate in well we know that's five the concentration in one pound per gallon is an appropriate concentration you can use that one one pound per gallon right out that would be three gallons per second notice how we're in second so what we get out of this is going to be seconds this is all seconds concentration out the concentration out relates how much salt is there with respect to time divided by your volume which is always changing notice how this concentration in this concentration are in the same same relationship this is one pound per gallon this is X pounds per gallon of volume so that's okay to have that as long as they have the same relationship there now we can start plugging in this this is better makes sense that you're in at five gallons you're out at three gallons you have a concentration of one pound per gallon in concentration of X pounds per gallon X pounds per gallon out let's plug this into the difference in the equation you might want to try this on your own three times x over 100 plus 2t that looks pretty good to me that's a differential equation o my dependent variable X is over here I'm gonna group my DX over DT with my X term I'm gonna make it look like that linear different for shorter differential equations we want with X off to the back so this is my P this is the thing I'm getting creating now I'm going to find my integrating factor so that I can treat this like the linear first order differential equation it is so what we're going to multiply by is e to the integral of nasty crap it's not all that bad we can pull the three out we can pull the three out we have them do it quickly you should do in your own we have natural log of 100 plus two T divided by the derivative of mu because you have a u sub here so u equals 100 plus 2t derivative of B 2 DT divided by 2 you're going to get 1 over you you'll get Ln of you put it back but then you'd be dividing by 2 so all this works out to was you should try your own would be 3 halves Ln 100 plus 2t I'm dropping the absolute value because time is positive we're not going back in time we're going forward in time so we don't need that there so the 3 comes out you divide by 2 because that's a u sub there and you have Ln of 1 or plus 2t so let's simplify this a bit because we can if we move this as an exponent we get what we're going to multiply by to create this result of a product rule is that let's go ahead let's multiply that everywhere so from right here we're going to multiply one two three terms by this integrating factor so that's going to allow us to create this part rule let's see if I did it right got this we multiplied here looks good kept this multiplying here kept my tax got my five multiply here everything's multiplied by the same thing I'll take a derivative imagine doing this I bring down the three paths I leave this alone I would subtract one from it and we're gonna bop about to do that when we simplify and I multiplied by the inside which is two so that's where our two's going away there so if I simplify this here's one here's one and a half now we can really see it if I take a derivative this piece we've got three cows leave it inside alone to the one half there it is and then times the derivative inside by the chain rule that gives us two which would get rid of the three paths part of it we get to that we just gave three now that's the result of the product rule let's write the product product is you left this piece alone I mean that derivative was taken you let this piece alone when this derivative is taken equals and now it's just a matter of integrating both sides with respect to D integrals I do derivatives we have this 100 plus 10t 10 to three-halves x equals on the right hand side we go through the kind of the same exact idea we can pull the 5 out we have another you so we add one to our exponent so 5 keep our inside add one to the exponent divided by the exponent but also divided by the derivative in sites or you would be this 100 plus 2t notice how when you take the derivative you get D u equals 2 DT you have to divide by 2 so you have an extra 2 here because of that you said well this is making sense you kept the 5 this would be u raised to the 5 halves divided by 5 maps but then also divided by that 2 plus C try it for yourself make sure you're doing this so we will get 100 plus 2 T to the three halves x equals well gone gone gone gone 100 plus 2 T to the 5 halves let's see it might actually be now I saw first I'd still saw proceeded without elma and I'm solving for C so we need initial value oh man hey good thing we did that first so when we have zero time passed we have 250 pounds of salt we can use that now this is the amount of salt after time that's what solving the differential equation did us instead of rate of how the salt is changing we have amount of salt pretty cool so when we plug in zero for T we get 50 for X so 0 to the three-halves times 50 equals zero to 5 X plus C this gets a little crazy but 100 plus zero is a 100 square root of 100 is 10 10 to the third is a thousand so this is 50 thousand four thousand times 50 is 50 thousand four equals right hand side 100 square root of hundreds 10 to the fifth would be zeros of 100,000 so C equals negative 50,000 so when you change it's meant to race this we get then 100 plus 2t to the three halves power times x equals 100 plus 2t to the five halves power minus 50,000 we are almost over so close all we've got to do now is solve for X so when we solve for X let's multiply every single term by 100 plus two T to the negative three halves power negative three halves power is going to kill this off its going to subtract three halves and you're gonna get a negative three halves over here so we have X the amount of salt after time is going to equal this is completely gone this remember your x this to the native three halves it's going to subtract exponents 5 X minus 3 house is to s as 1 minus 50,000 times 100 plus 2t to the negative three halves I hope you see what's going on we multiplied by B multiplied actually by this thing here create one here created this to the first 5sos three house here you had to multiply it so it's got to be there man that's nasty but that's that's our result as far as our particular solution here so we started off with a rate of change we created a differential equation we solve it we got an amount we got a function for the amount of salt after a certain amount of time so what do we do now well we want to know how much salt is in there when the tank is full this is a different type of question in the last two last two was how long would it take to get this amount of salt now it's how much salt is there after the tank is full the tank is full in 150 seconds we want to talk about that that's why we did that so if the tank is full in 150 seconds we want to know how much salt is there after 150 seconds because at 150 seconds that tank is going to be right to the brim anything past that it's going to be overflowing you think before that Sun may be full so full would be at 400 gallons two seconds gallon to go from 100 to 400 to be 150 seconds so we want to know how much salt is in there how much salt is in there when it's full after a hundred fifty seconds have passed so we need X of 150 seconds oh yeah it looks to me like we get about see if you can do this on your own 393 point 75 pounds of silver we started in town so dancers gonna be in pounds we started in second so we had to use seconds not minutes not hours lot I really hope it makes sense so weird the last that's a less example for applications here but my goal for this video was for you to see the interplay between using a rate of change like for a mixture problem how our amount is changing with respect to time and using differential equation to find the amount from that because a lot of these questions ask amounts but you can't get it directly you've got to start with a rate and then do integrals from for it run it sorry with it for our differential equations and that's pretty cool I hope it's explained well enough how to how the rate of in and the concentration of n are constant how the rate of out has to be constant but how the concentration of out relates to the amount we have in there to give them at a time compared to the volume that we have for a given number time I hope it explained how to find the initial values how that's rarely given to you you have to start with what's you have to read through the problem and find out what's actually starting and then for our questions we're almost always saying how long so that's a time will it take to get this amount of salt so once you figure out your about function you set the amount and then solve for t with usually some L ends typically you'll have you but usually it's that so solving how long that's a T will we have this amount of salt or in this case what's the amount of salt when this happens after 10 minutes after a hundred seconds after the tank is full what's it taking it before tanks full after another 30 seconds this right here is kind of a hard key of the whole problem because if you don't know that this is necessary you're never going to be able to plug in a team so reading through the problem very carefully helps us identify these these four key I hope that makes sense next time you deal with a couple extra that extra a couple different techniques which is super exciting we'll talk about homogeneous equations we'll talk about exact equations Bernoulli the equations will talk about substitution techniques all sorts of fun stuff so hope you enjoy this one I'll see you for another video you
