Transcript for: Special Integration in a Linear Differential Equation Problem (Differential Equations 18)
Hey so I was working on some problems and I came across this one and we were in the the linear differential equations and our first order difference equations and this one just threw me for a loop and I thought man that's a lot more involved and some of the stuff we did it's got this kind of special technique of integrating where it doesn't quite fit what you would normally look at for integration and that happened and count too but when I came across I thought this deserves its own videos so we're gonna go through this example I'm gonna go quite slow on this one because it's so involved there's lots of room for errors and frankly I made a couple of errors myself when I did the first time so I wanted to give you the courtesy of giving this problem walking walking through it with you and and just showing you exactly what takes place so sometimes we get these difficult integrations or in these integrations that don't quite fit I want to look at that with you so let's go through together let's see if we can classify this as a first order differential equation that happens to be in that little linear category now let's work with it so we're looking at this for going well that's a difference of equation of course we have an initial value problem we've got an equation first order differential and we have Y to the first power so let's try to get this to look like how we really want our our linear equations to look with just that dy/dx and then we have this thing this function of X is next to our Y on one side and then equals this function of X so have you if you watch the last the last video that should make sense to you if you haven't you really should watch that right now this is a great opportunity for us to kind of go step by step see if you can do this step and so I'm gonna be going slow to see you can work through it and then see if we're on the same page so is it a linear first-order differential equation yes is it in the right form no you should probably try to put that in the right form right now we want the dy/dx to be by itself function of x times y and then equal sign and then another function of X no otherwise so that means for us we've got divided by the x squared plus 1 we're going to do that divide all three terms by that x squared plus 1 and so we get that that's the form that we want so that's familiar to you that's fantastic you you know that proper form for solving this first-order linear differential equations now it looks fairly benign like yeah okay no problem it's it's in the proper order of this thing is the function of X that we're looking for so that right there is that P of X we're talking about remember with linear first order difference of equations we're trying to find something to multiply by so that we can create this result of a product rule if we can create the result of a product rule we can write the product if we know that that was there was that what we have here is the result of the product rule okay well that's great then we can take an integral of both sides and solve for our function so right now what we're gonna be doing is we're going to be finding this thing to multiply by this integrating factor that we're multiplying by it's going to multiply every single term it's going to create for us the result of a product rule then we're going to integrate and that's all that we're going to do so I'm going to find the product and then we're going to integrate both sides in order to find that integrating factor what we were what we talked about last last video was that we wanted to repeat so we want the derivative of this thing to repeat the function and the derivative of the function need to have the same thing in it that means we're gonna have each of a function also because it's the result of a product rule the thing we're multiplying by here is going to be part of that product so this is going to be the X part of that product this has to be the derivative of the exponent of the exponential that we're going to multiply by and that was in that last video so our P of X is this whole entire thing all right no problem that means that if we're gonna find if this is the derivative of some exponential function of the exponent that exponential function then Rho of X would equal e to the f of X sure wrote of X that even the f of X is the only type of derivative that we are on it's type of function we have when we take a derivative of it we get the function back so on our product rule we want this piece to go here and we want the derivative of this piece to be here the little bits we need we needed to repeat this is gonna be tacked on over on this right hand side it was in the last video well if we do this if we take the derivative of e to the f of X we leave it alone by the product rule for the first term we take the derivative of it here so this is gonna have to be multiplied here but then that piece that P of X must be the derivative of f of X that was all explained the last video what that means in order to find the f of X we've got to undo this as if that is the derivative it means we get integrated so this would be the integral of 3x squared over x squared plus 1 DX and this is where I'm going to spend most of our time right now it's just integrating that and then this thing's gonna explode and look crazy which is why it does I think it deserves on video so let's take a look at how to solve this integral let's find that so I'm gonna ignore the e for a second we'll put it back in just a bit but let's focus on you know what I'm going to do I'm gonna leave this I'm going to put it up here I'm gonna show you two ways to look at that integral and then then we'll come back and we'll read kind of reevaluate let's go on here so let's look at this integral of x cubed 3x cubed over x squared plus 1 DX your first inclination might be to go oh wow that looks just like maybe trig so because we got the x squared plus 1 and it's not partial fractions because you can't well you can maybe like write partial fractions but if you've thought about partial fractions it's not a direct partial fraction because the exponent here is higher than exponent here that might lead you down long division that is an appropriate technique I'm going to show you that in a minute but there's also a way around not doing that not doing long division I kind of like long division I like perfect fractions there's another way to look at it so I'm going to show you both ways is one of the reasons why we're doing the problem right now what if you just chose to do a substitution and you go that doesn't look like a substitution but maybe we can force it to be if we did u equals x squared plus 1 let's just run with this then D u equals 2x DX you go I don't see an X it seemed x cubed up there this is one of the reasons how I was taught I was taught how to do integration by substitution by solving for the DX and that way when you put this back it'll cancel some X's but some won't cancel and that's okay and so level to check that out so if you've never seen that this is how I would do it in like a calc 1 class to explain what's exactly going on and then we sort of transform this into well you're really just looking for the DX and all the X's you group them together well what if that doesn't work then you get stuck or you have to think about this as 3x squared times X which is totally fine too and then you're you've divided by 2 and your XD X this X DX would change into D u over 2 but you'd still have a 3x squared then we're going to see that on either technique so whatever you want to do that's fine well we're gonna do is we're going to look at this as let's leave that 3x cubed we know that we call this U but then we know that DX is substituted and we use the substitution D u over 2x and this is what I was talking about as far as the cancel is concerned when we look at this we know that we can pull out the 3 halves but X is going to cancel with X cubed and leave squared so whether you write that as three x squared times X and just substitute it do you / - here's our do you / - it's gonna work the same thing so we have a 3/8 integral of x squared over you do you pulled out the three-halves cancel one of the x's we've got an x squared over you do you and then you go wait a minute that's not how I've learned out of these substitutions that doesn't work the oh yeah you're right because all of your variables have to match and so when this happens it's okay to use your substitution twice you have forgot about that it's been a long time for a lot of you since you've even looked at substitution some of the comments on the videos are saying it man you're I'm so glad you're going through this because I forgot how to do it happens happens to everybody so whenever you have this situation where you did a substitution it wasn't trig so you know I don't want to do long division what you could have maybe I can just do a substitution to work with it this happens quite a bit where if we use the substitution one time to get rid of x squared plus one we got that you maybe we try to use it again to get rid of another variable up there so if u equals x squared plus one and we still have an x squared well can you just subtract one from both sides and get x squared equals u minus one since that substitution works for you equals x squared plus one it has to work for x squared equals u minus one it's the same it's an identity I mean you're calling these things equal so however you add or subtract on both sides it has to still be equal that means that x squared we can rewrite that x squared as u minus 1 let's take a look at that a little bit closer so when we have that three-halves integral of u minus 1 over u do you remember remember how when you have a number of terms on a new writter but only one term on the denominator which is why this works you can split that fraction up so we can write u over u which is 1 minus 1 over u do you and that looks a whole lot better that's not a fraction we don't need another substitution we've split that fraction up into two fractions we don't have any X's so our use match or D use this is something where you can now either great so we have the three ass make sure you have parentheses because that's going to distribute here we have you - Ln absolute value of U and then we would normally have a plus C but remember what we're doing what we're doing is just finding this exponential we're going to multiply that everywhere so it's going to get multiplied here it's right here and here and here which means that that see that'd be e to the C well that's just a constant not zero it's actually positive on all three places so and you could easily divide it out for that reason we don't do a plus C Warner integrating on top of our exponential it's not needed what is needed is for us to put our you back so we use this to get our you okay now let's use this to get our our X's back so we used you one time to get two x's we're going to use that substitution again to get back to use sorry back from use so to use use the you to get rid of the x's and use the e to get rid of your use that's fine so our u is x squared plus one we used it to get rid of our X's now we're gonna back and if we distribute that three hats notice I'm gonna I'm gonna drop my absolute value because x squared plus one it can't be negative with real numbers so we don't even need that now that looks really nasty that is just the exponent of what we're gonna have to multiply by so we're gonna come back here in just a minute I'm gonna show you how the long division would work just in case you forgotten how to do that and I'll show you that we get exactly the same thing and whichever technique you would like to use that's fine so one more time what we're what we're looking at is this linear first order difference with equation we just put in the right form we said that's a P looks pretty okay and then we started going alright well if that's our P we need to integrate this to find the function of X so that when we would take the derivative by the product rule it would give us that back as that piece as the chain rule portion of the exponential derivative we go right well that's happen and that's nasty how do we do it not a treat so trust me you do not want that I tried it not fun so we do a maybe a substitution twice or we look anything that looks like a partial fraction with an irreducible quadratic can I maybe do long division well let's let's try our long division if we try the long division remember with long division you need every power on this numerator in here every power banks descending down to a constant so we have 3x cubed shirt when we have 0 x squared 0 X and then a constant of 0 the reason that is is when we start dividing by x squared plus 1 we need some place value holders because when we start distributing by whatever our our result is then we're going to start multiplying by x squared and by 1 we're going to start getting back some some powers of X to the power x cubed it's created squared or exes and we need to have a place for that so when we do long division of polynomials we only care about the one it just plays along so we look at what is 3 X cubed divided by x squared X cubed divided by x squared X sorry 3x and when we multiply it we can we can check your work long time our first terms have to always match up 3x times x squared is 3x squared no it's not 3x times x squared is 3x cubed but then when you distribute so we multiply the first term we multiply the second term notice how we're going to get a 3x that 3x has to fall under something if you didn't have that 0 X right here it'd be really often when I subtract that from well you don't have any X's this is a way for us to understand that what we're doing here is we're subtracting from something's not there we're going to get a negative x or if you're subtracting negative you're going to get a positive X it just gives your mind a way to see what's going on so when we subtract like long division always does yeah you need parentheses 3x cubed minus 3x cubed is 0 0 x squared that's there's no other X Squared's that's nothing you don't even need that 0 X minus 3 X 0 X minus 3x and then you start that algorithm again take the first term divided by the first term you go I can't and you're right as soon as and this is what help this is how powerful fractions work as soon as that numerator has a degree that's less than your denominator you're done you can't simplify that anymore you'd have to use partial fractions or a substitution or break it up like we did here with this fraction so what to do with that well what to do with with this piece of it by the way maybe I probably should have done this we could have pulled that 3 out from the start and not even worried about the 3 doesn't matter not really you'll see it right now if we write our equation when we could by this polynomial by this polynomial so when we took this and started doing long division our result was 3x cool and then we had a remainder and how do you write the remainder of any fraction when you're dividing is you can write that remainder over what you just divided by so this integral changes into that integral can you see that if I pulled the 3 out from this term in that term it would be exactly the same as if I pulled the 3 out there doesn't matter not really in fact when we get done with this we distribute the three halves anyway so take your pick it doesn't really matter what it does matter is your ability to do the rest of this so if you go well that this still doesn't look all that all that great I can do the integral of this one but that one looks a little funky you go to what should I use there should I use partial fractions no you should you should use a substitution because if you take the derivative of 2 X of x squared plus 1 you're gonna get 2 X and all we really care about is the variables matching up so here integral of 3x gives us 3x squared over 2 that looks pretty familiar then we have this and we'll see that in just a bit then we have this whole alright well if I do a substitution on just this piece then we're seeing that this integral is we had a three stool we substitute them using another technique now X DX so we have a deed over to so 3 and then D over 2 3 over u D over 2 and if we pull out that 3000 and integrate we've got 1 over you that's element you and we end up with three halves Ln X square plus one let me double check to make sure we're on the right track yep okay so you might be noticing a difference here and you go well Leonard if I I take this I take that and I take a look at that and those don't look the same even if I distribute this even I can see that that's that's got a plus three-halves in that one that one doesn't what's what's wrong what you do wrong do anything wrong what happened here is that your your integrals can be automatic constant we talked about how that constant isn't going to make difference so whether you include that or whether you don't the very first thing you would do is divide it away anyway so whichever one you have that's fine so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use that one it's a little bit more concise that we can show this one it's fine but you'd be dividing anyway so I'm gonna take a break I'm gonna race the board to leave just these two things so make sure you're okay with your integration then we're gonna start multiplying back let's continue so now that we've found out that that integral is either this or that and I'm going to show you that both of them work out exactly the same we can now make that integrated factor we can now make that relevant so we know that this thing that we're multiplying by equals e to the nasty junk either way you cut it so I'm going to show this one and then I'm going to replace a piece of it with this to show you in just a moment it's gonna work out exactly the same here you see what I'm talking about so let's start with this guy that we got by that long division we have e to the 3x squared over 2 minus three-halves ln x squared plus 1 ok that looks pretty good actually no it doesn't but we can still work with it let's start separating this and try to get rid of that Ln remember that what we can do is we can move these exponents to numerators so we could write this as e to the 3x squared over 2 well a couple things we could do times e to the negative three-halves ln x squared plus 1 so we're separating we know that x bones that are added and subtracted me and they came from a multiplication into twos that is a negative and then if you added those X coats you the exact same back and then we move that to the numerator so e to the 3x period over two times e to the ln x squared plus one to the negative three-halves I'm just moving that as an exponent and now we see that's a composition of these inverse functions and those always eliminate other they are inverses so this is gone let's rewrite in just a bit now this is what we're going to multiply to create this result of a product over here and here and here and then I'm going to do what I promised and show you why this difference doesn't matter so let's go ahead let's multiply that so this gets multiplied man it's going to be a really long long equation here here and here and here to create this result of a product rule on the left hand side let's do it dy/dx and we multiply by e to the 3x square root of 2 times x squared plus 1 to the negative 3x yay let me do it again so we multiply that here we still have this garbage times y and it may be the equal sign and we multiply on the right hand side also see it all three places here here your no sign there's I have the original let's make sure that original rigid looks pretty good I'll make sure that I have that looking looking correct so I used it here let's see make sure I simplified so I separated that by exponents and multiplication I know that I can move this as an exponent so I did that I know that I have composition of inverse functions no problem that's it the same okay that looks really good so I'm always double-checking my work especially some like this that's crazy now I mentioned to you that this doesn't really matter so much so why why doesn't that matter if you took a look at this and instead of having 3x squared over 2 minus three-halves ln and you just had that plus three-halves that would have been please check this out don't miss this that would have been here that would have been oh if I have that plus three-halves i could separate that as an e to the three halves that plus three-halves right here that right there would have been written as either yes think about that this is all going to be an exponent on e on the exponential so e to the three-halves x squared times e to the three-halves times e to the negative three-halves ln x squared plus one you do the same thing with this one same things that one is you did over there but that guy that's either the three-halves so what would happen well when you do this and you simplify this down you'd still have this even the three-halves just floating out there well when you multiply that you have a times in three house at times e to the three-halves and at times you three-halves and if you have something this positive number there but it's positive its own it's not a whole number but it's a positive number that you could factor out and divide you're not dividing by zero what that means is that that's and that's an arbitrary constant it's literally arbitrary it makes no difference in this problem whatsoever in fact if you just divide all three terms by that constant it remains exactly the same so sometimes you get that when you're doing this integrals two different ways you might get this awkward constant up there that doesn't make a bit of difference and you're integrating factor you should divide it away and that's fine if you were thinking about this like we'll wait a minute what about whatever if you're just doing a regular old integral well that wouldn't make so much of a difference either you'd have a constant in there that doesn't really matter as far as the adding subtracting you'd be able to rationalize that we'll divide that away so when we get back to our work whether you have that plus three-halves or whether you don't not such a big concern what is a concern now is making sure that this is the result of a product rule you go that's going to be hard to check yes it might be because here's the here's the factor that you would have to take the derivative of in order to get this whole entire piece that means that you have a product rule that means that you have a chain rule you start looking at them and you'd have to divide that away you'd have to the factor that because of that product rule so let's just imagine that is true hopefully that's true and or you'd have to check it by hand what we do after we check it mr. bill okay if this is the result of a product rule this thing that's been added then this is a factor that we didn't take a derivative of and this is a factor that we didn't take a derivative of and they're added together so remember how we leave the first factor alone derivative of the second so its root of Y that's your Y plus the derivative of the first that's the derivative of that factor that's the derivative of that thing and then times we leave the second one alone what that means is that this is a product rule the result of a product rule where a product is that this is the product rule from that thing on the right hand side let's simplify as much as we can so we know that e to the negative three halves x squared times e to the three times x squared you're multiplying common bases you add exponents these things are gone thank goodness right we'd still have six x here we have x squared plus 1 to the negative three halves that means that we move this to a denominator then be x squared plus 1 to the positive 3 halves let's combine them you've got two halves plus three halves let's bypass so now we're left with this idea of this is a derivative besides a derivative of this and if we want to get rid of the derivative we know that we can integrate so let's integrate both sides with respect to X this was a derivative with respect to X this let's find an integral with respect to X once you do to one side you have you the other so on the left hand side the fundamental theorem of calculus says integrals on new derivatives basically so we've gone we have this e to the 3x squared over 2 and then this X sorry you glad I forgot something should have been screaming at me through the video I told you that this is a product and then I never actually put the product so you need a y hopefully you got that so this this is the result of this product rule derivative the first boom sorry leave the first loan River the second plus the first derivative the first time the second time say that again because it sounded kind of convoluted in my head probably YouTube this is the result of this now product with you when you have the Y leave the first one alone derivative the second factor plus the derivative the first factor all that stuff times I forgot the why the first time so when we integrate both sides no problem we have e to the 3x over to this x squared plus 1 to the negative three halves times y on the right hand side we have another integral this one's not so bad it's just a substitution so when we substitute view equals x squared plus 1 let's do it off to the side here we have let's pull the sticks out we have 6 we would have X DX is d over 2 so this whole thing is d over 2 and then this is U to the 5 halves so 6 divided by 2 that gives us 3 let's make that a negative 5 half so we can work with it we integrate let's see about that we didn't have a 3u negative 5 halves we're gonna add one so it's negative 3 halves divided by the new exponent the Reiser gone moved that to up its negative you to the negative three house and we know what you do is we know that U is x squared plus one so this integral equals that thing with x squared plus one let's do that now we do need a plus C there that's important in fact this is the first time that we get to look at our initial value our initial value says that when we plug in zero for X we actually get one for y so let's do that now there's no LMS or anything in here so it might be a good idea to do it now so when we plug in zero for X plug in 0 for X this whole thing would be zero you would get e to the 0 that gives you 1 times plug in 0 for X here that would give you 0 plus 1 1 to any powers 1 sorry times y well Y is equal to 1 when x is 0 on the right hand side we have negative 2 of course we have 0 squared plus 1 is 1 1 to any power is 1 plus C this is 1 1 plus 2 gives you 3 C is 3 not 1/3 like I did in a few videos ago just randomly divided for no particular reason because I wanted to onyx it so C here is 3 let's plug that back in so we're gonna have eat at 3 x squared over 2 no problem looking good x squared plus 1 we can do this negative 3 halves y okay certainly kind of crazy equals negative 2 x squared plus 1 to the negative 3 halves and then we have this plus 3 all we have to do now is solve for y so we're going to divide both sides by this which it cannot be 0 so we might think about that say multiply times x squared plus 1 to the positive 3 house that would cancel cancel x squared plus 1 to the positive 3 house has to go there next thing we're going to do is multiply both sides by e to the negative 3 x squared over 2 and that's going to go here and here and here so we're going to factor it out in the second one I'm going to show you that right now so I'm gonna erase this let's deal with this first let's get rid of that so I'm going to multiply both sides by X square plus 1 to the positive three-halves it's going to cancel cancel and go on to that 3 so I still have an e to the 3x squared over two I still have my Y we multiply both sides by this so this is gone this is gone so the two we have three to the x wrote this one to three halves I multiply both sides by x squared plus one to three house now we're going to multiply both sides by e to the negative three x over two and what we're gonna do instead of putting it in both places we're just gonna do this we're gonna say okay if you multiply both sides that e to the negative three x squared over two this is gonna be gone so we're just gonna get Y but on the right hand side let's leave the negative two let's leave the plus three let's leave the x squared plus one let's leave the three halves what we're gonna do is just show that this is multiplied by e to the negative three x squared over two and that's about as good as we can get that to look without distributing so if you even if you did distribute refactor it man I hope that makes sense that that is just a massive problem it's like ten times longer than any of the problems I've seen so had a special technique in there it really wrapped a lot of stuff together good problem hopefully we didn't make any serious error by no I forgot the Y but hopefully you caught that on your own and even man even when you're going through you're gonna do stuff like that which is why if you notice what I'm doing I'm always double-checking my work I'm always stopping going especially about students in here to catch my little mistakes I'm always looking through how does this make sense can I go back does this make sense what am I forgetting and try that try that when you're doing your homework and especially in your test if you have your that that process in your head to make a lot less mistakes so when you late special problem I hope that makes sense I hope that helped you in some way to see what we can and can't do with these things especially the two types of integration techniques we had alright guys I'll see you for the next video when we're gonna do a couple of applications like with some mixture problems have a good day you
