Transcript for: Using Partial Fractions in Differential Equations (Differential Equations 34)
hey again welcome to another video in this video we're gonna take a sidestep so I know we've been talking about modeling populations and we certainly will talk about more modeling in the next video but the next video has a lot of partial fractions in it and so what I'm gonna do is kind of an optional video for you if you are very comfortable with partial fractions grapes go on take care of another video but if you need a refresher and you're not used to seeing partial fractions and differential equations and sometimes we just get away from those we don't see them very often I'm doing this video for that reason so you get us comfortable with partial fractions in differential equations some algebraic techniques that can help us like moving some negatives around that make things just slightly easier so I'm going to show you my techniques on how to do that I'll show you some shortcuts when dealing with linear factors which we mostly get in these population models and then I'll move on so if you want to maybe just practice with me make sure that we still understand partial fractions how to deal with some negatives and some explanation will come up so this is going to be as quick as I can make it go through three examples just the bare bones on how we go through partial fractions again so kind of a refresher on partial fractions and differential equations so let's suppose we have a differential equation we have DX DT so deep in a variable X infinite variable t equals X minus x squared and then X sub 0 equals student so we got some initial condition on it what I want you to remember is that these are going to be separable but when we separate them they're not going to create some integrals that are very easy or very nice they're gonna create integrals that you need to deal with partial fractions and so sometimes setting these up it's very nice to put things in order and factor so your first term is positive so what we're gonna do before we even start is set this up like DX DT equals negative x squared plus X and factor out and negative x so X minus 1 let's make sure negative x squared plus X that's really good after we do that we're gonna see that this is a separable separable difference equation could you have seen that right here yes because X is your dependent variable and T is your independent variable you can group your X is the X and constants DT but sometimes that negative screws us up a little bit not that it's any different I mean you can slowly do this that ways get everything on one side right now and keep a constant on the right that's that's fine but going through it sometimes we get some sign errors now is it is a big deal no no and in fact as we move forward with this I'm gonna be factoring out a negative again and multiplying both sides by negative but I've seen a lot of students when they're just forgotten some partial fractions really make a lot of sign errors in this screws of everything so I'm gonna do it this way you can choose your own way to go on this one but what I'm gonna do is I'm going to move my X's DX so 1 over x times X minus 1 DX equals negative DT and when we integrate that sorry when we get ready to integrate that we're gonna see that on the left hand side this is set up really nicely do a partial fraction that's why I'm factoring first here instead of putting everything on one side and trying to struggle through so I'm factoring saying okay I I see that those two are those are some linear factors that's gonna be partial fractions now we're gonna spend some time right now to talk about how you do partial fractions I know you've seen it but it's it's it's my getting a long time so how partial fractions work it says you're gonna take this fraction and we're gonna understand that we can write this as a sum of two different fractions here's how you set this up for every factor you were going to get a fraction so two factors two fractions and then for every numerator do you have a degree lower than your denominator so if we have a linear a linear denominator you're going to that constant it had been a quadratic number you would have had a linear numerator so the fractions equal factors factor equals fractions and when we have linear factors you're going to have constant numerators and then the whole process is really just fighting the common it's not magic but this says is if I give a common denominator my denominators equal but my denominators then my numerators would have to be equal so the whole process is really just find a common denominator multiply this fraction by X minus one multiply this fraction by X and then if you had found the common denominator your numerator would be this your other numerator is one and because your denominators have article and you've found a common term and put this together your numerous also have to be equal and then so it's so moving forward past that what's very nice about our Lanier's is that you can oftentimes plug in a number like zero to make one term zero solve with other coefficient or one make this term zero so for this coefficient that's really nice with linear so it's a nice little trick that we do here we'll say what if x is 0 if X is zero then this would still be 1 0 minus 180 times negative 1 so 0 minus 1 is negative 1 plus this whole term would be 0 and it allows you to solve for a very nicely it would be negative 1 now what if X word 1 well if X were 1 then this would still be 1 this whole term would be 0 and this would be just B and be lit equal 1 and what that does for us says one time through they haven't put in order factors so you see that you got a couple linear factors here you go okay when I make a separable difference of equation out of this I know that I'm gonna have partial fractions it happens a lot in the next video so we have such partial fractions we know that we're basically just finding the common denominator and setting our numerators equal then we plug in a number that's going to create a term equal 0 solve another coefficient so we've done that and says you can now rewrite this fraction you can rewrite this as negative 1 over X plus 1 over X minus 1 we're going to do that right now a was- one got it over X B was one over X minus one home I'm not an empty vector in a billions DX equals integral of negative 1 DT so on the left hand side left hand sides really nicely just have a basic integral on the right hand side even nicer we're gonna get negative a-team plus some sort of a constant now think through what's gonna happen we're gonna get a couple natural logarithms we're gonna be putting that together do you remember that when you have logarithms added or subtracted you can combine them and so on the left hand side we are going to combine that on the right hand side we're gonna put a C sub 1 because eventually we're gonna have to be written that logarithm that's going to be an exponential and so when we have at C sub 1 we're gonna wrap that up as e to the C sub 1 probably a plus and minus a new with the absolute value and that whole thing is going to be another arbitrary constant so we're gonna do we're going to do that most of the time for these partial fractions on the left hand side hey that's gonna be negative Ln absolute value of x plus Ln absolute value X minus 1 there's not really any necessary use so maybe something very basic and this is what I was just talking about when you have two logarithms being added or subtracted the positive or the plus goes on our numerator so X minus 1 and this thing being subtracted creates this quotient inside one logarithm where we have the numerator from our positive or plus Ln and the negative gives us our denominator that minus Ln X gives us X in the denominator equals negative T plus C someone has something pretty good now we can take an exponential on both sides so here and here yes we're going to get absolute value of X minus 1 over X on the right hand side e to the negative T times e to the seasoned why don't you remember that how we can when we take an exponential to this entire function over there we have e to the negative T but times is e sub 1 well if we wrap up this absolute value as a plus and by this then this whole thing we've done this for many times we can define that to be it's like an e start to be a C so that's our constant so X minus 1 over x equals C e to the negative T now pause I know that you want to solve for X I do - we're gonna solve for X but do you remember that with these logarithms that we take an X mention both sides we wrap up that hole we see the 1 e to the C sub 1 plus some eyes with a scene right now is a really good time to plug in an initial value or an initial condition or whatever they've given you because if we start solving for x we're gonna have to eventually solve for C and it's gonna take us a lot of work to undo what we just did so if we take this X of 0 equals 2 that means that T our independent variable 0 and X is 2 this is much nicer salt because if you plug in 0 here this whole thing's in one that's going to be B C equals 2 months 1 over 2 that's a lot nicer than having to solve for X and then put that in and have a result for C that's crazy so when you're going through these plug ins see basically as soon as you can since you have a nice arbitrary constant not here so much not there for sure because that that's garbage right that's that's nasty but as soon as you read the redefine your arbitrary constant now's the time so 2 minus 1 over 2 equals C times e to the 0 or 1 this is gonna say that C is 1/2 now we plug that in right here so X minus 1 over the X looks pretty good there rid of 1/2 e to the negative T this is where we want to solve for X now I mentioned something a while ago I said I might have the fact we're gonna negative here's when I would do that so I'm trying to explain so now that you have to okay I'm try to explain the Leonard way of doing this what I'm always looking for when I'm going through these integrals partial fractions is I'm really trying to make sure that my negative fraction has only one term if if not then okay but I'm trying to make sure that has only one term why because if that's gonna be a natural logarithm and that's gonna be a natural on them I want the single term to end up on the denominator because I know we're gonna be doing exponential I know we're going to be multiplying to get rid of that denominator if this has two terms you'd have to multiply it distribute it subtractive factored divide it here because from a one time we will multiply subtractive factor divide it so it saves us one step is it really important it's not I'm going to show you the last example that if we do it differently have this reverse it's not a huge deal but you will have to distribute subtract you'll add an extra step there so one time just to make sure that we're we're golden on this a lot of times we're getting some partial fractions that happens when we have a constant divided you don't have to have a constant but here it's going to be constant divided by some linear factors so we factor we see that we do our partial fractions we're basically doing a common denominator we're sitting our numerators equal it's going to solve for those coefficients for separating fractions and we're going to get a lot of natural logarithms try if you want to try if you can to make sure that your negative logarithm has one term that's really helpful so we group them as one logarithm we exponential both sides we get rid of that we wrap up our arbitrary constant as a plus a minus e to the C sub 1 equals C and right there we plug our initial value problem that lets us solve for our C or that we're pretty much good to go we're going to multiply both sides by X we're going to group our X's on one side and our constants on the other so maybe adding one and subtracting this term and then we're going to factor X we're going to factor X because we're grouping the terms that have X in them on one side of purpose so that we could factor it and then divide and so we're going to divide this that doesn't look that great we get some complex fractions we have a negative explore out there so we're gonna do a couple things to make this maybe a little bit nicer number one we might choose to multiply both the numerator and denominator by two so we multiply by two well it's gonna distribute but it's gonna kill off that one-half that would be pretty nice so X as a function of T we have two over two minus e to the negative T that's perfectly appropriate that is fine but you might also see this you might see some textbooks some people say yeah I'd really prefer not to have that even though your T here so because that's technically a complex fraction you do have 1 over e to the T we can multiply by e to a positive team and get our function of X with respect that in in terms of T would be 2 e to the T over remember you still distribute here to even t minus 1 e to the negative T times me the positive T would be 1 e to the 0 either 0 is 1 so you might get a better than notice how to look completely different right I mean they they look very very different but they are the same exact thing so that's about all I want to do on this problem we've used our initial value problem we've done some partial fractions this is how they locked a lot of those these next differential equations for population modeling is going to work it's gonna say hey you have some linear factors it's still separable ninasam your factors under constant that's a partial fraction so make sure you're seeing partial fractions try this to get your term on your denominator to be a single if sorry that negative know meant to be a single term so you're done with your single term it does help a little bit just makes makes it so that right here when you multiply you want to distribute again it's not a big deal it's just a deal other than that we're solving this like normal and then we're typically wrapping this up if we can avoid negative exponents we try to avoid negative expose there's two more I'm gonna come back up here and do a couple more just to get us really really good at this hope this making sense I hope this is refreshing your memory let's try another one so we're going to start here another difference of equation says that we'll like at a quadratic that's not going to be partial fractions right because that's like a creek that's like a tan inverse no sign immerse really that right there maybe be more appropriate to write this in a good order no no what's gonna happen I'm gonna write this as negative x squared plus 1 we're gonna factor out the negative and we're going to see a difference of squares but when I do that when I leave the native on the right hand side I am going to factor a negative from what we get so I will be changing it back if you can see that this is 1 minus x times 1 plus X and you fine with it and do your partial fraction from there great do it but over the last 14 years man I've seen a lot of students mess that up first thing I see it and secondly mess this up with some sign errors you can get the wrong a and B and so I'm not gonna do it that way now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna do the way I would normally normally teach it to avoid the sign there's and the only reason it works just like I've shown you that's fine if you have your own way of doing it that's totally ok it's just to get you some some techniques that have seemed to work for me really well so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to rewrite this as negative x squared plus 1 I'm gonna factor that negative I'm going to factor this right now so that I see the linear factor so I'm not screwed up on something like a it's a trick Sun or something weird and now what we see this is acceptable difference of equation we can group our exes the exes and our negative 1 DT so I'm gonna move my exes to the left hand side on the right hand side we just get negative 1 DT and when we see our integral right here when we see this on the left hand side you have to be seen as part of a fraction the Yui yep there's nothing I can do with that that is why I put this in order that's why I factored appropriately so I'm seeing two linear factors I'm seeing I can separate this fraction into two different fractions two factors two fractions both Linear's constant numerator so I'm going to do that why again why I chose to put this in this order factor the negative is because I see a lot of sign errors happen if I don't do that again it's not it's not a huge deal but it just needs a deal so let's try and separate this by partial fractions we know that two factors means we're gonna get two fractions linear factors means that we're gonna get constant numerators now we're finding the comment another so one would equal a times X plus one plus B times X minus one and what that gives us is says if you found common denominators your numerators would have to be equal so we're gonna take that word and run with it I'm gonna say hey what if fun what if X was one notice how zero doesn't help us but if X was one this would be zero this would be one plus one this would still be one so we have 1 would equal a times one plus one plus zero if X is one this whole term would be zero so any would there be one half now extra negative one vector negative one this would be zero this would be negative two so this term is zero this would be B times negative two and B would equal negative one half so that allows us to split up that fraction and say all right well if it is one half of these negative one half then this this fraction becomes two different fractions one over two times X minus one minus coz B is a negative minus one over two times X plus one and this is all DX equals integral of negative one DT so a couple other things look what might you do well personally I probably factor out the 1/2 I probably multiply both sides honestly before I even did anything it's probably the factor out this that 1/2 also if you don't want to deal with this negative you can factor a negative 1/2 I'll show you that right now just to show you some things that we can do so if i factor out a negative 1/2 then this would be negative 1 or X minus 1 plus 1 over X plus 1 notice things the factor a negative 1 happen either should be a positive 1/2 negative 1/2 if we multiply both sides by negative 2 then this would give us an integral of 2 DT or 2 times integral of DT so we've avoided a fraction we've avoided a 2 we don't we won't have any 1/2 L ends that's kind of nice to deal with that on the right hand side that would no matter what will you do by the way so if you didn't see that it's fine I'm just showing some small techniques here then this would still work out to 2dt imagine that if you had a a 1/2 and 1/2 e digit integration you have a 1/2 ln a 1/2 ln you've multiplied by 2 anyhow and that would still be a 2t what's these the 1 C sub 1 because we know we're going to be dealing with some logarithms we're dealing with logarithms means we're gonna have an exponential we're gonna be changing at arbitrary constants so on the left hand side we'll have a no need for a you sub it pretty loud basically so but no need for any coefficient changes will have a negative Ln absolute value of X minus 1 plus Ln absolute value of x plus 1 and we talked about just a minute ago how when you have a logarithms added together the same base or subtracted we can make this one logarithm with the positive or plus on the numerator and the minus or negative on the denominator now we're ready to take both sides 2 as an exponent on deep so we do it alright e to the both sides here on the left hand side and we're gonna do a couple things because we should be literally just did it we're going to have X plus 1 over X minus 1 on the right hand side you know that you'll have e to the 2t times e to the C sub 1 and we're going to put the absolute value equals plus and minus that and we'll call all of that our arbitrary constant so X plus 1 over X minus 1 equals arbitrary constant C e to the 2t should you solve for X right now know also made a comment a little while ago that I really want to try to set these up so that my denominator has a single term well I couldn't do that both of these fractions have two terms in them so it really didn't matter about our negative I just factored a native because I didn't want that one to be negative I wanted to deal with an with a positive exponent that's only reason why we did it could you have got here without doing what I did without changing this around could you have just factored this yes if you see that that spectable is a different squares great do it if you see that that Specter with different squares and it still leads you to partial fractions that's great okay totally fine to do that I've just seen a lot of students get really jacked up about this like all that's not a partial fraction I don't see so I've learned that if I write this in order make them factor a negative they'll see difference of squares better they'll see linear factors better they won't get messed up with negatives sign errors won't happen the A's and the B's are much more consistently found that way and then I will get the correct coefficients out of them because imagine this imagine if you screwed up that sign this whole thing is smoked okay your problem is done so that's why I've done that huge deal no not if you but I've also said well I want that to be positive so notice I'm factoring a negative I wouldn't have had to do this if I didn't set this up this way so i factor the negative it's basically undoing what I've just done and then I want a positive exponent on my exponential so I've got that that looks really good goes ready to change that the very end last problem if you remember e on both sides they're wrapped up my arbitrary constant as a giant C and right now is where you'd want to plug in that initial value so we're gonna plug in x equals 3 when T equals 0 that's really nice to do right here because if I play in T equals 0 this is 1 and if X is 3 we get 3 plus 1 over 3 minus 1 equals C that's 2 so 4 over 3 minus 1 that would be man just to this it's pretty nice let's rewrite it so we'll have X plus 1 over X minus 1 equals to e to the positive 2 T and now it's just about solving for x so here's what's gonna have to happen when we have more than one term on the denominator we are going to multiply both sides by the denominator but we're gonna have to distribute collect our X terms on one side non X terms on the other side factor and and divide so I'm going to be multiplying both sides by X minus 1 I'm going to be distributing we're going to group our X terms on the left Arnon X terms on the right there's a lot of negative splitting around we're going to factor our X and now since we factor since our group our X terms are infected actually now we divide it so X is a function of t equals negative 1 minus 2 e to the positive 2t over 1 minus 2 e to the positive 2 team that's a lot of negatives one thing that we could do if that's not looking that great to you you can factor out a negative from your denominator or numerator and distribute it through the opposite so I'm gonna factor it negative out of this well that's going to do is that's going to create this this is negative 2 e to the 2t minus 1 and then I'll run that through the numerator so this should be that of the numerator and our function can look quite a bit different here we get a positive 2 e to the 2t plus 1 over 2 e to the 2t minus 1 that might look a lot nicer for you a little bit easier to plug numbers in kind of see what's going on with that so if your problem is not looking exactly the same a lot of negatives sometimes it's nice to do I hope it's making sense I hope that you're seeing some of the nuance of appropriately working with partial fractions again these things are optional that I'm doing I don't want you to say well I've done it different my whole life that's fine guys I'm just showing you the way that I do it cuz it works really well for a lot of people so we have one more and I will be right back with it ok so here we go last one just a recap of how how partial fractions work especially in differential equations now I could give you just the integral of partial fractions as a just link a video and I can do that too if you want but in in setting these up there are some things that we want to deal with the first before setting out to do that integral partial fractions becomes stemming from these differential equations number one to recognize me so we have a differential equation we have two linear factors already it's already factored for you I would say that's I'm going to change that but they're already kind of setting this up as something that is going to be done with partial fractions so if we're seeing separable hopefully you've seen they're separately you know X's the XS constants DT but what I want to notice is that that might screw up some science for us so I'm going to change that real quick what I'm going to do is I'm going to factor a negative in form and write this in a what I would say slightly better order no it doesn't really make a difference moving forward it doesn't make a difference but for for the students have helped it seems to make a lot of sense we're going to our X's DX and are constants DT and we are ready to integrate it's just that sensibly wrote this as two linear factors and since we saw that this is separable now we have one over that well that right there shows us so that's going to be a partial fraction a partial fraction decomposition so when we when we set this up as a linear we've set this up as something recognizable when a group are excess DX it's going to be more apparent if you take care of some some work beforehand so now we're going yes that's for sure partial fraction milk creating trig stubs or anything weird now we say all right let's separate this fraction we know that there are two factors so that's going to give us two fractions we know that they're both millennia absorbable our numerators have to be constants one degree below that we know that in order to do partial fraction decomposition all we're really doing is finding a common denominator and setting our numerators equal so if we were to find a common denominator it would be a times X minus 5 and it would be B times X and that would have to equal the numerator one then we also further stand that we can plug in some numbers like 0 and if that's 0 then 1 would equal so 1 would change any times negative 5 and a would equal negative 1/5 that's kind of nice if X was 5 then this whole term would be 0 and 1 would equal B times 5 or B would equal 1/5 now we've seen this very similar problem before so when we let me break this up when we decompose this into some partial fractions here then we're going to have this integral changes to let's see a is negative 1/5 so that would be negative 1/5 X plus B is 1/5 do not distribute that 1/5 times X minus 5 DX and then on the right hand side we get this 3dt now the reason why I said don't distribute that those both have a factor of 1/5 and we're gonna factor that out also I told you this and for me this is great this looks really good because my single term the the denominator with the single term has a negative in front of it so think about what's gonna happen we're gonna factor a 1/5 right we'd multiply both sides by 5 that defines going to 15 over there on the left hand side I'm gonna get two logarithms one of those negatives and that logarithm that's negative is going to have a single term inside X that's great because when I put this together as a fraction I'd have two terms over one term that's a simple multiply combined there collects some some terms with the the accident and then factor and divide that's easy what I'm gonna do is show you how to do it if you if you're not practicing that in that method so I'm gonna do something a little bit different I'm gonna factor a negative one-fifth I'm gonna show you how to deal with an Ln when you have two terms on the denominator how you'll need to multiply distribute collect factor and then re divide so I'm doing this on purpose even though this is this looks really good to me I would keep it this way all I would normally do is factor a 1/5 like this and say hey this this would be negative 1 over X this would be PI plus 1 over X minus 5 if you find what I'm going to do is I'm going to factor a negative to show you what happens when you have two terms of the divisor so negative one-fifth would create a positive one over X minus a 1 over X minus 5 let's verify that multiplying you get negative and you get positive this now what what is nice is that when I multiply both sides by negative 5 and this I'm not gonna have to deal with a negative exponent that I'm gonna get when I take both sides as an exponential on that either way we would have been fine though on the left-hand side we're gonna get ailment absolute value of X we're gonna get minus Ln absolute value of X minus 5 mil problem should be very comfortable that on the right hand side we get a 15 T 1 Z sub 1 we know that we're gonna be changing that C sub 1 now let's combine these and you can see what I'm talking about right now I said that when you have a subtraction and two terms on your denominator eventually that's going to become your denominator when you combine these into a single logarithm by the quotient rule on the right hand side that 15 T plus C sub 1 that still looks fine right here we're saying hey we've done this three times in a room now let's take both sides as exponents on that extra function on the left hand side we just get x over X plus -5 on the right hand side we're going to get a plus or minus e to the C sub 1 times e to the 15 T and this is what we're gonna call that seam let's move up here do a little more work on it double check looks pretty good to me what do I do now I don't know I don't solve for X right now I use my initial value after you redefine your constant that exponential rate constant after you've done that now is a real good time to plug in that initial value problem or the initial condition initial population we're doing population problems so 0:48 for X and since we're playing at zero for T 15 times 0 0 e to the 0 is 1 that's awesome that means C is the Third's and let's rewrite it so since C is just this constant 8/3 we know x equals R sorry X over X minus 5 was 8/3 e to the 1500 now this is what I was talking about we are gonna have to multiply it by that two number but now that duck denominator has two terms so we're gonna have to multiply by X minus five we're gonna have to distribute that we're gonna have to get our extras on one side constants on non X's on the other side so stuck with T's in it factor and then divide it it's just one extra step but it is it is an extra step so happy for having not factored a negative we wouldn't have to do that we were to multiply by X our exponent would have been negative though and so I guess maybe you would have you consider that to I think it's easier to deal with but I guess it adds a step two so either way you go well I am gonna do I am gonna multiply both sides by three though because I don't like that fraction so let me multiply both sides by 3 we get a 3x over X minus 5 equals 8 either 15 T that is nicer now let's multiply both sides by X minus 5 and we're forced to distribute we have to do that so when we distribute this we're gonna have a 3x equals 8x e to the 15 minus 40 e to the 15 and now what we're gonna do we're going to group our X's on one side and we're going to factor that excel and then we're going to divide so when we factor that x3 minus 80 the 52 equals negative 40 in the 15 t and dividing we have a function of X in terms of teeth that's negative 40 e to the 15 T all over 3 minus 8 e to the 15 T now what do you what do you think you do do you think you'd leave like that do you think you'd deal with a negative most people say they're gonna deal with a negative right here you're gonna take this negative and from the 40 and distribute through your denominator and change a couple sides with that so this should really look like 40 me to 15 t over positive a 15-3 do not please do not simplify the 40th day please don't simplify the game the 15 to you or you think you can't do that stuff not less you can factor and we can't Factor anything here so I hope that's made sense I hope that this has refresh your memory on not just partial fractions but how to deal with them in differential equations that were really looking to make some some factors first that way when we put this as a several difference equation in separate variables that's more easy to see this partial fraction I hope I made the case on why you might want to necessary why you might might want to have it in honor of a single term it's just a little bit easier to deal with in a lot of cases so other than that what we're gonna do next time is I'm gonna take these ideas that we've done and since we're really really good at these partial fractions now we're gonna apply them some population models and see how they work so I'll see you for the next video on that I hope you've been enjoying this exploration of some more real-life examples with population stuff we're gonna get back to that in the next video have a great day you
