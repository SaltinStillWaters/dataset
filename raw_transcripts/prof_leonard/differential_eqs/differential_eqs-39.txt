Transcript for: Harvesting Populations in Differential Equations (Differential Equations 38)
hey welcome to the last video on population models for these differential equations in this video we're going to talk about how harvesting and stalking affect critical points and affect your population growth and really determine what's gonna happen and so obviously this kind of real-world applicable because in in like our ecology and biology and our systems of life in the world we really don't want to be harvesting too much and but we also want to be overstocking because things might die out and so we're gonna look at maybe how this stuff works and so we'll take a look at our difference equations we'll see how our models are affected by harvesting and stocking and a little bit of fun so before we get there though I need to remind you of a couple things the first is there's a difference between the logistic and explosion explosion extinction differential equations we took a look at that there's slight differences but they really affect what's going on and so what I plan on doing in this video is showing you how when we start harvesting or stalking on the list logistic equation or harvesting and stalking on the explosion and extinction equation we're going to get some different things these are basically opposites and so we'll take a look at how that affects our critical points we'll take a look at how the critical points will affect our population so before before we go anywhere do you remember with the logistic equation that everything really depends on your initial value and these differences having this M first or last determines whether we're going to have a funnel or have a spout that's what that's what happened so let's take a look really quick about what goes on here let's suppose that our initial value of x is greater than M let's suppose this is greater than M what's gonna happen with our critical points here well if you remember we weren't able to really talk about it before but if you remember with critical points in the last couple videos all we kind of do to find critical points is set this equal to zero and solve for X ok well if we do that then we're gonna get two critical points you can see it right here this is zero we get x equals zero we get x equals M those are the two critical points now with populations x equals 0 or X initial value less than 0 is basically meaningless if we have no initial population we're not gonna get anywhere from there we're not gonna get anything from a negative population either that doesn't make logical sense and so when we take a look at our critical points here x equals 0 is basically irrelevant yeah if you started stalking from 0 well then you would have a population growth but starting at 0 not doing anything from it on just the logistic equation is going to go nowhere so the only really relevant critical point that we would have is M if we set this equal to zero and solve by the zero product property and say hey if x equals M we have a critical point then some really interesting thing is going to happen around that M if our initial value starts at M we get a horizontal line we get this equilibrium solution nothing's gonna change we're not gonna grow we're not gonna shrink remember that M would be positive and K would be positive here so if that's the case nothing happens honestly I'm just kind of recap in a few videos right here but if we start above M if our initial value is above and look what happens if our X sub 0 is above M this is obviously positive this is positive this is positive if this is more than M we would get a negative number here positive times a positive times a negative is a negative our slope of our function would be decreasing every general of general solution for anything higher than this would be decreasing we would have these decreasing curves so depend on what our initial value is if it's more than M we're going to get decrease so negative decrease we would have to look like this something along that now what if our initial value is less than M if our initial a is less than M positive positive something less than M is going to create a positive number here we would get increase our slope would be positive every single particular solution would be increasing and we get like a definition of a funnel here this is what the logistic equation does for so so one time on this because you need to get what's going on with these two how they're different before we start looking at how harvesting and stocking affects it so with the logistic equation one more time if we have this and first this constant first then what we have is what's called a limiting population in equilibrium solution and a limiting population if we start above that we're going to decrease we can see it right here this is a positive minus something bigger than it that'd be a negative number we're going to get a decrease if we start plug low that we're going to get a positive number something positive minus something less than as a positive we'd get an increase this is how logistic equation works it would have one relevant critical value right there that would just be M that's the equilibrium solution this limiting population now what if we change what if we say hey we have a X minus M it looks just so similar but we get a completely different picture this is an explosion and extinction equation again katelyn be positive and that's positive so let's take a look at it if we set this equal to zero find our critical points we'd really still get to zero and M will let that sound just like that one it is just like it and the fact that zero doesn't really mean anything here either if we start with zero population obviously zero times anything is going to give you zero our population is not going to change gonna stay horizontal there is no change there if it's negative that doesn't make any sense as far as a population model goes we can't have a negative puppet you can't Oh someone population doesn't make sense but if we have something greater than zero so X would be greater than zero K is positive M is positive well if our X is equal to M like gimmick it no change this equilibrium solution there however look at what happens when X is greater than M if X is more than M then something bigger than M minus M would give you a positive positive times positive times positive if we start above M we explode take a look at bellowing if we start below it positive times a positive now something less than M minus M would give us a negative number so positive times a positive times a negative would give us a negative so a decreasing function that's the definition of a spell we get a stable critical point or an unstable critical point depending on whether we're talking about the logistic or explosion extinction equations I hope this is making sense this is basically all the videos that we've done leading up to this so we've talked about logistic and explosive extinction we talked about critical points now we're kind of in a plane all of them so one less time all the way through differential equations that model populations don't make sense if our population is negative so we don't have to worry about this less than zero case if that's true then everything is based on our initial condition for here if our initial population is more than a mileage istic we decrease and increase if it's less than them the opposite is true if we switch this that should make sense to you all this is that's different from here here is a negative sign that means that above instead of negative we get positive but low instead of positive we get negative and we get this completely different picture which is what separates the logistic equation from the explosion and extinction equation so that that's what's that's what's going on right now we're just taking a look at equilibrium solutions and how our critical points basically give us those and how this is completely dependent on our initial value whether we're going to have a limiting population or a threshold solutions with that's called the threshold solution says if I've above that I'm going to explode go away from it but below that I'm going to go extinct go away from that so it's it's that spell idea again I hope that's making sense now what we're gonna do after this we're gonna say in real life well what happens to populations we we typically stock them or or we we harvest from them this happens a lot like in lakes where people go out fishing they take some fish or we stock with fish that we can we don't over fish it we want to have responsible harvest and responsible stocking so that we can have these populations of species sustainable really and so let's take a look at what happens when we start subtracting or adding to to these these equations we're gonna take a look at logistic first we'll see how the harvesting or stocking affects it we'll take a look at critical points and how this is a very simplistic model this is going to give us some really different stuff so we're gonna take a look at critical points we'll learn a couple new words like bifurcation point what the world that means that would be good to go so let's suppose that we have the which ones this one see that's this is logistics so this is a logistic equation and we're taken away from it or we're stalking so what how can it be both if your H is positive then subtracting H would be in harvesting we'd be taking things out of its population if our H is negative that would be stocking so this can count for both the harvesting and stocking here on the logistic equation also keep in mind that H has to be constant and that's constant per unit of time so of our time period is per year or per day or per month then that harvesting is how many items you're taking out per year or per month or per day and it's not going to change so we're gonna consider that to be a constant just like our our growth rates and death rates were number of items there are a number of population per thousand per year this is how many years you're harvesting our stocking per year per day whatever that is so let's take a look and say if this know wait a minute if that's a differential equation let's find our critical points how we find critical points all the time is we set them equal to zero so here's what I want to do with this now that we've kind of recap this I know I went quickly through it what I want to do with this is I want to use what we know about finding critical points I want to solve them for X and I want to look at what's going to happen with this H how that age affects our critical points and what would happen with it so what we're gonna do is rinse that is equal to zero we're gonna find our critical points I'm going to use a differential equation - I'm sorry a quadratic formula to show you that it's possible and then show you how that depends on your harvesting or stocking and the little top is exactly what these pictures would look like so let's let's start man let's find some critical points how we do that as we said our difference of equation our function equal to zero do you remember that you remember that this is this is a first derivative so studying a first derivative equal to zero is probably find critical points so let's set this equal to zero and let's solve that for X because that's exactly how we do find critical points so let me set this equal to zero and say I'm going to solve this for X well we might want to distribute now you're in the right neighborhood so if we distribute here I'm gonna go there first so negative K x squared plus M K X - H don't distribute to there it gives us a quadratic equation in terms of X and that's something that we can solve so finding critical points here not as easy as logistic this one's really easy man I mean we set this equal to zero you get to zero which would have a zero population that would not change or you get M and that gives you your two critical points obviously some things are going to happen around there that are important we get an equilibrium solution above that we talked about the slope we talked about how if our initial value is above M then we would get a negative slope or a decreasing function the general solution for everything above or the particular solution for everything above here would be decreasing contrary to below so if we have a initial value below and we get a positive so than increasing everything flips or the explosion extinction I thought that later so if we say all right this is a differential equation its logistic but we're harvesting and we distribute we don't have something as easy to solve that age starts messing with us and so we go well I don't just have some very simple critical points that I can I can find with logistic I'd have to do something more fancy let's do the quadratic formula and solve this one thing I might do before I might factor out that that negative this will make things a little bit nicer so if i factor out this negative and get KX squared minus NK x plus h I'm gonna do the quadratic formula on that piece right there but keep in mind I have a negative right now so what I'm planning on doing is solving the quadratic formulas showing you that it's possible I'm gonna come back up here I'm going to use the the solutions to the quadratic formula to show you that this is factorable and then show you factors including that negative so let's uh let's go right from here so X would be equal negative B so our K is our a some BS or C negative B well if our B is negative and cake we have negative negative okay maybe it'd be plus or minus square root B squared minus 4 times a times C all over 2 times 8 all right let's see a SRK got that C is H and let's see here is K okay just a little bit of fancy work good see ya see that this is possible so let's see x equals negative x + 8 is a positive so we're gonna get this MK plus or minus square root we get M Squared k square- core KH all over 2k we're going to do one other thing before we start talking about it we're going to factor out a K squared from ear so how we're gonna do that is if we divided by K squared and K squared factored that out this is going to become 4 k 8 well 4 KH divided by K squared can give us 4 H over K so think about that maybe try not on your own if i factor out a K squared this is going to cancel out the K I have a K on the denominator so it looks like this and we can see that if we distributed we get M squared K squared we get 4 HK squared over K Kay's you cancel leaving this ik and the numerator all over 2 K now the nice thing about products and square roots is that we can simplify them we can split them apart so we factored out that K squared so that we could simplify it what that means is that we're gonna get x equals MK plus or minus the square root of K squared is K but we still have a square root with M squared minus 4 H over K all over 2k that's also pretty nice because we can simplify these case if we factor out the K and simplify that means that every term here and every term of the denominator we can divide by K we simplify it we get and plus or minus square root of M squared minus four H over K all over two and you know who cares this is really important and I want you to notice what's up there right now when we started this we said logistic equation has a constant and a constant so this actually concept in the concept you can do very much the same thing get a different sign in there that's not all that would happen only thing of it happen different here than here is that negative won't be there so all right so we went through we did quadratic form we to the very end and look at the quadratic form of what it gave us it said your critical points the the things that really matter here your equilibrium solutions depend on let's see that's a constant that's a constant that's a constant the four is a constant the two is a constant the only thing up here that is a variable that can affect anything is how you were harvesting or stocking that right there that H whatever that H happens to be is going to determine your critical points do you see it do you see how that age really really affects stuff constant constant constant constant constant constant variable the H is only thing is gonna fix critical points here now how does it work well let's suppose that the inside of your square root your radicand let's suppose that's positive so let's suppose your H is small enough you're harvesting you're harvesting few enough creatures or other population whatever it is you're harvesting feeling of creatures that this is positive if this is positive then what you get out of it you get a constant plus or minus some other real constant divided by two you get two solutions man this goes all the way back to like an intermediate algebra when you first start using quadratic form and they go hey if your discriminant is positive you get two real answers exactly and it still matters if you're harvesting few enough out of your population that this is positive the square root of a positive number is a real number that means you're adding and subtracting a real number you will get two critical points now let's suppose that this H is such a number that the inside of your square root is zero remember that with your parabolas your parabola is if you have this square root at zero you get plus or minus zero you get one solution give this vertex that's wherever the vertex is so if this H is such a number that you get zero inside that radical then an plus or minus zero over two would be one critical point and you would get a semi stable equilibrium solution we're above it you'd either go to it or go away from it below you go either to it or away from it and depends on whether you start with logistic or explosion extinction we look at that in a second - what if your H you're harvesting so much that this inside your radical is negative wait a minute what's the square root of a negative number well it's not a real number that means that you even have no real solutions that means you would have no critical points you are either going to explode or become extended there will be no equilibrium solution at all remember that no critical points no equilibrium solution so solving the quadratic formula shows us that our critical points are heavily dependent on our stocking and harvesting number so let's let's go through each of these cases let's suppose that that this is positive so I'm going to erase this we're going to come back up right to here no could you fast we're getting excited about this pretty cool so suppose that N squared minus four H over K is positive if that's positive we just went through it one more time if this is positive then we're going to add and subtract a real number we'll get two critical points we'll get two critical points that means we get two solutions X would equal two different numbers here two critical points that means that we could factor this do you remember that like solutions equal roots equal factors if you have a solution or real solution you have a factor to this which means that we could let's call these critical points or good enough letters and and Candis Cayne don't wanna use age can use down P N and P so if we have two critical points N and P then what would happen is that we can factor this so X would equal and and X equal P two critical points do you remember that if we have solutions if we have roots of it zeros then roots or zeros equal factors man if you say x equals n some sort of some sort of solution some number here that we have X to equal eight a critical point and or an end a critical point P by adding and subtracting a real number then x equals and says yeah just subtract 10x minus n would be a factor if x equals P another critical point the next - Pete would be its factor let's factor this thing then so if our inside of our square root is positive and we get two critical points then we get to factors to this guy this thing right here let's factor that then zero two equal two factors X minus N and X minus P I'm gonna stop right there this can get real confusing a lot of theory it's pretty hopefully well explained to you but this is gonna be a little weird we're talking out a lot of different letters so one more time I know I've done this three times already but it's really important that you get it logistic equation has your M first explosion extinction has your M last this is going to create a funnel this is gonna create a spout for you we talked about why couple times already if we say now we're harvesting then our critical points are no longer found easy it's not as easy as this because this is already factored for you set it equal to 0 u 0 M 0 M that's a piece of cake when we start subtracting or adding some negative subtracting then we start altering it or altering our critical points that are harder to find and we use the quadratic formula so as soon as you start subtracting you go right we'll distribute you have a quadratic equation if we factor in a negative and use a quadratic formula then the whether or not we get critical points even and what they are depends on your honor H if our H is such that the inside is positive we were going to add and subtract and get two critical points now those critical points whatever they are x equals N and P they are going to be equilibrium solutions for us like all of our critical points are there going to be equilibrium solutions well they also create factors they tell you that this could be some number that you can take our quadratic equation that we did the formula on and you can factor it so if we factored and say hey there's our negative I told you even come back to it and we factor this as critical point factor as the factors we know they have to be and we say all right [Music] then if I distribute a negative not to both remember this negative search to one or the other doesn't matter which I distribute the negative that we get positive and minus X X minus P and what we end up getting is a combination of both of these ideas this is fantastic if you understand if you understood that when X is bigger than M you decrease when X is less than n you increase when X is more than them you increase and with X is less than n your decrease then this puts both of these together it says look looking look at it we have the N minus X that's very much a logistic equation idea I mean X minus P that's very much this explosion extinction idea so what goes on here is we say all right so we have n and we have P you're gonna ask well which one why eyes and above py speed above and they're arbitrary letters that we're using so one of them is gonna be on so the let's call and the greater list let's say that let's define that so that nmp 4-h small enough is going to give us something where MMPR between 0 & M that's going to make this work a little bit better for us that way we can say ok and it's the bigger critical point and P is a smaller one so that we can put them on a graph appropriately and let's distribute the negative to the one that has the end it's going to make it look like the logistic equation for us if they were reversed we would distribute this to the P and have that big it would be a bigger critical point so anyhow this right here says that if your X is greater than Y or n then we would get some sort of a negative now with P being less than n excellent well are let's see if X is what I just said if X is greater than n up here our initial value is greater than n then this would be negative but if X is greater than and it's also greater than P this would be positive negative times a positive the positive says we would be decreasing how about between an NP if X so 0 is less than n this right here is positive if X of 0 is greater than P so between here then this is positive we get something that is increasing if X is less than P okay X is less than P that's a positive sure because n is greater than then that X this would be a negative X is less than P the Sevilla native so positive times a negative is a negative this is what is going to happen if you start harvesting from a logistic equation that's what's gonna happen so we remember we did we took a logistic equation said I'm gonna harvest from it and I'm gonna harvest in such a way that this becomes positive well what's what do you mean that how would that be positive what would H have to be for that to be positive well H could be negative so you're stalking this number should be positive isn't it because if you're if you're adding to this if you're subtracting and theyyou so you're basically you're adding to this then this would be positive positive plus deposits getting the positive so if we're stalking or we're not harvesting enough to make this zero or negative then we're gonna get a picture just like this it should make sense because what we're really doing is 40 minus a this idea of logistic explosion extinction if we start harvesting so if we have harvests in such a way that this is positive we are going to get this picture we're going to get something that has a equal of the solution at two critical points on the top one we're going to have a funnel on the bottom we're gonna have a spout if we start above and will shrink to it if we start between P and n will grow to n if we start below P we're gonna go extinct is does that make sense I hope that makes it make sense on your initial your initial conditions so if we have this H that's if we have an H that's that's constant over time and we have an initial population what's gonna happen to our puppets long run it's going to depend on that initial population here's what I mean like that so let's suppose that we starts talking but there's not enough to begin with to support any sort of death rate or something like that and no matter what if we start below this a certain threshold solution this certain threshold then we're going to decrease we're gonna go extinct because we're we don't have enough of a population to support what's what's there anyhow and the stockings or harvesting is not going to help us at all if we're between P and n then we have some sort of a threshold where when we're above it we're going to increase so we have an ethical population to start with that it's supported the death rate that's happening and the stocking is going to increase it so that would be some sort of an increase until we get to n if we have something greater than that then we have a lot of population right so it's something something greater than and our stocking up harvesting is going to decrease that until we get to this equilibria version of n so we have this threshold solution equilibrium at a threshold where we're going away from it equilibrium but a limiting population where we're going to go to it I hope that makes sense to you because we're gonna consider two more cases right now so we looked at how what happens when this is positive so H is small enough that this is positive either we're stocking over not harvesting too much does that make sense stalking is kind of anti harvesting so we're in the long run now now you might have a question what if what if we're stalking that we're also fishing well you would look at the net so you look at what is going on in the long run you're stalking a thousand fish people are pulling out 1,500 well then you would be harvesting 500 does that make sense so we look at harvesting and stalking as a net a net gain loss so if we're harvesting few enough fish that this is positive we get two critical points and you're gonna get a fun waterspout I'm gonna talk about a little bit if we start harvesting your stocking starting with the explosion extinction you switch a switch around now what happens if we get zero so just like the discriminant tells you if this equals zero you're going to get one critical point your critical point is going to be exactly M a plus or minus zero over two you get one critical point and that critical point happens at let's see if that's zero and one or two it's going to happen around that critical point well if we look at one critical point of M over two well we're going to be decreasing and decreasing we get a semi stable critical point I think I mentioned that at the very beginning that we're going to get a fun one spout if we have one critical point we get the semi stable what now what happens if this is negative if that's negative but we have no real solution we would have no critical point we have no equilibrium solution and we're going to do one of two things that kind of where we start we're either going to explode in population or we're going to go extinct in population so if this is so big that this becomes negative then your population is going to go extinct we're basically going to give this picture somehow we're going to have an extinct population you're gonna decrease now you'd be a little bit different than that but the long story made real short is that when you start looking at harvesting or stocking you don't have something simple like critical points that are easy to find this quadratic formula we use says that your points depend on H if you have a small enough H we're gonna get two critical points if you have an H that gets you a well zero inside your radical you get one critical point and it's gonna be semi stable and if you have an H it's so big so you're harvesting so much this is negative you're outpatient your population your population is going to go extinct you're not stopping enough to when you're sucking off you're harvesting so much in net that you're going to go extinct there's no critical points at all what I want to do right now is go through an actual example to show you how all of this works alright so these are fairly quick because we kind of done all the work up here already all we're talking about is critical points and how that age how the harvesting is talking to fix that so what I'm gonna do right now is I'm going to show you that this is this Sam you second model we've already done a lot of the work could you just identify your K and your M and plug it in yep we're gonna do that and I'm gonna go through the quadratic formula again with this to show you that that's probably a little easier to do than doing quadratic formula for the beginning so if that right there is a differential equation and it's modeled really on the logistic equation that we are harvesting from remember that negative harvesting is stocking so it's the same thing this is just a logistic equation that we are harvesting from so let's identify what the K is and what the ana is our K here is this number in front then our K is 110 and our M 10 which it noticed this is important this right this number right here's gonna be five if when we're done and your bottom like two is gonna be five that's going to be an equilibrium solution that's gonna be a critical point it's going to be a very important point for us actually so so with these two numbers could we just say hey since this is the solution to this type of equation could we say that our critical points are going to be at 10 plus or minus 100 that's 10 squared minus 4 H you don't know H is or try to see how H go affects this over 110 don't pretend you over - then our critical points would be 10 plus or minus 100 - 4 th all over 2 you can do a little more work with this if you want to but this really matter you get back there at the 10 and simplify that a little bit but we don't we don't have to our critical points are going to be exactly what that is so I hope you know what let's do a different way if you wanted to do quadratic formula from here which you can totally do then what we would do is we simplified this we would distribute one negative x yeah and set equal to zero maybe multiply everything through by ten or probably factored out him that he could factor out the 110 ball so factor out a negative and do the quadratic formula so let's see negative B plus or minus B squared minus four times a times C ten H all over two times a all right well that's ten plus or minus 100 minus or th all over two which way is easier it kind of depends if you've already done this work with the quadratic formula from the general logistic equation upon which we're harvesting that's really easy to plug in your M in your cake obviously if not it's a lot easier to do the quadratic formula from right here so we just simplify the governor of a fraction we do the quadratic formula and you end up getting exactly the same thing now that's great but that's just a little bit of algebra finding what the critical points would be the important thing what I want you to get you want to get you to understand is that your critical points aren't dependent on your H so let's look at it the big deal here is when this is zero positive or negative so let's set this equal to zero and let's see what this number becomes so I'm taking a look at this 100 minus 4 th and saying when that's zero that that right there that that value we have a name for in just a minute that value of H is really important if we have something above that we're going to get two critical points if we have something below that was sorry if you have something above that we're going to get no critical points equal to zero we're gonna get one critical when sequel's you're really good I'm critical point if this is negative so needs to blow that value were going to get two critical points I think it said that completely backwards at first time and so let's take a look at it and as we go through so we're looking at the same whatever this H is is a really really important number we have a name for it in just a minute but in this H so let's solve for it right now if this H is divided by 48 pads if our H is exactly five house what's gonna help me if this is exactly five halves this is zero let's say the H is more than five halves if H is more than five halves this is negative if H is less than five house this is positive this H what I want to get you to see is this H is a huge number for us obviously in real life how much we are harvesting is incredibly important if we want things to survive if you take too much of something it's gonna die that's just the fact of it you take too much of something no matter what you you take too much of something matter what your population is it's gonna die out if you take too much of something depend on what your population is it's gonna die out how parents gonna reach a level so so our harvesting in real life in this real life application what I've done the last like 13 videos it's getting into these points this stuff is real and and as as people who are kind of in charge of certain arenas of life we make sure that we're in a sustainable area like fishing game does this is sort of thing a lot if you never know what fishing game is they're the department that kind of monitors how much you can finish where you can finish what you can finish what you can hunt what you can do so anyhow the point and I don't want to get all into that but the point of this is that how much you're harvesting really or how much you're stocking really affects what's happening with your populations so let's suppose that H is greater than five hats if you're harvesting more than two and a half parts of your population per year two and a half whatever to have hundreds to have thousands to millions whatever happens to be two and a half units of population per unit of time if you're harvesting more than that then if you're harvesting more than that this is going to be negative you have no critical points your population will done so if RH is too much for harvesting too much we will not have a critical point so this is this values of this five house it's like your your breaking point the name for it it's called a bifurcation point if you're harvesting more than that then this is negative do you see it they're harvesting more than that this is negative you have no critical points because you have no real numbers and your population will decline a negative thing really think it's going to go this early if H equals five halves you have one critical point what's going to happen if H equals five halves you have one critical point you can see it right here the critical point would be 10 divided by two oh my gosh we can that M over two you would get 10 over 2 or simply by default but what's gonna happen with that if you have your harvesting set at exactly two and a half units of population per unit of time eventually you're going to people your initial your initial population if you start something you're going to equal five and you start above that the critical point or you're going to go extinct the view of the hood so if you're harvesting exactly five halves then your what your population is going to do ultimately depends on what you so if we started above five then harvesting is going to say I'm going to shrink to that that limiting popular that limiting population it's kind of a threshold and lemonade solution all at once so it's a nice table critical point if I start above that five my harvesting is going to say okay if I start above that it's going to decrease naturally that would be the case so it's so suppose suppose you have like a lot of population but you're harvesting more than they can more than the rate of which they can grow that at the same rate so what's going to happen as your population is going to decline so if you're harvesting that amount it's gonna decline until you reach this thing that eight consisting so why why would that that be the case maybe there's so many up here that they're eating a lot of food which is they're dying off but you're also harvesting so eventually that that's gonna level out so you you're harvesting enough so that they're not killing any to themselves by eating all the food that's there so that would level out that's fine now what if you have less than than five but you harvest the same amount well if you have less than that that the initial population of five then or your population initial elevations I survive then your harvesting so much that they can't breed fast enough and that's going to go extinct so again if we have something if we're harvesting too much data if we're harvesting just right at five halves this right at two and a half years population per unit time then it depends on what your initial condition is if we did initially started about you if you're above you're gonna string two if you're below this five this group point you're going to go extinct let's say that we're harvesting less than five halves which includes negative values of harvesting or stalking then we get to critical points for whatever those critical points happen to be and you could you could find them pretty easily we have a big one we have a small one and the for harvesting less than two and a half units population per unit we're going to be in a stable and unstable critical point we're going to get a limiting population or a threshold of limiting solution with limited population or a threshold solution so if we start below the bottom critical point you're going to go extinct whether you stock or not whether you're harvesting or stopping there's not enough population to support it that's going to go extinct if you start between MMP your stocking or harvesting there's enough birth rates or whatever is happening here it's going to grow the population only to a point until where maybe there's so many that we start having competition for food and they're dying off themselves we start above that they're either whether you're harvesting or stalking there's too many to support there's not enough food whatever the assistance system is doing here they're gonna die off to that end this is what is going to happen this is why harvesting is so important to this model we saw logistic harvesting is going to certainly affect that I hope you've explained the nature of how you're harvesting affects your critical points this is a huge deal what this value five-halves as two and a half is it's called a bifurcation point and what that means is that it affects the quality of your outcome so if you're above equal to or below that bifurcation point whatever your partnership something is it's going to affect you ultimately your outcome and it's a big deal so it affects the number of critical points and affects what's happened around those critical points and if X was happening to populations so that that name when you hear that bifurcation point that's what's talking about where what we're harvesters talking is really affecting what's going on let's go through one more example where we can go all the way through to I'll deal with a not a logistic start will deal with a explosive extinctions beginning and we'll talk about how stalking would affect that all right last one let's take a look at this differential equation let's see what it really looks like would you think the best logistic or explosion extinction it doesn't look like this this is logistic where we have a fixed positive number we're subtracting from it this is explosion extinction so we can do this right there we are either going to explode or we're gonna go extinct around that five thank you man you should be able to see it you should see that five would be a critical point that above five exploded below five extinct now what's talking deal stocking stock here well if this is different what's happening is we don't have an M minus X we have an X minus M and we're sort of anti stocking so we're opposite of stocking us are uh anti Hurston we're opposite of harvesting this would be a stocking solution where where you stalking not stalking sounds sick so we're doing this for putting digs in just so you know there's another one somewhere so anyway we are we're stalking on lake we're stalking something we're putting creatures into some sort of a habitat is it always good not necessarily it doesn't have to always be good it could be bad it could be good but so what we're doing is a reverse or an anti harvesting what we can expect to happen is for these pictures to all reverse themselves that's what's going to happen well let's see let's see about it so we are gonna solve this I want to do the the quadratic equation from scratch because I'm dealing with this I'm gonna do it from just this one example here and let's go ahead and see what happens so when we set this equal to zero and we distribute now you don't have a good turn let's type equals zero first you worth a hundred multiply everything by 100 that's gonna be cancel that and 100's and distribute we see something different right off the bat we see that there's no negative out front and what that what that did do you remember that what I did what that did is that that negative reversed one of the one of the critical value the the fact that at that critical point in it he was the the end that we reversed well it's not going to happen here so we're looking at a slightly different sort of a picture and when we do our differential equation oh let's see negative 5 negative 5 squared 4 times a times C 2 times a and simplify that's what your critical points are going to be for this differential equation and if X references in our population our population really depends on how much you're stalking if that s is excuse me to positive that s is to positive number this will give you a negative you have no critical points how can you stop and go instinct you wouldn't these would be reversed so if you are stalking to such a point now let's be free let's figure out what that bifurcation point is so 2025 minus 400 equals zero that's going to give us a bifurcation point this this value that when we're above below or equal to it affects the outcome of our population and X would equal 1/16 that doesn't mean that means that that's 1/16 of a unit of population per unit time so our units population are in like hundreds maybe that 116 to 100 per pot the per unit of time that we would be putting into this population anti harvesting all right well what's what's going on here if we are above 1/16 greater than that if we're stalking more than 1/16 of the unit of population per unit time and this here would be negative we'd have no critical points a radicand negative discriminant would be negative or we have no critical points and we would have if there's no critical points there's no equilibrium solution you've got to get that we wouldn't have this picture we would have the reverse we would be exploding which says if we're stalking too much sounds like stalking starts as much as you can well that's not true if we stalk so much in a lake or some sort of system all the foods can be gone well once they reproduce to a point that's why this doesn't go extinct all it kind of has this gradual thing is okay we're going to grow and then it's gonna grow exponentially not be good um what's gonna happen is they're gonna eat all the food there's no food left even though the population looks like it's going to explode it doesn't explode forever does it that's called a doomsday thing if you had this body of water and it has a finite amount of food and or food that reproduces but only supports a certain level fish and you start stalking it with fish they're gonna eat all the food and they're gonna reproduce a lot but so much that they're gonna end up dying out from starvation that's what would happen if we over stock so I don't want to do that so if we stalk so much that this is and it's so big enough that this is negative we have no critical points our population does explode but then it goes so far what if we stock exactly equal to the bifurcation point then we have one critical point and that critical point would be five as well if we have five halves let's see what's going to happen then what our population does is based on our initial values so we're where we start if we start above two and a half our population is going to explode low doesn't make sense even if you have a fairly large population and then you start stocking it oh and a harvesting it's going to explode or even though your stock in it maybe there's not enough to support it no that's wrong awesome awesome let me start below that your stocking enough to support it so whatever we have as far as our initial population is going to determine what happens to our population as a whole with our buy fruit with a stocking equal to your bifurcation depends on your initial condition if you're above your critical point you can explode not a great thing if you're below a critical point you're going to reach reach to whatever that limiting population is that's that sort of threshold it's a threshold solution for something above your critical point and in limited population for some people it's a semi stable and lastly what if our stocking is less than our bifurcation point of 116 there were in two ribbons and that picture is going to reverse so what would happen is we would have a this two critical points PNN but our picture is going to be different what I wanted you to see is that much much like the logistic and explosion extinction gave us different original pictures general solutions so does it when were harvesting and stopping so if we starts talking to this explosion extinction the equation we're gonna get pictures that are very similar to logistic just just reversed I just wanted to make sense to you I wanted to make sense that when we start stalking or harvesting it really is important that bifurcation value that it's really important to watch that especially in like real-life situations where we don't we really don't want explosion of species we don't want extinction of species we need a harvest in stock responsibly according to the difference equations to make sure that that that happens so hopefully made it clear that the bifurcation point is valuable sometimes we have if we stock or harvest too much we start exploding or extinct in a matter what if we stock or harvest exactly equal to a bifurcation point really depends on your initial condition was going to have at your population and as does it if you have stalking or harvesting less than an amount it really depends on where you start so stalking less than 1/16 if we start below our critical value we're going to reach it between we're going to drop to it above we're going to exclude and if it really just depends on your initial condition so I hope that makes sense we wrapped up population we talked a ton about it at this point what really should be making sense is the the connection between critical points that we saw last time last few videos and now populations so those those critical those critical points of equilibrium solutions being above and below really really affects what your population is doing and whatever your population is and then harvesting and stalking can do the same thing so I hope it explained by vacation to you critical points the interplay between that we're gonna move on after this so other fun things I hope that you're having a great great time with the videos still and I'll see you next time you
