Transcript for: What are Exact Differential Equations (Differential Equations 28)
hi welcome to another video on this video we're going to talk about something that a lot of you have been asking for for a while now we're gonna talk about something called exact differential equations and we are going to discuss exactly what that means so we're going to start with with where they come from where they're used and how in the world they get this idea of exact difference of equations and most importantly the process in solving for the potential function that gives us that exact difference equation so let's start off with what these things are now in order to get here you gotta you kind of remember something about calculus 3 you gotta remember that backing right there let's look at that if you have a function Z equals two variables x and y you have what's called a service in in r3 or three dimensions and if you don't remember that maybe check out finding differentials for multivariable functions from from calculus three so what that would create is some sort of a service now if you remember from calculus three when we set such a function equal to a constant what we get is something called level curves and you can picture like this imagine a surface and imagine the z-axis coming up and imagine setting that Z equal to a constant like 1 or 2 or 3 and the surface is doing something well if that cuts this surface on a plane like Z equals 3 would be a plane you're gonna get a curve on that plane and that's called a level curve or yeah that's called a little curve and so what we have is this idea that if we have a function that it creates a surface and we take this equal to a constant we're gonna get something called level curves and in physics and engineering these level curves happen an awful lot and they're very important and a lot of times where we're trying to get this potential function that's giving us a level curve and that's the the impetus for talking about these exact difference of equations so so one more time those are surfaces set them equal to a constant you get something called a level curve now I'm going to show you two ways to get down to the idea of what is an exact differential equation so I want discover what that means but what it required was as kind of knowing where we're coming from so so why why in the world are we doing this we have these things called surfaces if we set them equal to constants we get these things called level curves and exact differential equations deal with level curves that's what they're dealing with so let's see where they come from now the two different ways I'm going to look at this is if you remember back to surfaces the way that we can find differentials took a long time to explain and again you should check that out but in order to find the differential of such a function what we would do and by definition we sort of proved it and kind of a loose proof when when I went over it would be like this willing says we saved the differential of Z is the partial derivative of F with respect to X DX plus the partial derivative of F with respect to Y dy and that is the definition of a differential for such a function well let's let's look at a different way let's look at it from here so imagine you start with these functions that that's a surface you know okay well the differential would be this and you find that in any calculus book or one of my videos or let's suppose we start with the level curve how would we get down the same thing and the idea what a different way to look at this would be what if we looked at this as a function of two variables equal to a constant one such a case if I wanted to find the derivative of that function with respect to X I could do implicit differentiation and one way to accomplish that so taking a derivative on both sides with respect to X so let's take a derivative on both sides that will exclude to excuse a notation here I'm just going to do this derivative with respect to X on the right hand side and we know we're going to get zero derivative of a constant with respect to X is zero but on the left hand side the derivative of F with respect to X would equal we would take and and this is kind of cool this is a way that you can do implicit differentiation with respect to X you would take the partial derivative of F with respect to X plus the partial derivative of F with respect to Y but because you have that chain rule we have this dy/dx and again on the right hand side the far right-hand side you would get zero so well not just like a 10-second recap here we're looking in this two different ways and so we can get the same thing I'll show you that in it so if we have these surfaces that differentially be defined like that okay that's a differential no problem if we look at this as level curve well then if we take a derivative on both sides implicitly with respect to X that's gonna involve implicit differentiation or we can think of this using partial derivatives see well those those don't look the same how would we make this look like like that you know well firstly they're coming from a slightly different place right now so we're gonna have to change this one a little bit but if we formally multiply both sides or all of this by this DX that we can do so if we just multiply everything by DX then we would get DF or the derivative the differential f is we get a partial derivative of F with respect to X but we would have a DX now this would give us a partial derivative of F with respect to Y but we would get rid of that DX and just have a dy we would still have zero zero times anything still gives us zero just kind of an interesting idea now what change is just a little bit and then we'll talk about how these things are the same so let's go back over here we go okay well how's the differential that looks pretty close actually we just don't have a zero imagine that Z changes to a constant no right well if Z is a constant instead of an actual variable Z and we say we are going to set this function equal to a concept they give us those level curves from that service then this changes a little bit then this says all right then this differential if we set this equal to a constant it would just change to this it would be the partial derivative of F with respect to X DX the partial derivative of F with respect to Y dy and then we would get zero and we get exactly exactly the same thing so again there's two ways to really look at this do you look at it as a differential of some function equal to a constant well here's the definition of a differential from this surface and we go well let's just let's just make it equal to a constant if we do that then the derivative gives us zero and so we have this differential right there from that that function equal one constant or do you look it as a level curve and take a derivative on both sides either way it's fine if you look at that implicitly you got partial derivative of F with respect to X plus partial derivative inspector yd Y DX and we form ly x DX now here's where the main exact differential equation comes from what these are called what these are called this is called the total differential for some potential function I miss I learned it as parent function so I will say that from time to time if you hear me say parent function accidentally it really is a potential function I learned it the wrong way when I was going through it so that's called a potential function for some exact differential equation now why they're called exact differential equations these things this thing this exact same thing here is called a total derivative a differential or an exact differential that's the name of it and so when we talk about an exact differential equation what we're talking about is a differential that's coming from some potential function which is a level curve one time all the way through as fast as I can go like like maybe a twenty second recap we can't look at this two different ways just as a differential and then say okay but what if that is a constant well then we get this equal to zero and this is called the total or exact differential or we say let's look at this is level curves take a derivative on both sides no problem have implicit differentiation we'll have a 0 over here we'll multiply by DX and we'll get again the total or exact differential I hope that I've made this make sense of where it comes from the first time I went there that I'm going to what that actually means when I was learning and what does an exact differential equation mean where'd you come from comes from a differential or comes from a derivative and changing it into what's called differential form as a total or exact differential now why is that important what do we actually do well let's um let's let's go a couple more steps and see what's going on when we get these differential forms of these these differential equations or a total differential here oftentimes you won't see this partial of f with respect to X and you won't see the partial of F with respect to Y what you'll see is the letters m and n or some other letters but if we define m to be the partial of F with respect to X and n to be the partial of F with respect to Y then this total differential changes to M DX plus n dy equals 0 and that probably looks familiar to you oh yeah yeah that makes sense because we have this this okay that's that's the exact differential equation I've seen in my textbook but that right there is representing any an exact differential of some sort of potential function now here's the issue and this would be exactly what that differential is here's the issue we're not starting here in this class and ending here where we're starting is here and trying to end with some potential functions so so how in the world do we know that this is an exact differential for some potential function and here's the beauty of it so I want you to listen real carefully that understand where this is coming from when we this is when we talked about continuous and differential differentiable functions with two variables we learned something really interesting what we learned is that mixed partial derivatives are always equal on some sort of region where our function is continuous and differentiable I said one more time so look this is a partial derivative of f expect X right that's what that's what M is and this is a partial derivative of f respect to Y that's what that's what n is if we take another another two partial derivative this one with respect to Y and this one with respect X those things have to be equal if this is representing some potential function as both continuous and differentiable on some region I know that's a lot of theory but I want it to make sense because I don't want to just to give you the hell thought you understand the why that's pointless it it'll work but you'll never really get it so so let's let's get this let's see it's a real straight in order for this to actually work that function has to be continuous and differentiable on some sort of a region do you guys get that like it's got to be differential linked in continuously differentiable for us to even do this so we don't start here though we start here so how do we know we're gonna be able to go backwards well we know we're gonna be able to go backwards if we have these mixed partial derivatives being equal because what that means is man if this is continuous and differentiable on some sort of region then the mixed partials will be equal that means if I take the partial derivative of X and then Y it will be equal to Y and then X that has to be the case in order for this to actually be continuous and differentiable on a region for this up to work so when we start here we say there's a test that we can do if this is the partial derivative of F with respect to X let's take the partial derivative of this with respect to Y let's take the partial derivative of this with respect to X and let's see if they're equal because if they are that means that this comes from some sort of a potential function that is continuous and differentiable on a region which means we can go backwards and there's a way to do that it's not that hard in this video I'm going to show you two techniques might show you why I probably take the - show you both I'm going to show you that a lot of textbooks will sort of make you choose this one to take an integral of all the time you don't have to do that so I'm going to show you that and then I may and we'll practice in the next video in the third video I'm going to show you that there is also an integrating factor that we can find so I'm gonna give you everything I know about exact differential equations I can teach them in this particular class where we where we go the the driving thought behind this is we're trying to get back to a potential function you're going to be given this so in order to not waste your time what we're gonna do is we're going to test to see whether this actually is an exact difference of the equation for some potential function by checking the mixed partials then we'll be able to undo it so how's that going to work for us man if M is the partial of f with respect to X and n is the partial of F with respect to Y then the partial of F with respect to X and then Y is really just the partial derivative of M with respect to Y it's saying look this is the M is already a partial with respect to X let's just do it again with respect to Y and the partial of Y with respect X well this already is the partial of F with respect to Y let's just take that again with respect to X and these two things are equal this is a great point if these two things are equal it means that this is representing an exact differential equation from some potential function and then we can go backwards what these aren't equal well then this is not an exact differential equation for some potential function and we'd have to either a say it's not possible or be theoretically it is possible with some sort of a function that we can multiply and so we can make it an exact differential equation with something called an integrating factor now we've had that before that's gonna be in the last in the last video about exact differential equations so okay so let's suppose let's supposedly start here how in the world are we gonna do it I'm gonna give you some steps right now I'll talk about both meth methods that you could use to go back and then we're just going to practice two examples and we'll we'll continue with that okay so hopefully I've explained this well enough for you to understand that you understand where we're coming from that you understand this is a differential form that I'm sorry that this is the differential for this function this right here is the total differential for this function ends up being the same if you let that be set equal to a constant there's two ways to come down to that idea what we also learned is that mixed partials are equal so in this differential exact differential equation if bar makes parcels are equal that's coming from sort of some sort of a potential function that we can go back to that is continuous and differentiable on a region now let's suppose that we don't start here we want to get here let's suppose we start here at this that's exact difference in the glacier the first thing we want to do is we want to check we want to check the partial the mixed partial derivatives here so we want to check is that actually true which means since n is already the partial derivative of F with respect to X we just have to take that and do it with Y and since n is already the partial derivative of F with respect to Y we just have to take that do the partial derivative of n with respect to X those right there represent our mixed partials you could even see it like this partial derivative am inspecteur y must equal partial derivative of n with respect to X if this represents an exact differential equation so so get this real clear if this if this actually happens then this is an exact differential equation of some potential function so I'm like right off the bat you don't just start calling this an exact differential equation a lot of people do they go oh that's an exact differential equation no no not necessarily it is if the mixed partials are equal because if Parcells are equal then it's representing the exact differential for some sort of a potential function not the other way or not not this way not well this is an exact differential equation therefore this has to be true you know this being true says that's an executive it's equation of some potential function that we can now find so we check this and says hey if that happens right there if that happens then this right here is representing the exact or total differential for some potential function let's find the function how do we do that well let's think about it it represents the partial derivative of F with respect to X how do we go back to F how do we undo derivatives integrals how do we know undo partial derivatives with integrals but everything with the partial derivative it's held constant for instance if we took a partial derivative of F with respect to X we held the Y's as constants so when we do this integral of this partial derivative when we can get back we have this this idea that there can be a whole lot of terms with lies in them that would have been cancelled out and say this one more time when you take a partial derivative of function everything that's not the variable under consideration goes to zero if it's a term so like X plus y take the positive x that Y term goes to zero well if I'm gonna undo that derivative I'm gonna undo the partial derivative then yeah I can just find an integral with respect to X that seems pretty logical this is gonna say well hey M is the partial of F with respect X how do you don't undo derivatives do an integral with respect to whatever Verity - the derivative - but since it's a partial I very well could have a function in terms of Y that would be completely annihilated imagine it but the derivative of this piece this only have X's right all of its gonna have X's you're gonna be able to get the partial effect X everything over here that has no X is just terms of why that's going to go to zero and so we have to represent that I hope you're getting that like if you have a partial adventure this or a partial of a function spec 2x your washer gone we've got a show that doing the integral would give us something of why now most of your textbooks are going to end right there and say that's all you need to know then what we do is we we take a derivative of this piece and then we set it equal to man and then you're going to go and that is true but sometimes this can be very challenging and what some of the textbooks don't tell you is you can actually do it another way so instead of just saying well I got us I got to take the integral of M I have to do that have a G of Y that's really hard what have we thought about different what if we thought wait whoa women if ends the partial derivative of F with respect to Y could we find the same exact thing by saying let's undo that derivative with respect to Y let's do an integral of n this time with respect to Y but keeping in mind that you're gonna have this function of X that would have been knocked out when you take a partial derivative so we check we go hey if that's equal that's that is an exact differential or total differential for some sort of potential function well what's that mean then this is the partial of F with respect X let's do an integral but we're gonna have a function in terms of Y or let's do an integral of n but we're gonna have a function in terms of X no that seems really good but you're thinking by the way just so I'm real clear here you don't do both you don't do both you look at this you say which one would be easier to deal with is it easier to look at the integral of M with respect to X or is it easier to look at the integral of n with respect to Y again M with X or end with y which integral would be easier and you do that one you don't need to do both it's one of the other and then you go wait though I mean this is the function of F with respect X this is exactly what we're trying to find this is it but there's half the function I don't know but here's the beauty in this technique if you take an integral of M with us to X and you get a function of Y well well what about this what if we took this and took a partial derivative of this piece with respect to that y so we're integrating X we did some wise we don't know let's take the partial derivative of this function what if we're going to get with respect to Y all right then if I take the partial of this with respect to Y that's what I'm doing right here well this must be full think about what must it equal if I take the derivative of F with respect to Y I take the derivative of F with respect to Y it has to equal n so the idea is take your M do an integral tacking a why take a derivative and then that derivative with respect to Y must be home and it has to that's what this means that is the end that you're standing on your on your work right now also when you do this if you take a derivative of this with respect to Y you're going to get a G prime of y the first derivative of that whatever that function is respect to Y in then likewise another way we can think about it let's say you did this one because that was easier ok great right now this is the function of ethylene this is what the function have what the function you're looking for this is the function that you're looking for okay but you don't know the X is well we do have something that we we understand about the derivative of F with respect to X we understand that the derivative of F with respect to X is M it's the same thing so we say alright well now that we integrate it with respect to Y let's take the derivative with respect to X ok so we're gonna have this thing derivative whatever it is with respect to X and it's gonna have to be equal to M you're gonna get some derivative of that function of X a couple questions that students always have is this always going to be only wise yes is this always to be only exes yep so long story made real short integrate em with X then take a derivative with why instead equal to N or integrate n with respect to Y take a derivative and with respect to X and set equal to M you're going to have some sort of a derivative in there solve for that derivative so you're gonna have you're gonna have these set equal you're gonna solve for that derivative so solve for G prime of Y or solve for H prime of X and lots of stuff is going to cancel typically so you'll get something that's that's nice now again when you solve for this should this be in terms of Y only yeah that's that's that's kind of the point right because you have a function of Y's should this be an X is only yes now how do we undo so you solve for this right you have this equal how do you how do you undo that what we doing this so let's find G of Y our H of X G of Y that's doing integral of G prime of Y dy H of X let's do an integral of H prime of X DX shoot that so we got it anyway we took a derivative with respect to Y to get n to get this thing all right cool and then we undo that with respect to Y or we took a derivative of X to get to em to get to this thing so let's take an integral the spandex your variables have to match up anyway you're only gonna have lies here you only have X's here so that dy and the DX should be making sense lastly once you find this piece man I promised you earlier I said this is your function right it just has a piece you don't know likewise that this is your function it has a piece you don't know so either way you go here you're gonna get the same answer um do one of these ways and then the piece you don't know can solve for right here so let's replace it let's take these two things this is G of Y or this H of X and we replace it in our function here and then you know what you're done because what we're trying to get is our potential function right there this does it man would you replace that that is your function set it equal to some constant some C and you are your money you're good to go we're going to explore that in two examples if you're given an initial value after this step is where you plug it in so so keep in mind what we're doing right these are low occurs so they're curves and and like every difference equation when we solve it it's giving us a family of those scrips like an infinite family to figure out what specific curve you want what particular solution instead of a general solution in the initial value so I hope that makes sense to you I hope that the logic behind where you're getting an exact differential equation is explained well enough for you guys understand that's always my goal to make sure this stuff makes sense the process right now seems pretty vague because we don't have what's not but it seems pretty big because we haven't done an example hang on for it we have two examples I will walk you through will see how all this stuff works to make it a little more concise and then we'll go through it okay hang on I'll be right back okay I hope you're ready we're gonna go through how to solve an exact differential equation what what it means I'm gonna show you how all these steps make sense but now when we go through it there you're gonna see where these come into play so I know this is very maybe not vague it does fully explain it but without doing an example you're gonna lose track so stick with me on this one let's go through every little detail make sure that we get it so number one what normal is that well that's an exact differential equation written in what's called differential form so we have a differential equation is it exact well before we can say that we need to do a test on so for this let's test the mixed partials let's see what what happens now let's make sure that you understand the the terminology here and what these little pieces mean so based on the form of our total differential or an exact differential equation our partial derivative of F with respect to X would be this piece but this is written three different ways the partial derivative of F with respect to X could be written as that our saluteth F with respect to X and that is our M is the piece the partial derivative have inspected X is the piece that's in front of your DX so this in this case is just 4x minus y now the partial derivative of F with respect to Y according to our differential form or you could write it as partial F with respect to Y or you could write it as n that's the most common is this piece it's always the piece that's right for that do you why I need to be familiar with that this n is in front of DX so this n is in front of dy that means the partial of F with respect to X and with respect to Y now we do our test we see if this is actually an exact original equation by doing what's called a mixed partial so we want to discover is the partial derivative of M with respect to Y the same thing as the partial of n with respect to X since this is already a partial derivative with respect to X according to our form then that we're just doing to do with Y since this is already with respect to Y we're just going to do it with respect to X and that gives some mixed partial this right here would be XY this regular would be YX let's try it so look at that you're hopefully remember partial derivatives we look at the partial derivative of M with respect to Y say hey with respect to Y that's a constant that's 0 with respect to Y this would give us negative 1 now let's look at the partial of n with respect to X partial of n with respect to X this is wise that would be 0 with respect to X minus 1 partial and with respect to X is negative this is what we're looking for we're looking for the partial derivative of M with respect to Y and the partial derivatives and with respect to X to equal the same thing what that says is our mixed partials are equal what that says is that if our mixed partials are equal they're coming from some function where it is continuous and differentiable on a rectangle that's saying that we can work backwards and find a valid function on the interval that's what we're doing here we're saying hey this is now guaranteed an exact differential for some higher parent function we're gonna find that now so how we do it so we we've done check them good now we find and now we find f of XY based on that so so how how's that work this is where your textbooks pinafore would kind of push you to this and we're going to be at this time but I want you to look at this we're gonna look here and see which one is easier to integrate is it easier to integrate you this with respect to X or this with respect to what now line those two variables this is already a partial derivative into X so we're gonna try to undo that this is a partial derivative respect to Y so we're trying to undo that one which one's easier this respect to X this respect to Y or does it matter in this case it looks like they're about the same so I pick this one because I'm more familiar with integrating with respect to X you don't have to do it down there so let's try it and say hey well you know what if I'm man if if M is the partial derivative of F with respect to X which it is and that equals 4x minus y then check it out from here if I take an integral of both sides with respect to X then I would get f of XY is equal to the integral of 4x minus y with respect to X I'm basically doing this basically saying hey take an integral with respect to X take an integral with respect to X that's basically we're doing and we're saying well then this he's really not bad the integral of 4x would be let's see 4x squared over 2 so x squared X square root 2 to the 2 and Kansan of 2x squared minus integrals of things that are being held constant so what like why we get this X Y but we also get this is very important we also get some function of Y because if I were to take a partial derivative let's just verify this if I were to take a partial derivative of this thing with respect to X it darn well better equal M because that's what M means and means a partial derivative of F with respect to X let's take a partial derivative of F with respect to X and make sure that happens here those are all exits that before X here I take the derivative of X but Y would be held constant minus X is to be 4x minus X I'm sorry 4x minus y the derivative X would be 1 we leave the Y alone is a constant for X minus y here that that would be all in Y's so all of these terms over here that are added all these terms would give a 0 on a partial derivative with respect to X man I hope that makes sense for a lot of students is losing what how about that one why is that there because if this is that partial that's a partial then when I do an integral of both sides I do respect to X so I get this but it has some function of Y because that integral said that partial River says all those wise we go to cereal Lisbon so we we've checked it we know it's exact we labeled it we've picked something we're gonna integrate either Ammerman and you integrate with respect to X because it is based on it partial of X we do that we have a function of Y considering the partial derivative but no no so we're right here we found one of these two things now what we're gonna do is we're going to take a derivative and we're gonna say what's the point of doing this well we think well if you face this on and he said this is a respected X I did an integral with respect to X I have this thing with the function of Y then let's be smart about it what we have now is something that's really close to our final answer this f of X but we don't know that piece we don't know what G of Y is now is the process we're finding that well but we know something about this we know that the partial derivative of F with respect to Y the portion of your management of Y is exactly 6y minus X so what if we were to take the partial derivative of that with respect to life this would go to 0 this would go to minus X this would go to the derivative of G with respect to Y and this is really important right here understand this please get this this is exactly what n is the partial derivative of F with respect to Y is exactly n its n not n factorial I'm just end it is end you have to get back one less time all the way through because it's giving site again is that an exact differential equation for something yep because we check the mixed partials and that says that that comes from some parent function that's continuous and differentiable on an interval this has to be an exact differential equation from one of those things how do we do it take either one a miranne and just just integrate with respect to X for them or why for n great you're going to get something very easy to find typically and you get some function of the variable that you didn't integrate with respect to so for DX you're being the Y then be smart about it if this is the function that we're looking for but I don't know this function of Y let's take a derivative with respect to Y what because we know that piece to so take the derivative straight to Y so the other thing the variable you didn't integrate with respect to take that derivative and set it equal to the other piece so basically integrate em take a derivatives of equal to N or integrate n take a derivative set equal to n the key is don't forget about that all right now lots of things are going to cancel typically so like here you add X to both sides and we get G prime of y equals 6 wine let me ask you a question shouldn't it be in terms of Y only yeah because you said it's just a function of Y right so you're gonna get lots of things that cancel well wait a minute women or right we're right here by the way how do you find just G of Y integrated if G prime of y equals 6 while then she of y equals the integral of 6 y dy so G apply would equal to C ad so it's 3 y squared plus some sort of a constant now do we need the constant not really I'll show you why it's a little C sub 1 but here it is we took our animal we integrated inspect X to getting some function of Y we didn't know we took a partial derivative with respect to Y because we know what that's supposed to be what that does is that allows us to solve for the missing the derivative of the missing function of Y do we got it so notice take a derivative this you get G prime y solve for that how do we solve how do I do derivatives where we take integrals and you just found the missing piece that's right here you just found that so to replace that from step number two replace it from right here so our function is now this is great we got that from integrating our X's this is great we've got the same thing but now we know this this is 3 y squared plus C sub 1 but here's the thing here's where this constant does not matter we know that this is this was an executive equation for something that's of this form I recently there's something of this form right here so something in the form f of XY equals C well if this is sorry not zero f of XY equals C so we have solved it we now know the function we have all of our stuff all of our complete function there's no G of Y no H of X but we know that this comes from some function of X's and Y's equal to a constant notice how we can just subtract this constant and you would get just another arbitrary constant so typically people don't even have to show that you don't even need it because you're going to wrap it up in the concept either way so for us our final solution would say that that is a function in terms of exit live equal to some constant exactly what we're looking for - exactly something that's producing level curves for us that is rad like that's it that's what we want now if you had an initial value problem say Y of 0 equals 1 or something you can plug in the 0 for the X the 1 for the Y and you could actually solve for C that would give you a specific curve going through a specific point that would give you a specific differential equation sorry a specific function that satisfies the particular solution to that exact differential equation I hope right now that that has made sense to you I hope right now that you understand a little bit better about what an exact differential equation even means because half of but not half of it some of it is knowing what it even means what it means is it's it's coming from a differential form from some function that looks like this and if you have mixed partials that are equal it says that that differential equation is an exact form of a differential equation for such a function all we're really doing take a piece and it becomes very easy when you get it ok I hope that I've made it make sense you take a piece either and then do an integral have them functions you don't know take a derivative set it equal to the other piece solve for that that derivative of the function you don't know integrate and then plug it in we'll do one more right now and then the next time we'll practice just heck out of it alright here we go we get time for about one more so we're looking at this we're going to determine firstly is this an exact differential equation for some function that I'm gonna try to find if it is perfect we have an easy way to do it it is it's very streamlined very nice once you get the hang of it but we got to check it first because there's no sense of going through this if the mixed partials are not equal so I want us to be able to identify this I need you to be able to identify this I need you to be able to identify that from this form the partial derivative of F with respect to X in such a function if this is a differential equation for such a function if the function exists for which this is the exact difference equation then this part would be the partial derivative of F respect X bats of this it's always next to the DX and if such a function exists such that when I take a derivative of it and put a difference perform its this then this would have to be the partial derivative of F with respect to Y it's always next to the dy now our test comes in and says take the derivative of M with respect to Y and n with respect to X and it will create some mixed partials so this with respect to Y says that's treated as a constant so this would be for X Y and that would be 0 that would be a constant term and if we're only looking at y's are very well likewise here with respect to X that would be a variable to be 4x but that Y would be a constant like a coefficient but that Y with respect to X becomes a constant hey look those are exactly the same what this is proven is that f of X Y first because F of Y then X derivative of Y was a bit too Y and then inspect the X in other words our mixed partials are equal and what that says to us it's very important is that this is an exact differential equation written in differential form of some function that is continuous and differentiable on some rectangle now it's up to us to find it I mentioned earlier that it does not matter which of these you integrate you just need to know which one you're integrating so you either integrate this with respect to X because that's where it came from or you can agree to this with respect to Y because that's where it came from they looked about the same next time the last example on the next video I'm going to show you how to do this one it's it yeah so let's go ahead and let's look at this let's say let's pick this and say I'm going to take the integral of F with respect to Y that's our N that's 2x squared y plus 4y cubed now what do we don't like that if that's the partial derivative of F with respect to Y how we undo all derivatives is with integrals so let's integrate this side but we're going to do it with respect to Y we're doing this with respect to Y because that's what M came from us a derivative with respect to Y you're just I'm doing that and say let's undo the the derivative with an integral with respect to Y but what's gonna happen here when we integrate with respect to Y we'll have our two x squared Y squared but we would divide by two this is all treated like a constant so two x squared that's a number five and then Y squared over to our twos are going to disappear plus this needs to be integrated with respect to Y so we'd add 134 divided by the new exponent so before Y to the fourth over four and that's gone now every time you integrate you know you get a constant right every time but when we're dealing with stuff that came from a partial derivative this was the partial derivative of F with respect to Y that means that every function of X would have been cancelled out just exactly like we did up there right here when we took this with respect to Y this thanks cancelled out and we took a respect to X that Y cancelled out so understanding that this came from a partial derivative with respect to Y means that any function of X that would have been there in the original function would have been canceled to get this pieces in again because it's a partial derivative with respect to Y any terms or functions of X alone would have been cancelled out when we took a derivative of this with respect to Y therefore when we get it constant it can possibly have X's in it because those would be held constant with a partial derivative with respect to Y this is what our function looks like our function really is this our function is x squared y squared plus y to the fourth plus some function of X that we don't know now how do we find that well beautifully since we used n to find an integral to find our function now we can take a partial derivative of F with respect to whatever variable you didn't just integrate so we integrated with respect to Y right you okay I have a function of X that I don't know if we want to find the function of X that I don't know let's take a partial derivative with respect to X and set it equal to the thing that it has to be and is the partial derivative of F with respect to X so if I take a partial derivative of F with respect to X you have to believe that I'm gonna be setting this equal to M this is M this is exactly what that means so let's take this partial with respect to X now the variable that I did not just integrate in order to find the function that I don't know well let's see here that would be 2x that be constant this would be a constant at 0 plus if I take a derivative I'd have the derivative respect to X I check out the Sokol take a derivative respect to X this is the derivative with respect to X and this is M the derivative with respect to X as predicted as predicted a lot of things are going to because you're going to everything with wise in other words in this case and everything to exit we've done the other way you're just going to have a function in terms of X or what that's exactly what this says so a first derivative of the function that we didn't know is 3x squared I'll say it again the first derivative of the function that we didn't know is this rigged squared how do you undo derivatives let's integrate then H of X would equal the integral of 3x squared DX or that's just X cubed do I have to do a constant you should when you're doing integrals but here we don't have to because we know where we're going with this we know we're gonna have some function equal to a constant anyway and that constant we just get wrapped up in the sake of now you want to show it every time and subtract it totally cool but we don't have to but we do have to understand it's the following we've got to understand that if our mixed partials are equal this is an exact differential equation if right once we have that once we understand that's an exact difference or the equation take one of these partial derivatives of F with respect to whatever you want whatever looks easier and integrate integrate and with respect to X Y was and with respect to Y I did the second one to give you some diversity here so with respect to Y great okay do it you can have a function of X that you don't know okay well now take a derivative again but with respect to the other variable so you can set it equal to the other thing that's gonna allow you to make a derivative solve for the first derivative of the function of X that you said would have been held constant under differential differentiation with respect to Y in this case we do our integral we have our function and we are done so our function of X right here our function of x and y was x squared y squared plus y to the fourth plus some function of X that I didn't know and have just found and that's going to equal some sort of a constant because that's where these functions come from now we can write it simply like this and if you've had an initial value problem this is where you go ahead and plug it in what's really cool is if you take a partial derivative I'm sorry if you if you take a derivative of this with respect to X on both sides and you start figuring out and put in differential form it's going to be exactly that thing on the right-hand side you get zero on the left-hand side and you get partial derivative spec 2x that's that 2x Y squared plus 3x squared right there and then partial derivative with respect to that vector Y would give you that 2x squared Y of 4y to the third and then that second part would be dissolves well go to zero and you'd have that dy/dx which is spread here and here and that's that's it yes so anyway I hope that that's made sense I hope that I've Illustrated this well enough that you understand what exactly a differential equation that exact differential equation is where it comes from and what you're doing when you're been doing it I hope I've explained you the necessity of doing the test first because that's saying that makes partials are equal therefore your function is continuous and differentiable on some sort of a rectangle I hope that I've made it very clear that most textbooks will always do this integral and then take your derivatives city will do this thing and that is ok to do most of the time that's fine I made the point in the second example kind of went off script here a little bit to show you that that's not necessary you can certainly take the integral of this with respect to Y take a derivative keeping the function X taking a derivative with respect to X and then City equal to M that's the opposite way it will give you the exactly the same answer it does not matter which way you do that so other than that I think that's about it next time we're going to is we're gonna practice man just a whole lot of these to make sure that we're really good at it they don't talk about an integrating factor that we can use on these things that might not be exactly exact so I really hope that makes sense please leave comments if you have questions or anything I'll try my best to answer them so have a great day I'll see you for the next video you
