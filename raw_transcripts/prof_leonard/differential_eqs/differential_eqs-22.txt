Transcript for: Solving Homogeneous First Order Differential Equations (Differential Equations 21)
now is there time to practice some of these homogeneous equations are solving by homogeneous substitution so we have these differential equations we know they don't fit a particular technique that we've learned so we're trying to substitute that make that happen last video I gave you a couple introductory examples this time then we're gonna crush some examples there's about seven of them that we're gonna do and some of them are just brutal and so I'm trying to give you the hardest ones I could find or create or recreate to give you those those cases where it they're very difficult now I also send some said something the last video that sometimes some of these equations can be solved at least one other way and so in in a few videos from now I'm going to show you that so while some of these look just extraordinarily hard we go Wow can't there be a better way to do this maybe but I'm giving you at least a fallback like hey here's homogeneous equations this is what you could do with this and also you know me I'm trying to get you to practice some of the whole techniques that way they're in your head so you're never forgetting them excuse me let's look at this one so we got X plus y dy DX equals X minus y and with with these substitution techniques they're only used if you can't make it into something you already know how to do it's like hey could you take a basic integral well no could you write this as the simple equation where we can separate the variables no is it linear doesn't look like it can you make it homogeneous and that's what we're gonna do this is similar to one of the examples in the last video but it has a different technique on on doing the integration so we're going to start here something basic just to get our brains working on what this is again and then we'll start some harder examples so number one let's try to make this into that form of solve for dy/dx and let's see if we can make the homogeneous or at least fit the form of it we saw this in one of the previous examples like that doesn't look great but remember what we're trying to do with homogeneous with homogeneous equations what we're trying to do is we're always trying to structured so that every instance of why is divided by X that gives us a very nice substitution if you have not watched the last video you need to watch that because I'm not going through and explaining this whole technique again spend and how we're doing that right now we're just practicing so the technique says yes you can create this Y over X every place you have Y let's just divide everything by X if we divide every single term by X which means we're multiplying 1 over x times 1 over X and we're distributing that's what's really happy to mathematically what it's coming down to is if we divide everything by X well then what we get is 1 minus y over X hey that's what I'm looking for over 1 plus y over X that's also what I'm looking for I want to structure this if I'm gonna use this technique with every case of Y has to be a fraction Y over X we need to make sure we're getting rid of all of the Y's you may not have y's and x's and these are substitutions so we're grouping all of this so we have y over X that lets us make a really convenient substitution we explored why we want that in the last video but if we have V equals y over X that's going to be a V that's going to be a V but this little Y over here is also got to go well that's where the substitution comes in handy because if I solve this for y and we do a derivative implicitly we'd get dy/dx equals by the product rule that we have here based on implicit differentiation we get X DV DX plus B now we're gonna make sort of a two-port substitution yeah we're gonna call that V yeah we're gonna call that V but also because we made this really convenient substitution because we were able to take a derivative by solving for y we now get that dy/dx these are the same dy DX's dy DX equals this piece let's substitute for all of them so left hand side is going to become this textbooks that look like magic but where they come from but here we have dy/dx equals here's some do a great job but some just kindly behaved equals this so dy/dx is equal to DV X times DV DX plus me on the right hand side so this is that derivative same exact thing that's why we need to replace it on the right hand side we still have a one we saw have a minus but now we're grouping that Y as where X that becomes our V and one plus B so let me let me double check something we knew how to do know maybe we can structure for substitution let's try coma Jeanne's let's group this so we have dy/dx and everything on the right hand side let's see if we can make all of our wise of the form Y of X divide everything by X ok let's substitute let's call this a letter it's called a vu variable all right so V equals y brakes no problem oh we also need to solve for dy/dx let's solve for y let's take a derivative dy/dx is now based on X's and B's our Y's are now based on these that's our substitution and then what this has done is this this has created a differential equation that's based on a different variable yeah that variable is still X's and Y's but it creates something that hopefully we can do with a simple equation or something else so we know how to do so let's try let's try to get rid of this mean we want to make sure all our B's are together for separable equations so let's try to do that hmm in order to combine those we're gonna have to have a common denominator so let's go ahead and let's make that make that happen so our LCD here is this 1 plus B so 1 minus B minus v times 1 plus V all over 1 plus me that was our common denominator I know that I'd never want to distribute this in my head because I'm used to I don't wanna mess up that second side so let me distribute we do it from here and we get x times DV DX equals 1 minus B minus another be those two cancel minus B squared all over 1 plus B all right Wow what now well let's simplify well if we do that you know I really don't like the way this looks now when we try to factor and do substitutions you also time it's nice to have that in order that's nice to have the first term positive so what if we let me just factored out that negative so we factor out the negative here we get a positive B squared a plus 2v and a minus 1 let's let's double-check that factor the negative all the signs change have a negative out front now it looks pretty good I don't look good well that looks good as far as being a simple equation because we have these these on one side we can make on the left hand side the X on the left side we can put on the right hand side with our DX let's do that let's move this to the left we'll have to reciprocate remember what we'd be doing it would be multiplying by V plus 1 we'd be dividing by this expression and then we'd be dividing by X we're also going to leave any constants which includes negatives on the right hand side works a little bit better that way so let's try that so moving this all-around structure RVs on the Left Divi are X's on the right DX we'd have V plus 1 multiplied by the reciprocal over B squared plus 2b minus 1 we're gonna keep that DV on the right hand side so we let C move that we kept the DV let's divide by X let's move our DX now let's make sure that we don't forget that Megan it's so easy to lose  I do it sometimes it happens well let's just be real careful I've always known back and double-checking my work so do I have my V plus one on the numerator yeah do I have this exact expression no sign changes on the denominator yeah with my DV okay did I divide by X I got that to leave my negative I got that and I move my DX now we're ready for an integral so when we integrate both sides on the left hand side don't make these harder than they have to be it's so common for people to dis assume they're gonna be brutal sometimes they are we're gonna get some of those today but sometimes they're not so when you look at this try a substitution first if you take u equals the denominator can you simplify the numerator the answer is yeah you can because if we take u equals V squared plus 2 V minus 1 and we do a derivative and we factor out 2 and we divide by 2 sorry mr. Peavey well then we get Dean you over 2 equals V + 1 DB that's exactly what we have right there so we looked at we thought man that doesn't look great but let's try some simple stuff first let's try separating the fraction bad this is not something I want to do because the substitution won't work I don't want to go any harder than that let's try a basic substitution okay well if I take my denominator as you then 2 u plus 2 V Plus would be 2 we can factor out the 2 and we get that D U is 2 times V plus 1 DV divided by 2 then V plus 1 DV exactly what my numerators is equal to D over 2 and that's a nice substitution so on the left hand side we have this whole piece this is gone that's 1 over you call this whole thing you that's really nice and then we have this piece this V + 1 DV is equal to D u over 2 man that looks a whole lot better than what we started with on the right hand side we still have a negative we still have an integral 1 over X DX now let's go ahead and do our integration so on the left hand side we get 1/2 Ln absolute value u on the right hand side negative Ln absolute value of x and yeah I'm gonna plus C now what else we want to do with it well we gotta at least substitute back in for u so this needs to become this piece and now we have a couple of the things that we can do number one well I probably would multiply everything by two because I don't like that 1/2 I don't want to deal with square root so let's multiply both sides by two right hand-side multiplying everything by two it's gonna distribute I know I'm gonna be changing that constant now let's get as close as we can to solving for V let's take both of these sides as an exponent on that e so to get rid of our lens on the left hand side remember what's gonna happen here I'm going to show all of this at one time what's going to happen is well put it me here and E on that entire side well on the left hand side that's fine we'll get absolute value V squared plus 2b minus one on the right hand side you have exponents added together what that means is that we can have e to the first term times if excellence are added together the came from common bases being multiplied each to the first term times e to the second term so that's we're gonna get so e to the ln gone b squared plus 2v put minus 1 is a value looks good each of the first term times neither the second term lorries might across this out i want you to see what happens in negative to that negative 2 is an exponent so let's move that if we do with that then the absolute value of V squared plus 2 V minus 1 doesn't change on the right hand side I'm going to move this that be X to the negative second power times BD - let's do this times e to the 2 c1 now absolute values let's group all of that idea best value remember it's either plus or minus that idea let's drop those and let's group that idea onto this constant so plus or minus e to the 2 C sub 1 times X to the negative 2 now we're gonna see this whole thing let's just call that a constant and we can even do this really big value we can do this over an x squared so that's a negative exponent no problem just a couple more things we got to do you know what we have to do hopefully understand what we're doing here we have this in terms of B so long problem these take a while some of these are just brutal but we said can't do it regularly try them when to use substitution or homogeneous equation let's make a substitution we did that we have something that we have as separable equations we've solved our integrals for term of V and X but now we got to go back to wise so every place you saw why it was Y over X maybe now every place you see V that's got to be replaced with Y over X so here we're gonna get this Y over x squared 2 times y over X minus 1 equals C over x squared if we simplify just a little bit this will be Y squared over x squared plus 2y over X minus 1 equals C over x squared let's just multiply everything by x squared so we're going to get some simplification if we multiply x squared x squared x squared and x squared then we'll get Y squared plus if we multiply by x squared 1 the X's will cancel one will not 2xy minus x-squared remember we distribute by multiply on both sides on the right hand side we just get C nasty yeah kind of some of these problems I don't know that that nice but what's just amazing the substitutions work force a lot of the time and we can solve some of these differential equations that otherwise we'd be like Milan so that's that's the idea substitutions make them a little bit more possible hope this makes sense I hope you're seeing the idea of homogeneous equations I told you that we're not going to shy away from some really hard problems you got the easy ones in the last video so if you need if you haven't watch that you really should because this might seem like oh my goodness what are you doing these are going to be the more difficult examples I'm giving you here so the ideas were in the last video now we're just putting them into practice so we have got like six more examples from a long video hang on let's start our next one so same ideas again this is a section on homogeneous equations so obviously we're gonna go ahead and do all those I will say one more time that some of these examples can be done a different way and we're gonna get to those and when we do hopefully all kind of reference some of them as we're going through that so let's try this one anything we look that looks like we know what we're doing that not so much can make it homogeneous what that involves is structure and everything with X's and Y's on one side rewriting all the Y terms as Y's over X's let's good let's do them so when we divide both sides by x times X plus y kind of similar to the last problem and that we have this idea we're gonna do the same thing where we have X minus whatever X plus y but this right here this is already what we want to do so don't be distributing that you know you don't have to undo it anyway so if you have the Y over X you're trying to make this a homogeneous equation of the form of a homogeneous equation leave that so we can look at this at why over x times whatever this is now we can divide each of these terms by X and that's the exactly the technique we've used a couple other times so let's leave the first Y of X let's divide everything in this fraction by X that's 1 minus y over X remember the idea we're always trying to get every instance of Y divided by X and we have it we have it one two three times that's when we make our substitution so now we can say okay let's call V let's call this Y of X equal to V what also happens is that if we solve for y so here's our substitution if we solve for y well then we can take a derivative and that lets us substitute for our dy/dx product rule with a chain rule so a derivative of the first times a second plus the first times the derivative the second which is one let's make our substitution hopefully you can do that right now so if you're this takes some some work and you might not be there yet but from here you should be able to make your substitution so dy DX dy DX is now this junk right here hopefully you noticed this but in these homogeneous equations dy DX always changes to that so your left-hand side always why it's always the same substitution why because you're always trying to make Y over X it gives you the same substitution that gives you the same derivative it gives you the same dy equals this so always the same on the right hand side command we get a lot of these so dy/dx I replaced it why Rex I replaced it with V y of Rex and replace it with V Y Rex and I replace it with v normally I show these in parentheses to show that this is what I'm replacing do you have to not really but for me it's a nice little organizer in my head and this is what I'm doing oh man well we're probably going to want to move that V to the right-hand side and see if we make one fraction our ideas let's try to structure this like a separable equation separator variables so if we subtract we get V times 1 minus V over 1 plus B - and under V so we subtract V on both sides well we're gonna need a common denominator our way if we get a common denominator just like last time exactly like last time we multiplied by the other denominators then others shared over Fraga factors we're gonna have to do that so left hand side we get X DV DX no problem that looks really good right hand side we have all on the numerator we have V times 1 minus V - V times 1 plus V no there's a mistake right now and it's really common and it's an algebra mistake a lot of people will do this and say oh well you you've got well let me say it a different way it'd be an algebra mistake if we did something like this that's what I want to see I didn't make a mistake sorry I'm did my own state but when we're grouping this this fraction right here this has a V on the numerator already when we get a common denominator you don't need to distribute that so this V didn't come from here this V was our minus B that we had when we multiply it by that that de nom we create this common denominator we create one fraction this V does not need to be distributed here it's it's not the same idea as multiplying you're just subtracting a fraction that V was already on the numerator that V should have already had parentheses do not distribute to the second fraction see it sometimes we go so fast you make the little bounce mistake so don't do that please don't be there so what could we do well we could just distribute everything and see what happens we could factor out a V and then simplify either way you want to go it doesn't doesn't really matter so let's give it a try V minus V squared minus B minus B squared all over one plus B so if we simplified we're gonna get our X not a problem DV DX looks pretty good right hand side these are gone negative two V squared when you combine like terms over one plus B that at least looks a little bit better now I've got my visa rather than one fraction I've got my X over here let's switch those let's keep the negative two in the right hand side we're going to keep our our coefficients that are constants like the negative two in the right hand side will move our one plus B and our v squared so we're gonna have the reciprocal DV we'll have negative two over X DX so we're gonna move that stuff around what we're trying to do is we're trying to group all of our V's on one side DV all of our X's on the other side DX we're always trying to get the separation of variables in here to work for us so multiply by the reciprocal got that DV we kept our negative two over X and now we can integrate right hand side not a big deal left hand side well let's run through it can you solve it by separating the fractions yeah let's do that without any division it's not a new sub something anything fancy just separate our fraction there so we've done that maybe we simplify a little bit maybe so it looks a nicer force instead of one over B squared let's do B to the negative 2 plus 1 over B and I got that all DV and then negative 2 integral of 1 over X DX it's gonna be absolute value of X let's just go ahead and do that so we got an integral of V to the negative 2 power not a problem we're gonna add one to the exponent divided by the new exponent plus integral of 1 over v ln v right hand side we keep the negative 2 Ln absolute value of x plus c we're actually almost done so when we do go ahead and simplify this a little bit how it looks like we're gonna have yeah negative 1 over V get it plus Ln absolute value V equals negative 2 Ln absolute value of x plus C on them what else can we do well we could just multiply everything by oh there's an idea what if we took what have we took and move this to the left hand side that way we've got L ends together and what if we took and move this to the right hand side that would we have our stuff that's not a lens over there so the idea is remember those those export rules that you can do sorry natural log rules if you have natural log to be multiplied you can you can combine them so let's try that let's move this to the right side this to the left side all right what else could we do maybe we move this is an exponent right hand side stays the same maybe even combine those do you remember what happens when you have logarithms being added together that you create a product inside one logarithm well that's about as good as we're gonna get before unless we start using some Exponential's which I don't want to do so let's plug in our Y so we know that V was equal to Y over X let's do that again so if we do V equals y over X then we have Ln Y over x times x squared equals 1 over V so 1 over Y over X plus C now a couple other people might want to do this like well the V let's make a V to the negative 1 so it would be the negative 1 we'd have Y over X but then it'd be the negative 1 power we would reciprocate that so x over Y same thing happens here 1 over Y over X that's the same thing as X to the line so right hand side we're going to get x over y plus C left hand side we since the vacation we know that x squared over X just gives us X feels like run a rule let's keep on going so we have another one and we're looking at it going back does not look very good there's an e up there what in the world we do with that well look at the export of the sometimes these substitution techniques almost give themselves away so when you have Y of an actually go I'm not going to get rid of that well that's kind of begging you to do a homogeneous into that home easiest form of the difference equation so do the substitution the V equals y over X it's almost just asking you for that so let's see if that works let's divide both sides by x squared to try to get this in the form remember the fun we want is dy/dx equals a whole bunch of stuff where every instance of Y is divided by X so that our substitution works let's try that so when we divide by x squared well we simplify and it almost get itself up for free so that's kind of nice some of these examples or some of these problems just all show you what to do it says that's that looks really similar to a substitute that is a substitution we've been doing before let's try to make everything else fit that so we solve for dy/dx we simplify what we can and now we see that every instance of the variable Y is also divided by an X that is our substitution let's make y equal to that I'm sorry feed let's make V equal to that if we solve for y it allows us to go ahead and do a derivative based on our product rule and chain rule and get something that we can replace not only Y over X so V V but now dy/dx is this whole piece right there dy/dx replace it so our left-hand side looks like this we've got that right hand side this is now V he is still there but raised to the V power now this is pretty nice we saw this a couple times on on the last video but if you subtract V this happens occasionally happens quite a bit when you're going through all of your examples sometimes your beasts cancel that's great does it look like it's separable can you group your visa on one side DV your X's on the side DX that's what it looks like to me if I multiply both sides by e to the negative beat or divide by e to the V change your exponent we're gonna get an e to the negative V DV divided by X that's 1 over X DX man this problem looked a lot harder than it is and sometimes that happens if you get the right substitution or use the appropriate one there are some that work with some of examples you can work it in two or three different ways but sometimes that one will be just really nice in this case that's what gave it away oh that's that's really nice for a homogeneous if I could write the otherwise in that form well we can so once we get it down to here we separate our variables let's do an integral the way that e to the function of X works is you get the you get that that function back again divided by the derivative of your exponent that's just negative so negative e to the negative e equals Ln absolute value of x plus C see well let's see what else can we do I don't like that negative let's multiply everything by a negative call that C sub 1 that way we might change it later looks pretty good what else can we do well we this can be kind of awkward but could we take an Ln of everything we could we can do L n D to the negative V equals l n- l 9 absolute value of X minus C sub 1 let's do a couple of things with this number number 1 let's eliminate this is a composition of inverse function so that's going to be gone we'll get negative V on the right-hand side I'm gonna do two things inside that bracket I'm gonna move this negative as an exponent I know that that means that's going to be 1 over X I'm also going to change this minus C sub 1 to plus C so remember that that's an arbitrary constant so if I define C equals negative C sub 1 then I can write this is plus C and if you're getting a lot of problems on your your homework or your practice go where where there's a sign coming from why am I not getting that they might be wrapping up and negative inside of another arbitrary constant now we have one last thing to do that V that V is representing wire X let's change it back if we multiply both sides by negative x get a really awkward-looking answer but i mean it's not not horrible I suppose so we have this negative X Ln Ln of absolute value 1 or X plus C you might see it differently so I wrote this my way but you might see this differently I'm going to show you from right from right here imagine you didn't do that negative one imagine you didn't do this as Ln 1 over X which is one reason why we do this example to show you you get several different looks here well if you consider this to be that so I still wrap this up as the C but I left the minus alone I let the negative one's gonna kill the - well then when you solve this negative Y over x equals Ln C - Ln X and you multiply both sides by negative X you get something that looks fairly different you go those don't look the same they don't look the same but they are the same you see some of those logarithms when we get logarithms you know that you get several different looks for it so whether you get this or that doesn't really matter you're gonna see this problem more often than not because people try to avoid those fractions inside natural logarithm logarithms but I wanted you to see both of those that those are equivalent answers just by stretching the problem little bit differently anyway the fundamental idea is hey if you've got a substitution you can make it's really apparent try it is always gonna work no but there's a good chance that it will let's move on to another problem all right moving on so we have another example we've got a differential equation it doesn't look like anything that we're used to seeing like well that work can be seen home genius but it don't look like anything were used to seeing as far as direct separable equation or linear or something else that we've done like basic integrals so we might start trying homogeneous because that's all we know and we're going to I'm going to show you that but I want to say right from the beginning that there is at least one other technique that we can use here it's called an embedded derivative at least that's what I call it is an embedded derivative where the function of Y and the derivative of the function of Y is also in your equation so I want you to check this out disregarding constants if I look at Y squared and the got Y squared the derivative Y squared is 2 wide there's no y and we would be able to do this with another technique and it might actually work out a little bit easier so I'm saying that now just to prove to you because I'm gonna do it later that you don't have to use one specific technique to get the same answer and to solve this differential equation right now because we're kind of limited to homogeneous equations I'm going to show you that because this has some interesting techniques as we go through that's what we're doing it but that's I just want to let you know that so let's try to make this homogeneous we know we need 2 ydx by itself we know that every instance of Y has to be Y over X let's divide by X times y and let's simplify as much as possible you go that doesn't look great well you know what we can do if we have x over Y we can write that as a negative exponent so take your fraction reciprocate it's also going to change the sign of your exponent so we have this dy/dx well we can write this as not x over Y but Y over X to the negative 1 plus 3 and then Y over excellent really good now we're ready to go now we know that our substitution can be B we know if we solve for y we can do an implicit derivative dy/dx and now that lets us do is sort of a double substitution we're gonna replace dy/dx with this piece we're gonna replace each instance of X Y or X with V so this whole thing this thing is going to change dy/dx is going to be this piece right hand side we have V to the negative one power plus 3b all right hey let's try to write this as separable let's see if that works that's one technique that we're really familiar with one or for that to happen we're gonna have to group RVs on one side create one fraction then move it back so let's let's try that so we have this X DV DX no problem right hand side we have V to the you know what let's write that as 1 over V plus 2 V they'll probably combine some like terms well that's not one fraction and if I want to group this as all my these times DV and then XD add 1 over X DX I'm gonna have to make one fraction out of that so we'll need a common denominator if we multiply by V over V we get our X DV DX right hand side we get 1 + 2 V squared over V just V to the first power because this whole thing common denominator you're not multiplying that when you add fractions now that's something we can deal with let's group RVs on one side DV so reciprocal sure divided by X move our DX no problem now we're ready so the idea try to make it homogeneous if you want to is there other ways yes we don't know him yet so divide because by whatever this XY y because homogenius are predictable we kind of know what's gonna happen we kind of know that we're gonna be trying to get separable equations we know how to deal with that so we do it even though sometimes the techniques aren't great as far as their integrals we do know what's gonna happen with them so we're going to reciprocate with our DB and reciprocate with our DX let's do an integral on the right hand side piece of cake not bad at all left-hand side this is not a separation of fractions you can't separate that unless you do partial fractions you're not going to do that we're going to do a substitution so if you equals to V squared plus 1 try something basic try the most basic technique see if they work then D u equals 4 V DV let's divide by 4 because right here we have the V DV that's fantastic and now we can make that substitution work someone just go right over here we get our integral of V DV that is our D u over 4 we chose our whole denominator to be u so here's our you there's our u v DV is DV over 4 and so we can go ahead and change this integral left hand side becomes this right hand side was really basic we didn't have to change it and now if you did great nicely we know that that 1/4 is gonna stay there Ln absolute value you know problem right hand side Ln absolute value of x plus C sub 1 in case you have to start changing that arbitrary constant now we can kind of like to read substitutions we have a u in there but we use the use of so let's move that back to 2 V squared plus 1/2 V squared plus 1 is never negative so we don't really need those absolute value more next step maybe we start multiplying I mean well unless you learn to deal with the four through let's go to play everything by four to get rid of the run for let me hang on to that for C sub one for just a bit because I know I'm probably going to be using and an exponential here I'm going to wrap all of that up in that seat well another thing I might do maybe move this as an exponent so I can get that Ln by itself now that looks pretty good let's do the e in to change both of these is x bar on e if we do that so ii ii ii this whole thing well we have exponents that are added that came from common bases being multiplied so gone gone but we're going to get e to the 4 c sub one i hope that makes sense if you fall in the algebra on this one so take these as an exponential we would get X to the fourth x naught plus x we have exponents so that would be e to this term times e to this term let's call that whole thing the arbitrary constant C now we're almost done man the only thing we've got to do now let's solve for V as much as it's possible so we can just subtract one if you're thinking why don't we divide by two you certainly could but because we're going to be ending this implicitly anyway we don't I mean we don't have to because we'd started getting getting fractions out of that so if you want to divide by two you can you started getting one-half things like that so I'm gonna leave it as two V squared but what we do have to do we start in terms of Y so we're gonna need this back in terms of Y since V equals y over X the left-hand side becomes 2y over x squared equals C X to the fourth minus one let's make this 2y squared over x squared equals C to the fourth all right sorry the X to the fourth minus one and another thing we could do probably is multiply everything by x squared we could do that so multiplying gone see X to the sixth minus x squared you could factor the x squared you could have just multiplied the whole thing by x squared you can also add x squared back if you don't like the - there's lots of different forms we can except here what we're not gonna do is we're not gonna solve for y because you get the plus and minus you have something that we don't really want to look at as far as their solution here so implicitly defined we just consider that as our solution so we're looking at it saying could could we solve this homogeneous lead over the homogeneous equation yeah yeah we can some interesting techniques sometimes happen try some simple ones first before you get all crazy on your new rules and then if you can solve for like great if you can't it's okay to leave it implicit especially when you get things like Y squared so that's about all we can do on that example let's move on to another one we're gonna start getting some some tougher ones for these last few problems well let's get moving so we have another one I'm going to show you how to do homogeneous make this into homogeneous form of this differential equation we'll make our substitution we'll go through it a couple of things that I want you to notice we're going through this is how to deal with the square roots we've seen it one time before like how you make that happen we'll talk a little bit about that and then my ideas here of course when we deal with integrals try to make them as simple as possible it's gonna look like you're gonna want to do one technique here but refrain from that until you try something easier so let's get started I would actually really like it if you guys would try this on your own try at least the first step so try putting this in the form of a homogeneous equation so can you get dy/dx by itself try that can you simplify what you have try that try to simplify see what happens think about what you want to happen you want every instance of Y to be in the form Y of X that looks really good right there it doesn't look great here so think about how you can make that happen could you define y as something that you can put inside the square root think think about that think about what you can do to make make it possible for you to combine those square roots what could you do try it could you write this as the square root of Y squared we're always under than trying to give this idea of we want Y over X Y over X Y even x over a while work because we have negative exponents that are exposed over here so Y over X looks really good the square root does not look really good so let's see if we can make this Y into the square root of Y squared now we can make one one big square root out of it and if we make that into two different fractions we get 4x squared over Y squared plus y squared over Y squared now that we have that down can you simplify it and see if you can simplify these fractions remember what we want we want Y over X so can you simplify Y square root of Y squared of course can you write this as Y over X to some power the reason why I'm asking you these questions at this point in this this lesson is I want you asking yourself when you when you approach these problems like on your test or homework I want you asking yourself these questions when you deal with these and try to make them in homogeneous equations I want you asking can I do this should I be doing this how can I simplify it am I getting the right thing that's why I ask you these even though you can't respond to me verbally I want we think and think in that way so in my mind I'm always asking those questions so can I write this is why Rex done can I write this as Y bricks probably because I know that I could make this four times x over y squared that's the same thing keep kick out before that's x over y squared plus one but because that's the reciprocal of what I want if I reciprocate the fraction all it happens is I change the sign of my exponent Y bricks got it core no problem Y over X yes but to the negative 2 power reciprocate change the sign plus one now we're ready for our substitution so can you do that so once you have Y over X in every instance of life make your substitution try it so V equals y Rex do your y equals do your derivative of Y and then substitute for everything two parts substitution one for dy/dx one for every case of Y Breck's should be trying that right now so my hat ask am I ready for the substitution yes I have Y's over X's can I solve for y corns can I take a derivative of Y so as to replace dy/dx sure now we're ready so this is going to become left hand side is exactly what we found because we solve for dy/dx that's always the case for homogeneous equations so left hand side that right hand side I'm gonna replace V and V so let's make sure that work dy/dx no use your substitution dy/dx no this thing Y breaks no B plus sign sure square root sure 4 sure why bricks no V to the second negative second power then plus one I love it when this happens oh man so nice avoid some common common denominators avoids adding fractions I love it when the B's cancel now the right hand side might take a little bit of work so we can write this as 4 over B squared plus 1 but that doesn't look really good so let's try and see if we can make that a slightly better form so for V to make it too sure but that means 4 over V squared plus 1 can you and this happens a lot when you have something over a variable squared plus a constant can you make a common denominator can you combine this and simplify the denominator so try that try getting a common denominator here try combining and then splitting up that square root for the numerator and denominator on the numerator we just get 4 plus B squared over B squared and that happens a lot when you have constant over variable squared plus constant you'll get a common denominator you'll go ahead and add the numerators but your denominator is a square I have a square root if you split that square root up square roots and exponent exponents distribute across operations that are right below them so multiplication and division so our our square root distributes to the numerator and the denominator but when we do the denominator the square root of B squared is just V oh man that looks so much better that's something that we can do as a separable equation with separate variables these on one side DV 1 over X on the other side DX I'm going too fast for you if I am slow down the video that's a joke but I'm kind of taking for granted that you you at this point understand we're reciprocating understand we're reciprocate understand we can feed VN DX because it's a separable equation to spent just tons of time on that and then the integration techniques I slowed down for so when we integrate both sides right hand side just super easy left hand side some of you are gonna really really want to make this a trick so because it looks like that form don't do that all right try easier stuff before harder stuff so when you look at it is it basic no can you separate the fractions and make it basic no is this substitution yes that's how you should go through your integrals don't automatically jump to it's gotta be partial fractions with the trig so whoa can you come crazy don't do that all right do something easier versus harder sometimes we're forced to trig so yeah sometimes you're forced a partial fraction yeah but that those are last resorts try the easier stuff first here all this taste has a nice little view some you as V squared plus 4 do you is 2v DV divided by 2 and then we got it we got a nice integral we're gonna have 1 over the square root of U so we'll write that as u to the one-half so you was V squared plus 4 square root of u there's a u to the one-half and then D u over 2 if we write this appropriately we'd have a 1/2 so that's the D over 2 is pulled in 1/2 out we got an integral we get U to the negative 1/2 D U and we do a basic and go of that that's kind of nice so let's keep our 1/2 let's do you to know that see we add 1 divide by the new exponent 1/2 and 1/2 gone right hand side get Ln absolute value of X plus C let's put our view back so ru was V squared plus 4 we know that C the one-half power things we can do well we could probably write that as a square root Finley so square root of B squared plus 4 let's try to solve for B as much as possible we could square both sides looks okay to me let's subtract 4 and now we're about as good as we can get before we start plugging back in that Y over X V is y over X so we use that that V twice 1 to get away from wise want to get back to why it just is always in conjunction to whatever X so this will be y squared over x squared I hope you see why if you don't see why I'm just but I hope you see the the reason of okay the reason why we have the square we're squaring V and so we're squaring Y and we're squaring X on the right hand side that things change maybe we just multiplied by x squared to call it good so x squared times ln f of x plus c squared minus 4x squared and that's about it you could see a different form sometimes we get that people would add back the 4x squared will not even move in the first place I like that one but sometimes you'll get this where they say I'd prefer to have that on one side it's implicit anyway so why not put them together avoid the minus sign either way is is really fine so that's about it for that problem we're gonna move on got two more to do they're gonna be some of them are Perdition these last two are the roughest ones you're gonna see so I'm going to show you those techniques they most partial fractions with the integrals we see that again so hang on formed all right let's get going on this I'm going to show you how to do this as a homogeneous equation there's gonna be some rough parts in this some things like whoa I forgot you can do that with integrals and that's how we're doing these problems of course it's pretty easy right now the destructure these is y over X everywhere and do your substitution but I'm doing these examples because the integration techniques and them needs some refreshing sometimes you're just gonna be missing that so that's what we're going through just lots of practice if you don't need it fine move on to the next video when we talk about different technique but for right now this this is kind of this is kind of nice to be able to get through these and see exactly what's going on so number one does it look like a difference equation yeah don't look like a basic one no can we do a substitution we're gonna try let's try to do this with a homogeneous equation so let's go ahead let's get everything on one side don't divide by Y first subtract 2x first we can do that okay now we get a solve for dy/dx that's how the structure of homogeneous equations work so let's divide my line now we got a couple things going on we've seen this at least two times before we're gonna take this and go well let's make that into one big square root we need the square root of Y squared so we're gonna do that but also we don't really want X over Y we want Y over X so in doing that we change the sign of our exponent reciprocate the fraction change the sign of yourn exponent plus but then we're going to get a big square root with x squared plus y squared see if I can do this for you all over Y squared if this piece of the square root of Y squared then we have a giant square root of the same numerator divided by y squared because it's now inside the square root let's simplify that so negative negative Y over X where X negative 1 power cool plus big that square root we have x squared over Y squared plus 1 or separate the fractions x squared rights are great plus y squared Y squared that's 1 no problem what else can we do that doesn't look great does it let's fix it if we had x over so this piece x over y squared that's what that is that's X over Y squared but it doesn't fit what we want we want Y over X let's reciprocate it it will change the sign of our exponent so expert over Y squared x over y quantity squared Y over X to the negative 2 power even though that looks really nasty that's what we can start substituting so we know that every instance of Y is now over X we know that we can put v equals y over X we know that if we solve for y dydx is going to be x times DV DX plus B not a problem and now we can make our substitution you should be trying that right now see if you can substitute from here do your X DV Plus DV DX plus B and then V 2 negative 1 with e to the negative 2 Plus once you can do that okay so dy/dx not anymore negative x my rights negative 1 no negative V to the negative 1 plus square root of Y Direction a to know V today 2 plus 1 stagette plus 1 it's exhausting let's go ahead and try to simplify some of this maybe make it a little bit better so X DV DX no problem that looks ok let's subtract this so let's subtract V that'll be negative V now I'm gonna do it two steps that was easy let's simplify this first so negative V of negative 1 that's negative 1 over V let's write that as a fraction plus big square root V to the negative 2 is 1 over V squared plus 1 so this side says saying this is 1 over V but negative this is one of V squared plus 1 we're gonna do two things I'm now gonna subtract V on both sides it has no like terms right now I'm going to make this a common denominator so I'm going to do that first so the end of this I'll have plus C 1 plus V squared over B squared you should be trying down here so 1 over V squared plus 1 1 over V squared plus V squared over V squared 1 plus B squared over B squared I'd have a minus 1 over V if I subtract V I've got a negative V and that's X DV DX so X DV DX got it subtract V here's my minus V I've got my - gonna repeat okay get my plus I get my square root that I'm trying to simplify that a little bit now let's simplify this so we're gonna keep the square root of the numerator by the square root of the denominator simplifies oh my gosh let's create lots of algebra right rides a fraction or as a fraction common denominator simplifying this stayed the same all the way through subtract V we got a remind of speed now in order for this to be a separable equation in separate variables we've got to have one fraction so even though it's nasty we're gonna have to get a common denominator this already has on V and V which is by simplified this needs it so it's just a matter of multiplying by V so let's think about that this should be V squared over V so negative B squared over V we're basically just taking this and multiplying by V over V so negative V squared over V minus one over me plus square root of b squared plus 1 over v let's put all of that on one fraction so X DV DX it's gigantic fraction all over thee then on the numerator we have negative B squared minus 1 plus square root of b squared plus 1 I'm gonna write that just slightly differently before we start making this into the separation of variables idea I'm gonna write my square root first and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to write V squared minus 1 but I'm gonna factor out the negative and here's why I'm doing that if I have V squared plus 1 and I can make this look like v squared plus 1 by the factor not a negative maybe a substitution will work when we integrate so the factor the negative it's changing to be square plus one if you distribute you see minus B squared minus one same thing that looks crazy let's go ahead let's separate the variables it's put these on one side so we know about reciprocal we know about the DV we know about dividing by X we know about moving over our DX let's pause for just a minute that's gonna be yep can you do homogenius yep let's see take a lot of work so divide everything by line notice on the Y over actually gotta have that en our Y over X make a square root simplify okay we can do that do our substitution as soon as you have Liza wretches make those all these make this into X DV DX plus mu okay got that but we know that we need to get all of our piece together simplify your French and get a comment another simplify our square root move over our V okay we can do that make one fraction you comment on that we can do that let's make another form where maybe the inside of our square root is the same as something else that helps us with a substitution and now we're ready for an integral so when we integrate both sides right side super piece of cake easy left side you might be struggling with that one for a while because you go hi man I'd love to do a substitution but especially generally this thank you you imagine like if you had that you know what's my substitution night I don't know what that is but if you structure it like this you know what's my substitution I don't know but maybe I try the thing that's the same maybe I tried doing u equals B squared plus one well the derivative would be two VD bye / - at least I have this piece and what that would change - is well let's see an integral of square root of U that's a bug list you never square root of U - you because they're both the same thing and that was what that one I keys here is like what else was do if those are the same call them both you on the numerator you only get one because that V DV is all wrapped up in D u / - now I'm going to take just a moment because this is also not a basic integral so you can't just separate those fractions so I'm gonna take a self to the side I'm going to do the integration I'm going to show you exactly how to do it and then we'll go through and and every do this so what could we do maybe we factor out the square root of you see if that helps us there's probably another thing 'king of another way to do it right now that might be okay also but I don't want to go through it with your both ways so I'm gonna factor out the time and force it to factor out square root of u so notice what we have here if we factor out the square root of u we're going to get square root of u times one get to square u square root of u times fur do you give us back you and then we have a 1/2 and float that out front I'll be start with Milnes now at this point we're going to need another substitution so if we do that pick a different variable like W let's call W equal to u to the one-half well if we do that when we take a derivative we bring down the exponent we have U to the negative 1/2 so 1/2 u to the negative 1/2 let's solve for that DUI well let's solve for D u let's do it that way so if we do that x to do you see it DC that is this is in our integral right there here's the one overskirt of you here's the D you this whole piece is right there so when we do this substitution if we get the one half we get the one we get the this is no longer there this this and this is all wrapped up in 2d W what we have is oh you know what let me change it to produce - sorry one with one things let's do that let's change it to that because all it would happen is negative negative negative negative and then we'd wrap this whole thing up as just a W so let's say W is this whole piece that look that works even better then we take a derivative of that we go okay well it's still it's the ones gone that's fantastic so it's still negative one-half this U to the negative one-half power so we'd have u to the one-half we bring that down negative one half subtract one we got it we're still solving for that D u over one half power so multiply by negative two we got that u / sort of 1 over u the one half D you know problem that's still negative to DW is 1 over square root of u that's here right there it's just now we have over W and that's fantastic so that's pretty cool because now we see that our twos are gone if we get negative integral 1 over W DW that equals negative now an absolute value W that's just the left side and then we're gonna have to go back and reset the two so I'm going to erase part of this board I'm going to come back and do that just a little recap that we had here try to make these the same that way your substitution works ok so we got that we can do our substitution when we get down to here factor because then if we call this a different variant of another substitution if this is W derivative of 1 is 0 derivative of this is negative 1 now 2 to the negative 1/2 that's negative 2 DW equals 1 over you've the 1/2 this is whatever you the 1/2 let me just put our negative 2 up there I'm gonna come back and do the rest of it just just a minute so I'm gonna race a bit a bit of the board we're about doing on this crazy thing so we have erased most of it where we started we've already gone and gone through that so now we got down to the very end we thought man this this integral looks nuts let's make it so that we can do one substitution but that led to uh well be forced to sing the factor we can do another substitution choose this to be W derivative of W gives you negative 1/2 of U to the negative 1/2 let's solve that for this negative 2 DW equals 1 over the square root of u 2 u 1 of the square root of u D u this piece is negative 2 DW no problem this whole thing was called W we got the negative 2 O to cancel to get negative integral 1 over W DW and we know that that equals negative Ln absolute value W so right hand side super easy Ln X plus C but now we've got to go back so W was 1 minus the square root of U let's do that so w1 my square root of you got that but view you was V squared plus one let's put that in there now before we start going and plugging in for V let's get as close to solving for V as we can one thing we might want to do is remove that negative so multiply everything by negative here let's call that C sub 1 because we're certainly gonna be changing that when we do these as Exponential's other thing we might want to do before we get there maybe move this negative up here so element absolute value 1 minus square root of b squared plus 1 and that's a guy equals Ln of well X to the negative 1 power of the absolute value of 1 over X minus C sub 1 now let's take both of these as exponents on e remember we do with those exponents if they're added or subtracted they came from common bases being multiplied so we can look at this as absolute value of 1 minus square root of e squared plus 1 right hand side would be 1 over X times not - times e to the negative C sub one now let's wrap up the absolute values in the plus and minus so let's drop the absolute value get 1 minus square root of b squared plus 1 equals plus or minus e to the negative C sub 1 times 1 over X let's call this thing C it is a constant it's an arbitrary constant so 1 minus square root of b squared plus 1 on the homestretch here C over X what we do from there the only thing that you really have to do is substitute in for your V you got to have Y square root of x squared here so let's try that if we do we might want to simplify this we've seen this a few times now let's get a common denominator so 1 is x squared over x squared so Y squared over x squared plus x squared over x squared that gives us Y square plus x squared over x squared that equals C over X and then because that's in a square root because the denominator is a perfect power of all perfect squares x squared we can simplify the denominator so 1 minus square root of Y squared plus x squared all over maximum be some elaborate doing that is because when we multiply both sides by X well we can simplify and we can get this whole distribute X minus if you distribute this that X can cancel square root of Y squared or plus x squared equals C and that's about the best that we can do on that one so from here simplify your French just some algebra multiply both sides by X this X going this X go on this is multiplied by X that's about it that's a nasty problem so that's about as much as I can show you on that one what we're gonna do this we're gonna do one less problem it's gonna involve some some partial fractions I want to give that to you and then we'll call it good let's wrap up this video with one last example one that involves a lot of different algebra techniques and Gration techniques not so much as far as it's in it so we're going to show that this is a homogeneous equation whenever the proper form we're gonna make our substitution we're going to see some special integration so some things that we sometimes forget about so number one differential equation yeah normal stuff not really let's try homogeneous let's divide both sides by x squared minus y squared let's get the dy dy DX by itself now with our goal to be achieving this Y over X look for every single term of Y we're gonna need to divide by something so both the numerator denominator but let's make something smart so instead of dividing by something random like x times y or something like that let's divide everything by something that will not only get rid of not only putting Y over X but also get rid of all the x's like next to those those Y's so something kind of nice otherwise we mess around with simplifying these things so instead of just dividing everything by x times y which is what this is to try to get that to to be 2/1 and getting everything down here let's divide everything by x squared if we divide everything by x squared and this is what's really driving this if I want Y over X I have Y squared let's divide by x squared to get Y over x quantity squared so look at it here and doing that what's nice about it is that when we divide everything by x squared well we end up getting two XY over x squared all over x squared over x squared minus y squared over x squared and lots of nice things simplify on the numerator we get just two and then ok we get that X x squared simplify we just get Y over X I love that that's already the form that I want to put in parentheses I don't know that's gonna be V on the denominator x squared of x squared is 1 that's perfect y squared over x squared is y over 1 over x quantity squared that's exactly what we're looking for so by putting this in the proper form of solving for D by DX we just pick some nice thing some nice divisor that we can put in there to simplify parts of our terms to get this Y or X however we can do that now we're ready now we're ready to say let's let V equal Y over X Y therefore equals V X and dy DX is x times DV DX plus B let's change us that's substitute let's make this equal to this let's do every Y over x equals to V so we're going to get this X DV DX plus V equals on the right hand side we've got two V and not to me well I'm minus B squared um what's the next step do you think well I would probably just subtract V and now I'm gonna try to do separable equations here so one game IVs all group together so if we do that we get X DV DX on the right hand side 2 V over 1 minus B squared but then we have this minus V okay well probably going to want to make a common denominator so that will give us X DV DX then we got this to be I'm never going to distribute that until I make one fraction I do not want to mess up those signs okay I'm gonna do I'm gonna distribute now so - V - V Plus V to the third power to be guide minus V got it plus b cubed all over one minus B squared I'm gonna combine some like terms I don't have any other X cube sorry beacuse but I do have another V so V cubed plus 2 V - V is one being over the other thing I'm gonna do I don't like the way that that denominator looks so I'm gonna factor out a negative so if I do that I'm gonna get negative 1 plus B squared or B squared - 1 the reason why is our game accrual is gonna work a little bit better that way I always like to put things in order with the first term positive we can it makes things a little bit nicer and now we have it we've got this fraction that includes all of our B's this term X we now can separate our equations there's separate variables so on the left hand side we have a reciprocal what we got v squared - 1 we've got a v cubed + b we've got a DV on the right hand side we keep our constants or our signs we have 1 over X DX man-ho that's making sense you reciprocate keep our sign over here keep our 1 over X give it that over there get our DX over there keep our DV now we're ready to do an integral well we're gonna rewrite this a little bit here's the reason why we're gonna do that let me take a look at this and go how in the world am I going to do that let's run it through does it look like you can just separate the fractions no because your denominator has two terms does it look like we can do a basic substitution you kind of want to don't you you want to say hey use this but then you get three u squared plus one that's no way we can match that up so not that can you do tricks oh no really can you do a double substitution doesn't look like it either when you get something like this and none of those are the techniques work this is where you're gonna want to use partial fractions so we're gonna explore that for a little bit so partial fractions say you need to factor your denominator that's what it's all about some factor your denominator if we factor out me our GCF they'll be factored out BT we have V squared minus one over V times V squared plus one we are gonna make these partial fractions so here's how that looks if you don't remember that so this is a big thing for us happens quite a bit and count two happens here not as often but occasionally it's all about the set up with these partial fractions was here's what you need to know on your denominator you're gonna factor everything now all polynomials can be factored into linear or irreducible quadratic factors for every linear there's a power one you're going to get a constant over the linear so it's always one less degree on the numerator so for this me you're going to create a fraction for every factor factors equal fractions so we have two factors maybe we got a V squared plus one those go on the two denominators no problem it is we're kind of undoing the idea of a common tract common denominator so we're gonna kind of use that in just a bit to break these up so whatever your factor is look at your degree if your degree is one your numerator has to be one degree less than that well what's a degree less than one zero that's no X's there's no V's that's a constant look at your irreducible quadratic you can't factor anymore so irreducible code for quadratic has power - well what's one less than R to power one power one X to the first power oh that's a linear partial fractions work you go ahead you need a factor denominator make a fraction for every factor look at your degree your numerator is one degree less than that so for linear you need constants I already have irreducible quadratics you get Linear's however many you have now the idea is you need a common denominator so if I could make these denominators equal to this denominator my numerators will have to be equal what that comes down to is since these don't share common factors I know that my common denominator would take 8 times this denominator B squared was one of these for this one BX plus C times this denominator V over V that would give me the common denominator I'm looking for so most of the time we just see it this way but the reason why it works is because what you're really doing in practice is you're creating a common denominator on these two fractions and you're saying hey since this denominator any times V squared + 1 or V times of each of us 1 plus BX plus C times B over B times B squared plus 1 since you have the common denominator here if these if this is an equation and your denominators are the same notice how on this numerator you get this thing on this numerator you'd get this thing by common denominator if your denominators are equal a fraction your numerators have to go on a fraction also so we say ok just as equal this is like that hey do partial fractions cut to this is what you have why because you're just making a common denominator that's it now let's use some of our logic here so if we were to distribute this you know what I made a mistake I'm sorry I'm so used to X's you probably heard me say X subconsciously it should be these that this should be obvious at this point so yeah V squared plus one the V plus C over V squared plus one I'm sorry about the ex probably gonna happen so multiply B squared plus 1 multiply being sure our numerators are now equal so this numerator with a times common denominator be V Plus C common denominator and now when we distribute now when we distribute we have a B squared plus pay okay be V squared + C V let's group these things together so I know that V squared minus 1 I have a V squared plus B squared if i factor out the V squared from that then these two terms make a plus B B squared plus C V Plus a and match that up with the terms over here so this is an equation this is the only possible thing they could give you B squared that means that a plus B has to equal your coefficient here that's all determines B squared so a plus B it has to equal one this is the only term that has to be there are no terms of have V so C can't be any number of a zero a is the only constant negative ones the only constant so a has to be negative one but you know that then that tracking negative one plus B would have equal one - so we've gone ahead and said all right so that integral now changes to this pair of fractions so instead of having d squared minus 1 over B times V squared plus 1 we know that this is going to be a over B so negative 1 over B that's our a over B plus sign BV so - V plus C plus C is 0 that's fantastic over B squared plus 1 over B negative 1 over V be B plus C over B squared plus 1/2 V plus 0 over B squared plus 1 I'm gonna race this side we're gonna come back over here we're going to finish that up and wrong some other problem that was kind of the biggest main idea here is that partial fractions are still in play I'm careful with them alright so coming back to finish off our problem now that we had our partial fractions we've determined that this integrals separates into two fractions now we just have these two different integrals here pretty basic negative Ln absolute value of E we can do that this guy over here well that's a u sub so the derivative of v squared plus 1 is 2 means we know that we can do that so let's do it pretty quickly that's invest nice I mean that's just straight-up exactly what we got right there so V squared plus 1 equals to V DV that means that we have well the integral of negative 1 over V DV plus the integral of this is all wrapped up in one we have u D you because 2v DV is to you that's nice on the right-hand side let's just leave that integral for just a moment longer than we do them all the same time so right here we're gonna have negative Ln absolute value V done plus Ln absolute value you will come back and substitute that for V in a moment equals negative Ln absolute value of X got it plus c1 because we're probably gonna have some exponential up here let's go ahead we know that U is V squared plus one I'm gonna drop the absolute value since that's always positive anyway now let's start working on some other things let's um you know what since there's two negatives here let's just multiply everything by negative let's also use some of our techniques of logarithms since we have logarithm minus logarithm we can combine those as natural log of that fraction [Music] now let's do the exponential soap well take both of these are the power of you've done this many times before we're gonna get the V over V squared plus 1 equals e to the Ln absolute value of x is absolutely of X but we'll get times e to the negative C sub 1 X course being added or subtracted comes from common basis being multiplied let's wrap up the absolute value in a plus registration breath up the x value no plus or minus e to the negative C sub 1 times X that's C Wow almost done there's only one more thing we've got to do we've got to change our V back into Y over X so every place we see V we get Y over X just like every place we saw wire X we got a B so we get this complex fraction if you've ever had an intermediate algebra class you like why in the world do we never deal with complex fractions I don't even said it just like that then maybe right there because it happens quite a bit so let's multiply everything by the common denominator both sides both top and bottom everything by the LCD of x squared so we multiply by I'm sorry on this side my top and bottom by x squared not that not the right hand side of the spoke there so on the top we're going to get this x squared over X that's going to simplify that's going to give us x times y on the denominator remember that this distributes so when we distribute we'll get y squared plus x squared equals C times X Oh what else do I want to do oh that's nice look at this if we consider this to be not next time well alright again not next times y of x times y over y squared plus x squared if X is not equal to 0 we can divide both sides by X or think about it I multiply X to the negative one and then last thing let's just multiply both sides by y squared plus x squared that's about as pretty as we can make it so gear were divided by X that's gone provided X is not 0 and then we're going to go so that's it that's that's how to solve these homogeneous equations we always make sure that we have Y over X we always change that into V for every instance of Y all the Y's have to be revved up we always solve for y for a derivative and then dy/dx is always the same thing then we're trying to usually make these an acceptable equation some of our other techniques deal with linear which is why I had to kind of think that is it separable is it linear is it basic integration because other techniques we'll go more towards those ideas like linear and and basic integration so we'll see that in other videos right now I hope I've done a good job of explaining how to work with these homogeneous equations and why it works with our substitution technique so I'll see you for a couple of the videos we have several more substitution techniques to learn so exciting times everything we learn makes it a little bit nicer to deal with differential equations okay back to domain and I just want you thinking about some issues that's happening when you are making these differential equations fit the technique you're trying to and so I'm always going to try to put this back in your head for you so let's look back at some examples these were meant almost all of the examples that we just did in this video but let's look back at what happened when we tried to put these into proper form for a homogeneous equation number one well if you're gonna divide by something that's they cannot be 0 so when you're dividing by X plus y we go ok then X plus y put the condition somewhere in your problem that says when I'm doing this to make this fit because I have to I'm understanding I'm doing this with the condition that X plus y cannot be equal to 0 this is saying I gotta do it solve it but I can't let this happen because that that would break over to me we'd have something that's undefined this can't happen so is it okay to put conditions on your domain when you're solving these yes because we have to in order to use this this certain technique so whatever you're doing to modify your original differential equation if you're dividing my variables just make sure those that expression that you're dividing by cannot equal 0 now furthermore because we're trying to make this homogeneous at some point we're going to be dividing by X so that X also can't equal 0 just be careful of those things when you're when you're going through these maybe you can look at the next few examples and just quickly identify what's what's going on so down here yeah we're we're dividing look at your denominator just make sure every factor cannot equal 0 X can't equal 0 X plus y again can't equal 0 so when you're seeing a lot of these restrictions like what is coming from those are those are coming from two two places typically number one is that you have your modifying your differential equation to make it that some technique here it's homogeneous and so we're dividing and then we're also dividing something by X and so that that X can never be 0 with linear we were also doing something with an integrating factor so that that came about as well as far as a domain restriction how about the next one Matt we don't have to do anything to see what's going to happen here you look right there at that fraction you go hey X can't be 0 and by defining that you get 2 divided by x squared without any additional constrict restrictions because you already did that so that that's the idea just be thinking through if I'm dividing if I have fractions my tan there cannot be zero for this homogeneous equations we we're not super concerned about being greater than zero because of some reason they explained in the last video that well with your homogeneous they're always separable we're typically getting an e to a C and we can put the plus and minus from the absolute value in front wrap the L open a big constant or what we can do is is notice that the absolute values oftentimes contained in another function that we wouldn't be able to simplify or combine our X's with anyhow so we're not very much worried about that like we were linear this over the last less three you're obviously going to be divided by X Y so neither X or Y can equal zero by the zero product property if either one of those a zero the denominator zero so just show those restrictions or just when we're modifying our differential equations sometimes we're doing things that could cause us problems if we're not saying what we can't have it's a weird way to say but you're going yeah I obviously obviously can't can't have X or Y be 0 and and for the reason that this is obvious to a lot of people some some books a lot of them and some teachers a lot of them don't even talk about it because that frankly they are a little obvious when you but you need to see them for one time for them to be obvious to you go ok any sense I can 0 okay that makes sense I can 0 here now we should always write that and it's a it's kind of a failing of our textbooks and some of these teachers have been and myself because I was focused only on on the technique at first I did that for a reason I wanted you to master the technique get that in your head and then realize that this stuff is happening when we master the technique first then we can go through and get the finer points otherwise we would try to get the finer points as we're learning a technique for a lot of students not everybody but for a lot of students that's hard because it feels like the lectures being broken up and so we match their technique but these things are also important we need to understand that when we modify a differential equation that some problems can be occurring in the domain we had to show that those problems are why don't you look at the last two and see what you do with that obviously we're dividing dividing x squared minus y squared what's that what can't that be Chile is that lastly because we're gonna be dividing everything by x squared next like we did in that example okay well if x squared can't equal 0 X can't equal 0 and so we're showing the conditions that we need in order to use our technique it's all we're doing okay last one I say this one for less because this is interesting it's it's kind of it's really clear to most people that well I mean you're divided by y y can't equal 0 if I need the homogeneous form of this then when I reciprocate this to get my negative exponent X can't equal 0 but why in the world would they have y greater than 0 and as for what you have to do to simplify this so right down here man toughest and calc align remember it vividly because it's in limits and when I when I'm teaching it it's really kind of awkward because you need to look at why are your limits going and then say can I just write y equals the square root of Y squared yes and no yes that's true but because that square takes any negative why's it makes them positive we have to look back at what the definition of the square root of Y squared is really within even radical when you match a power root and you simplify it that radicals even you actually get this you get the absolute value of y that's the definition of the square root of Y squared you're going to get the absolute value of y so it depends on what Y is now obviously that's going to be positive no matter what but we have to show that Y is greater than 0 in order to avoid the absolute value and back in limits it was this ok well where are we going to positive infinity or negative infinity and that let me choose whether we would have positive Y or negative Y there and that that was the whole the whole case so thinking okay I need this to be in that square room I gotta have a square root around let's just make it square root Y squared great but to avoid the absolute value are you guys understanding like the kind of theme here to avoid the absolute value just like in linear to avoid the absolute value just like we did with the integrating factor to avoid the absolute value man just do this make it greater than zero then you're dividing by something that's not zero and when you're using these techniques simplify what are using techniques for the integrating factor you're avoiding the absolute value saves a lot of headache later with simplifying everything else because some of our wise would have an absolute value if we did do that and some of our wise wouldn't that would be in the scene so I hope that you're understanding that that we when we're doing these things were we're restricting some of our domains just to make our technique work there's only one more video I'm going to do this on for a while so hopefully this is helping you understand some of the finer points so when we're going through this you
