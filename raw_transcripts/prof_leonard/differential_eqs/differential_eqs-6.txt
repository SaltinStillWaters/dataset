Transcript for: Solving Basic Differential Equations with Integration (Differential Equations 6)
welcome to another video this one's kind of exciting because now we finally get to start solving differential equations on our own the path speed video is only really done is kind of identified what they are how they kind of relate real-life things and then how to check whether an equation is a solution but I never told you where the solutions came from we're gonna start right now and we're gonna start with the most basic of differential equations if you remember a differential equation is just an equation has a derivative of some function in the equation and some other some other junk sometimes the function itself sometimes second derivatives all sorts of things floating together our idea is to solve by finding the equation that satisfies the difference of the equation so and then that's generally the family of curves we're going to talk about that right now so the most basic case that we can have in difference of equations is when we have a differential equation with a derivative and just a function of X so this is a differential equation that's your derivative a derivative of Y with respect to X or independent variable equals some function of X and here's the key with no lies so no to know Y itself no function of Y I know first derivative know second derivative just the derivative isolated on one side and a function of X on the other side if you have this situation for if you can make this situation you manipulate your problem a little bit these are the most basic types of differential equations in fact pretty much all of calculus 2 is based on this idea so every time you did a an integral in difference within calculus 2 you were kind of treating it like a differential equation in a sense because that's exactly how we solve it if you just have a derivative of the function you're trying to find and it's people to some function of X and otherwise in there well then we know a little something about derivatives we know that if we do an integral and integral will undo a derivative and that's how these most basic differential equations are solved let's show you a little bit of math behind it and then we're gonna I'll show you what that these can be done that way so we have a derivative equals function of expertise the riveting function of X no iess derivative function of X no wise derivative function of X no Wiese same thing for the last two driven up on one side function of X on the other side with no why's know why primes no no double life second derivatives just an isolated derivative and a function of X so what I mean by why integrals work so well for this we're gonna see some funny math if you remember where a derivative comes from it's this idea that Y is changing as X is changing and this this distance that you're changing it's really really little calculus one teaches us that that limit of get really really really really really really really close to something else is this idea of a limit well these come from a delta Y and a delta X and the way that you start with with your derivatives is that Delta X is actually on the other side from a Delta Y because of that idea we can move this around it looks really weird but we can actually write this worse dy ever we could write that as dy equals f of X DX we can treat them like they're separable like that DeWine that DX are just pieces that we move around they come from the fact that we have the Delta X Delta Y in our limit we take the limit as as well do you know what we take is we take that limit and the the Delta X's get really really really really little we call that the differential so we're going to talk about different differential forms of differential equations much later but we need to know that we can move around dy the exits we can separate those things now because we have this idea of an equation whatever you want to an equation as long as you do to both sides we can actually take an integral of both sides so if you take an integral of dy well think of that as 1 dy take an integral of 1 dy n cdy Specter what you're gonna get why take an integral of f of X remember this has no y so this is solely based on X which is why this works why it's so simple why chemicals work is because you're able to separate the dy and the DX on the right on the left hand side integral of dy gives you Y on the right hand side integral of f of X because that has no lies in it because it has no second derivatives first derivatives nothing nothing like that this is typically if it's even if it's possible it's a basic integral of f of X so straight out account to and I've chosen some probs up here that's going to help you remember some of the techniques about calculus too so we're gonna have some integration by parts substitution some tricks and stuff like that just to give our brains wrapped around it this is more practice than anything because that is very basic that is if you have a derivative and a function of X with no Y's separate the DX into an integral that's that's practically and if you get that you're gonna be fine so let's let's do it the integral of f of X well you get some antiderivative there well what you're also going to get you remember this because you're teaching Yeley every time they didn't do it you get a plus seems and a lot of time talking about that plus seen we talked about how that plus C creates this general solution it's an arbitrary constant and it creates a family of curves each of which is going to satisfy this if you take a derivative of this right here you're going to get the derivative of Y with respect to X is equal to well the derivative of antiderivative obviously but then the constant that's a constant is going to go to 0 it's going to give you back that for any choice of C that we have that's a constant that's the arbitrary constant idea this is a family of curves and what's interesting about this is that what these create are this family of curves that are in a sense parallel parallel and then they don't intersect think about this for a minute let's see if you add that on to the end of a function all it creates is this vertical shift up or down on the y-axis it's not moving so not living - right it's just shifting it around same exact curve it's just one right and think of a parabola one right on top of another right on top of another right on top of another they're never going to intersect so we're going to talk a little bit about this after we do these problems just to get practice about the difference between a general solution this and the difference if you have one initial value because what's gonna happen I'll preview I don't like suspense in math you need to know what's gonna happen if you have derivative filling to dimensionalize take an integral both sides you're going to get a Y and you're gonna get an antiderivative of the right-hand side user whatever technique you can from calc 1 or calc 2 what you end up getting is a family of curves we call that family of curves the general solution it's got an arbitrary concept could be any number whatever but it is constant if we want to narrow it down here's the the key for a particular solution if we want to narrow it down we need just one point why do we need just one point well to think about this if these are all parallel curves in a sense that they don't intersect then only one of them is going to go through any one distinct point because if they don't intersect they never share any common points think about that so if I give you a point say hey I want the one who goes to this there's only gonna be one curve that satisfies that in this type of a difference in the equation of this type of the solution that's what narrows down our family of curves into a particular to say here's all of our parallel curves I want the one that goes through that point okay that's going to create one particular solution so we're gonna do that just a little bit so let's start with doing some examples I'm gonna erase the board we should have this idea down the idea is if you have a derivative equal to a function of X no lies in it we're just going to move our DX and do an integral that's it make sure you get a plus C that's your general solution so we're gonna do these five examples on the board again that there's our different techniques and then it's the sewing practice and then I'm gonna start putting up those initial conditions all right so here we go so I've rewritten the problems the same ones we had in the board just a minute ago let's go ahead and go through all the the ideas of we can still take integrals there's some taken have played five different techniques up here for you so that we're just kind of getting our brains wrapped around it and then we'll talk about the initial conditions so let's make sure that they fit before we do every one of them in every case we have a derivative of Y with respect to X equal to a function of what we're taking the derivative Y with respect to so here's the derivative of Y there's an independent variable and this is a function in just the independent variable that isn't necessary for this technique to work if you have any wise floating around over here if you have any second derivatives or other derivatives in there this is not the right technique to use we're going to deal with a lot of different techniques but this is a very very basic one you get a derivative on one side function of X or the function of independent variable on the other side that's it so what we're going to do number case is we're going to move that DX you don't you don't really have to there there is a way to think about it if you wanted to right now take an integral with a DX on both sides but then understand that because that comes with a delta X idea it's getting closer to that Delta X changes exit getting closer to zero but never becomes zero it's okay to cancel that out so you can actually do that most people do not do that so most people think about this as well that's a little bit weird to think of the math is kind of kind of funny on that but if we do just move the DX which is possible then we can take the idea of an integral on both sides so this idea that hey just take an integral on both sides okay and if we do that on the left hand side it's really nice because you just have the integral of dy or the integral of 1 dy it really dy it's going to give you back about Y function that you're looking for a differential equation on the right hand side this is where all of your work is gonna come in with this technique you still need to know how to do to do integrals you still need to know some basic substitution techniques or your table of integrals it's really helpful here at this point in your math careers I now know who your teacher is or even if you even have a teacher if you just learn this for fun or whatever may be a part of your job or relearning it because you've been out of school for a while that's fine but most most instructors most professors really don't care super much about seeing the hardcore work on your techniques of integration they can't understand the idea so whether you're finding the answer from a table of integration or you're crunching it all out doesn't matter it really smoke for most of us it really doesn't matter the idea behind it's more important so on some of these you go man that that's a that's a substitution yeah you're right that looks like 10 inverse because table of integration sure that looks like well whatever that's going to be because of table integration or trig so it doesn't really matter anymore so use what's easiest to you to get the job done for integrals this one you could use a u substitution and do u equals X minus 2 but because the derivative of that X minus 2 is just 1 man we can just treat this like it's one variable and just do the integral like we normally would so imagine this is just u we would add 1 to the exponent that's 3 divided by the new exponent so 1/3 bunch of crap in here squared the the derivative of this is 1 which is why it works otherwise we would start dividing by the derivative there and the biggest part about it what we're just talking about is this is going to create a family of curves by that plus C these are all parallel none of them intercept if you start adding different values of C they're all stacked right on top of one another and it's a family of curves each of which satisfies our original differential equation but you kind of messed up there I want to write that back so you see what we started with because it says this here's a function that if you take a derivative of it the derivative of this function is going to be that and that's true that's the solution to a differential equation let's do the next one so on the next one we still have a derivative equals a function of X no lies no nothing pretty basic so we're going to do two things so we're gonna move the DX over we're gonna take an integral I like to show this in two steps and most of the time you really don't have to so if you move this over you go okay that's a dy equals x square root of x plus nine DX and you go that's let's do an integral of both sides we just put that right out front that's fine if you that now on the left hand side this is this is great this is just gonna be Y on the right hand side we'll have to have something else this looks like au sub to me so if I take this as my U then D u equals 2x DX I've shown several techniques throughout the 14 years I've been teaching this stuff about how to do this with basic calculus so whether you're of my school where you like to solve for DX and then substitute in cancel the X's or whether you what most will do is they will just solve for the pieces that show up here so the twos not in those pieces move the two then replace the X and the DX with just that little piece so here's our square root of you will call that u to the one-half we know that X DX is de over two so when we do our integral we've got this hey let's add one to the exponent that's going to give us three-halves over three-halves but we had this one half four right here well that's going to be one of these chains are gone we have y equals one-third let's put our you back in there x squared plus nine but analysis to the three halves power and then once C is ultimately extremely important for us without that plus C an initial value can't be used because there's nothing there's nothing to plug in to test that that well to find out what that value of C would be so if you don't have a plus C how you gonna find that doesn't make sense so you have to add the also can you check your work obviously we should be able to check our work here if you take a derivative well three halves times one-third that's gonna be that that one half thing a little house that one happen disappeared three half times one third gives you one-half x squared plus nine is gonna stay to the one half power but then the derivative and the inside is 2x the one-half and that two are gone you're left with an X square root or a one-half power x squared plus nine and a plus T would disappear also so that does work that's a general solution you check you with the derivative okay next one this one looks a little bit hard at first to Alex I don't see a use of your right you don't but don't forget that there's a lot of techniques and calculus to if we just isolate that D wide and we take our integral after that we had a function a derivative of y equal a function of X we do our integrals on the left hand side the integral of dy is just Y on the right hand side ten tens a constant it has no bearing on the immigration just pull it out or leave it on numerator if you want to or leave it on on the outside is it's a matter it's a constant if we're gonna get ten but right now with that x squared plus one yeah you could use a trig soap but if it's one of those basic things it's kind of been drilled in your head oh man something over x squared plus one that's that's in a table here what would I do well it's ten inverse so if you have the table of integration or you've memorized some of this stuff don't be afraid to use that we do need a plus C on the back and if we take a derivative of that we do know that this the derivative of this is that thing so we're good to go next one well this is a little bit trickier you could use a table of integration for this we notice that it's a derivative it's equal to a function of X without Y's in there that's great if we separate out that DX gotta be a little bit more concise we notice that we can take an integral really nicely the integral of dy again is y on the right hand side the well that's that isn't a table of integration so if you want to look that up that's fine but if you don't remember it or if you just want practice like I do right now you could do it a trick set so we look at this and go that looks like a triangle okay that big triangle it's a square root the the math and side looks like a relationship between the sides of a right triangle I always set up my triangles exactly the same same orientation every single time now many of you if you didn't take me or you watch my videos go you can watch them right now it's in calculus too it's trig sub I want to say this in Chapter seven but I can't remember right now i I don't memorize this stuff what I do I've never memorized it what I do is I think through what would these sides have to be on a right triangle if you're subtracting then you're subtracting a smaller side from a bigger one and that's got to be the hypotenuse so one must be the hypotenuse x has to be another leg then so you're doing Pythagorean theorem you'd have a square root of one squared minus x squared is going to give you this side so this whole piece is going to be the side of this right triangle then the square root of this is a side and the square root of this is a side what we want to do is find the hypotenuse first because you're subtracting that's got to be bigger than that otherwise you would have a negative instead of a square root it wouldn't represent a right triangle so that has to be the hypotenuse this is going to be a leg somewhere because you're it the way the math looks is you take the hypotenuse minus another side that's going to be one of these legs so what we want to do is create a relationship where we have the hypotenuse correct but then we also have this idea where we don't want a square root inside of one of these three trig functions sine tangent or secant so right now I know that sine looks pretty good if I put an X right there but put an X there sine is x over 1 that's pretty nice this last side isn't used in any of the tricks up it's used to get back your X's at the very end so okay you know what in this relationship sine of theta equals x over 1 now if we're going to do us a substitution like that we need to know that because X is our independent variable we're dealing with the DX you need a DX substitution also that comes from a derivative here so sine theta equals x then take a derivative of both sides cosine theta equals DX that less a substitute so we've already done integral of dy its Y on the right hand side we still have an immigrant we still have a 1 you still have a square root we still have 1 over that square root we have 1 minus x is sine so we have this sine squared theta inside but DX I kind of forgot something here that I need is mimic Mitch it is when you do a derivative of sine theta equals x you're going to get cosine theta but I forgot my D theta now if that makes sense to you I'm going to show you something here if that makes sense to you like oh yeah it makes sense that D theta and DX are on opposite sides then what I showed you the very beginning should also make sense that you can move the DX because could you solve this for D theta DX yeah you could and you have a derivative of theta with respect to X it's the same exact idea it's just a little bit different a little bit different in how we structure the problem but not the ideas are the same so we had the X now we have this cosine theta D theta the reason why we use tange and sine and secant is because on that right triangle there's identities kind of built-in if you use the the sine the tangent of the secant they've worked out really nice for instance one minus sine squared theta is cosine squared theta so this guy this is cosine squared theta square root of cosine squared theta is cosine theta these are gone all we're going to have is y equals an integral of D theta or 1 D theta y equals theta let's see how in the world am I going to do that that's what our substitutions for if sine theta equals x then theta by definition has to equal sine inverse of X so what we have his wife will sign inverse of X plus C which is nice now the last one sometimes you run into stuff that you have a practice in a long time I'm gonna kind of repeat the idea these are old concept we've used them but if you've had calc 3 if you don't do a whole lot of this this last one in calc 3 sometimes you forget or you just it's not coming to mind so if you have something that you know you should be able to do with integral and you go well it doesn't look like when I've taken integral both sides a substitution right it's not it doesn't look like a trig so you definitely not it doesn't look like anything that is easy for us maybe you're dealing with the integration by parts and that's what we have here for integration two parts to use some people use limpid a way to think about through what you would take as your you what you would take is your V what you want is for the derivative to make it to become easier and for the integral of what's left over to be possible so when you're dealing with integration by parts one of the first things I'll do is I'll look at this and say I need one of these things that are connected by multiplication become you I mean that you'd be something I can take a derivative of and generally becomes easier typically I also need the integral of whatever's left over to be possible and to not get worse you don't want that to get worse on you otherwise if you pick the wrong thing you'll tell really quick cuz your problem will start to explode oh man that looks way worse let me keep going at it don't keep going at it you probably made the wrong choice so what I'm looking at this I need to I know this is why on the right hand side I need to pick one of these pieces that things are connected by a product here to be you and the rest of its going to become V so the way I always thought the way that I have talked to you if you watched it I will pick you as X I cover that up so ok X is gone V is in whatever is left over so be is everything else if we actually do that integral you don't need a plus C here if you did a plus C you and wrap that up later on with a larger plus C you don't need to leave it right there so we know that y equals u times B U is X B is negative e to the negative X you do that integral you're going to get the it's like a basic u sub u would be negative x the derivative that is negative 1 so you have a negative floating in there that's going to come out right there so if u times B is negative from here x times e to the negative x so u times V minus the integral of VDU which means you need to use the D u comes from your substitution for u so u equals x d u equals in this case DX so we pick something that the derivative generally gets easier the rest of it should be an integral that's possible we integrate and we derive so we have u times V got that minus the integral of VDU kind of flip-flopping here that's the first part negative x e to the negative x minus this right here's that integral well the integral of e to the negative x is negative e to the negative x but we have a negative floating out front so we're going to get positive a negative so minus is that minus this becomes actually positive e to the negative x and then we do with less now we can start factoring out if you want to factor out a negative e to the negative x this thing looks pretty good that way and what we have is a general solution in every one of these cases we've started with a derivative equals a function of X with no wise and out of it like ten times but it's important you get that in your head those are the basic the basic is if it is made of a word the most basic differential equations they're done with integrals move the DX integral so you have to move the DX but integrate with DX on both sides take an integral on both sides on the left hand side you're just going to get Y the solution what you're looking for in the first place on the right hand side you should have an integral that is possible don't have to be easy they can be quite difficult most of the time in a section like in a textbook through textbook right now they'll give you a lot of different techniques like I did so I gave you some basic ones some substitution some trig sounds stuff some tables and then some integration by parts to get used to that just for us to practice so what we've done though what's important for you guys to grasp right now is that all of these solutions are general solutions they all have a plus C they're all creating this I'm just to pretend they're all parabolas I know they're not but we create this family of curves it's infinite if you add plus C it's just a vertical shift so you could have like plus one point zero zero zero zero one plus one point zero zero zero zero two plus one point zero zero zero zero zero I'd love to comma zero is three and you could have these things you stacked right on top of one another the key point here is that none of them all of them are parallel none of them charity points what that means is that if we give one point so well I I want to go through I'll go through this that point right there there's only going to be one curve in the entire family that does that it's going to be one particular solution out of the general solution one particular curve out of the family of curves so let's do that let's all mint these problems with just some initial values right now so the first one let's suppose that given our differential equation we have our general solution we know it's a plus C it's a family of curves but I want the one curve that goes to the point 2 comma 1 2 comma 1 would look like that Y of 2 equals 1 X would be to the corresponding Y value would be 1 that's a point 2 comma 1 so this is asking for the curve that goes through the point 2 comma lines all that same if you remember from a couple videos ago we started thinking about particular solutions we solved for some C's it's the same exact stuff in fact it's basically the same lesson it's just now you have one technique to be able to find the solution before we verified it and then we plugged in to solve for C now we just have to solve proceed because we've already found it ourselves so we replace X with 2 Y with 1 it's going to solve for C we plug that back in in our case here if X is 2 2 minus 2 0 0 cubed is 0 1/3 times 0 0 plus C is C and we know that that's 1 so C equals 1 and then all we do is rewrite that that's no longer a general solution that's a particular solution that says that this is the one curve that satisfies that differential equation but also gives to that one point you see the difference I hope you see the difference in that that this is a particular it's no longer you can plug in anything you want to get different curve to satisfy this differential equation it's there's now 1 and that plus C is all it takes to save this the one curve going to that point that's kind of cool next one let's suppose that we have the fact that we need to go through the point negative 4 comma 0 all right we've already done the entire integral but down here right at the very bottom we know that Y is 0 when X is negative 4 let's see 16 16 plus 9 25 to the 3 next power when you do like 3 halves power that happens the square root so how I always do this I don't take 25 to the third power and then take a square root that's crazy what I do is I take 25 square root power I get 5 and then a cubit since 125 so 125 over 3 if I subtract it on both sides we get a really awkward scene again 25 square roots 5 cubed 125 over 3 subtract both sides we now know C is negative 125 over 3 that's when it shouldn't be too bad let's suppose it on the next example this derivative equals 10 over x squared plus 1 that we need to go through the origin Y of 0 equals 0 Y is 0 when x is 0 ten inverse of 0 man do you remember what that is tan inverse of 0 so if I do what angle tan versus zero equals theta so tan of theta equals zero do the inverse then we think that's the sine over cosine of sine zero at zero so let's just pick zero so tangent of zero gives us zero so tan inverse of 0 is also 0 that's once you think you're good stuff C is zero so our original solution here has a plus C of 0 that's it ok second last one let's suppose on this we got to go through the point zero zero again we do the same thing cyan versus zero is still going to be zero so we would have no plus C here as well let's say that's a kind of same exact example listed last one last one is kind of interesting we wanted them to the point zero one so if we go through the point zero one that says that Y is 1 when X is zero be careful on the little math it sucks so much to know how to do all this stuff and then make a little air down here that's gonna be kicking yourself I hate that so let's really be careful 0 plus 1 is obviously 1 but e to the negative 0 make sure to make any sense but e to the 0 is still 1 so you have 1 times 1 but it's negative so C is not zero here this is one equals negative one plus C you add that wonderful side C is 2 so we get a particular solution from our family of curves that goes through that particular point 0 comma 1 I hope this is making sense to you long story made sure how we deal with this is if you have a derivative that's equal to a function of X with no lies try an integral now usually work pretty nicely and then that's a general curve general family of curves you have this plus C it's parallel families here if you want to go through one point that's called an initial condition and there's only one Curtis satisfies that a particular curve a particular solution so if you want if you yeah what a good idea would be is to try some of these right now before we go into the next video make sure you understand this concept because we're gonna kick it up a notch and start talking about how well acceleration and velocity are derivatives that are related to one another to to the position we're gonna start talking about how to do that so get this stuff down so the next step makes sense hopefully you got it I'll see you for the next video you
