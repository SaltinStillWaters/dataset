Transcript for: Separable Differential Equations (Differential Equations 12)
exciting times exciting times we finally get to learn our first technique on how to solve some differential equations and it's gonna be awesome so when we deal with differential equations we have learned a lot about what they're about we've learned about slope fields on kind of how to solve them at least an approximation we've learned a lot of things about differential equations but we haven't learned really how to solve them the only thing we really know is that if we have some very basic differential equations an integral can undo a derivative and so an integral can solve some very basic differential equations for us no problem now we're going to learn about this technique that is it's the most fundamental it's the one that you try to use as often as possible because it's the most straightforward so there's lots of techniques on how to solve differential equations for ordinary differential equation first-order differential equations like we're dealing with so there's things like separable differential equations that we're going to talk about today there's homogeneous differential equations there are Bernoulli if you can make a Bernoulli substitution there's a substitution technique for differential equations there there's some other ones as well that we'll explore so my point is that we're gonna get in in the next several videos on lots of different techniques and at the very end I'm gonna wrap up and say hey here's how you should approach these differential equations here's what you should be looking for maybe maybe try this first technique and then after that see if you can make it to this and then see if you can make it to this and I'll give you a list of a thought process on how we would go about it the first one that we should try like all the time if we can and it's it's pretty easy to see when we can use it and when we can't is if we have a form of a different equation that is separable where we could separate the variables and the first about five minutes of this video I'm gonna explain exactly what we're doing why it works and what we're looking for so we need to remember that integrals can solve differential equations because a differential equation is basically this equation with the derivative in it and if I can get it in a proper form I can just integrate both sides and find my parent function or the the anti-derivative so that's what the integrals do is they find that so we can do that so here's our idea if we can if we can write our difference of equation where we can group all of our let's call it Y stuff all of our functions with Y in it and the dy on one side and all of our junk with constants and X's and the DX on the other side so you're wait wait a minute I thought we had dy DX we do but those differentials we can put this in what's called differential form and well similar to differential form we can split up that dy M DX we can treat it like the fraction that it is it comes from that if you remember it like back in way a long time ago in calc one I have a video on actually where we talk about how you can really sort of separate that dy DX because of how it's created when we first create the derivative we we put a dy and DX together and we can actually pull it apart and it works for us mathematically and that's pretty awesome I will show you another way to think about it if you really need to that's okay too so I'll show you two ways to approach this but the plan is if we know integrals under derivatives let's try to put all of our Y stuff and dy on one side X stuff and DX on the other side and then when we integrate we'll integrate one side hey we got a dy oh my gosh that matches up an integral with all the life stuff and then we have another integral with DX oh and that matches up with all the X stuff and we can just take two integrals and then if possible we can solve for y explicitly and that's what we're talking about here group your life stuff and dy on one side group your X stuff and DX on the other side and then integrate both sides what we do to one side in an equation we've got to do to the other so that's why we're integrating both sides the reason why we have y's and dy on one side is so that when you integrate dy your variables match up we have X's and DX that way when you integrate the other side your variables match up that's the plan this works for any sort of differential equation where you can solve for the dy/dx and then this thing is a product what Wyatt Wyatt product well if we want to separate our variables and have the ability to do an integral we need the X's and Y's to somehow be multiplied together that way we can easily divide or multiply or move our our X parts and our Y parts are factors to one side of the other and separate if we have stuff added and subtracted we either have to be able to factor that which we're going to get in our second or less problem which we have a factor that to create this product or we have to have some other technique like linear there's linear differential equations it's another technique we're gonna use figure out how to have solved linear differential equations so a little bit of a recap I said about five minutes I don't know if I've made it that long but the idea is we've got differential equations if you can write it as dy/dx your derivative equal to a function XY where your stuff is multiplied then we can separate multiplied or divided then we can separate our variables we put our Y's on one side with dy our X's on the other side with DX we integrate and we try to solve for y so a couple notes one thing is we're going to really help you keep all of your I'm gonna call them constants they're really coefficients because we're multiplying so keep your coefficients your constants all of that stuff the numbers keep it on your next side the y side it gets a lot more difficult to solve if you've moved your constant coefficients to your Y side so keep your constants on your x ID we're trying to solve for y so that that would save us some work if we keep our constants on our x side secondly if you can when you do your integrals you're going to have a Y function somewhere you're gonna have an X function somewhere try to solve for that Y explicitly sometimes it's not possible a lot of times it is with separable equations so we're gonna I'm going to show you that we are going to do just an absolute job of examples here but I think like twelve example eleven twelve examples if you are getting the point after the first two and you want to just go and try stuff that's fine of what I'm trying to do here is for the yoo-hoo man it's been a while since you take Cal - or even count three and you're like I don't remember how to do partial fractions whatever look like I don't remember how to use integration cable or trig sub or substitutions even or integration by parts I don't think we have one of those but if you're not if you're not familiar with that stuff that's okay that that's what this is for okay I'm gonna do like eleven examples to make sure that our integrals our integration techniques are still there if you're fine with that man skip through a few that's okay I mean I don't care if you watch the whole video or not I want you to learn it so the basis of separable differential equations our very first technique is if you have a product can write it as a product factor it so that's a product get your wife stepped on one side with dy next up another and integrate that's it I'm going to show you a couple of them I want you to hang on for the first two and then if it's making sense cool if it is making sense to you and you don't need any more skip to the last example please in this video and at least watch these singular solutions though very less one talks about a singular solution and you need to you need to understand that this technique while awesome sometimes doesn't give us these things called singular solutions a solution that doesn't show up by just integrating so check that out so let's give it a try let's see how this stuff works so we're gonna do two that look very very similar they're slightly different and the point is that that slight difference causes us to get a nearly completely different type of a solution here so let's look at this first differential equation we have a derivative and rather badly meant that doesn't doesn't look like that let's make it look like that so sometimes in our differential equations we have to do some work just to make it fit our model of being able to separator variables this model of I want a derivative that's equal to a product a product of some X stuff and a function of x times some Y step a function of Y well I'm going to look at it like that there's a function of X negative 2x and there's a function of Y just Y so we are going to move our variables what we're gonna do because we have a dy on the numerator of this this fraction here this dy DX and DX on the denominator we are going to want to move our Y variables to the left hand side of our equation by multiplication or division obviously we're going to have a product over here so it's going to have to be multiplication or division to move our stuff and we're gonna move this DX to the right hand side might seem a little weird but we have done this since calc 1 it's it's rare that we do but you can separate that fraction so if we divide both sides by Y I'm gonna be getting 1 over Y dy DX equals negative 2x notice how I'm fine I'm moving my wife share of room in my Y my dy I'm keeping my constants my coefficient it really is what that is constant factors on the right hand side on my excited now one last thing we're gonna do before we integrate that DX needs to be on your x side so if we do that multiply both sides by DX this gives us something that we can integrate on both sides so that Mel and the fundamental ideas of solving equations is you can do a homestay that you want as long as you do it to both sides so if we say well I want to perform operation while we've never performed operations on equations and on both sides shouldn't do you do a logarithm on both sides you take both sides as an exponent like Exponential's we do lots of operations on both sides and integrals is an even derivatives with implicit differentiation you take derivatives on both sides integrals is another one that we can do this operation on both sides so if we integrate on both sides we have this idea of I'm integrating 1 over Y dy oh my gosh the variables match up that's awesome that's a very easy integral on the right hand side integral of negative 2 X DX that's an even easier integral then the variables match up so I told you that I would show you this I'm sure this one that if you don't like this here's kind of the root of this this idea - you can think of it this way it's a little weird but if you kept it like this some people don't like the idea that you are integrating with respect to two different things here they well this is why that's that's X so you're not really doing the same thing if you think about it this way well what if I integrated one side of the X and integrated the other side DX these DX's actually do cancel out from the root of where they came from on the the definition what a derivative is we have those like like Delta X in a limit so where that comes from you can actually remove my shown in a video in calc 1 but that's that's possible so if you want to think about it that way like hey you are integrating with respect to X on both sides it's just that this X and X go away and you have the dy so you integrate with respect to Y think about it that way if you want to I don't care the point is that both these this actually does work we can separate the dy DX and integrate both sides and mathematically that's a nice tool for us to be able to rely on so let's use it if we integrate and again most of this this video is about integration techniques the idea of really basic move your wise move tricks it is dy/dx group them and then then integrate so we need to remember that things like the integral of 1 over Y dy is natural log absolute value of y on the right hand side and when we integrate this negative 2x you can pull your negative 2 out as a consonant so a coefficient can move out in front and we integrate or you think about just the negative if you want to this should be negative x squared so when we integrate that we get this negative x squared if you want to do the derivative real quick but you know - its tipping negative 2x that's great importantly like really important you're always going to get a plus C now it should be in your head right now it will wait a minute I'm doing an integral on both sides when I get a plus C on both sides the answer is yeah you could make that argument but because you get a constant on both sides it's plus C on both sides you could you could add or subtract one of them to the other and you get this other arbitrary constant so we really only need it on one side we choose the X side because we're trying to solve for y I hope that makes sense so make it fit separable equations if you can separable differential equations separating the variables so make it look like a product get your X's on one side with a DX I waited to the motek get your X's on one side with a DX your Y's on the other side with a dy integrate both sides and try to solve for y you only need one plus C because if you had two plus C's like minus 2 and plus 3 you could group them on one side you could just add or subtract one constant to the other and remember we're talking arbitrary constants so it doesn't matter what it is is creating this general solution for you remember general solutions the general solution is this family of curves that has an arbitrary constant in it but says you could plug in any number and it would still work so it doesn't matter that we have a plus seat here in here we would just subtract or add an arbitrary constant and group it on one side now I'm gonna be so weird I'm gonna call this C sub 1 because what's going to happen is in our process of solving for y we're going to start and multiplying that number whatever that is time times other numbers and we're going to take it as an exponent on e in just a little bit because we've got a natural log so I'm gonna call it C sub 1 for a little bit and this is a man I don't remember when it was I think it was calculus 2 that we started talking about this one the first few videos there's a section on simple simple differential equations separation of variables idea where we have an arbitrary constant now that constant when you multiply it by another number like a factor it's still a constant and if you take it to an exponent on e it's still a constant so we're gonna allow that to happen at the very end we're gonna say hey this thing right here that looks really nasty that's just a constant so we're gonna leave that for just a bit as we work through our examples it's gonna happen like every example we do and then the end we're gonna say this thing that's got the c1 in it that's still a constant we're gonna call it the arbitrary constant I hope that makes sense just just watch out for it so let's go through the process of solving this for y we need to solve explicitly if we can and we can so what I'm doesn't actually work with them well we're gonna we're gonna take e on not matagi but like we're gonna put an e on both sides and treat both of these as an exponent so Ln absolute value y equals negative x squared plus C we know that the exponential that is the inverse of this is e so you can show it this way you really don't need to go all that in-depth and show that you can just say man yeah Y absolute value of y is going to equal e to the other side so raise both sides to the exponent as an exponent on e these are a composition of inverse functions they're always going to cancel out that's going to leave you absolute value why most people don't even write this most people go directly from here to here that's what most people do think of it yeah this is a base of e e to the other side equals argument and that's how this these logarithms work now I was mentioning to you a little bit before that we're gonna have C sub 1 as an exponent on something else and then we're gonna have it multiplied by another number or another positive or negative and so here's that here's how that works if you want to solve for y you need to get rid absolute value and this doesn't look all so good over here so here's some ideas that commonly come up in solving for y explicitly a lot of times if you have e to an exponent where there's a plus or minus do you remember that when you have a plus or a minus in your exponent it came from common basis being multiplied if you have common bases being multiplied what you do with exponents is always one operational level below what you see so if you see multiplication that involves exponents what you do with your excellence is once it wants one below multiplication addition what's one below division subtraction so when we see that what we're gonna do is imagine that if we have addition in our exponents we could actually write this and this common bases it's going it's going backwards if you had common bases you add exponents if we have adding exponents we have common bases that are multiplied together so that's what's going on notice how we have either 2 C 1 e to the c1 Latian gentleman it's still a constant if you take e to that C whatever it is any number in the world its Billy because the domain is anything you're still gonna get a constant out of it now the idea of absolute value this also happens a lot let's move this around for justice idea the idea of absolute value do you remember the definition the definition of an absolute value says you get X if X is positive and maybe x is negative x if X is negative that way we always get a positive out of it if that's a negative number you say well I multiply my negative it's good and I'll be in positive it's not absolute value works what that means is that whatever we have here we can always change this to absolutely the absolute value of y equals plus or minus whatever Y is so that's that's something we can only doing that absolute value kind of nice if that happened to be positive we keep the positive have to be negative we keep a negative and a negative times negative would give us the positive why we're doing all this and why we call that C sub one because if you're stealing any but who cares because about that right now I want you to think about that because you have this number e 2.7 something blah blah blah forever natural number you're gonna raise that to a constant you this is still a constant right here and it's based on whatever that is in fact you could get back the first constant by plugging something else in but you're also gonna have either positive or negative the point is this whole expression is still a constant doesn't matter what it is you know it's an arbitrary constant whatever that is the derivative of that is going to satisfy our original differential equation remember what we're trying to do we kind of get lost and some of this or start crunching numbers you're not really thinking about what we're doing if we're to find any function so that when you take a derivative of it it's going to satisfy this which is really cool and any arbitrary constant is going to work we're creating a general solution here we don't have an initial value so we can't find a particular solution that's going to come later in another video next video I'll talk about particular solutions so what we do what we often do and we don't even really identify it sometimes we should every time is we say let's let it see this arbitrary constant equal that constant there and when we solve for awhile that that's why a lot of times on your homework when you're going through it or your practice you know ma'am my answer doesn't look anything like what they're doing it's it might be if you're not making a fundamental sake integral mistake sign errors like that it might be that they're moving around they're calm and adjusting for it and taking that whole garbage out at the end and saying that's still a constant let's call it a constant so that's the reason why we write the C sub one so that later on when we do multiply it when you do take it as an exponent we do it with the plus or minus in front of the positive in front of it we can call the whole thing a constant at the end I wish I could ask if that makes sense but I hope that it does this is salt explicitly for why this is the general solution to that difference of equation that's pretty cool we had our first date made the next one's really really similar I'm not going to show you a lot of like the options basically most most everybody does it this this way we separate the Y dy the X is DX and we integrate we take that but that's okay so let's give it a try of course we need to write this in this form if we can at all possible man separable equations are really nice and separate our variables out let's write this as a product of function of X and a function of y equal to our derivative or first derivative if at all possible that allows us to move things these these factors by multiplication division so we're going to group are wise and dy on one side our X's and the X's on other most of the time we don't show a lot of work between there we understand that yeah you're dividing both sides by Y square that's going to give you 1 over Y squared MFD why we're keeping our constants and our X's on one side and multiplying by DX then that allows us to take an integral on both sides which is really cool idea and look at the difference look what that Y squared does for us instead of having 1 over Y and yielding this Ln of absolute lie that the absolute value of y that's not what's happening we really have an integral of why to the negative 2 power dy so we have a completely different answer we're not going to have an e to anything on this on the right hand side sure we got the same exact stuff going on so remember on the right hand side that's where our constants are gonna lie that's where a + C is going to lie which is an arbitrary constant we're gonna have this negative x squared plus c1 I'm gonna write the plus c1 just in case I've multiplied by any other number this in case I take you to an exponent this can be a little bit more easy to it for us to show that we're changing or changing that to another constant if we don't have to move to change it we're just gonna race the +1 and call it the arbitrary constant on the left hand side we've got why don't they into so do you remember those we we add 1 to the exponent divided by the new exponent so add 1/2 the negative 1 or we can think of this as negative 1 over Y let's multiply by negative thank you this is positive y equals positive x squared minus c1 so right now if you're if you did this problem on your own and you checked I don't know if this came out of a book or not but if you checked in the back of your book they said well they have they have x squared I'm sorry I made a mistake it's thinking about the next thing it was saying 1 over Y they've got x squared plus C you know what maybe they defined C as equal to negative C 1 and that would change that sign if it's barber trade doesn't doesn't matter so that that's not a big sticking point the point is that can you get down to 1 over y equals x squared minus C 1 or plus C a different constant can be the same thing well that's great if you can now we're almost done if we have 1 over y equals x squared minus C 1 then y equals the reciprocal of that so we can you can think of it as multiplying both sides by Y and divided by X square - e1 taking reciprocal and as I was saying just before that right there that is a solution that's a general solution we can either erase the c1 and just take this as y equals 1 over x squared minus C or if you want to keep the C one you can redefine it let's see what Megan if C 1 then you could write this as x squared plus C is it a big deal no it's not even a big deal not to me at least it's still the function that has an arbitrary consonants in the correct form we've solved it explicitly and this function is a general solution why general well it has a plus C in it still so this is a family of curves an infinite number of functions that when you take a derivative a first derivative of it it will satisfy our differential equation with that other stuff in it which is really awesome that's pretty cool we can do that now from scratch if you wanted to look back at the first few videos there were some problems that we could have solved this way there were some some basic basic problems that we could have solved with separable equations so we're going to do a whole lot more if this is making sense to you right now like I really it is try some and if you if you're not familiar on some of the integration techniques then check back in the video again though skip to the last problem where we talk about singular solutions so I'm gonna race this I'm gonna come back in just a minute with some more examples let's give these a try the first one remember what we're trying to do with separable equations here separable differential equations we're trying to see if the function fits the model of could you write it as a dy/dx equals a function of x times a function of y sometimes they're written like that that looks great sometimes they're not but if you divided this you could write it so we're gonna get to that where we we were thinking that but we're not actually showing that particular step so the main idea is can you your why is dy X's the X that's the main idea whether you go through the actual process of writing dy/dx equals a function of x times a function of Y now I'm gonna move the 1 doesn't really matter the idea is can you write it like that if you can great do it that's your first goal first goal in differential equations is if you can get it that way here we can we've got dy/dx equals a function of Y times a function of X that's perfect because we know that we can divide and get the Y's on one side dy X's on the other side DX you're gonna get really used to the old one rule I think one of her why do white happens a lot you're gonna get a lot of element absolute value wise you're gonna get a lot of e to this side whatever integral is and then we're gonna get a lot of that plus or minus e to the c1 equals that see that happens quite a bit with some basic differential equations so we got this down we say all right we grouped our why do you.why we have our function of X DX let's integrate both sides that's great on the left hand side we know that integral this is element absolute value of y it looks pretty good we know what that loves be an example like that before integral of sine X let's remember what that is remember most of this lesson is just repeating some integration techniques and just getting it back in your head because if you can't do this then it doesn't matter that you understand separation of or separable equations here so on the right hand side see the derivative of cosine is negative sine so the integral of sine is negative cosine of X and I might want to just take a moment to just think that through the derivative of cosine gives us a negative sign so the derivative of cosine times negative 1 gives us positive sine X and that's pretty good I'm going to add my plus C I'm going to give it a little 1 because I expect this thing to be changing a little bit later so I've grouped them integrated both sides easy integral had think about this a little bit but we have our plus C only on the right hand side our X side now let's start solving for y explicitly sort our calculus is pretty much done all we have to do now is a little bit of algebra to see if we can solve for y we know that the base is e so e to the right hand side equals the argument that means Y at least absolute value y equals e to the negative cosine of X plus c1 and we go through this process a lot we know that absolute value of y is going to equal if we separate this I'm going to move my factors this is e to the C sub 1 times e to the negative cosine X we know that anytime exponents are added together they came from a product of common bases I just move the e to the C sub 1 first we also just explored what absolute value is absolute value takes a positive when the the expression is positive and a negative expression is negative which means we can write y equals positive or negative now the fact that's never going to be negative because we have this e to some power this might be a little redundant on some cases we can do it anyway this really matter as far as a long-run but sometimes e to e to anything is not going to give you this this negative so that we're going to redefine we're going to call that C so sometimes we show this off to the side and we say let's let this I would show that if I were you but sometimes that's not showing so if you're wondering where that garbage goes they're wrapping this whole thing up and calling it the arbitrary constant so that's our solution that's the general solution of that differential equation which is pretty nice let's try the next one so the next one doesn't really look like like what we it doesn't look like what we had before either where was added but can you imagine if I divide this over here you would get 4y over 1 plus X well since division is can be defined as multiplication and multiplication is division they're the same level of operation this acts like that form all we're really concerned about is can you get your wide on one side by dividing my wife can you get your X's on the other side with with your coefficients that are constant factors I divided by 1 over X with your DX by multiplying by a DX can you do that because if you can then you can integrate both sides if you can't then there will be another another technique for us so we divided by Y keep the dy divided by 1 plus X keep the 4 multiplied by DX and now we're looking great for integrals so left hand side again you're getting really familiar this Ln absolute value of y on the right hand side well we have 4 over 1 plus X now the 4 is a constant so we can pull that out and multiply by whatever the integral is going to be of 1 over 1 plus X so do you remember what the integral of 1 over 1 plus X is if you need a substitution you could do that it's a direct substitution there's not even a coefficient that comes out of that so we would have this whole integral of 1 over u du u another Ln of absolute value whatever that is so this whole side over here comes out 2 Ln absolute value of 1 plus X because they've won over it except off if you're not sure that's not making sense go through the derivative the derivative of natural log of being 1 over inside times the derivative of the inside but then we have that for it's the same thing as what we have right there and we're going to put that plus c1 so next thing just so we recall do you remember that with any coefficient in front of the natural log that acts as an exponent so before we touch this with with any sort of e to that power we're going to move this and create an exponent so let's keep on going now because we have a natural log of something that cannot possibly be negative but it's whatever whatever this is we're going to get that to the positive we don't even need that absolute value there so we're going to take this e to the left side to the right right hand side so absolute value y equals 1 plus X to the fourth power plus C sub 1 and E is 2 all that stuff that wrote that a little funny to rewrite that so e to the other side equals our argument of natural and natural logarithm so that's kind of nice now let's do the same same thing we did before let's do absolute value of y equals e to the C sub 1 times e to the 1 plus X to the fourth power you know what I'm in a mistake I hope you saw the mistake I kind of went a little too quick here maybe we're only good but I forgot something here and I really need to see when we do this this whole removing the longer than by using of exponential I forgot about that Ln so that's true but then when we separate this when we have the absolute value of y equals e to the C sub 1 times e to the Ln 1 plus X to the fourth power well now you have a composition of inverse functions these things are going to be completely gone so we have the absolute value of y we have the e to the C sub 1 but because you had 80 to the Ln of an argument right there we've got this 1 plus X to the 4th power that can't be negative so we're whatever that absolute value would be we're taking the 4th power can be negative this plus or minus can be wrapped up in the needs in the c1 and now we can call that whole argument that's our general solution of that differential equation sorry about that I completely forgot the ln hopefully you don't do the same mistake so walking back through sometimes they don't look like what we want them to look like as far as these separable equations but we can always see if we can do it let's move our X's to one side keep our concept why is it low side and then keep our dy over DX integrate and then start moving these these coefficients if you can for Ln so we move that up we recognize that hey there's two L ends they should both disappear when I'm doing an exponential with them so absolute value y equals e to this sure we have a c1 let's separate that out e to the C sub 1 times e to the that's where it elements go away so this whole thing disappears we have a composition of inverse functions we'd have 1 plus X to the fourth power we're gonna take away our absolute value if I call that positive or negative and map gives our general solution with an arbitrary constant C so the next one works very similar if you haven't done so already pause the video see if you can just write it in the right form if you get stuck on integration that's what this video is for is practicing integrals but see if you can do that so we have X's here we got a dy/dx viy factors over here we need to move this to the left this to the right and our da test all the way so we divide both sides by the square root of 1 over Y squared 1 minus y squared and we keep our dy and we divide both sides by 2 squared of X and we multiply by DX so we've divided both sides by square root of 1 minus y squared cap dirty water we've divided by two square of X we've moved our BX now we're ready to integrate hopefully you got the same thing or at least thought about it and said yes that makes sense to me let's look at that one I want to do that that's easier it's stupid right the insight so on the right hand side we've got an integral of 1/2 X to the negative 1/2 we can do all of our integrals with exponents of sang exactly we add 1 to the exponent and divide by the new exponent 1/2 and whatever gone plus C sub 1 so that would give us just this square root of x let's see some one we've added one to our exponent what happened / new exponent why not we already had a 1/2 it gone and now we just have square X plus c1 on the left hand side there there's two ways that you should approach this number one way if you're allowed to or if you remember it or if you have it or you used it before man your table of integrals that's why they're in most every differential equation textbook because of the back or the front you go yeah you're gonna use this a lot so these are things that are very common that when they come up here's what our answer is that's that's fine this this class shouldn't just be a repeat of calculus to where you learn all your integration techniques I'm showing it to you as a courtesy and thank goodness that we have lots of time you're my class so you are my students I'm gonna I'm taking the extra time to make sure you know it if you if you don't if you do know it right use your table integration if you don't and you prefer me to forget it or you're not allowed to for some odd reason do tricks up you can do it tweak so on on this and either case you get sine inverse you know maybe you've memorized that so we get this whole sine inverse of Y and dropping that down sine inverse of y equals the square root of x plus c1 remember that with inverse trig functions if sine inverse of y equals something that y equals sine of that something I'm gonna drop the c1 we don't have to change that that constant at all that's an arbitrary constant and that is a general solution to a differential equation so we're always trying to group XS the X's on one side for you on this side why is dy is on the other side integrating both sides and then doing our very best to do two things number one don't forget a bunch of constant always plus C making sure that we if we can simplify that so it looks nicer as a maybe larger or different form of an arbitrary constant and solving for y explicitly we have several more examples I hope this is making sense to you if it's if it's not if you're not quite getting it our integrals it might be time to go back and watch some count two videos about how integration works I'm trying my best to explain it quickly but we're also looking at the form of differential equations here we've got a few more on the board let's go through them make sure that we're understanding what's going on again there's some techniques here that you might have forgotten about integration so first one this this is really close to fitting our form we see a product on one hand side on one side of the right hand side we got our derivative on the other side but it's all wrapping that one third power so sometimes all it is is a matter of distributing that exponent across multiplication division that's fine we know that exponent rules work one lovable level we have so you can distribute exponents across multiplication and division but not two levels down not addition subtraction so we're gonna take the cube root or the 1/3 power of 64 not bad that's 4 we're also going to have X to the 1/3 power and Y to the 1/3 power and now we see that yeah that's that's a that's some factors that are by together we can move our why we can keep our coefficient of four and we can keep our X and move our DX let's go ahead let's write it as something that we can integrate so one over Y to the 1/3 power looks pretty good we're going to keep our dy right hand side we're going to keep our 4 we're gonna keep our X to the 1/3 and we're gonna have our DX we just multiply on both sides to get that now we're able to integrate so let's try it on the right hand side that's pretty nice our coefficient of horse stays remember with our exponents we add 1 and divide by our new exponent and we're gonna have a plus C we're gonna call plus C one sort of expecting that we're gonna change that later on the left-hand side well this is the integral of Y to the negative 1/3 DUI so Y to the let's add one that's positive 2/3 divided by 2/3 on the right hand side our fours are gone so we and we can move our 3 to our numerators so we're gonna get three X to the 4/3 plus c1 now a couple options you can move this first and just get three halves Y and divide everything by two thirds or well multiply everything by two-thirds or you can multiply by two-thirds now so either one of those is it's absolutely fine so if we do that we multiply by two-thirds then we're going to get just Y to the 2/3 on the right-hand side when we distribute that our threes are gone we're gonna get 2x to the 4/3 plus 2/3 c1 we're gonna wrap all of this stuff up and we're going to say let's just let that become our arbitrary constant that way it's a little bit cleaner so if we have Y to the 2/3 then essentially we can raise both sides to the 3 halves power so if we do that raise both sides to the 3 halves power exponents raise two exponents multiply one level below exponents raising two exponents multiplication that's what we do with our exponents this is completely gone on the right hand side we raised all of this to the three halves powers well and we get y equals this 2 X to the 4/3 looking good plus a big arbitrary constant and then this is just raised to the 3 halves power so we've grouped our X's grouped or Y's we had to distribute an expo of this fine and then we do an integration and then the hardest part of all this stuff is just solving for y but that's like the the most challenging part is just doing that so make sure that we're doing a right make sure that we're not making little little teeny errors and hopefully I didn't making the Milot any errors on that so let's go on the next one that looks good already so this is a differential equation we have this function of X this function of Y it's multiplied together it's really solid let's move our wise it's move our X's try that now do it on your own if you can oh group my YS dy group my X's DX take an integral on both sides try that if you have it well that was easy now on the right hand side that's a piece of cake that's gonna be x squared plus c1 no problem on the left hand side don't overthink this stuff okay do it don't try to make it harder than it is is what I'm saying so when we have this one over secant yd Y they're struggling to figure out what that is think about one one over secant white really means one over secant well let's see secant is one over cosine so if we have one over secant that's just cosine this would be integral of cosine y dy equals integral of 2x DX and I gives us something really nicely integrate the integral of cosine well the derivative of sine gives us cosine so the integral of cosine gives aspects sine of Y on the right hand side we have x squared plus c1 is expected let's just call it C there's nothing fancy when we're going to solve for y here with an inverse if sine of y equals x squared plus C then y equals sine inverse of the same and we're good that's our general solution it's got a real nice plus C in there now this harness is you might have thought it's just a matter of recognizing what you're doing with your integrals so separating your variables these separable equations they're not hard as far as the typically the set up they're not bad but the integration techniques might get you on the next one so let's try it if you haven't done right now I would really recommend pause the video see if you can group your Y's on one side with your dy group your exit on the other side with any constant so the coefficients are constants n DX my wives got to move one over why we keep rdy our ex can stay there we have to divide by one over one minus x squared so we get this two over divided that one over Y divided that keep our dy move our DX and now it's time for us to integrate left hand sides really a non-issue we have this absolute value of Ln of absolute value of y we've got it several times before on the right hand side 1 over 2 over 1 minus x squared there's a lot of people who just really really really really want to do like a tree step on this this is not a tree sub it's not going to work out for you there's no square root there it's really hard to represent that we don't want to try it because what you end up getting if you do force this thing to do a trig so I think it's like secant theta d-theta and that's a nasty integral it would it would work but there's an easier way to go around doing it so instead of going about that way let's see if maybe we can revert back to something a little bit nicer like how a partial fractions so let's take a moment and review that so we have 2 over 1 minus x squared if you remember how partial fractions work they rely on your ability to factor into Linear's and irreducible quadratics so what that means is that we can write that as a difference of squares so 1 minus X and 1 plus X and now we do our our partial fractions so partial fractions say for any linear factor that you have on your denominator you're going to create a fraction for that with a constant on the numerator leave the numerators on partial fractions are always one degree less than the denominator so if your denominators are linear your numerators are constants if your denominators are quadratics your numerators are Linear's so like x squared plus one then you get a X plus B or C X plus D or a linear over that so that's how those work we don't get a whole lot of that we get some basic ones like this though a lot so we know that we can split this up somehow as long as we have our same two factors that's a linear I have a constant that's a linear as a constant and they're added together now the whole idea where you go from there is basically just I call it a cover-up method but it's basically just finding a common denominator so we found a common denominator what would happen here you would have to multiply this times 1 plus X you'd have to multiply this times 1 minus X and then if you were to add the fractions your denominators would be the same that means that your numerators would also have to be the same now that all boils down and that's not really explained very often in an account to class where you learn about partial fraction it's not very much explaining so let's do this cover this one up but this here cover that one up with this one there and then just make sure it's equal to 2 why because you're multiplying a times a factor that this needs and B times a factor then this fraction means it's 1 minus X that's creating a common denominator when you add your fractions 2 will be equal to the numerator that you're creating by finding a common denominator if you went and found a common denominator for these two fractions and added the fractions that's your numerator that's the numerator we have they've got to be equal now how we go about solving for a and B there's some nice stuff when you're dealing with just Linear's plug in a number that's going to create these factors as a 0 so for instance I'm going to plug in 1 if x equals 1 that faction that's a reset that factor would be zero if X is 1 this factor goes to nothing 1 minus 1 is 0 that's a 1 cool so we would get 8 was 1 2 divided by 2 is 1 now I plug in negative 1 1 plus negative 1 is 0 but 1 minus negative 1 is 2 which means B is also 1 which is kind of nice it's old moving on from there if we wanted to go ahead and write these fractions out our integral changes a bit we have an integral of 1 over Y dy we've got an integral now of instead of all this stuff we've used some partial fractions the saying that this is now this right here where a is 1 and B is 1 so that's 1 over 1 minus X plus 1 over 1 plus X DX and if we integrate after that let's just you the same thing within tonight oh we've got Alemanni the absolute value of y on the right hand side these are both l ends we had something very similar in one of the first examples where we did hey 1 over 1 plus X that's just Ln of 1 plus X the absolute value Ln of 1 minus X but we have a negative in front of a gcy if you had to do I use some you would get negative DX it's gonna have a negative in front of your Ln right here so we get integral of 1 over 1 minus X that's Ln that's absolute value that's 1 minus X yes but it's gonna make it because the derivative of this inside part if you will is negative 1 plus 1 over 1 plus X well that's Ln absolute a 1 plus X and you all say what do I need after this let's call it c1 we know that we're going to be changing that now before we go any further I'm going to I'm have to move over here someone erase it but before we go any further we need to know some properties or logarithms so stuff like if you aren't adding logarithms together or subtracting logarithms they create a product or a quotient respectively so when we're doing this my maps at a why there's not much we can do but can you think of this as Ln of 1 plus X minus Ln of 1 minus X because if you can then we could write this as Ln of 1 plus X over 1 minus X 2 logarithms add or subtract to create one logarithm with a product or a quotient respectively this is technique subtraction if you have a logarithm - or the law creative create a quotient of F plus c1 now let's see if I don't forget my Ln this time so now that we have this rid we're going to try to solve explicitly for y we're gonna do that e to both sides what we have e to Ln of absolute value y is just absolute value Y e to the Ln absolute value one oh my gosh is getting messy 1 minus X plus c1 let's go piece by piece through it we did eetu both sides that's great this is just absolute value of y e to the right hand side I've shown exactly what that is now you have this whole hey added exponents that's that's these common bases they're being multiplied so absolute value Y it looks good we're gonna get e to the C sub 1 no problem times because additional exponents means that it came from multiplication common bases but we also have a composition of inverse functions here though it was always go away gone so let's do one more thing remember our absolute value we don't want that that's going to equal plus or minus e to the C sub one times now sense that e in Ln if they essentially cancel out man to each other the inverses there we get just this absolute this 1 plus X over 1 minus X let's wrap all of this up in a sea we're done that's our general solution to that differential equation it took a lot of work that's a lot of partial fractions stuff that maybe came out of nowhere for you when you see something and it doesn't fit and you go what how how do I do that try to break it down so we would we would try some basic things we would try l-man a lot but if you're getting something that looks like a trig sub or it looks like something that you want to do for a trick so and it's not fitting maybe think about partial fractions that might give you a hand alright so check it out through a couple more examples a couple more integration techniques making sure you see all that so let's see if we can separate these variables get our wise with dy X's with DX and looks like we can if you were to move this over here you have a product or quotient that's what we're really looking for we don't really want to have to do that we're gonna do a lot of stuff at once so we're gonna divide both sides by 1 plus y squared divide both sides by 1 plus x squared and multiply by that DX you know at this point the this stuff should just be kind of pop and not been in your hand you know yeah I'm getting that if that's great there that's if that's happening that is that's great that's really good that means you understand the idea at this point so that's perfect you might want to just go and try some on your own right now before we go any further and see if you do run into a problem maybe I'm going to cover it on these these techniques also but if you're getting it man I'm proud of you that's excellent you're solving differential equations it's pretty cool so wise got to divide X's got a guy divided we got to get our dy on one side DX on the other side and now we're ready to integrate it let me see that that doesn't really look like anything that we've seen before at least not yet where it's not really a Ln man I really don't want to have to do two partial fractions and it's not partial fractions but just just remember that when we have some simple linear inside of a power oftentimes we can rewrite this and do a very simple use of if bad so they're the same integral twice on the right hand side we have well 1 plus X to the negative 2 power if you called that you you would get U to the negative 1 over negative 1 so negative U to the negative 1 divided by the derivative of that but the derivative this is just 1 so if you equaled 1 plus X then D u equal DX that's just a straightforward substitution that that's excellent we would just get negative U to the negative 1 but then we have 1 plus X being ru and we're gonna have a constant left-hand side is going to behave exactly the same so let's make this a little bit nicer right now it doesn't doesn't look very nice so let's make this over a fraction you go Levin doesn't look nicer either I don't really like the negatives so let's multiply everything by negative now we're gonna have to solve for y so how in the world are we going to do that it wouldn't help here's the thought process so it would help if this were all one fraction because if it were then I could reciprocate both sides and then Y would be on the numerator and all I would have to do is subtract one right now I can't really subtract one so I want some mechanism where I can just reciprocate and reciprocate I can't do it because of that if that wasn't there it'll be easy but I can't do it because of that so let's find a common denominator here let's make one fraction and then we're going to reciprocate so why number one plus y because that's just a constant over one all we really have to do is multiply the numerator denominator by 1 plus s and then when we join that together that gives us something that we can actually reciprocate and that's what we're gonna do right now so let's try it so if we reciprocate this we have one plus wide on the left hand side on the right hand side we flip that fraction over so X plus one or one plus X's on the numerator and one minus C sub 1 1 minus 1 plus X is only denominator so we just reciprocate and then all we've got to do subtract 1 and that's good enough I really I don't really want to to leave this as C 1 so a lot of times lots of times what we're gonna do is we're gonna call this piece that piece with the sign we'll call C equal to negative C 1 that way we get rid of a minus sign and we get rid of that little subscript of 1 so if I call that maybe C 1 then y equals 1 plus X over 1 plus C 1 plus X minus 1 if your signs are wrong like I did everything right dirty letter don't darn the Lenard man it's it's probably something like that so don't worry about it don't get super frustrated if your signs are wrong if it's a if it's revolving around a C they're probably just redefining it it happens a lot that's it it's nasty that that's a horrible looking problem answer but that is a general solution to that differential equation that's kind of cool so let's do this this last one before I give you some other other ones they're a little bit more advanced so we got some wise hey there's already Y's on one side we got some X's they're already on the correct side all we've got to do is move the rest of the wire that's connected by a product on the left-hand side won't you try that see if you can go through it look at the left-hand side to see what you get look at the right-hand side and maybe do that simple integral that you have and see if you can practice that I really hope you're doing that when I suggest it okay give this a try because while watching me do math is super exciting it's not benefiting you if you're not internalizing it so one way that you can get better at this is before I try the problem try the problem if you can do it you don't need to study that problem anymore okay if you can't you need to watch me that's okay you're still learning it but at the end try again see if you can do it after you've learned it so and make sure that you have learned if not try to get and see if you can watch the videos pick up the small piece that you're missing that's that's a good way to study so don't just watch it all the way through well beneficial for a little bit it's not internalizing it and I want you to know it I don't want you to struggle with this stuff when you're in your class or learning it so much that you get mad okay getting mad at math it's never helpful it's like two people who are having a discussion and they start yelling and then at that point no one's listening it's just in your head against wall frustration can't produce perseverance and character sure and it makes you a stronger person by having to go through trials I like learning math that's definitely a trial but make sure that we're actually just using our time wisely so one part of that is not just watching the videos but trying them out make sure you're trying to learn so on the left hand side we've divided by Y to the fourth plus one we've multiplied by DX haven't shown that yet we have a cosine X and then DX hey we're ready we're ready to do an integral so we're going to integrate both sides on the left hand side Y cubed over Y to the fourth plus one whenever your exponents on the numerator are one less than the exponents on the denominator you're talking about au sub and then LM so right and you just have one term so right here we're gonna say hey you is Y to the fourth plus one D u therefore has to be before Y Hugh well that's perfect dy this part matches this part we're going to do a substitution do you want to get rid of this constant right there so do you over 4 equals y cubed dy I've done this many different ways I've shown in lots of ways in the videos this is the one that lots of people prefer you're looking for the piece that's the same and you're gonna replace that whole piece with this stuff so why the fourth plus one we call that u y cube dy that whole piece gets replace with D u over for no problem because we know that we can just do a 1/4 Ln absolute value u we know what that is why the for the plus one let's talk about Y to the fourth plus one is there any possible number you can plug in that's not imaginary that you can take to the fourth power I'd want to get a negative then that absolute values irrelevant so we're gonna drop that now we've just done a whole lot of work all this was a u so let's see what's on the right hand side so integral of cosine X the X side happens to be easy one here that's sine X the derivative of sine X is cosine X so the integral going backwards is let's write the derivative sine X is cosine X or the integral of cosine X is just sine X plus c1 and that's gonna follow us all the way down oh well we definitely want to get rid of that one fourth you do have options let's think about what the better option it would be would you want to create a fourth root on the inside of a logarithm or would you rather just multiply both sides by four since we're trying to get as close to solving for y as possible it's more beneficial to multiply both sides by four and at least remove that fraction so we're going to get this whole Ln Y of the fourth plus one equals four and we just want to write like this for sine X plus C if you do want to distribute then we're gonna replace that for C one with just the arbitrary constant and you can do that on your own this is one that we really we really want to assault start solving that for y so we have to do an exponential on both sides that that's not fun and then we have to subtract one and then we'd have to take a fourth root that's just too much work so this is one of those cases where you're gonna see it left implicitly you're not going to be solving this for for that Y especially since we get the the whole non function issue with the plus and minus will take that 4 through so anyway I hope that's making sense we have like four more to do the last one again is probably pretty important for you to see so don't skip out on the video without watching that okay so two more again I am going to encourage you to try them on your own see if you get stuck if you do that's okay you're still learning it it's probably an immigration technique if you're not getting stuck that's awesome that's to build your confidence you guys shouldn't be really good at this because you're putting in the time you're already watching the videos that's like number one so perfect so as I was rambling you probably hopefully pause the video and did that if not we're gonna get going right now again the idea I'm gonna try to model my thinking here for you is to get it in your head you more times I'm kind of trying to brainwash you and to do it in my way or several equations way here your first order of business is to look for separable equations see if you can make it fit that if you can it's just a matter of integrating and then solve it for y which is nice so here we have everything that's multiplied and divided that's fitting the model of differential equation equals separable equations on our separable variables in the right hand side let's get the Y's on one side let's get the X's on the other side with the DX so that's gotta move so we divide this has to move so we multiply on the right hand side all of our X's can stay that they would need to move there now we've grouped our wise D wise you've grouped our XS d X's it does not look very nice does it well not very nice to me at least but let's go through the process of seen our integral just by writing the integral hopefully a little psychology comes into play and you have some better recollection and oh I'm integrating okay how would I approach something like that substitution no because there's too many terms on the numerator not enough on the denominator your powers don't match up substitution no I came for the same reason too many terms on the numerator power doesn't quite match up here so not a substitution but we also see that we're only divided by one term when you're dividing by one term on a fraction split up that fraction so we're gonna make this 2y cubed over Y to the fifth minus y over y to the fifth that lets us simplify and the same thing happens with X's and we simplify each little fraction and then we can immigrate very easily so left-hand side we're gonna have an integral of 2 y to the negative 2 minus y to the negative 4 power what we're sticking with me on the right-hand side we get an integral of we have to leave this as 1 over X because X is negative 1 of course we don't know how to integrate that with some basic technique it's gonna be a logarithm and right now if you can integrate that so 2y to the native to remember we add one to our Expo and divide by the new exponent add one to our exponent divided by the New Mexico so that's y to the negative third power divided by negative 3 right hand side we've got an Ln absolute value of x we need something looks really bad it's all Mastiffs ID so let's fix it ful first thing well we might want to make these into fractions and see what our common denominator is in the fraction and see if we can change some signs so negative two of a why we got a plus/minus set up one over Y cubed plus one over Y of three Y cubed so that becomes our Plus leave our three move our Y and negative three down becomes a positive exponent on the right hand side Ln absolute value of X I'm gonna get to Scratchy so negative 2 over Y just redoing it plus 1 over 3 y cubed looks good equals Ln has a value of x no problem that's going to be a plus 1 over X plus C I gotta be honest with you that's way too majesty to trying to solve for y just leave it when it's that bad you go how am I gonna do that well you're not because you're gonna start getting stuff like common denominator you'll start getting wise up there even if you reciprocate and you'd have to distribute get everything on one side refactor and hope they get solved for y and take a radical it's it's not it's not gonna happen at least not easily so this is one that you'd be fine just leave it like that I know it doesn't look good but that is a general solution to that differential equation let's try that next one so next one says if we have x squared plus 1 on the left hand side that that's on the wrong side let's move it we don't have an x over here let's leave that there for y I forgot to write it sorry guys I forgot something's kind of important you try to do that in your own e we're able to buy that actually you probably should have been able to because without that tan why you just do the integral of dy and it's just Y so without that you move that and that's gonna be looks like au sub and then take an integral dy you get Y on the right hand side you get something really easy so that's alright if you did that in your own but good job good job you got it now we have something a little bit different obviously so let's leave the Y's where they are remove our X's where they need to be by dividing by X fruitless one and moving our DX now we're ready to integrate both sides so let's take an integral of tangent Y dy and integral of x over X Rho plus 1 DX on the right hand side as I was saying that that's a perfect case for a substitution so we let u equal our denominator the derivative is 2x our variables match up we have a constant which we don't care super much about so when we're doing this we're looking for remember we want this piece to match this side you got a divided by 2 now we can replace that X and DX with D u over 2 we know we're going to place that with just you that's what we call for our substitution so we get our 1/2 that's our de over - we're gonna get an Ln absolute value of you now that you that you as x squared plus 1 so we would normally do Ln of absolute value whatever ru was but because x squared plus 1 can't ever be negative with real numbers we don't need the absolute value anymore we just do x squared plus 1 and then we have a seen on the left hand side so the integral of tangent Y this is one that you're going to want to use your table for so the integral of tangent Y gives you Ln absolute value of secant wide and now we work our way through just like we normally would so let's let's write this down here Ln absolute value secant wide and then try to do the same techniques we've done a couple more times let's move this as a square root let's get rid of that that coefficient that way we can do an excellent on both sides remember that first so kind of putting everything together right now x squared plus one to the one-half power is a square root now I've got an Ln equal to Ln plus 2c ones you remember what happens when we do that e to both sides so to take that both sides as an exponential on e our elements are going to drop but because what I'm really doing is this that's gonna go away that's gonna go away but that right there that plus C one C sub one that's e to the C sub 1 being multiplied by this remember that when we have excellence being added that's a multiplication common basis so I'm still going to have an e to the C sub 1 now we know absolute value well we can take this as if we need to plus or minus e to the C sub 1 times the square root of x squared plus 1 now we bet that's a consonant in that many times so that's going to be just a big C the arbitrary constant so secant line equals some constant square root x squared plus 1 and last step man are less that we're almost done if secant y equals something then y equals secant inverse of that something and we're done that's as good as we can get that's our general solution for that differential equation I'm really hoping that this is making sense to you that you at this point are like yeah I get how to separate my variables I understand that my y's and dy are here my X's and DX is here we're gonna do an integral do lots of different techniques there's lots out there and then do our best so for y when we get really nasty stuff we're probably just gonna leave it if it's reasonable then we solve for y we have two more to do they're not that bad that we're actually gonna get a couple easier ones it's just one special case I need to show you the very end and kind of a you need to pay attention to this when you get it for the next one so we're gonna do those two then call it good two more ones got some fancy-pants math on it and one of them is just something that you need to be aware of that can't happen when you're solving differential equations so first this one when things don't look in anything like what you're trying to make them sometimes they're not but sometimes it requires you to think outside the box so in our case right here you know that doesn't that come on they can't possibly be separable well whatever we're looking for stuff being multiplied how do you get sevens multiplied data stuff that's add subtracted what you want factors oh my gosh to get a factor sometimes some rarely these things are factorable so if you have four terms on the right hand side three terms use a diamond problem four terms maybe thank you my grouping if you factor by grouping on that one we can actually make this into things that are being multiplied that creates factors that creates this function equal stuff that's a product and that means that we can separate your variables so doesn't happen all the time but sometimes you can group it so the first two terms 1 minus x squared we're trying to factor GCF I'm not talking difference of squares here I'm talking about factor and GCF there's nothing besides 1 so we can write 1 1 times 1 minus x squared gives you that back factor by grouping always writes our middle sign between those pairs of terms and then a factor than GCF out of the last two which is y squared this is what you're looking for with a factor by grouping is two big fat terms that have a GCF that you can factor out again so we factor out our 1 minus x squared that leaves us with and the reason why we wrote the 1 so when you remove this by division you still have one that doesn't go away whenever you divide something you can't ever get 0 unless you start with 0 so when we're factoring your terms never disappeared the smallest they can become is 1 so we get 1 minus x squared 1 plus y squared and that's something that we can separate the variable on we can move our Y's on one side X to the other side with the DX and integrate try it I'm gonna go a little quickly on this because we've had a lot of experience with a lot of these differential equations and doing the integration techniques so we're about ready to emigrate use a table whenever you get one over one plus y squared you can do tricks up if you really want to but if all possibly use a table if you memorize that this is a tan inverse on the right hand side will certainly split this up as 1 over x squared minus x squared of x squared which gives us negative x to the negative 1 minus x plus c1 this is we're gonna leave at C we're not going to have to change on this one so if we clean it up just a bit Y would equal if tan inverse of y equals this chunk then y equals tangent itself of this junk that's negative 1 over X minus X plus C that's a really nice way doesn't to solve that but the point of this problem wasn't wasn't this we've done those techniques before it was sometimes you can get stuff to fit even when it looks like it doesn't think about factoring things that make a product for you hmm that's about all I need to know on that one the last one deceivingly simple problem is it's not hard yeah of course we're going to separate our variables so if we divide both sides we get a 1 y squared divided by Y Squared's 1 we get 1 over Y squared dy if we integrate we get the integral of Y to the negative 2 dy equals integral DX which is integral of 1 DX which is just X not a problem on the left hand side we get negative Y to the negative 1 yeah this we write as a fraction if we call it C 1 because we'll have an A up there just a moment so we'll get one or y equals negative X minus c1 if we reciprocate we get one over negative x minus so you want to hope it's making sense then we probably call this thing C and get one over C arbitrary constant minus X that is a general solution that is the general solution a difference equation but I want you to consider something else once you consider this what life is zero you can't get away with zero from here it's impossible because your numerator is 1 there's no way that you're gonna plug in any number and get y equals zero verify that that you can't you can't get it so it's impossible but consider this if you took y equals zero the derivative of Y would still be zero so we'd say hey does that satisfy this remember the very first thing we did was plug in stuff to make sure it worked at our difference equation would say dy DX is zero y squared would be zero squared because Y is zero yes zero equals zero yes that's a solution there are sometimes solutions that do not appear in your general solution it's not even possible to get it there you know still solutions those are called singular solutions so it there they can be very hard to find a lot of times with easy ones you can look at it and go oh yeah if if I imagine something like y equals zero the derivative is still zero and I would satisfy this they're easy to see on basic ones or easier to see but they do happen I just need to make you aware of that that this while awesome doesn't necessarily give you all of the solutions there are some singular ones out there that you'd have to find a different way or kind of reverse engineer that that equation see what you can plug in like guess and check the way through it anyway that is separate that's solving differential equations by separation of variables or separable equations I hope it made sense I hope you're excited to learn some more about this because the next video we're gonna deal with some initial value problems and see about doing this technique with initial values and how to get rid of that general arbitrary sorry the arbitrary constant by using this true value and where to do that so I'll see you for the next video on that you
