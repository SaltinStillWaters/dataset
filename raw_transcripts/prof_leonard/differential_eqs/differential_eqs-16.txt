Transcript for: Introduction to Linear Differential Equations and Integrating Factors (Differential Equations 15)
hey I hope you're ready for another video this is a good one man I love this technique we're gonna learn some more techniques about how to solve some some differential equations it's ordinary different differential equations and this one's just to me it's fascinating because we we sort of use a lot of really cool clever stuff to make these differential equations solvable and the difference the places we're talking about fall into this class called linear differential equations specifically linear first-order differential equations so you've got a differential equation some derivatives in there it's first-order so there's only the first derivative and linear we're going to talk about what that means so in this technique we're going to learn some pretty neat stuff one of my favorite techniques I really enjoy doing it because it's it's sort of like crew fighting a puzzle like you like finding the missing piece of a puzzle and that's really how I want you to think of solving these linear first-order differential equations is you have this piece and what we're going to get to is what this piece is and you're trying to make it fit something and there's a missing piece to it we'll talk all about that as we go through so a new technique it's pretty cool it's not separable those are very straightforward this is kind of kind of going around the problem to solve it it's different with the different logic and this technique even though it looks kind of weird at first we use this idea of finding a missing piece to make it work a lot in differential equations so let's talk about it let's talk about what linear is how it's different from separable what these two things mean and then they move on to what I mean by a missing piece so that's what we're going with it we've got linear it's a different technique than separable we're going to talk about how to find a missing piece I'm going to spend a long time on why it works any teacher can tell you how to do it but I'm gonna tell you why it works we're gonna basically go through the process I would call it a proof or anything I'm gonna show you though through an example and through some logical thinking about why this is working for us and why you take this e to some integral of what in the world and that works magic none of this is magic we'll talk about that link why this stuff works so what we know already is that with some very basic differential equations we can just integrate both sides very good we're fine with these other types of difference of equations that are called separable we can move our Y variables on one side and our experts on the other side integrate both sides and those are very straightforward those two techniques the first one being just integrate if you don't have any wise in there or separate and then integrate if you do have some Y's that are being multiplied and that's what's separable equations work was this class of difference of equations where you have a function of X times a function of Y and we can sometimes factor to make that happen where you can't get the function of Y on one side with the dy the function of X on the other side with the DX and just straight-up integrate we did that a lot I'm not going to revisit that that was in the last several videos well linear is a different class linear says what if you don't have things that are being multiplied as function of x times a function of Y what if instead you have a first order differential equation where you have a y being multiplied times some function of x times another or sorry plus another function of X well these are called linear because you have just a single Y Y to the first power instead that linear so remember what linear equations look like like 3x plus 5 something multiplied times a variable plus something else that's why that's called linear so we have a function of x times y to the first power power plus another function of X and generally we'll consider these not to be factorable so that you can separate them I'll show you the first example where it is I'll show you both ways just verify we get the same exact answer but in general these are not separable you can't if there's no wiser rigor you can't generally just factor out a Y and divided by Y that's that's what we're talking about we're also not talking about where that's a constant and that's a constant that's a coefficient that has no variable X because then that would be separable you'd have like 3y plus 2 okay we just move the whole thing over if you want to that's not what we're talking about here we're talking about on legit function of x times y plus another function of X it could be a constant over here but it doesn't have to be can't have variables that's what linear is that's what this class of differential equations is talking about is where it's not separable you have function of x times y plus function of X so let's talk about this idea what we're what we're thinking here well if we can get this piece moved so again kind of the same logic of organize your Y's together so get your function of Y on one side with your dy/dx well if we do that I know that's a plus sign I don't really care about the sign so much it could be plus or minus I'm just writing it so we don't have to worry about it being a minus so yeah I know from here you'd subtract not concerned about it if you can write this the idea is if you can write this as your first derivative which we're talking about first ORS it's got to be the first order derivative here with this function of x times y the only Y that should be up there if it falls in this class if you can write those on one side and a function of X on the other side so we're kind of separating the variables not separable and that they're not multiplied together you can't completely separate them because there's X's right here that's why that's that's not considered a separable equation you can't divide have a product times some other function of X and have the Y's on one side x another side it's not we're talking about well when we are talking about is getting this the out of the power one y variable with that function X on one side added or subtracted to or from that dy/dx at first derivative and then another X's or constants or whatever on the other side here's the big point about what we're trying to do here and this is this seems like magic the first time you see it this works that is awesome it is awesome we're gonna focus right now on what the idea is why we would approach the problem this way and how it works not just but how to do it how it works so let's imagine that you have a linear first order differential equation and you you could go ahead and subtract that function that has Y in it on one side so you've Group this you have your X's this part should be easy because if this is all X's then we should be able to just integrate it if we're going to integrate both sides we know that we have the first-order difference equation we're gonna have to integrate some time to to go to our actual function of Y or to an equation that has that actual function of Y in it even implicitly well on the right hand side when we perform that integral that should be easy sounds very easy because we're gonna integrate on the left hand side here's the thought behind it if you look at the left hand side this sort of looks familiar where you have a derivative of Y there's something missing up front talk about that whole heart behind this problem this derivative of Y but then the Y appears without a derivative and it's added together go that man that looks familiar I remember there's one class called calculus and we had these things like that had X's and Y's all wrapped up and we were still able to take a derivative but why wasn't defined explicitly it was defined it was defined implicitly this looks like very similar to the result of implicit differentiation and that's what we're gonna talk about we're gonna treat this as a result of a product rule with implicit differentiation I'll show you that right now so if that looks familiar let's try that man let's try to make a day let's try to make that fit the result of implicit differentiation using the product rule let me show you real quick just to make sure they were on the same page here so let's just pretend that you had you know what I'm not gonna use P and Q that'd be a mistake because I want you to see what what the P is actually okay because it's gonna go over here and then it's going to explain what the world are doing so let me call this R and s if you remember when you do an implicit derivative and if you don't you should go back to the calculus one and watch that video on how to do implicit differentiation because it's huge for this well we're do understand that looks very similar to the result I'll show you right now if you were to take the derivative of both sides on the right hand side it's very easy there's no why's there's no nothing we would just do s prime of X on the stuff right now I want you to focus on this if the right hand side is just the derivative of some function that's what Q of X is so Q of X is just the derivative of some function that's why it's so easy because we just do an integral and we get right back to what this s of X is so so right now Q of X is s prime of X do an integral you get back Q of X I hope that makes sense on the left hand side well because Y is implicitly defined Y is this function of X that we don't know right now that's a product rule that's a function of X this is why R it's represents a function of X remember in first order differential equations Y is treated as the dependent variable on some independent variable X this has X's in somewhere well by a product rule we would say ok the the derivative of I'm going to do it a little backwards because it's going to fit our model I usually do the derivative of the first times a second plus the first time through the second I'm a flip flop that so the product rule says take the derivative of one of them leave the other one plus two take the derivative of the other one and leave the one you just took the derivative alone sounds confusing but take the derivative one leave the other then take the derivative one leave the other so the project can be represented this way leave the first one alone okay take the derivative of the second one got the derivative with respect to X remember Y is a function of X we're taking the derivative with respect to X on both sides it's got to match up take the derivative respect to X here taking the derivative of the back to X here that involves our chain rule so I had made the first one alone the derivative of Y with respect to X plus we got a product rule take the derivative of this our bags River and leave the Y alone that's our product rule to take the derivative the lead first one alone derivative the second that's derivative of Y let's make X plus agree with the first one times a second leaving that alone but right here because it's a chain rule the chain rule says all right well what would you how do you represent that what's the derivative of Y one but then you get that x dy/dx by the chain rule or just think about it this way this says alright this is the derivative of Y with respect to X that's the same exact notation it says it's same as anything this right there is a straight-up product rule on implicit differentiation and it looks a whole lot like that here's the thing I want you to notice right now I want you to notice that if this is linear and it's supposed to be sort of this it's supposed to be the result of some sort of inaudible of implicit differentiation there's a missing piece the missing piece is that this hasn't a function of X in the front of our derivative and this one doesn't so how the hell no rule that we're gonna we're gonna fit this well we're going to find that missing piece furthermore this thing right here this P of X this is representing a derivative of somehow some function so when were when we're doing this there's two ideas the rillette isn't you can pop in your head number one is that when we have a linear first order differential equation we are going to treat the left hand side as the result of some sort of a product rule of implicit differentiation we are going to try to right now find a missing piece it's going to complete that so it doesn't quite match up so we have this thing like okay this is the result of product rule it's missing something I'm gonna show you right now how to find that missing piece and why it works next part is that if this P of X is the result of a derivative I'm gonna somehow use the integral of this piece remember this is a derivative I'm using integral that piece to help find and the missing thing that I want well you can sort of see that right now this is the missing piece okay this is the derivative of something this is the antiderivative of that piece it doesn't match up perfectly because we're gonna see why and when I go through another champ like our very first example explain where L is coming from - but it doesn't quite match up perfect because this thing needs to go away we need to divide everything by that in order to see it but the ideas are very very similar the ideas are you're missing a piece here we're gonna find it what's that piece relate to this piece relates to the integral the antiderivative of this piece so whatever we're going to multiply here make this work it's going to relate to the integral of that piece we're see in just a moment so little bit of a recap because I know that's a lot of words and a short amount of time we're no longer talking about separable equations we're no longer talking about just integrating on both sides we're low beyond that right now we're trying to try to take a linear differential equation first-order where we can structure this as looking like the result of a product rule has a missing piece in well we see that this is really really close but we're missing something we're gonna find that the right-hand side should be easy just an integral so here's our our steps on how to do it number one we need to get the Y it might have some X's with it that's not a problem easy to deal with get the Y term on one side added or subtracted to or from the first derivative the dy/dx on the right hand side so they get the y and the dy on one side on the right hand side you're just gonna have a function of X we can integrate really easy now left-hand side don't just integrate the left-hand side it's not gonna work you can't we can't really do that we can right then appropriately and we'd be missing we need to have our dy/dx is all screwed up so we can't just integrate the left-hand side you're not just integrate left instead we're gonna find the missing piece to create the result of a product rule that's what I was talking about here if we do a product rule this is really close it's just missing something let's talk about that missing piece I'm gonna erase this but this is an important concept you need to have a concept in your head right now that we're going to try to make this thing fit the result of the product rule we're trying to make this thing fit the result of the product rule it's just that it's missing something we're gonna focus on that for the rest of our our video right now what we call that missing piece all the row X so it looks like a lowercase letter P I don't care what you call it the idea is this is gonna represent our missing piece and we're gonna talk about what this missing piece needs to have so the first thing if it's missing a piece we don't just get to multiply in one term and leave the rest of it so if you're going to multiply by this missing piece that we know I had up here we know we're gonna have to have it it's missing something or it's written in a different format we need we need to sort of undo it man I should have done that do it again the rial going today I didn't want to but I think it's it's important for you see the reason why this doesn't have it and this does is because in order to get our linear first order differential equations in the proper form we divide by the arm so really what this is doing is dividing everything by our legs and this can disappear which is why the missing piece isn't so easy to find whether you can't just do an integral of that R prime of a I mean this student intro that's gonna be right there it's not because in order to get the missing piece in order to have it missing you're really dividing it so what we're going to be doing is we're gonna find this row of X and we're going to be multiplying it here's what the row of X has to do the row of X has to be something that when I multiply on both sides which would distribute them that row of X has to have our original function in it because it's kind of canceled that out but to get back what we really want so our row of X has to have our original function in it also when I take the derivative of row next element is they have to have the original function in it but the derivative has to somehow be the derivative of that see what the world what function what function in the world can you take the derivative of it that not only does it give you itself back robux has to be has to have that in it it's got to cancel what function the world can you take the derivative of it and it gives you self back there's not a folks there's nothing that I mean nothing does that nothing takes the crap nothing takes the derivative itself and gives you itself it gives it that was a weird way to say you take the derivative of a function and it gives you itself back you're talking about e to some function of X but not only that it also has to give you this piece the derivative of it when you take the derivative of e to the function of X yeah it gives you back the function of X either the function X but it also gives you that first derivative this is how we're gonna find our row of X so I'm going through a little bit more detail here so the recap on our recap I suppose is this when we when we have this as the result of a product rule and and we think it's got a missing piece well it has a missing piece this thing is missing because to get in the right structure we divided by that function and you can see them in about 10 minutes or so after I show you what we need here well to undo that idea we're gonna have to multiply by something that's something that row of X it has to have our original function in it this original piece that we we had in our root function or our equation before it took the derivative it's got to have that it's got to cancel that also what it has to have is it's got to be able to take the derivative of that piece and give me this R prime of X it's got to have that as well we call that row of X and here's the ideas so we're gonna have our linear first order differential equation we're gonna multiply it by some thing it's gotta be on all three returns because you're multiplying both sides sure we can multiply both sides as long as it distributes goes to everything and here's what Rho of X needs to do I'm just gonna go through slowly exactly what I was talking about so linear we're treating like a project all the implicit differentiation we know we want to get everything on one side no problem that's the looking for the product or we're not integrating we're finding the missing piece so to speak we're gonna call it Rho of X here's what we needed to do number one we need something that repeats itself so we need something that because this is a product rule here the result of a product rule we need something so that when you take the derivative of it or you don't take the derivative of it it's in both places so we need something that repeats itself I hope that makes sense you do something so that when you take the derivative of the first times a second and the derivative the second times the first it's in both places well you to a function of X does that so the idea we needed to repeat itself when you don't have the derivative of the first and when you do have the derivative of the first it's in both places let's let's talk about either f of X so our missing piece is gonna be an exponential it's gonna have be in it number two number two remember that this is a derivative of Y implicitly so when we do the derivative of Y in a product rule implicitly we don't have a Y here we do have a y here which means that our Rho of X if this is the derivative of Y implicitly our Rho of X is the the function itself without taking the derivative that means this piece must be found within the derivative of Rho of X I'm gonna say that again cuz I can that can lose you I know the first time I went through this just show me how to do it because I'm not really grasping what's going on what's going on is you're trying to complete a product rule you have any missing piece we know that this thing has to be some a derivative of something that repeats where when you take the derivative and when you don't you get the same thing in there well that's a neat e to the X e to the f of X whatever that happens to be second piece because dy/dx is a derivative based on implicit differentiation and the chain rule I'm gonna write it simply so derivative with implicit differentiation I'm not writing everything out there but because of this because of your thinking that you're okay if this is the result of a derivative of Y based on implicit differentiation and a product rule then this is the derivative of the Y piece that would mean that Rho of X itself is the piece of X that you did not take the derivative of now you're going to see you see why that's important at the very end when I go through this explanation because at the very end you're gonna go oh my gosh if that's a result of a product rule then the thing that it was taken approach ruled of has to have a row of X in it and we don't have to change it and it's really nice so this is something we just want to note in our head never episode number one we need something to repeat itself e to a bunch of extra pieces so number two this is the derivative of Y based on a twisted invitation which means that this was not taking it well this was not a derivative this is going to be in your original function original equation number three number three okay so if this is base number y this thing you did not take a derivative to get this thing then that derivative repeat that when you do the derivative this thing repeats then this is missing this is this is this is this is I won't say missing we just found a missing piece but this thing right here needs to be based on the derivative of Rho of X so this right here was the derivative of Y this you didn't take a derivative to get that but because it's a product rule this whole thing needs to be from the derivative of your role of X that means that P of X needs to come from that derivative of Rho of X I hope I'm making sense to you right now when I'm saying it I'm like may I hope these people get it I can't read you right now so if you if you understand raise your hand did you did you actually set it be awesome but if that thing right here wasn't taking the derivative of it's taking the derivative right now that P of X has to come from that so let's the subtle about that if P of X comes from some function e to the F X how do you take the derivative of e to the f of X well the derivative of e to the f of X gives you back e to the f of X here but then you take the derivative of the inside by the chain rule so let's do a little bit of manipulation of this if you were to take the derivative only is purple so you see the derivative coming up if you were to take the derivative remember that's what this is the derivative says hey you leave the first alone derivative of Y you take the derivative the first you leave the Y so this piece is the derivative of robe X well we would take the derivative through the robots on the right hand side the derivative of each of f of X gives you a to the f of X times that prime of X guys that's exactly what's taking place right here this side is the derivative of Rho of X it has to be derivative the first times the second plus the first times during the second one of the first times during the second plus the derivative the first kind of second remember this is all coming from some function times y when we take a derivative derivative of the second the first that's here plus the first time through the second that's here but check it out this is your row originally remember that that's helping we did this row of x equals e and f of X you've got back your road that's this piece this is that piece x or y that's going to be there because of that that product or you're going to have that what that means is that P of X is equal to the derivative of that exponent on e the P of X must equal this you okay what's that mean to me well what that should mean to you is that if P of x equals the derivative of that exponent if you want to find the exponent all you have to do is integrate P of X now if this is getting confusing to you remember that P of X is a thing that you're given so if you look back at our original form here the only thing you're giving is the right hand side which is super easy to do an integral and on left hand side that's the only thing that's got X's in it there's nothing here you have a function of x times y so what we're trying to do is find this missing piece before realizing is that it's going to be easy to a function of X okay that goes in all three terms that e to a function of X the only thing we wouldn't know about it is what the function of X hat sounds funny what the function of X we're doing what the function of X actually is well that function of X that has to be on the function that when you take the derivative of it it gives you P of X so if we integrate P of X obviously if we integrate V of X when you take a derivative of it whatever we integrate and a derivative it's gonna give you P of X so if we know that the function of X is such that when you take it to Rivet it gives you P of X integrate then the function of X is just an integral of P P of X so what that means is this our missing piece number one has to repeat e needs some function number to this function of X this this row X it's going to be here and it's going to it's going to have this piece because it's based on the implicit derivative it's going to be here as something that you didn't take the derivative of and it's gonna be here something you did take the derivative of it it has to repeat which is where we get the e but also when you take the derivative of an exponential it's giving you the exponential back that's here but it's also taking the derivative of your exponent since that's a why it's not be some X this has to be the piece that when you take the derivative of the exponential it gives you that piece of the exponential gives me this so the integral of this gives me my exponent the integral of this piece must be the exponent so that when I take a derivative exponent it gives me back this let's just double check is this something that when I take a derivative of it it's going to repeat sure see the X is this something I want to take a derivative of it it would give me P of X back well by the fundamental theorem of calculus if you take a derivative of an integral it gives you that inside piece over an interval that's what we're doing so the derivative of this row X would give us Rho of X in both places one where you didn't take tribute one where you did furthermore when you take the derivative of this it's going to give you P of X back the derivative of the integral so the inside the riveted exponent would get you T of X it's weird but this is completing the puzzle it's such a cool idea you're going looks like progr have you make it work let's multiply by something multiplied by something that has to repeat is X multiplied by something that when you don't take a derivative of it because this is implicit derivative the second only derivative of Y gives you dy/dx this is not a derivative here of anything and then when you do take the derivative the derivative of it it's in both places we got that but more because it's based on either the f of X the derivative f of X is this guy so if you're given this guy just integrate you've got your exponential right there what I want to do right now I want to show you the result that you're going to get this is the piece where some students struggle with like well how in the world is the this the result but check it out your result is really easy your result here says this if you can write this so basically just multiply that load X if you can write this as something is some result of the product rule then the product itself that gave you this result this is why I said it's like 30 times this piece in the first term here you did not take the derivative of which means that the equation that you did take the derivative of has to have Rho of X in it it's got to know the way this is the result of a product rule which means you have a product so derivative of this oh wait but we made that's the derivative of the same piece that's the piece itself sloppy over there so what it comes down to is that this piece right here is the result of some product rule what's the product then well if this is the first times the derivative the second then that's their first piece if this is the derivative the first time a second that's the second piece done that's that's it some textbooks say well yeah so we'll do two sets here so you're not really yeah okay this is this right here this whole piece is the result of a implicit derivative based on the variable X and that's an equal to right hand side so they're not showing the the integral yet they're gonna do the next step so if you've ever seen that before you I don't I don't know what that means here's what it means it means when you take a derivative of this product you're going to use the product rule notice how I've done nothing to the right hand side this said this kind of wraps that this up and says this right here is the derivative implicitly I'm the variable X of a product it's a that's that's exactly we talked about it's the reverse of - so it says this thing is the result of a derivative based on X of the product rule boom right hand side hasn't done anything and then they would go and say hey do you remember fundamental theorem of calculus if you have a derivative then if you integrate both sides the integral is gonna kill the derivative so then they go integrate both sides okay so Rho of X times y would equal the integral of Rho of X cube X DX notice all exes should be a very basic in howtobasic sometimes they can get hard and then do this just divide by Rho of X to solve for y that's the idea I want to show you right now with an example I'm gonna walk through them I'm just gonna race this this little piece I want you to see it in action so it's something very basic and what I'm gonna try to do is we're going through this is I'm going to I'm gonna show you each little piece that I've explained for the last like 30 minutes in this I'd like to show you with an example how this stuff works and we'll see a little bit more about the Y as we're going through so again my idea is that to show you why or where this is in this sort of a problem so this can look very big or it can be like man that's a lot of symbols and there's no examples so I wanna well I really want you to follow this don't skip this one okay let's see how this works what this stuff and I'll show you each of the pieces were going through it so obviously not a differential equation we aren't going to get this back when we're done with our problem so I want to show you that what we're getting when we're talking about linear first order differential equations is based on stuff like that it's based on the result of a product rule so let's take a derivative right now let's go take a groove on both sides on the left hand side as I mentioned before so this is our theory and practice on the left hand side you have a product it's an implicit function of Y so we're gonna take the derivative of Y treat it as a function of X it's involving the chain rule left hand side we would get you know what I'm going to do it this way so pattern I'm going to take the leave the first and the derivative of the second so X cubed times the derivative of the second would be dy DX plus because you have a product rule the derivative of the first I could take a derivative correctly that'd be awesome derivative of the first times the second on the right hand side the derivative of 2 a 2 give us to yourself I'm just taking a derivative on both sides of just implicit differentiation derivative by little of the second times the first or leave the first loan to rip the second plus the first during the first time to say completely mess it up but leave this one alone and River that guy then ribbon this guy leave that one alone that's how approachable essentially works doesn't matter what order you have additions commutative we just do it this way the structure of best for our linear first order diverse equations but then the derivative the right-hand side is also important now you're going to say to me well look that doesn't look like the bat because this doesn't have that piece exactly that's why we have to find this missing piece so in order to get this watch what's happening in order to get this to look like that you're going to have to divide by X cubed you're gonna have to divide that means that we're going to have to multiply to get that piece back that's what will next Cosgrove X decimal to fine so let's divide everything by X cube to make it fit this so you see what's going on let's just do that so we've divided everything by execute that means we're just going to have a first order derivative then we're gonna have okay three over X yeah we get to simplify y equals 2x look how it doesn't it doesn't quite look like the same result of the product rule that we have so we're missing something right now we're missing our function over here and we're not able just to integrate right now you couldn't even hear you have a sulfur do you wanna do an integral but that's not the idea the idea here is that okay let's go ahead and find that missing piece so check out what's gonna happen we're going to be multiplying by something we just divided so to undo this we're gonna have to multiply so remember you wouldn't be given this you'd be given this this is where it comes from this fits our formula so we're trying to make it back to that we divided let's find something to multiply by what do we know about it we know that when we multiply an equation it's gotta go everywhere both sides means you're going to distribute it's got to go everywhere so the derivative what we want to take has to repeat itself so our row of X is equal to it needs to repeat itself it's gonna have an e in it the ITO function of X repeats when you take a derivative nextly though we know that P of X is just this function 3 over X it's just that piece this is Q of X this is easy you could take an integral of this right now you don't even have to but you could take a nibble of this right now this right here is our P of X the function of X that's right in front of our Y to the first power making this linear here's what we need to also understand we need an e because the derivative Eve repeats so we need it in both places to satisfy our our product or the result of the particle but nextly this has to be the derivative of the exponent of this function you see when you take the derivative an exponential you get an exponential back but then you take the derivative that's what this has to be we talked about it right here we said yes you're going to multiply everything by something that something has to repeat obviously but this piece this piece must come from the derivative of your Rho of X this wasn't from a derivative this one is leave the first alone to the second take it through the first thing the second loan this piece must come from the derivative of the exponential so this piece must come from must give us this when I take a derivative so if I want to take the integral of P of X this would say yeah hey if you take the derivative of my exponential it's going to be 3 over X derivative of integrals give us I can do each other there being sort of inverses all right what that means is that our row of X is equal to e if you're worried about man I'm gonna have a lot of Exponential's in there yeah you could put a lot not a lot of times some of the times they often I would say you're gonna have an Ln so the integral of 3 over X is 3 Ln x over 3 is a constant you pull it out 1 over X gives you Ln X we can move exponents hey inverse functions they're being composed we would get execute what what no wait a minute you mean the thing that I divided in order to make it fit this form is exactly the freaking thing I'm gonna multiply right now and yes that's all you're doing is you're finding the missing piece the thing that you would have divided away here from the result of your product rule that maybe did that form that's the exact thing that you're multiplying by 2 back to the parole form I hope you see that it's fascinating it's amazing it's the missing piece it's the the link that says oh yeah you know what you're right it is the result of a portable I just have to kind of put it back there it just so happens that this always does it why because Exponential's always repeat and when you take derivatives or not they're going to be in both places it has to be that the integral of P of X is our exponential because when you take a derivative of exponential e to the F X comes back but then you take the derivative of your exponent so I'm doing that that derivative gives us our exponent then we say ok that's that's not bad let's go ahead and let's multiply everything so we had this we just learned it should be kind of cementing your head right now that when you have just the dy/dx you're missing a part worth finding that missing part that extra P whose derivative gives us back the original function and whose derivative exponent is exactly this take the interval you find that exponent we now found that it's X cubed let's multiply everything by that X cubed this execute can look like it's coming out of left field if you do not understand this if you were just taught just take the integral put it on top of B you're good to go yeah you are why who knows this is why because when you structure your problem like this where dy/dx doesn't have anything in front of it when you structure it like that you've divided you've divided by what's kind of from the original equation of that products you've taken it away we're putting it back which is why you're multiplying it we're putting back in such a way that it's repeating you that's of X and that when you take the derivative of exponential based on the chain rule you get that piece the P of X that's the derivative of your exponent so take it in a refined X for me watch what happens X cubed dy DX is still there it's not a problem this right here is going to give you x squared here that's completely gone you get two equal signs of maryland's you get 2 and here's the major thought if you were able to do that and it will work every time if you're able to do that then this has to be the result of a product rule but think about what product rules are from fools have one piece in each term that you didn't take a derivative right those two pieces as a product and you're done say that again each one of these terms has a piece from a product that you didn't take the derivative of that's why this is important since dy/dx is the derivative that's the derivative of Y then this is not the derivative of the X function it's the X function itself it's not really dyslexia if you put on top to bottom as I can't use that as excuse it's kind of orgasm each one of these terms has a piece that you didn't take the derivative of it when performing the product rule since this is the derivative Y this is not the derivative of the function of X this is a bunch of X itself since this is the derivative of the function of X notice that derivative of x cubed gives us 3x squared then this is not the derivative of a function of Y is the function of Y itself so this piece came from a derivative with respect to X of that product that's what that means how have you undo derivatives with respect to X you take an integral with respect to X on both sides integrals are new derivatives by fundamental theorem of calculus we would have X cubed Y on the right hand side you have a bunch of X it's easy to take an integral a function of X if it's possible to define a great and that's exactly exactly what we started with that is the way that this whole technique of solving linear first order differential equations works it's so awful to learn it if you don't understand what you're doing and you are structuring this as the result of a product because if that's the case you get your answer really easy look here look here put them together you're done that then just integrate both sides and the derivative drops off so that's the result of the derivative of a product rule there's the products they have to be when you do an integral on both sides your derivative with respect to X is gone you have the actual function itself and can you solve it for y well of course you can't we we will have plus C's in here as well I'm just trying to give you this as as a representation of the this technique and I hope I've done a good job of that that's we talked about where our so we talked about how we need to repeat the X we talked about the derivative of the exponent means to be in that second term so when we integrate the X function of that second term functions right the X to the second term we get our exponent and then I showed you how that that works so what I'm gonna do now is do just one example we're going to talk about one example in two different ways one with separable a separable equation and then one with this technique we'll see it comes up the same exact answer it's gonna be really nice I really hope that this has made sense to you that you see that this technique is just undoing a product rule but because we have a missing piece here you have to multiply to get that back once you do pretty easy in your head right now ask these questions do I understand why we have e to a function why it's gotta be interested that the answer that hopefully you said right now is well it's got to be because when I take the derivative or not I have to have the same thing in there because I'm multiplying all three spots hopefully understand them do you understand that the first term here the first term based on its product rule this is not the result of a derivative this is this is the result of a trivet this is not generous enough do you understand that because this is an exponential this piece is just the result of the derivative of the exponent does that make sense if that makes sense integrating this would give you the exponent of rule of X so let's try that one example you might have to go through this a couple times to really get the flow of it do not cheat yourself right now don't be like yeah it's all I gotta do is do a to the integral P of X sometimes that's true but you know what that thought process is going to hinder you later because this idea of multiplying this equation to get something that you want is is use a lot so if you sure cut yourself now it's probably not gonna make a whole lot of sense later so spend some time to really grasp these concepts I hope I've done my job to explain that to you I know I took long enough let's do that one example I was talking about and then we'll we'll go on and the next video and I'm gonna give you a ton of examples on how to do this let's go through an example together I'm gonna do this two different ways I'm gonna do it one way as separable equations by separating our variables and the other way as a linear first order differential equations so can you write that as something and use separable equations you can remember the separable equations have dy/dx on one side and a function that you can move and separate your Y's on one side and exit on the other side this is actually one of them you know that doesn't have a function of X in it exactly so if you treat this whole thing as a function of Y itself times one as the function of X divided by 2 minus y you don't need the 1 there but you get DX let's integrate both sides we should be pretty comfortable with separable equations on the left hand side we're going to have a natural logarithm because we have 1 over Y to the first power we can use it you so it's gonna have a negative in there ever seen that so when we get this yeah Ln absolute value of 2 minus y but because the derivative of to minus y is negative 1 you got a negative by au substitution right hand side we have X plus C I have not shown you where to put the plus C when we were doing our our technique over here on linear I'll show you how to do that let me do this example in just a couple minutes so we do it a second way now we know we know how to solve this stuff we know that we're going to use an e we know we get rid of that negative I don't typically like to plug in right now I'll separate this I'll use a plus and minus so I'm separating my equate and my my X 1 remember we have negative X minus C so we can write this as e to the negative x times e to the negative C I'm also dropping my absolute value put in the plus or minus I'm gonna wrap this whole thing up as a gigantic C and now since we have an initial value I can plug this in right now and solve for C that'd be pretty easy to do if I plug in 0 for Y and 0 for X we get C was - okay great so we have 2 minus y equals to e to the negative x let's solve for y if I divide both sides by negative 1 we get Y of X is positive 2 minus 2 e to the negative x done now we're going to do this a different way so separable equations this was separable because we can have a Y's on one side and our function of X and the other just integrate both sides no problem now let's look at the as the into the the linear differential equation is as well does it dip the form do you have a derivative for riveted plus a function of x times y constants can be considered functions of X so D of a function of X yeah if there's no X's its call it one equal to a function of X there's no X's all that the constant that it is this would be fall under that class of linear is very basic but that's linear let's see how it works so option two right now I'm gonna write out what the P of X is how to find the row of X I would suggest you do that every time I do it every time I'm gonna do it every time so number one doesn't fit linear so what you think in what linear means linear means you have Y to the first power up there somewhere it means you can write this as a derivative plus some function of x times y or y equals no lies on the right hand side so that that fits that if that's the case then you're gonna have something that's being multiplied by that Y that we call P of X so P of X right now is just one one that's what the event Q of X would be 2 you don't need to write that down that's just gonna play along you're not gonna do much with that besides integrated after you find your missing piece the thing we're multiplying by so linear yes what's your P of X the thing that's in front of Y once you've put it in this form that I can't stress that enough you might have to multiply or divide or do something to fit it in the linear so if you had a function of X up front you're gonna have to divide by that if you get stuff floating around or wise in several places you might have a factor that you have to multiply you might have to divide it this once you fit that then you can find P of X you need to write that down or right in your head or make a mental note or something it's gotta have just the dy/dx for you to start identifying your P of X it's got to be in this form before you do anything else that's why I gave you that for now your movement is not all that hard to find all we need to understand is that it repeats that's e to a function of X the function of X when you take a derivative of it it's kind of if you want it's got to give me your P of X so our Rho is equal to a function that repeats whose derivative of the exponent gives me P of X or in this case gives me 1 that means that our romex is e to the X let's talk about when you need a plus seen when you don't when you find the role of X you do not need a plus C so you don't need this the reason why you don't actually be up here the reason why you don't need that is because you can separate that like I should draw it over here you can separate that and get e to the C that's a constant that can be divided on both sides and just incorporated with another constant that you're gonna get when you're getting rid the right-hand side so long story short you need no plus C's over here you just need a plus C on the right-hand side that will have everything for you so do not worry about it you just since that row of X is everywhere I hope that makes sense to you since that row of X gets multiplied here and here and here and that's a constant it's not 0 e to a C is never 0 you could just divide it divide it divide it so we don't need either the C we don't need that constant because you just divide it on both sides anyway all right what we are going to need is really a plus C only on the right hand side so we do not need a plus senior now let's double check let's see if this works when you take the derivative of e to the X do you get e to the X back yes when you take the derivative of the exponent X do you get that do you get the thing that's in front of Y because X is 1 yes that that's gonna work for us so we're now going to multiply this on all three sides all three terms both sides is going to distribute so we'll multiply e to the X e to the X and e to the X you know where most people forget it it's right here they forget to multiply on the right hand side because they figured on due to product really you are but remember when you divided we did I erased it but you divided on all three terms where we need to multiply all three terms so we're putting that missing piece back double check your work right now double check that when you take a derivative of e to the x times y with respect to X the derivative of the second and the first to leave the first role owned over the second that's it that's a chain rule with implicit differentiation so we have e the extruder the y is derivative 100 swag bags plus because of a product derivative of the first that's PDX derivative the exponent that's one leave a second one alone that's why that's pretty cool why do we get to go down to here so quickly without doing any it doesn't look like we do any work is because you just built this as the result of a product rule you just find the product since product rules work this way where you don't take the derivative of one piece in each of the terms just find the two pieces you didn't take the derivative oh and that has screech your product you didn't take the derivative of e^x it's there you didn't take the derivative of Y it's there that way when you do don't take the derivative times through the second or take the derivative times not the driven the second chic it's your result you get your brother give your brother the result from your products were right there on the right hand side he had this to me the X we haven't anything with that and what this is saying plain English is hey here's the product that when you take the derivative with respect to X you're going to get this piece now if that's the derivative how undue derivatives yeah it rolls with respect to X on both sides this is why we had to have Y as a function of X because when you're when you're doing this product you're treating that as a function of X and you're gonna have to undo that that integral with the DX to match up the derivative with respect to X and you have to do it on both sides and that's exes so it's couple matchup on the left hand side you just took an integral of a derivative calculus says that those are gone on the right hand side we get okay what's the integral of to e to the X I love integral Z DX to e to the X you do not need a plus C here but you do need a plus C here you don't need a plus C here because if you did it you would just subtract it on the right hand side from the other plus C and you get a different plus C so you'll need one arbitrary constant and as a matter of fact you could plug in that initial value initial condition right now so if x is 0 Y is 0 that's what that says 1 times 0 is 0 2 times 1 is 2 if I subtract 2 on both sides C equals negative 2 so well let's see we could do that and then if you divide everything by e to the X so if you divide every both sides by e DX notice that we would get go on we get why there's a fractional right this is two different fractions that's gone that's gone that gives us 2 and this is minus 2 e to the negative x so in both cases we get Y by 2 2 minus sign minus 2 over X is the same thing as 2 e to the negative x it is exactly the same answer in both cases it's how it works the what this one because this could be classified as both a separable and a linear now which way is easier that questions are relevant right now the questions are relevant because in most linear functions if you have X's actual X's there you can't write them as separable it doesn't work unless you have some factoring that you might be able to do that's the same function of ax or even removes your X's ok but in general these things are not separable so it doesn't really matter which ways easier right now they're both popping for this example in the future you don't have that option that's why we're learning this we're learning that we can write these linear first order differential equations as the result of a product rule you just need to find the product and then do integral both sides that disappears becomes very very nice I hope you like that technique it is so cool I know I talked for a really long time because I care that you get it I don't care that you just chug through and do this you need to understand the intention behind it I hope you do I hope that you this is very clear I hope it made it clearer for you next time so next video we're gonna do a whole bunch of examples much more complicated than what I've given you this was just give the idea down it's important understand the idea I hope that makes sense and I'll see you for the next video you
