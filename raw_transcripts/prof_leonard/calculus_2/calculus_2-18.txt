Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 9.5:  Showing Convergence With the Alternating Series Test, Finding Error of Sums
so let's get started on the alternating series test of course alternating series test is going to work for what type of series alternating series yes obviously so here's what a alternating series looks like what what it means an alternating series is simply a series where sequential terms alternating alternate signs so positive negative positive negative positive negative positive netive that's what gives it this alternating so it's a series where sequential terms alternate signs no problem let me give you an example of what alternating series typically look like and then I'll show show you what the alternating series test is so first uh you have seen a couple of these before they were very common in our our sequences actually now that we have a series we're not just going to be alternating the signs but we're going to be adding them together so we had alternating sequences we didn't really call them a name or anything but here uh alternating series well that's a specific section for us so here's what they look like typically there'll be some series like this one ah it's a horrible end some series like this one and there will be something in it that makes the signs alternate do you remember what we had that made the signs of our sequences alterative one that's right to some power yeah negative 1 to some power that was based on N so for us it's typically n minus one we usually not all the time we usually start with a positive term so we usually start with like uh when I plug in one I would get zero right remember how that matches typically that's going to give us netive one to zero or one so we get a positive term to start with that's normally how it happens this is your first experience with an alternating series so unlike the SE where we just list them the series is just going to add these things up so here's what it would look like what's the very first term don't at one one one yeah if you plugged in one you're going to get one over one it's going to be positive you get one would I add or subtract the next term sub subract because I plug in if I plug in two what's 2 - 1 what's 1 to the 1 1 so I'd have minus 12 so whereas a sequence would just go one NE then comma 1/2 then comma positive 1/3 then comma 1/4 what a series does it goes okay 1 - 12 + 1/3 - 1 1/4 plus 1 are you guys getting the picture here so the next one would be positive or plus 1/3 minus or /4 +5 minus and it doesn't end that's the way your alternating series will look you okay with that yeah now what's quite interesting is that this thing this thing any of these alternating series that do this they can always be written as -1 to the nus1 * some other Series where the a sub n is something that that uh is always positive so for instance the only thing that's giving this the sign change is at1 to the N minus one you guys agree with that yeah other than that the 1/ N the 1/ N is the a subn that we're talking about so in our case like more specifically this could be written as as the alternating part okay this1 nus1 * 1/ n this would be our specific thing here uh by the way what type of series is that p no yeah kind of it is it's a specific type of P series I'm sorry I said no but you're right it's a p series with P equals 1 but we had a specific name for what was it that's a harmonic Series so if that's the harmonic Series this is simply the alternating harmonic series and that's literally exactly what that is that's the here look it if that was a one that'd be har that'd be the harmonic series if I do this it's now just the alternating harmonic series does it look familiar to you it's alternating harmonic series that's what it is my point is that with any of these alternating series you can always do this you can always break off the negative one to your power and have some other a subn some other sequence that it's positive terms so F if you feel okay with that so far let me give you one more example so right now we're not really working with them we're just kind of getting the picture of what these things are like that one let's figure out a few terms here let's figure out a few terms there so what part of this is going to make our signs change what part if I cover that up do I have positive terms still absolutely I do so that's kind of interesting right so alternating series we can break off that one part that makes it negative we're going to have these positive terms so let's figure out with the first few let's do the first uh four terms this time what's the first term let's figure that out how much is how much is this when I plug in one so our first term here is going to be negative it said usually it starts off the positive doesn't have to all the time so our first term is going to be negative now we'd have one squar that's one over two fact so it's going to be one okay so -1/ 2 factorial which of course is just two but I'm going to leave it as 2 factorial so we we just keep the pattern okay I just want the first four to get the idea next one everybody am I going to get a plus or a minus plus get a plus that's right because this alternating series does that the only thing that's changing signs is this 1 to the N if I increase this to 2 the1 squ is positive one i' be adding this becomes what over very good and we can get the pattern really quick so this will be next so be negative then a plus then a minus what's going to go here here over here let's do one last one so netive plus minus plus and then what sure because we'd add the fourth term 4 S is 16 over 5 factorial and then it doesn't end goes forever and ever and ever notice this this is the same thing as some Series where we have -1 to the n * a subn where a subn is all positive terms the only thing that's changing the sign here is that1 to the end quick show hands feelc with what the alternating series do so alternating series is basically just having a negative 1 to some power that changes the signs every other sign of sequential terms now we do have What's called the alternating series test here's the test it's really straightforward it's not hard to do it uses some things that we've already talked about in this class so it's kind of nice here's the test for us four and alternating series so for some series for some series that's alternating by the way can you immediately tell that's going to be alternating series yes okay this series of course if you wanted to write the first few terms this would be a subn minus a subn plus or a I'm sorry a sub 1 a 1 - a sub 2 plus a sub 3 minus blah blah blah blah all the way till we get to a subn also what we want to what I want to tell you is that a subn itself a subn is positive terms does that make sense the only thing that's making this negative or negative is that negative 1 to a power so a subn is also positive that's the idea are you sure you're okay with that yeah the only thing that would be changing the sign would be the1 to the n minus1 in this case quick don't if you're you're right with that one okay so what I'm telling you is that an alternating series has ative 1 to a power times some other sequence that has positive terms these would all be pluses if it weren't for the negative one to a power agreed so that means that the a subn itself is going to be positive cool all right so with this as our condition if a sub n + 1 is less than or equal to a subn what's that say if a subn + 1 is less than or equal to a subn what's it tell you about the sequence from from which we get our series what's it telling you about that it is say say it louder decreasing it's decreasing can you explain why it's decreasing because the next term is smaller that's exactly right the next term is smaller do you guys understand we did this like a couple times before right do you understand this is the the term right after this one yeah if the term right after this one is smaller that means that we are decreasing so basically it says you're decreasing so if this is true for all end which means this is decreasing and the limit as n approaches Infinity is oh tell me something this is going to this is going to be good right this is us this is the thing that I have you do the first part of every single series we ever do I have you do this uh what what does this have to be do you think zero it's got to be zero now that's the that's basically the Divergence test now we don't really use a diverence test here because we don't include that negative 1 to n minus one but practically we do we use it on a subn so this is the Divergence test so basically what we're saying is hey if your series passes the Divergence test so basically look at the sequence of positive terms if your sequence of positive terms when you take a limit as n approach to Infinity equals zero and you know that the sequence of positive terms is decreasing for all n if you know that then you know that your alternating series is going to be convergent this is the test it has to be decreasing has to be decreasing I'll show you why in just a second okay let me recap this before I give you I'm not going to prove this I'll give you kind of like the graphical proof for it it's a very common sense type of idea once you see it okay so let me do like a 20 second recap to give you everything about alternating series that you really need to know first thing alternating series alternate signs for sequential terms it doesn't matter whether you start with a positive or negative typically we're going to start with a positive but it doesn't really matter what you need to know about these alternating series is they can always be broken up as -1 to some Power Times a sequence of positive terms 1 to some power time a sequence of positive terms does that make sense all you have to do for your alternating series test is first verify it's alternating verify it has one of these things does that make sense verify that if you can verify it's alternating then all you got to do is look at the limit of your sequence of positive terms look at your a subn if the limit of a subn equals z well you know what we do that anyway don't we that's a Divergence test so if the limit of a subn equals z says hey you might not be Divergent if the sequence is also decreasing so you look at the sequence of positive terms if it's decreasing which is what this says then you know it's convergent so all you got to show is that it passes the Divergence test as far as the sequence of positive terms is concerned does that make sense to you and that it's decreasing have we shown both those things at different times in this class Lots actually we were often in the habit of showing decreasing that was from monotonic bounding sequences we showed that they were decreasing we showed it for the uh integral test that was positive continuously decreasing now we're sh for alternating series just don't even worry about that though that's even part of it just look at your a subn if you can show your a subn sequence is decreasing man you're good if you can also show that the limit of a subn is n approach Infinity is zero that's the two parts of your test we've done both one's called the Divergence test most of the time one of them is just decreasing if you can show both those things then your series converges do you want to see why it converges okay remember here that what we're doing is we're adding up numbers right we're adding up numbers that alternate signs which means this are you listening we're going to start with one number we're going to subtract something right then we're going to add something then we're subtract something then we're going to add something then we're subtract something then we're going to add something then we subtract something then we're going to add something however listen carefully here's the whole Crux of this proof if your series is is decreasing then you start with a number correct let's assume it's positive it doesn't have to be it could be negative but let's assume it's positive if you subtract something it's going to go backwards right but it's not going to go to zero because what you're subtracting is smaller than what you originally have ises that make sense now you're going to add something to that aren't you but it's smaller than what you subtracted then you're going to subtract something but small what you add it and then back and forth so practically here's what it looks like you start with with let's say we start with uh start with zero here's zero after your first term do you remember this uh the the partial sums with it was the S we had that s subn for a partial sum so after your first term you'd have a sum S Sub one whatever that is you're going to have some sum because you only add you have one term make sense now because we know that this is decreasing you would subtract let's call it here and get the sum two after two terms that's what your sum would be do you understand that it would have to be positive here if I start with a positive number I'm going to subtract something that's smaller than that positive number true now I'm going to add something is it going to make it all the way back over to here no no it's got to be smaller than that because whatever I'm adding for my third term is going to be less than whatever I subtracted for my second and we keep on going because I'm decreasing I'm going to get closer and closer together do you see that ultimately what's going to happen lost my arrows didn't I so this way this way this way this way this way ultimately what's going to happen is that I'm kind of doing this pingpong match if you ever watch someone playing tennis right uh what you start here and you you you volly the ball over and some guy runs up and hits it let's pretend that these two guys start at the end of the Court and this guy hits the ball here and then he hits it back but doesn't go to the end then he hits it back but it gets closer and he gets closer and closer and closer to the net and these guys are come up like that and every time you hit the ball the guy steps forward a little bit does that make sense they're going to get really close to something that's what this is doing it's saying okay you're you're adding you start with one term then you're subtracting something less than that adding something less than that subtracting something less than that adding something less than that it's going to get really really close to one sum remember that the sums are what we're going to we're not adding all the rest of these things together these are the sums because you're subtracting numbers and adding numbers back and forth so sum number one hey subtract it sum number two add it sum number three subtract it sum number four because we're decreasing eventually I'm going to start adding and subtracting numbers which are so small they don't make a difference at Infinity show F if that makes make sense to you and that that's the idea of proving that this is convergent uh because it passes diers test and because we're decreasing and because it's alternating alternating series says yeah you're adding and you're subtracting sure but you're decreasing right so what you're adding subtracting keeps getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller therefore we're going to get really really really really close to one number eventually at term Infinity that term Infinity S Sub Infinity that be the limit of s subn as n approach Infinity hey we did that we did the limit of partial sums as n approaching Infinity that would be one number that's the idea have I explained that well enough you guys understand the the basis of this this test are you sure I don't want to leave anybody hanging on this one is it clear for you the whole adding then subtracting then adding something smaller subtrac and eventually you're going to get down to one number now let's go ahead and show how this actually works okay I'm actually going to start with this example are there any questions on on this other one so let's show what this one does first things first what must we show all the time every time for all our series ever basically oh okay doesn't necessarily have to pause of all the time uh continuity would be for the integral test you're on the right track for integral test for sure okay as far as every series ever what do we always check first the Divergence test so let's do that first so I know these are kind of out of order but I'm going to always show this one first because if I can show this one doesn't work I can just stop so number one we're going to take a limit as n approaches Infinity of a subn now please listen carefully when you do your limits and when you check for decreasing please look up here for right now look at this when you do that is -1 the nus1 part of your a subn no so basically we we ignore it that just says it alternating so right here we go okay you're alternating now look at this the rest of your series that is your Ace of n so when I'm looking at this one right here I'm looking at this one what part says it's alternating take that part away I'll put a little side note here for you recall a subn in this case is 1/ n it does not include the1 to a power that's why I made such a point about you can always pull out the alternating part and you can always have a series of positive ter or a sequence of positive terms that a subn so Advance if you understand that concept okay so do we need the the negative one I kind of reset with my palm here do we need this negative 1 nus inside my limit no no absolutely not all we've got to do is this is what it says folks it says the limit of a subn not the limit of the whole thing who cares it's just this little piece right there show it's decreasing well that's just the ace sub n not this piece who cares we just want to show that the sequence is actually decreasing that's the idea so for us I'm going to write this down a little bit let's take a limit of so practically What You Do cover that up write the rest of what's that going to be tell me what's the limit of 1 n as n approaches Infinity does that pass our version of the Divergence test for this yes I say our version of the Divergence test because we're not really taking a limit of the whole thing it's just the sequence positive terms that's what we're taking limit of so it's kind of our version of it for this so check that's that's brilliant what's the next thing that we should do decre we've got to show us decreas so this is a two-part test it's do the version of the Divergence test and then secondly show that this thing is actually decreasing so number two how in the world do we do that you could you could do it a couple ways um it's probably and and sometimes we're going to be using the derivative remember the derivative IA to show decreasing you call this thing a function you take a derivative and if the derivative is negative then the function is decreasing no problem well we can do that or sometimes it becomes a little bit just a little easier um for for instance um here's what I would say because it's so fast for this one here's how I would do it I'm move up so because I need a little room a subn + 1 is equal to 1 n + 1 correct you know I just asked correct but do you see that's coming from a sub n +1 says hey you plug in N +1 is that less than or equal to 1 n for all n that are positive and is this equal to a subn sometimes it's easier to do this than it is a derivative so right now this says that a subn + 1 is less or equal to a subn that shows that it is decreasing what about the fact that it's a harmonic series okay we're talk about that right now I want to make sure that this is okay with you all right do you understand that this is an alternating series hello yes no yes what says it alternating uh are you okay that the limit of the sequence from which our series is built as far as as sub is concerned is equal to zero Ence test are you okay that this sequence is also decreasing so a subn was 1 n we showed that the limit of that sequence is zero satisfied that part we also showed that this thing is decreasing because well if I add one to this I have 1 n + 1 that's always less than 1 n for all n greater than 1 brilliant okay well that's equal to a subn so now I've shown that a subn + 1 is less than a subn that said that's decreasing so I satisfied this by the alternating series test we have something that's alternating we have something where the limit of our sequence is zero we have something that is decreasing tell me something about this series it converges it Absolut it converges so we write this way so by the alternating series test yes you have to State what you're using here there's going to be a lot of freaking tests okay so State what you're using by alternating series test because it passed the Divergence test because our our sequence was decreasing we know that by the alternating series test the series of -1 N - 1 n converges okay honestly that is the entire lesson that's the whole idea there's only one alternating series test there's only one thing you do with it and that's it did that make sense to you now of course we're going do a few more examples sure but this is this is practically the idea show F if you feel okay with the idea now this is what's really interesting um if I take this away if I look at this if I look at this series what is that series Harmon harmonic series tell me something about the harmonic Series diverges this is called the alternating harmonic series do you see why it's called the alternating harmonic series it is a harmonic series only it's alternating the alternating harmonic series is actually converging and that's weird so the harmonic series diverges yet the alternating harmonic series converges I can be confusing it can be confusing so make sure you mind your p's and q's or harmonic series and Alternate harmonic Series this is the alternating harmonic series and yes it converges now fortunately for us we don't really base anything on the alternating harmonic series we don't say that oh this is always less than alter Alterna harmonic series don't really do that and so all these are kind of made from scratch anyway so you don't necessarily have to remember that I would like you to because it's important we will use it eventually uh but you can always redo it okay with alternating series test we use the harmonic series a lot because we're always doing well it's kind of like a PE Series so you could just think of it as a PE series but we always compare things to it a lot so that's kind of nice to know let's continue [Applause] tell me something about this series please what do you see right off the bat that says this is this type of series it's alternating how do you know it's alternating very good so we know it's alternating what are we going to use for alternating series probably the alternating series test because it's an alternating series yeah and that's the easiest test we have for this okay Show's decreasing show the limit of a subn is z can you tell me what is a subn in this [Music] case yeah that's exactly right it's not hard to do now what would you do first if I gave this to you on a test would you show it's decreasing first or would you show the Divergence test first what would you do I would do that first why because it's easy it's easier okay so even if we were to show I I'll show it decreasing here real quick by the way um and this case it's a lot easier to show with a function with a derivative than it is by showing it directly like this one this is why I give this example um this sometimes is hard to do sometimes really easy like this was easy but if I wanted to show that 2 n + 1 over 4 n + 1 - 1 is less than or equal to 2 N / 4 n - 1 I might run into some trouble okay it's just harder to do it's harder to actually show that does that make sense so rather than do that I'd be like no I I don't think so I would think of FX = 2x over 4X -1 I would find a derivative of that thing by the way um all of this is kind of a moot point do you understand that do you understand that when I take the limit of this it's going to equal 12 and that's not zero therefore this thing will diverge by the alternating series test by the Divergence test uh but I'm just showing you um something extra right now okay so if you didn't show it like this you could show it with a derivative it would be low D High minus high D low and square the bottom way we the way we do I think if I did it right looks like I did did you get that too if you did it -2 over bunch of junk yes so um is this thing always negative what do you think is this thing always positive is this always negative negative over positive is a so this is less than zero always therefore if that's always less than zero What's it tell you it's de it's decreasing this is a this is a slope yes the slope is negative a slope that's negative says that your function is decreasing since our function is modeling our sequence for us it says that our sequence is also decreasing I'll say that one more time because I'm sure it didn't see in some of you aren't even looking at me my goodness people in video they're watching me you should watch me too so they're probably texting they probably are texting sub texting anyway so if this is a derivative means a slope if the slope is negative which it always is that means that the function is decreasing since this function contains every point of our sequence our sequence is also decreasing for anything n greater than one one no problem so this says decreasing would that be good for convergence as far as our alternating series test is concerned would that be good for us yeah that would have to be decreasing so that fits half of it now of course what we would have done first this is number one we do a limit of 2 n/ 4 n - 1 as n approaches infinity and we would get 1 half by whatever you want to do with that you're going to get 1/2 so should be located with that one what's that say this is not zero in practicality if you were doing this problem on a test you would not even get to this you'd say let's do a limit first let's do the limit of this guy limit of this guy is oh2 is that equal to zero by the alternating series test by the Divergence test series Divergence you wouldn't even make it to that why would you do extra work work when this already tells you that it diverges show up hands if that made sense to you okay so yeah it decreases but it's not just about decreasing okay both of these things have to work in concert to give you a convergent series understood let's keep going really we're only going to do one more and then we're we're done we're done with uh with this because it's it's all the same it's all the same same stuff by the way do you have questions on that forgot this time now of course just because it's all the same doesn't mean everything is super easy all the time I mean you just have to show stuff bless you you got to show stuff so let's start with this uh you're given this problem on the test what do you do Panic pee your pants run out of class I never learned any of this seriously it honestly happened in class one time it was a final yeah person stood up I don't remember any of this crap threw his test down and walked out it's awesome not in my class in someone else's class but did they pass no they failed a final anyway uh so what do you do what do you do on this on this uh what kind of series what kind of okay what kind of series is it what are you going to use for alternating series alter series now yeah I'm going to give you a couple other tests that do work for alternating series okay so for right now that's all you got I will give you some that are sometimes nicer and we're we're going to see when they're nicer when we get there all right specifically have things like uh factorials stuff like that where this would be very hard to show with factorials possibly because well we're going to take a derivative do you know how to do derivatives of factorials no no we don't so we can show with other other techniques as well but right now if it's alternating series use alternating series test what are you going to do first ladies and gentlemen okay let's look at a subn what is our a subn in our case okay now what would you do decreasing or limit first li D do first then how would you show this limit how would you do it there's two ways that I can think of right now how would you do it the one top what do you mean well yeah say you could divide everything by n that would be one option can't do that oh yeah you could actually you could do numerator denominator not going to help us all that much but I like where you're at you would use that if you had a conjugate you use a conjugate you might try Lal sure could you do lals yeah why not you could do that I don't know if both are going to work I the only one I would see is divide by n that's what I would do um if you did lalls let's see do you understand why we can use lalls right now everybody LS might actually be pretty nice because uh what's the derivative of n minus one I like getting ones on denominator don't know about you guys but that's kind of nice right this gives You2 actually you know what all I make it nice U this would give you 1/ 2 < TK n + 1 can you verify that for me to make sure I didn't do a mistake but if you do it remember that this is n + 1 12 so a Lal would do 12 n+ 1 to the 12 that's over a square root so this would be a if I did a derivative you'd get the here's the 1/2 here's the N plus 1 to the2 uhhuh now let that go to Infinity what's what's n is n infinity infinity plus one Infinity sare OT INF * 2 1 over infinity 0 over 1 does it pass the Divergence test as it's concerned for alternate could you have done as Aaron suggested and divide everything by n be careful on this if you divide everything by n what happens is you do this n + 1 over n nus one over sorry like that you [Music] no true yes kind of true this remember all these would have to be equal correct this does not always equal this that is not true all the time this always equals that that is true all the time you need to be careful on that now of course why are we unconcerned where does n start and it goes to so it's always positive so for that case it doesn't really matter but if you would had n going to negative Infinity just in case you ever get a limit where n goes to negative Infinity um that changes to a negative n are you all clear on that so just be careful yeah you can do it because n's going to positive Infinity you're good okay uh this is absolutely true but this is really the definition of it okay anyway in either case that you get you would get zero so let's go let's let's backtrack a bit the first thing you do is you test a limit that's basically like the Divergence test for alternating series did it pass yes so should I stop or keep going keep going does it say that we're convergent right now no not yet but we're halfway there possibly possibly conver number two what's number two show decreasing tell you what trying to show this is less than or greater than n + 1 + 1 in a < TK over n + 1 - one can be tricky what might we want to do instead of that let's do derivative so here's how you do the derivative you say okay let's pretend this thing is a function of x and by the way do I want to include this in my derivative no heck no I want x + 1 over x -1 that's what I want to do so let's take a derivative of that guy so oh man low D High minus high D L Square the bottom and away we go correct me if I'm wrong if you see mistakes please do that I'm just going to do it kind of quickly oh goodness that's nasty what would you do did you get that far by the way yeah what would you do now give up simplify yeah get a common denominator combine your numerators it's complex fraction right now this sucks complex fractions always say get one fraction on the numerator one fraction denominator and go for it so in our case we get let's see uh x -1 - 2 * x + 1 all over 2 < TK x + 1 over X - 1 2 at least I believe so I'm kind of doing it quick in my head but you'd have to multiply by 2 rootx + 1 over X over 2un x + 1 and that would give you this still okay so far yeah let's keep on rolling so we'd have fime of x equals what do we get on that numerator looks to me like it's x - 3 did you get thatx - 3 yeah x - 3 all over if you do all of this you're going to end up with 2 > x + 1 * x -1 2 go no further because we're not trying to figure out a limit so don't think oh man we got to we got to do a limit we got to get rid of X on the numerator who cares about that all we're trying to see is whether this is positive all the time or negative all the time are you with me are you listening yes it's a derivative right derivative gives you increasing versus decreasing so we make it this far make it to one fraction then look at your fraction is that positive is this always positive is this always positive so your denominator is always positive your numerator is your numerator always positive no it's always if n is if x is greater than one yes absolutely because if x is one you get negative 1 x is 2 you get -2 x is you're going to get Negative whatever you plug in does that make sense that means that this is always less than Z for X greater than or equal one here's where we make the jump we've done this several times I'm do it one more time this function is modeling our sequence right now which means that every term of our sequence will be somewhere on our function do you get that this can includes way more points than this will ever have since this function is always decreasing we prove that by taking a derivative the derivative is always negative a negative derivative says that your function is decreasing that's what it says so since our slope is negative function is decreasing since it's decreasing for every X greater than or equal to one that means that because a sequence fits in here the sequence is also decreasing for every n greater than or equal to one two hands if you understand that concept therefore this says a subn is is decreasing let's put it all together all of it right now um do we have an alternating series yes alternating series says so this says alternating we look at our sequence does the limit of our sequence from which our alternating series is built does that limit as n approaches Infinity equals zero that passes that Divergence part of this test then we do the second one is the sequence from which our alternating series is built also decreasing everywhere yes so alternating series test says if it's alternating if it passes the Divergence test if it's decreasing those three things what do you know about this given Series so by alternating series test or a the given series that we have converges uh by the way if you notice something we kind of set this for n greater than or equal to 1 um yeah you can't really have it equal to one you pick two pick something like that now if we said two is it going to make a difference or equal to two now as a matter of fact our series don't even start t two but even if you it didn't even if those numbers didn't work out please recall that you can add or subtract a finite number of terms from your series and you still have the same convergence or Divergence does that make sense to you so it doesn't even matter if they don't really match up yeah your sum would be different but because we have this series idea of convergence or Divergence rather than find the sum okay did make sense for you all right so the last little bit of talking about alternating series now here's the deal have you ever wondered if a series goes forever and has a sum and we can't add forever how in the world can we say the sum of a series is what it is well the limit ident lets us know that but if you understand this about the series if I add a finite number of terms there will be some sort of difference between the sum of the series and the sum that I have does that make sense in other words there's going to be some sort of error well let's talk a little bit about finding error on our series here's what we know if your series converges then it will have some some let's call it s and we also know this this is old stuff we also know if we take a limit of partial sums as n approaches Infinity then the limit of partial sums will equal that sum s [Applause] let me let me explain that with some uh some different notation so if I take a limit of s subn uh do you recognize that notation s subn s subn was a partial sum it said hey uh find the sum after n terms find the sum after five terms after 10 terms after n terms as n approaches infinity and this was our very first kind of an idea for finding the sum of a series it said tell me what a partial sum is then let N Go to Infinity because if n goes to Infinity this part the limit of partial sums is n appro to Infinity will equal the sum of the series that was the whole idea this is old stuff do you recognize the old stuff if you need a brush up it's in uh one of the first sections on series I think it was like four sessions ago so this is what that that said it said hey take a partial sum no problem let N Go to Infinity then that partial sum will equal the some of our series old stuff well if this is true if the limit of partial sums ASO Infinity equals s then the difference between these things will equal what as n approaches Infinity if these things are equal as n approaches Infinity what's the difference between them should be zero it should be and it is does that make sense to you if the limit of s subn is n approach Infinity is s then the difference between them would be zero x n approach to Infinity as n approach to Infinity you guys okay with that so far now I made a statement as an approaches Infinity so what would happen if n doesn't get to Infinity if we don't have the statement so if we don't actually get to Infinity is this still going to be zero no there will be some error let me write that down for you so you have a little bit of note so now if n doesn't actually approach Infinity there's going to be some difference between S subn and S does that make sense if we don't actually get to Infinity now we kind of usually can't get to Infinity we have this definition of limit saying and approaches Infinity but if we don't actually get there there's going to be a difference between S subn and S we call that difference error or we have a special name for it we call it R subn you guys get the idea here I'm going to write down so you're hopefully still with me so if n does not approach Infinity or in other words it never makes it okay so if we stop somewhere along the way if n does not approach infinity or doesn't actually get there there will be some error between S and S subn we call that error AR okay let me let me recap just a little bit okay so here's the idea the idea is yeah if a series converges it's got to have a sum no problem this would be true as well if we take a limit of our partial sums as n approaches Infinity we say yeah go to Infinity guess what the limit of your partial sums is going to equal the sum of your series no problem we we had that last time well we had that several times ago and we also say if I subtract these two yeah the limit would equal zero if n goes to Infinity now assume that n stops before infinity it goes for a long long way but it stops before infinity this is no longer true because I don't have this idea of a limit I don't have the idea of and going to Infinity does that make sense to you I have okay we're stopping somewhere well then the partial sum is probably going to be pry let's say we do the first thousand terms okay the partial sums probably going to be really close to that sum of the series it's going to be really really close but it's not going to be exact because we didn't get to Infinity does that make sense to you so if we now this what I'm saying here now say n doesn't approach Infinity okay stop somewhere there's going to be some error it's going to be really close but there's going to be some error show hands if that made sense feel okay okay so here's what we know since there will be some error between these if I take s minus s subn this is what we're calling R subn basically it means this and hopefully this this makes sense Ren stands for your error that's what it is so this says that your error is equal to what's s stand for of the sum of the series that's what we said sum of the series sum so this would be like the idea of the whole sum the sum of the series the whole thing so the whole sum minus part of the sum that's a partial Su part of the SU so we have okay if we don't go to Infinity there's going to be a difference between these guys make sense we call that difference R subin naturally it would say the error is equal to well can you does that make sense to you the notation well this is error right it says take the whole thing subtract off part of it that gives you the difference between them that gives you the error so we have a equals whole sum minus part of sum it's a very wholes sum idea that we have oh man now the following is for alternating series only and you'll see why I'll explain why in just a moment why it's for alternating series only uh this idea okay we we have this but now we're going to apply to our alternating series why we're in this section now so for alternating series only [Applause] for alternating series only we have the following idea it's very interesting to explain why after I put it on the on the board here this is this is kind of cool check it out uh we know this is true error equals the whole minus the part true mhm now because we're dealing with alternating series this right here could be positive or negative right could be well actually this could be positive or negative we're going to make this absolute value because of the next thing we're going to do here's what I know and this is the interesting part of this hopefully you believe this true you believe that already yes no yes here's what I know this error is always going to be less than or equal to a sub n +1 always now some of you probably thinking oh yeah that makes sense some of like what in the world are you even talking about a subn + 1 think about this for a second s subn would be the sum when you start when you stop the sum when you stop at the nth term does that make sense says go a sub 1 a sub 2 a sub 3 a sub 4 a sub 5 a sub 6 a sub 7 a subn and add them all together that's what this is s stands for the whole thing what I'm saying is that this difference is less than or equal to the next term after you have stopped so you do a sub 1 a sub 2 a sub 3 a sub 4 a sub 5 a subn the next one would be a subn plus one right if you add all this up and you subtract it from s that difference is less than the next term the why in the world is that we'll talk about it right now here here's the Y uh let's let's consider what s is s would be a sub one M remember this is alternating and the reason why this only works for alternating I'll show you in a reason okay but this is alternating series show in just a minute why the reason is this is alternating series so it be a sub 1 a sub 2 a sub 3 blah blah blah blah and eventually you get a true now would s stop there yes s would go forever s never stops so s would do n + 1 minus a sub n + 2 plus and it would go forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever does that make sense to you now here's the deal this is all of s so this is the whole thing I'm going to write it a little differently this whole thing is s does that make sense can you find s s subn somewhere in that that series you have to be right because s subn is a partial sum it's part of that sum so it's got to be in there somewhere where does s subn stop that's s of n does that make sense hello yes no yes now here's the cool part the rest of this by definition here would have to be S after I take away s subn does that make sense to you hey look it if the whole thing's s and this first part is s subn then the rest of it is s minus s of n that's what the rest of it is now understand something about why alternating series plays a part of this check out what the what the terms do the next term after this is a sub n +1 correct now I'm assuming that's going to be a plus it doesn't have to be that's why we have the absolute value I don't care what it is it's absolute value so I have that a sub n +1 let's assume it's positive what's the next thing I'm doing subtracting I'm subtracting from it I'm making it smaller aren't I Now understand that with altern alting series like this we have this idea that it's decreasing okay we have the idea it's decreasing because it's convergent alternating series that are convergent this would have to be the case it would have to be decreasing it would have to have the limit of your sequence being zero it would have to be alternating so we're already stating this is convergent does that make sense to you this is not an alternating series that increases otherwise this wouldn't even happen does that make sense so th are are you am I talking over your heads here or you guys you guys with me I hope you're with me I want you to be with me here so if it's it's convergent and it's an alternating series then it must be a decreasing sequence as subn must be decreasing what that means as far as a convergent alternating series why this is important is because if we have this as s minus s subn here's my first term after S A subn my very first one do you understand that if something's decreasing every term will be less than that in absolute value it's going to be less than that so I'm subtracting that made it smaller I'm adding it made it bigger but since I'm adding something smaller than what I subtracted in terms of absolute value it's never going to make it back to what a subn plus 1 is does that make sense start with any number like 10 subtract something from it like n add something smaller than that like eight are you ever going to make it back to 10 no no that's what the idea of a decreasing convergent alternating series has to do with this says alternating is important because I'm not continually adding I'm subtracting then adding then subtracting then adding then subtracting then adding I'm never going to make it back to the 10 because my my sequence of terms is decreased show P if that made sense well if that's the case then what we know is that this whole thing must be less than or equal to a sub n + 1 and that's exactly what we're getting right here that's the whole idea I'm going to write that hopefully you guys can see it a little bit clearer so this this is s - s subn it must be less than because it's decreasing because we're alternating a subn + 1 and that's exactly what we have we say R is Def R subn is defined as the difference between this and this so basically this guy this is my error this is my error it's the difference between my sum and my partial sum this is the error because that error has to be less than my very first term after I stop my partial sum we have this as our definition for our error did they explain that well enough for you guys to understand it okay let me show you how it works in practicality do you have any questions on any of this stuff because I'm going to erace this and start my example over here are we good okay so let's start with an example and I'll show you where the error comes into play Let's do a series like this you know if we're going to talk about finding error we better make sure that we have a convergent series it really wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to find error if we didn't know that this was a convergent series would that make sense because if this things adds to Infinity well how we going to how find error that doesn't doesn't even work so by the way finding error only works for convergent alternating series so we're going to have to make sure that this thing actually converges does that converge don't just guess at it have we shown anything about it okay so you tell me how I show that it actually does converge Divergence has to be first firstly actually before that tell me what type of Series this is Alter alternating so with an alternating series you might want to use the alternating alternating series test is two parts alternating series says does it pass the Divergence test for alternating series so basically by the way uh what is your a subn here do you know what your a subn is one n factorial yeah just cover that up so the alternating series test says number one I want to find a limit of a sub n everybody what does that have to be in order to continue and say it's not necessarily Divergent is it so that passes the first part of my alternating series test it equals zero it's like the Divergence test for alternating series number two what's the next thing we've got to show for alternating series past the limit of your sequence equals zero decreasing decreasing why is decreasing important because it's because it's alternating if you keep going back and forth plus minus plus minus your term get bigger it's not going to work but if you turns get smaller remember that whole Su idea we went forward then back forward back eventually we're going to once and we wouldn't even be able to find error if it wasn't decreasing so yeah it's got to be decreasing is it decreasing would you show decreasing here with a derivative no why not factorial okay so we'd start with a subn + 1 we show that a subn + 1 is greater than or less than a subn l want this to always be going less than the next one so we want to show that this is ultimately less than or equal to a subn how much is a subn + 1 you know how to find the next term you start with whatever a subn is it already gives you a subn and then you just add one to many NS you got so for us it'd be one over n + one factorial yep n plus1 factorial does that make sense to you is it true and by the way here's a subn right uh a subn is 1 / n factorial is it true that this is less than or equal to this yes then we've proven that a subn + 1 is less than a subn and that's a second part of our alternating series test that says that this thing is decreasing should that made made sense to you this is old stuff so what we would say is by the alternating series test yes you have to tell me what test you're using by the alternating series test because our our sequence as subn limit of that is n for Infinity equals Zer that passes that diverence test because our next term is less than our previous term that shows that we're decreasing by alternating series tests in these two conditions we know that the series that we have started with our given series does what that's right if the series converges this is our condition if the series converges there will be some error between a partial sum and the sum of the series so you have to show it converges first before you start doing this nonsense because otherwise this does not matter does that make sense to you so we go right well it can converges therefore between any partial sum and sum of the series there will be some sort of an error now here's how you use the error you ever wondered well what's the point of doing some of this because yeah we know it converges but we still can't find the sum so why are we doing it well we can find the sum to a close enough value for us and this is how we do it with an alternating series at least what you do with the uh the error what you do with the error you tell the series how accurate you want to be then you find the number of terms it takes to be that accurate some of you looking one sound like a riddle yes well I'll explain that in just a second let's start with what we know what we know is that there's going to be some sort of an error and we know that that error will be the difference between the sum and the partial sum in terms of value and we also know that this will be less than a subn + 1 does that make sense hello yes no okay now do you have an expression for a subn + 1 yes yes you do in fact we just had it if you didn't you could make it easily you look right here and you just do n + 1 so for us we know that this is the same thing as 1/ n + one factorial you okay with that M okay so practically speaking we know that R subn must be less than or equal to 1/ n + 1 factorial now again here's the way that the error Works do you write this down maybe I should write this down for you here's the way error works you tell the series the paral sum you tell the series how accurate you want to be and then you use the error whatever this is to tell you how many terms you need to be that accurate tell series you tell it so how the air works you tell the series how accurate you want to be then you use R suben to determine the error to determine how many terms are needed to be that accurate let me give you uh an idea so F firstly are you okay getting down this far quicke if you're okay with that so here's the way that we go from here somewhere along the way you're going to get a number like uh 0.5 or 0.001 or something like that and I'm going to give this to you on a test or you homewor and give it to you and say tell you what I want you to find the partial sum such that so example such that I want R subn in terms of absolute value to be less than or equal to 005 now please don't just do this by rote memorization of how you do a process like an algorithm okay understand what this says what this really says is I want you to get the difference between the sum and the partial sum to be less than 0 actually let's just do L time less than .5 I want the error to be less than 005 so what that means is that I want you to give me the term so that when I do that amount and I add my partial sum that it's going to be less than this much difference from the sum of my series are you catching that say it one more time so really hopefully sinks in what this says is that I want you to tell me how many terms I need so that when I add them all up this is the difference the difference between my partial sum which you just added and the sum of the series the whole thing is less than 00005 that would be 10 hundreds up to the 10 5 10,000 so it would be very very close now the reason why we have absolute value this could be the partial sum could be a little over it or it could be a little under it but it will be within 510,000 of that that's pretty darn accurate does that make sense to you okay so here's what we do we go right we cool well tell you what uh we know know that R subn has to be less than this right so and we we want R subn to definitely be less than this so here's what we do we go if our subn has to be less than this if we make our last term less than 0.005 would that not fit the condition of R subn being less than that hope I didn't blow your minds I see some some wheels turning here what's happened to this okay here check it out you're given an error right your error has to be less than 05 in this case where' that come from I made it out it's going to be given to you or you come up with it on your own later on whatever so I want my error to be less than this well if my last term I make my last term I make my last last term less than 005 I know for a fact R subn is less than my last term so if I make my last term less than this number whatever my error is then R subn for sure is going to be less than that because this is even this is less than this this is less than that bam so set your last this as easy as is set your last term your a actually your next term a sub n plus one set that less than your error solve for n done now how we solve for n can get exciting did you know that if you take a reciprocal of an inequality your inequality just reverses did you know that mhm so then I do n + 1 factorial is greater than 1 over 005 can you tell me how much is 1 over 005 2000 it's 2,000 that's right 2000 you guys okay with whether the 2,000 came from your calculators you'll be okay with it in like 5 Seconds okay so if I do a reciprocal of both these sides then my inequality switches around no problem now there's no way to explicitly solve for n we cannot do it here we're not going to do it here so just start thinking about this start pluging in some numbers tell me something if I plug two all I need is for this to be more than 2,000 does that make sense if this is more than 2,000 then this will be less than 05 then our error will be less than 05 actually should be way less than that but this is the idea so uh how about one if I plug in nals 1 is that enough cuz that's two factorial if I plug in two is that enough that's three factorial that would be six six not more than 2,000 if I plug in uh three no that would be four factorial four factorial is 24 isn't it think so * yeah six okay so is that more than 2,000 no uh how about five they plug in five watch your fo 120 no say what no 120 no that's not big enough how about six I'm plug in six 720 7 if I plug in remember if I plug in six I'm adding one to it if I plug in five okay let's let's let me start again I got distracted so if I plug in five 5 + 1 would give me six how much is six factorial 720 that's 720 that's not more than 2,000 let's plug in 6 if I plug in N = 6 I get 6 + 1 is 7 7 factorial is is that more than 2,000 yes so the first term that satisfies this for me is n = 6 does that make sense to you okay now now what we do with that we say this if I take an add well I'm going to add and subtract because it's alternating series if I take and add the first six terms that partial sum will be within way within in this case way within 51,000 of the actual sum so what we're going to do we're going to find sub sub6 we're going to find s six s sub6 just says add the first six terms what did we start with anyway forgot what my series is what's it going to look like s sub6 remember we start at zero so let's do that don't start at once one first one's going to be one that's right if I start at zero I get one next I'm going to get a minus and then I'm going to get a plus and I'm going to get a minus and then get a plus and so forth and so on let's plug in one remember we start at zero here so we start at zero now we plug in one when I plug in one what do I [Applause] get plug in two I get I plug in three I get 1 over 3 factorial + 1 4 factorial - 1 5 factorial I ran out a room are we okay with all that should okay so let's figure out what it is this is 1 - 1 + 12 - 16 + 112 sorry 124 - over 120 + 1 over 700 that 720 yes you can really kind of see the error taking place right now check this out do you see how firstly are you okay getting that far make sure I got it right too did I get it right yes hope I did do you see how small these fractions are getting M the next one's going to be really really small 1 over 5,000 something really small and I'm going to be subtracting it well that's not taking away very much and after that I'm going to add but I'm not adding very much it's not going to change that much so here's what we know if I do this on your calculator whatever what I'm going to get I'm going to do the math for you but maybe you can double check this I get 0368 did you get 368 if you add that okay let me get double check here real quick did you get the same thing okay just make sure that my math was right as well so here's what we know let's put everything together right now okay here's what we know s sub6 was this correct that works down to this partial sum the sum of the first six terms usually seven terms because we had the S Sub Zero term so first seven term is n was six so you still got to go by whatever your series says all right add the first however many it takes to get up to n equals 6 in this case here's what I know is this equal to is this equal to S is this equal to S Toler is it equal to S no is it a good approximation for s yes how good so good that this number is within 5 10,000 of this it's that good and that's how you use the error did that make sense to you that's the idea folks show hands you understand the idea you feel okay with it cool all right
