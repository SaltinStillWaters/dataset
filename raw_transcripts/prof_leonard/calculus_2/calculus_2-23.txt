Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 10.2:  Introduction to Parametric Equations
all right we start a Brave New World so we're we're done with our series inter sequences now we're we're going to Omit one section of here and start with a good stuff the good stuff that we're going to talk about for the rest of our our section and for well kind of most of the rest of this chapter is parametric equations the calculus of parametric equations polar coordinates and then the calculus of polar coordinates after that we'll only have one more section on numerical integration that's our our course in calculus 2 so we are on very much the downhill slope um so start something new in plain curves and parametric equations because sometimes it's really hard or impossible to define a function or a curve as a function and so we have a different way to do that so I'm going like I just said I'm going to be writing a lot I'm going to write a lot of notes on the board because this is probably brand new to all of you unless unless you had the class before so um first thing first thing I had to do is Define what a plane curve is uh PL not the thing that goes and curves around it's not the type of plane curve we're talking about okay talking about a a curve on an actual plane so not a three-dimensional curve a two-dimensional curve just somewhere on a flat surface does that make sense to you a three-dimensional curve would be like a curve in three space uh that would be in your next semester calculus so here what a plain curve means it's just the motion of an object on a plane that's really all it is so when you see this word planker what's that mean well what this is is simply the motion of an object in a plane now I'm going to list out for you I'm actually going to write these out so you have some good notes Here there's a problem with always defining a plain curve in terms of X and Y rectangular coordinates so there's a few problems with this so problems with defining a plain curve so the motion of an object in a plane that's what we're talking about here like a normal function and what I mean by that is like a function in terms of X and Y that's typically what we do right we look at a curve and we say okay uh this curve it's on XY coordinate system it's on a plane and for any plane we should be able to go okay here's your y here's your X we should be able able to define the motion of that curve with x's and y's correct it's at this point then it's at this point and if it's on a plane it should always be on the x y coordinate system so why is there some problems on defining a PL plane curve like a normal function with x's and y's well we're still going to have x's and y's but the way we describe them sometimes we have a problem because those curves they're not always functions so one problem we run into with plane curves is that many times so here's the problems of defining a plane curve like a normal function problem number one a lot of times they're not functions many times they are not functions well if something's not a function it's really hard to describe it as a function you can't say the function of Y in terms of X because it's not a function that's an issue there's a couple other problems second one a lot of times these curves even if they are functions or if they're not functions they can't be explicitly defined in one in terms of one variable like a think of a circle is a circle a function no and the equation for a circle is x^2 + y^2 = R2 isn't it can you describe that in terms of one variable well you can you can take a square root with a plus or minus but you can't explicitly do that and still have a function uh you can describe it and it will make that circle with the plus and minus but it's really hard to do that's awkward some of them you can't do at all so that one you can Define explicitly it won't make a function though so don't go into that misconception some of them you can't even do it so the second problem we run into is well firstly some of them aren't functions a lot of them aren't functions nextly even if they are or if they're not a lot of them cannot be explicitly defined in one variable so many we cannot explicitly Define in terms of a single variable and there's another problem you see with a plain curve if a plain curve is more than just a curve of points if a plain curve defines where an object is does it make sense to you a plane curve is the motion of an object in a plane it's more than just a set of points a plane curve has a connotation that um this little bug this little bug starts here or this whatever starts here and this bug travels so this bug has a starting point it has an ending point so imagine like a fly on the board the fly goes and then I hit it but if I miss it it's going to walk a little bit right CU I don't like flies I really hate mosquitoes so if you see me just I'm not going crazy it's it's a mosquito um so this bug lands on the board the board is a plane this bug goes is this bug going to make a function for us probably not because it doesn't necessarily respect mathematics this darn bug uh it might not make a function for us could you describe the motion of this curve with x's and y's yes you say here here here but if you try to do it with only a normal function it' be really hard to do firstly it's not a function secondly if it's just a listing of all the points it's not giving you when this bug was at a certain point it's also not giving you the direction that it traveled so if I just list out this do you know without me telling you do you know where the bug started do you know the direction that it traveled do you know where was at any given time no that's another problem here so firstly they're not functions secondly a lot of times you can't explicitly Define them as one variable and they don't tell where the object is at a given time I'm going to use time Loosely here uh given point if you want to say given whatever uh we use the word time because parametric equations I'm going to say this in a little bit are kind of thought of in terms of time we'll talk about that and lastly I just mentioned this if you're talking about an object it's traveling it's very useful to know where it started sure when it was at a given point where it ended and the dire dire that it's taking well if I just give you a line does it give you a direction well that's a problem in fact a lot of times when we do our curves even if they're functions we do this we go wait what do mean it's going both directions how can that happen where does it start where does it stop I don't know it's just a series of points this has the indication that just goes forever well it doesn't tell you where it starts doesn't tell you where it stops does it so that's that's an issue if we're if we're mapping where an object is going we need that we need where it's starting where it's stopping and how it's traveling so this one gives us no Direction so no direction is given for that reason we create what are called parametric equations parametric equations are the way that you deal with plain curves so this is not really two different concepts um this is the way that we are going to tackle this does that make sense to you so the way that we are going to go about mapping these plane curves is with parametric equations so let's talk about it and I'll give you um give you the idea behind parametric equations have I explained everything well enough for you do you see the problems I was trying to to show you here they're pretty I mean they're pretty common sense if you understand the what a object is doing when it's moving you want to know where it starts where it lands in the hoard you want to know where it ends you want to know when or where it is at any given time and you want to know the direction that travel so that's why we're going to do these param equations so parametric equations here's what a parametric equation does it says you know what if you're if you're in a plane you can be described by x's and Y's for sure you can you can say at this point you're X and Y that's how planes work that's why we have a rectangular coordinate system to map any point on a plane no problem it's just the way we Define it changes a little bit we say okay if we want to describe where X is and where Y is we can actually do it differently than describing y as a function of X or X as a function of Y what we do instead we say tell you what instead of having X as a function of Y and Y as a function of X we're going to have X and Y as a function of a different variable an independent variable time or t so that's where we get this parameter the t is called the parameter we say okay tell you what you can actually describe X as a function and Y as a function of some other variable it's still going to give you a an X and A Y depending on what you plug in for your your time but in this way we we get away from this well if they're not functions of of each other no problem you can Define X as a function of time and Y as a function of time just say hey at any given time you'll have an X and a y coordinate does that make sense to you so if I said at 1 second you could plug in one and one it's going to give you an X and Y that's going to tell you where that point is and when that point was there does that make sense to you it will in a little bit I I promise it will so we Define the motion of both the sorry Motion in both the X and the Y directions of some variable T so I'm going write that out so we get a good note so we're going to Define Motion in both X and Y directions as a function of some variable t and really it's an independent variable so X and Y become dependent variables upon this T over a common domain and we call that domain I now here's the words we're going to be using okay you want me go through it one more time like a 10c recap yeah okay so here we go our problems with plain curves problems are real fast a lot of times they ain't functions all the time a plain curve if you define it as X and y's it will not tell you where it starts won't tell you where it stops will not give you Direction okay doie and a lot of times you can't expressly or explicitly Define it in one terms of one variable that makes it difficult for us so we we we get around that by saying tell you what yeah every point is still going to have an X and Y obviously it's going to be on a plane it's going to have an X and Y let's just describe them different let's say that well um X is now described by a function of time function of T whatever T happens to be and Y is described by a function of T the same variable but maybe a different way to describe them so it says hey um maybe the function of of t for X say in one case at 1 second you go over three and at 1 second you go up five would it give you a point I'm going to say that again maybe at one at tals 1 the x is three and the Y is five would it give you a point yeah give you the point 3 five it would still describe for you where that point is but if you do it in terms of T it doesn't have to be a function t just goes from wherever you want to start to wherever you want to stop and gives you points that's all it's doing here it's giving you points they can go above each other they go around they can make circles they can do all sorts of stuff does that make sense you're going to see that in a little bit it'll also give you a direction if we start at tals 1 and end at tals 5 where we start at tals 1 the X Y know just going to give you both an X and Y that is your initial Point your starting point where you end at I say 1 to 5 or something when you end at tals 5 that is your terminal point where you're actually stopping the C goes from 1 to 5 you can actually follow that curve and at any T at any time you can plug it uh that t in and find out exactly where that object is and that's a better way of describing the plane curve because it gives us our start it gives us our stop and it gives us our Direction that's the idea so hands if it's making a little bit more sense I promise it will after we do an actual example here okay that t that that independent variable that we're basing both our X motion and our y motion on that's called your parameter hence we get a parametric equation so T is the parameter and I is simply the interval for your parameter or the parameter interval now a couple of the notes before we get into our example typically I've already kind of ruin the suspense for you typically T is thought of as time now don't let this time I it's an just an idea okay don't let this time idea make you think that you can't have a negative T can be negative it's it's not like you can't go back in time it'd be kind of like uh the rocket launch would be at zero there's a time you say T minus 10 D I would love that part because you spend that whatever okay I'm a door anyway we're going to think of it like that time can be negative time can be positive it's just um it just gives you the the idea that this object is moving through a sequence of points of time points so T is usually thought of as time T is typically thought of as time and again I'm going to use that word time kind of loosely here so let's imagine something so for some interval so for some interval I equals A to B here's what this means for you uh what's T called again everybody what's T called time time but in more generally it's called the it's called the parameter that's right I is the interval for your parameter so here's what it says look at the board here real quick time t t is going to start where T is going to end where so we are going to have an initial point and we're going to have a terminal point where it starts initiates its motion and where it ends or terminates its motion does that make sense to you so for any any given closed interval we're going to have an object starting from an initial point starts from initial point and I'm leave some space here I'm going to write something over here and then ends at an a terminal point I do that initial point I'm need the space here initial point to ter Point let's talk about the initial Point um now we just talked about it I hope hopefully you guys hung on to it uh tell me where when is the in it's kind of weird to say when but when's the initial Point going to start uh at A or B so when t equal a we are going to get when tal a we're going to get our initial Point are youall understanding that idea so tals a is where we start our motion now here's what I was trying to explain earlier look at the board here real fast if T equals a check it out X is a function of t y is a function of T so all you need to do figure out where this point starts plug in whatever your T is if a happens to be like three plug in three for both X and Y you get your x coordinate and your y coordinate does that make sense so our initial point would be at uh which comes first X or Y remember our points are always X Y so if we plugged in a I would get F of a and I would get G of a that right there would be my initial Point notice how F of a is our x coordinate G of a is our y coordinate that would give us a point hey could you plot X comma y on an X Y AIS of course you could so a parametric equation kind of goes about it in not a more complicated way but just a different way it says tell you what instead of saying Plug In X's you get y's it says plug in T's you get both x's and y's make sense that way you don't have to have a function now your terminal point where's your motion going to stop at tals so if you wanted to find out your terminal point well what would you have to do to where T's to T's in F good so F of B and F of G of B would give you X and Y respectively once you understand it it's not that hard of a concept it says you can find points X and Y by plugging in a number into a function t a function of t for x and a function of t for y it'll still give you points now what happens is that we talked about this too if we start at a certain point and we end at a certain point this will have some sort of an orientation this trajectory the object will travel along a a definite path it's not going to travel back and forth like this it's not going to be randomly as a a whole bunch of um distinct unique points it's going to be it starts here it then moves to this point then this point then this point along a continuous path until it reaches its end point does that make sense to you so for us right here we say that this starts from an initial point to a terminal point along some sort of a trajectory with a given orientation trajectory has this idea of Direction okay are you ready for an example we've had about 20 minutes of pure theory behind this with no actual example I hope I've explained it well enough I think at this point you should have a good idea about what I'm talking about you should have an idea that what this is going to be is basically you're plugging in a t value for your X and your y independently of each other and it's going to give you coordinates X Y which you can graph on a XY system what trajectory with sorry with specific orientation with specific orientation and that's another point in that our curves are going to have a direction to them so can we start with an example just to give you an idea about what we're we're going to do okay I want to get through at least like four examples because they get very interesting and I want to make sure that you all understand this before you go today so first one let's suppose that xal t^2 - 4 and Y = 2 T and we have -1 is less than or equal to T is less than or equal to 2 let's see if you guys understood anything about this uh firstly can you determine that that is a parametric equation yes no what tells you is parametric is X defined as function of Y is y defined as function of X are X and Y both defined as a function that they have a variable in common like T that's a parametric equation does not have to be t uh in the next couple example well after the next couple examples we're going to use Theta it can be something else besides time okay but it can it has to be the same variable for both these things that makes it parametric with each other it's independent variable of T make sense so far tell me what the parameter interval is please that's all it says notice how it's not saying that X goes from somewhere to somewhere it's not really a domain for X we can find the domain for x by plugging in t that's easy we can find the range of Y by plugging in t that's easy too but really our our domain idea is more like an interval it's an interval that time goes for for it says in our case if T is time T starts at 1 it goes to two and then it stops this this uh fly was on the board this bug was on the board for -1 to 2 seconds or minutes or hours or whatever it was and it traveled a certain curve quick head now if you're okay with that idea now I'm going to do this in two ways the first way I'm going to do this is show you that you can actually find out your curve by simply plotting points it's really easy after that I'm going to show you that we can make functions sometimes or we can at least make Expressions uh that we can graph into ently so I'm going to show you both ways so if you wanted to graph this you know where's our T start again so we probably want to plug in negative one to figure out where this thing starts so we're going to make up a t table no pun intended whatever okay we're going to plug in some T values now here's what we're going to get what we do when we plug in t values where are we going to plug them in yeah for both of them and if we plug them in for X and Y we're going to get points out of this we plug in one number here and here it gives us one point together does that make sense you obviously hopefully obviously wouldn't want to plug in a t value here and a different T value here and then get the same point because that would have different times you'd say hey at time equals ne1 we're here for x and at time equals 3 we're here for y I'm going to put them together no no no it's got to have the same time so we're going to be getting x y points x coordinates and Y coordinates now just because of the first one I'm going to use several points let's use uh well we probably want to know what negative 1 is let's use - one2 let's use 0 let's use 1 12 let's use one and then let's use two so in each case we need to be getting points out of this not individual numbers because T goes into two different functions so let's go through it uh help me out with a couple of these please if you do uh plug in1 we're going to plug in for both X and Y plug in 1 for t to get our x coordinate how much are you going to get yeah hopefully you got -3 did you get3 that's our x coordinate says hey you know what plug in 1 you're going to get our x coordinate plug in1 you're going to get that's our y coordinate so hands if you understand how the points work if you get that you get parametric equation basically as as far as the points go the T gives you the points the coordinates for your points independently it gives you the x coordinate gives you the y coordinate it's still a point though so here's what this says where does our motion start what point does our motion our curve our our object start its motion what that's right could you graph that on a graph okay uh when when does our object start its motion at T one that's that's the idea so let's continue uh have you has anyone plugged in negative one2 okay tell you what how about uh these two rows you start here that row far row do this one this row do this one you guys do this one you guys do this one and all of you work together and do this one very fast have you guys done this one yet what is it you guys get a tough one I know this row what's this one three what's this one okay how about this one we'll go this one you better get this one real fast Geniuses all of you these are the hard ones they're going to be really similar but these are the hard ones uh did you find this one 174s and four or uh one I don't think so actually have it written down it's going to cheat it's 154s I believe yes it is and -1 and5 4 and pos1 is what those points are can I get a double check on that just to make sure that that's what I got okay good I just want to make sure you know how to find them you know how to find them the math yeah you're supposed to know how to plug numbers in on your own okay now can we graph it yes so basically we're just plugging in t for for T time for here and here we're getting our X and Y coordinates let's grab it now let me ask you a question let's see if you really do get it look up here at the board here with me real fast um am I going to want to plot 1 one2 Z2 on the on any axis do we even have a t axis no no don't worry about the T the T was just to find your X and Y you're graphing in terms of X and Y because that is our plane it's our planer system that we're using here so we're really just plotting these points that's all we're doing so Nega we're going to need neg3 then 1 23 I don't think we go pass yeah okay good4 and we're going to have to go up well at least four probably four we almost okay let's plot our points this should be easy for us -3 -2 is here -5 how much is 154s yeah it's almost like -3 and 34s exactly 3 and 34 so it's right here and then -1 is is right there we have -4 0 we know how to plot that we're just plotting points same thing but at positive 1 okay we got that then we have -3 pos2 and then we end at 04 end at 04 quick head not if you're okay with this so far do you see the curve it's making connect the dots don't do little lines okay connect the dots with a nice smooth curve do we need to go past this this way no this is where it starts if our interval if a parameter interval is starting at tal1 then that's our starting point label it what's that called again your initial point so this is our initial point do we have a terminal point not toilet paper okay terminal point you also need to label your direction so there's a if we have a an initial Point here and we have a terminal point here is the object moving upwards or is the object moving down we'll say this up and down is this moving upwards or moving downwards moving up the curve so you show that you show that with an arrow so this curve or this object is moving this way a simple arrow quick show hands feel okay with this so far are you sure so one way we can Define motion of plain curves notice is this a function no no it's a function in terms of x uh sorry in terms of Y but it's x equals something in terms of Y but it's it's not a function in terms of X you can't say this is y equals something X so it's easier to for us to Define this this way sometimes or sometimes it's it's nicer to do that it gives us orientation Direction starting point ending point now I'm going to give you another idea so or this is what we're going to be working with with most of the the rest we don't want to have to always plug in numbers to find points that's kind of the basis right when you learn about graphing you plug in points or you plug in numbers to find your points and you graph those points you make a curve there's almost always a better way to do this so let's look at a different way let's start from here if x = t ^2 - 4 and Y Y = 2 T maybe we do some like mathematical razzled Dazzle and uh and combine these things let me show you what I'm talking about could you solve this for T yes ah if you can solve it for T more specifically t = y 2 you with me m could you do a substitution yes in this way sometimes sometimes time not all the time but sometimes we can get an expression that's explicitly in terms of another variable sometimes in this case we can almost all the time at least for us about all the time we can at least make another function out of it does that make sense to you we can at least manipulate it somehow I'm going to show you that in the next few examples so in our case hey if x = t^2 - 4 and t = y over two then what we're going to have is y over 2^ 2 minus 4 or x = y^2 4 - 4 okay I want show can't be okay with the the algebra on it's basic algebra but check it out do you guys see that this is a parabola opening to the right that shifted along the xais -4 and has a wider than normal parab because it's 1/4 there that's exactly what this thing is in fact you could graph this and it's going to be exactly this here's the problem though if I didn't tell you this if I just had this it would go forever right you'd have to assume T would start at netive infinity and go to Infinity it's still going to have a Direction so a lot of times we can make an expression in terms of X and Y like we did here this is an X and Y but you still have to find the initial point you still have to find the terminal point you still have to find the direction so if you were to do this and I didn't graph the points so if you say okay let's go right to here here's what you do you'd graph your graph it would go forever does that make sense yes from there what you would do you would just plug in your initial point you just plug in your terminal point what's going to happen it's going to be swh on this curve it has to be so you plug in tal1 well you find out your you do it from here you don't do it from here this is just to give you your curve so you do this and find your curve you with me are you with me you plug in your negative one and it's going to give you your XY coordinate it will be somewhere on your curve you erase the rest of it that from where it starts or where where it doesn't start you put your terminal point you erase the rest of it everything between those two points your initial and your terminal that's the object in motion and then if you know where you start you know where you stop you immediately put your direction and that's what we're looking for do you guys feel okay about this example it's a little simple but I want to make sure that you guys understand the concept show fans if you do feel right with it okay we're going to nail a couple of them here real fast um I will be going very quickly through the algebra in these so with me so let's suppose we have x = t and y = t uh firstly is that a parametric equation have I given you an interval no okay if I do not give you an interval you must use What's called the natural domain you probably have seen that before so for instance are there any restrictions on the the interval for T here plug in anything are there any restrictions for the interval on T here what can't you plug in then right there you say okay tell what T must be greater than or equal to zero we get that from here does that make sense so you use the idea of like a natural domain now you say well if I don't give you an interval find your interval if there's no restrictions it goes from negative Infinity to Infinity quick head now if you're with that one all right so uh maybe write a little note down I'm not going to write this but if no interval is given find the natural domain for your uh parameter okay now if I haven't given you an interval it's probably not a great idea to just start plugging in some random points probably not a great idea you do know where it starts it starts at well when T equals z that's cool we can find out the initial Point real easy but sometimes it's nice to have a curve to go off of so for us we say all right well man if you look at these two things if x = theun of t and t = y x = the < TK of Y does that make sense to you in fact to make this even right now we we actually have the graph if you want to think about it in terms of xal square y it's really easy to graph but you can even make this nicer for some of you you well okay Square both sides y = x^2 wait a minut you can do that yeah you can do that as long as you follow the rules for your parameter so if we were to graph this do you know what y = x^2 looks like I freaking hope that you know what that looks like okay this looks like this yes however however does this represent our parametric equation right now no no for for a few reasons firstly half this graph it doesn't even exist secondly we don't have our initial point or a terminal point and thirdly we don't have our Direction so that's what you start on right now so start using your your interval that you found to find the domain for your X or your y or whatever you have to to list out where this thing starts and stops and goes from from so if T equals 0 use that if T equals 0 and goes positive look at this if T equals z and goes positive what's happening to your X can X possibly be negative if x can't be negative this stuff doesn't exist does that make sense to you now use your initial point that you have here where where's the first place that t starts if tal 0 then xal 0 and Y oh look at that xal 0 yal 0 what's the point where we start is that on our curve that we graph that's why we graph our curve first so right here we have our initial point okay tell me something where does the T end no does it end no no so we don't have a terminal point but we do have an initial point if we start here all this stuff is gone this doesn't exist it says that our bug our object lands right here at the origin and then it travels which way is it traveling is it traveling from Infinity here or traveling from zero to Infinity it is so we're going to show our direction is going that way this is the idea so from T is greater than Z this implies that X has to be greater than or equal to Z we get our parametric interval well you can even write it where's the parametric interval start where's where's T start where's TN you can even show that so our initial Point starts at 0 0 we go to Infinity we don't end uh does that one make sense to you yeah are you sure it yes okay let me show you why it's important for you to determine where it starts where it stops and the direction I'll I'll show you right now this going to be kind of cool so so bear with me did you all understand that problem yes so we can find our curve but that doesn't help us we have to actually use our T our parameter to find out our initial point and our Direction and what parts of this curve aren't to find last example okay here we go real fast first thing uh is it a parametric equation yes no yes of course it is X and Y are both defined in some other parameter T can you make a curve out of this by combining these two equations so x = t and Y = t^2 then y = wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute that's completely different than that but I get the same thing is that going to be the same curve is it going to be the same motion is the object going to take the same path is it going to be the same curve so let's think this is weird right so what this says is that can you graph y x^2 then do it of course you can yal X2 now here's the interesting part about this this is where the rubber hits a road as far as parametric equations you got to use that parameter determine where where it starts where it stops and and its motion so check it in the previous example we knew that t could not be negative correct if T can't be negative starts at zero that's our initial point and we can't go this way we can only go that way are there any restrictions for the natural domain of T no no then what's our parametric interval okay yeah you're absolutely right so our time starts at negative Infinity it ends at positive Infinity am I going to have to erase any part of this curve no no because I can plug in now here's what you do to find out where it starts just take your negative Infinity it's weird to think about it but take your negative infinity and plug it in so if I plug in negative Infinity for my T how much is my X yep so T = Infinity implies that x = infinity and yals okay if I plug in negative infinity x is negative Infinity do you guys get that yes if I plug in negative Infinity here Y is what positive does that cope well with our graph can we start at x = infinity and Y = postive Infinity that's actually exactly where this graph starts where it would end if you plugged in positive Infinity for t x would be positive Infinity y would be oh positive Infinity it says it starts at negative Infinity for x and posi Infinity for y and it ends at posi Infinity for X POS infity for y so what direction is it going is it going this way or this way both it's not going both ways it's going it has a start spot okay it starts remember this our interval is One Direction the interval starts here it ends here so if it starts at negative Infinity for T it starts at x = infinity y = postive Infinity it's starting way up here it's going in this direction it really technically doesn't end but the terminal point would be somewhere up there it does not come back it goes from this way to this way that's the way our T flows our time flows that direction so time tells us we have that direction I want know if I've explained this one enough for you guys to understand it so far have I yes okay very good the next example we're going to use something for use some trigonometry uh can you please brush up on a few of your basic basic identities such as the Pythagorean identity for S and cosine uh the double angle formula is like s of 2 2x = 2 sinx Co next Rush up on a few of those before your next session because we're going to use those right off the bat we're going to go through a few of them all right we got our final three examples on parametric equations how to graph them in the next section we're going to learn the calculus Behind These parametric equations so just three more I'm going to go through them like I said pretty quickly here I want to show you some of the things you that you can do in order to find the graph of these so one thing what we're trying to do is get the picture of the graph first and then find out where the object starts where the object stops and how it what direction it's going on the picture of our graph does that make sense to you we don't want to always have to start plugging in points because if I'm not giving you the range of your interval it's going to be really hard to figure out where this thing starts and what the picture looks like without plotting a whole bunch of points not sure if you understand what I'm talking about we want the curve of our object before we find out how it's moving on the object or on the curve so in order to do something like that sometimes we might have to to use some of our trigonometry some identities uh to get a picture of what this graph looks like in our case firstly is that a parametric equation do we have an X do we have a y and do we have both of them defined in terms of another variable right now A is not your variable a is going to be some sort of a constant the only thing I want you to know is that the constant is the same for both of these equations do you see what I'm talking about so what we get is going to be in terms of of a as a constant we're going to get the same shape no matter what a is it's just going to be bigger or smaller I'm going to show you that in a minute it's going to make perfect sense okay what is the parameter then is it X is it Y is it Theta what's the parameter Theta in this case is the parameter it acts like our T so in our case Theta is the parameter now sometimes it's really hard to solve explicitly for your parameter for instance let me have your eyes on the board here real quick can I solve that for Theta easily yes how no okay I can divide by a that's okay if I divide by a I'm going to get cosine Theta = x a you remember what we did in the last few examples if you don't you're going to have to go check your notes or check the video or something what we did was we solved for the parameter and and did a substitution you remember doing that that's what we did basically every single time is that going to be easy to do here if I solve for Theta only thing I could get is cosine inverse of x a right is that something I want to substitute into this probably not because I'm going to S of cosine inverse of X that's nasty okay so sometimes that's not the best way to go about it but the idea of get as close as you can hand to solving for your parameter such as cosine Theta and sin Theta equal y a that's something we could do quick head out if you're kid with the algebra on that one so if you can't explicitly solve for your parameter like we don't want to here okay you don't want to do cosine inverse and you definitely don't want to do sin inverse and try substituting that's not a good idea but but if you do have like a trigonometric function like these ones are you have cosine right you have S isolate those pieces maybe Nota itself maybe not the parameter itself but isolate these pieces the trig function cosine Theta sin Theta and then use an identity for instance one identity that's comes to my mind right now that's really nice that relates s and cosine very nicely is this one do you remember that identity that's like the one you remember right what's that one called well check out why this might be nice if we can solve for sin Theta and cosine Theta then can we substitute these pieces into these pieces MH yeah in fact you know what uh I'm G to have I'm going to reverse this it's going to be the same thing but just because you'll see it a little bit nicer I'm going to write this as cosine S Plus sin s is that the same for you okay let's do the substitution one's not going to change tell me everybody what is cosine Theta what I'm sorry say that one more time x a so if I have cosine thet = x a cosine 2 thet is X a plus what's sin 2 yeah exactly right if I Square both those things we get x2 over a 2 + y^2 A2 oh my gosh you know what some of you might know what the picture of this graph looks like from right here but you're definitely going to in the next step let's get rid of that a squ what can I do on both sides of my equation to get rid of my a squ If I multiply on both sides then I get A2 = X2 + y^2 or if I write that in Reverse so here X2 + y^2 = A2 what the heck what is that do you know what that is that's a circle that's exactly what that is it's a circle do you guys see the circle out of that the form of a circle is x^2 + y^2 = radius s okay so here's my question what is my a here boom and boom what is my a no look up here what's my a in terms of my circle a is my radius so this is really interesting but it's a way that we can describe a circle without an equation in terms of X and Y this is it this parametric equation gives you a circle it just so happens that my radius is this a so if this was a two and a two my radius would be a two that's right this is giving my radius right there now if we're to graph this thing where's the center of this circle do you know you should know or it's at the origin remember that with our circles whatever I would add in here or add in here whether it's like plus or minus that's going to shift our center around so in our case we're not shifted at all the Center's at 0 0 um again how much is the radius it's not two how much is the radius a it's a so whatever my circle looks like it's going to go out to a and it's going to go up to and it's going to go left negative a and down so our Circle will look like by the way I'm horrible to drawing circles I'm not good at all obviously this is nasty but it's a it's a horrible Circle but let's pretend I'm good and it's perfect uh that's the cir man that's really bad too my bad it's okay I got to make it better it's okay so mine yeah but you're not being that's even worse okay whatever it's my circle uh so what this says is if I can get maybe my trig functions isolated and I can use an identity put them together you can make some sort of a a picture of what your graph looks like that's nicer than just looking here now eventually you're going to get so used to this you're going to look at that and go oh yeah that's a circle how is it a circle your numbers are the same if your constant is the same and you have cosine and sign that thing's going to be a circle you're going to get used to drawing a parametric equation like that with your radius of a so if this was a two and a two I'd have my radius of two show F feel okay with that so far now here's the issue where's it start where do it stop what direction is is it going do you know no no not unless I give you an interval so I want to be be real sure that you're clear on this one do you guys get the idea of using identity put these two things together in a relationship that relates X and Y so that you can have some expression in terms of X and Y that you can graph you you with me on that one next do you understand that without an interval I don't know where this thing starts I don't know where it stops and I don't know the direction that it's going do you guys get that okay so we're going to practice a couple intervals so let's say for the interval 0 to Pi for the interval 0 to Pi here's my question if I give you the interval 0 to Pi am I asking you to plug in Zer for X and Y or a am I asking for that what is the 0 to PI what's it relating to what variable up here not time in this case dire Theta it's relating to Theta the parameter so the interval that you get for a parametric equation is always excuse me relating to the parameter so in our case it says hey you know what um if theta equals z could you find me X and could you find me y if theta equals Pi could you find me X and could you find me Y what are you going to do are you going to use this to find X and Y no go back to your original the parametric equation so uh let's do this together okay okay if Theta equal 0 if theta equals 0 am I going to plug something in for a no okay so if theta equals 0 how much is cosine of 0 what's 1 * a so then X would equal what a very good x = a and Y um remember remember we use the same Theta for both of them that's how we get our X and that's how we got our y that's how we started this whole lesson was you plug it in separately for X and Y independent of one another so if Theta now equals where are we at zero if th equals 0 what's sign of Z what's 0 * a z perfect now what's cool is that that point must be on the picture that you just drew it's got to be there so let's look do we have a point of a comma 0 yes can you plot it on the graph is it here no is it here no is it here yes that's a z so this right here check it out like it's got to make sense for you okay do you understand that R Theta is going to start at zero because that's the parametric interval that we have so when I plug in Theta equal 0 I find my initial Point does that make sense so this is initial point now our interval stops at theta equals Pi so whatever I get here that's going to be my terminal point now you help you understand that idea so hey you know what Theta goes from here to here in order in that direction so it starts at zero therefore this is my initial Point stops at Pi therefore if I plug in Thal pi to my parametric equations up here I'm going to get my terminal point so let's do it if I plug in pi let's do our X first how much is cosine of pi what's 1 * a how much is s * pi 0 * a is this also on our graph somewhere it better be otherwise you did a graph wrong okay it's got to be there so where's negative a comma 0 this one that now is my terminal point so here's the 10sec recap before we figure out the direction okay and Direction be very easy um first thing find some way to relate an equation that contains both x's and y's that will give you an idea of the picture of this graph do that always even if it's hard to make the picture it'll at least give you like symmetry or something so that you can somehow make your picture does that make sense it'll it'll limit the amount of work you have to do as far as plugging in points it'll really help you so even if you got to use identities like we did here get a get a parameter by itself to do a substitution like we did in the first three examples or get at least a trigonometric uh expression with your parameter in there and then use an identity to relate them not a big deal we know the identities make your substitutions you now an expression in terms of X and Y hey that's a circle Center 0 0 your radius is a draw your picture after that take whatever interval I'm giving you find the starting point your initial point just plug in the first first uh parameter sorry um evaluate the parameter for whatever your interval starts at evaluate your parameter for whatever your interval stops at that's your initial point and teral Point respectively so here's what we know we start here we stop here the next question is what direction are we going are we going this way we're obviously going one of these ways correct we got to be going either this way or we're going this way how could you figure that out say what now there say it does but that just means our radius is is not a negative radius cuz that'd be really awkward to draw a circle with a negative radius you're Circle someh A being greater than zero means our radius is positive it's just saying that your circle has a positive radius um tell you what we start it do you know what what this stands for is this x is this y or is this thetaa and Theta is an angle right can you give me some angle between 0 and Pi plug in pi 2 should plug in pi two plug in something between there to give you that relationship so if I plug in Pi / 2 it's going to be easy just plug in pi over two plug in pi over two here uh everybody what is cosine of pi over 2 what's 0 * a okay well that's right oh sorry that's wrong uh plug in s of pi/ 2 what's s of Pi 2 what's 1 * a a and there you have it so where's our where's our Middle Point okay let me go back 5 Seconds do you understand that pi/ 2 is right between these things so that's going to be a point either here or here it's going to be right between them um is it the top a or the bottom it's right there does that give you the direction yes it says it starts here it goes through this point and then it goes through through this point so it's going this direction I missed it's going that way in fact does it make it down here so sometimes our formula in terms of X and Y gives us more of the graph than we even need here's what this says this says that this thing is going to make a circle are you following me along here this makes a circle we've just proven why it's it's going to be the whole circle an interval is going to cut part of this graph so interval says if you start at zero and you end at Pi you don't even have this that's not even there it's just starting here going along the top half of the circle and ending there show hands if you okay with that one okay if you're okay with that what would this be if this 0 to Pi is a half a circle in this direction what's 0 to 2 would it still start here yeah would it end here no no where would it end it would be the hole that would be one full circle but it would still have the same direction it still be a counterclockwise Direction don't you have you understand that one so full circle same direction how about this one would it still start this now 0 to 4 Pi would it still start at this initial point would this be the terminal point no 4 Pi not 3 Pi would this be the terminal point yes yes it would do yeah here's Pi 2 pi 3 Pi 4 Pi does that make sense same direction so you're going around it's like it'd be like you start at 3 o' on the on a on a clock H the name o clock anyway three on the clock so we'd go backwards we go back in time on back in time to 3 o' and then back in time to 3 o'clock again and do two full rotations this would be two circles but it's in a certain direction and why that's important is because sometimes Direction on how you rotate is important um when you get to calculus 3 you're going to have that idea that you're spinning one way or you're spinning another way that's kind of a physics idea as well so whether you're going up an Axis or down at a different axis show hands feel okay with with this idea okay good deal now can we extend this idea just a little bit further yes no yes you ready for it I'm going to go quickly through this one as well and now that we have this idea this will be a little bit easier so your ideas first thing find some curve that you can SK that's what we did first right we just did the circle then find the initial Point that's easy just plug in where your interval stop starts find your terminal point that's easy too plug in where your interval stops so once I give you interval that's easy to do after that find the direction plug in some midpoints and then you can find out where that thing goes whether it's up or down or left or right and that's the way that we go about doing these sketch your graph initial Point terminal point Direction that's the idea let's try that with this one okay true or false this is a parametric equation true then you got to tell me what the parameter is not the interval the parameter Theta what's the parametric interval so Thea is traveling between Z and Pi true or false this is a circle false why the radius is not the same so if this had been four and four would that be a circle yes if this had been three and three it'd be a circle if it's four and three is it a circle no is it similar to a circle what do you think this is lips you're exactly right this is exactly what this thing is going to look like now we're going to see that when we try to do the same thing okay so we don't have a anymore we have actual numbers makes things a little bit nicer to graph so if we're to solve for our parameter we can't quite get there we don't want to do cosine inverse or sin inverse that's crazy okay what we do want to do is isolate as much as we can so cosine Theta is x 4 sin thet is y 3 could I still use the same identity to put those together well I know that s^ s plus cosine squal 1 I can do that here so 1 = cosine 2 I'll put in this order because I like my x's coming first plus sin^2 no problem do our substitution that gives us 1 = x 4^ 2 + y 3 2 because I have cosine squar I have S squar so this is s hey sin squ that's Y 3^ 2 show if you okay with the algebra on that one simplify let's look at what this gives us we get 1 = x^2 over 16 we get y^ 2 over 9 if you've ever had any intermediate algebra or pre-calculus which I know you've made it through you should remember that this is the formula for an ellipse it's exactly what that is in fact when you when you know that this is a radius squared this is kind of like the idea of radius squared it's just this is in the X Direction hey it's under X this is in the y direction under y so what we get out of this we get an ellipse within the X direction we go four you see where the four is coming from and4 in the y direction we go three and3 this is 4 S and X Direction go four and four this is 3 s y direction would go three and three and that's where those numbers are come in from by the way do you understand why I have this centered at 0 0 yes yes why is it centered at 0 0 X and Y don't have any plus or minus very good so if I have no plus or minus it's not shifted and centered at the origin could you make this centered not at the origin sure if you wanted to you could do that uh you'd have something like four cosine Theta and then you'd have like plus two minus one something like that where when you solve for cosine Theta you'd have that addition or subtraction on the numer of your fraction so can feel okay with that idea now we're going to keep it simple just have it centered to the origin makes things kind of nice for us so let's graph it by the way my ellipses always look like Stewie heads or footballs which are the same thing so it's going to be awful uh but try to make yours better oh man that looks like Hey Arnold hey feels like an egg I told you I'm not very good at this I wish I was I had a professor one time who could draw perfect circle now you can jokeing like perfect I did tell you he's also a very bad teacher so wasn't your I'd rather be a good teacher and not be able to draw circles than a bad teacher who draws perfect circles cuz then what use are you anyway I bet he's a good art teacher I don't care what he is he's hor did you say he was a physics teacher physics teacher man it was horrible anyway it doesn't matter um so what I want to know is have I explained this well enough so to get a bad ellipse out of this parametric equation you can follow this down yes try to isolate a parameter if you can't at least isolate a trigonometric part part of that parameter use an identity to put them together in terms of X and Y so you at least get somewhat what your picture looks like this gives you exactly what your graph looks like it's an ellipse in the X Direction it goes 4 and4 and the y direction goes 3 and3 draw your picture and now now after you've done the picture this is when you plug in points not before this so as soon as you have your picture you go okay let's start plugging in points from our interval where does our interval start so theta equals z should give us something and where's your interval end I'm leaving some space here on purpose because you're going to see why in a minute = 2 pi should give us something uh what is Theta equal Z going to give us our initial point or our terminal point very good and what's the 2 pi going to give usal that's where our interval goes say Starts Here ends here goes in a certain direction now where do we plug in this zero and the 2 pi do we do X and Y or do we go back to our original original okay this is what the par equation is all about it's using Thea X and Y so plug it in uh what's cosine of Z so X would equal and Y would [Music] equal sure sign of 0 is 0 0 * 3 is 0 we get 4 Z hey is 4 Z somewhere on your graph hey where is it at at 4 Z that's why we grafted it so it's it's got to be there uh what point is that again initial okay now let's plug in the terminal plug in 2 pi everybody what is cosine of 2 pi please one one 4 * 1 what is s of 2 pi 0 * 3 hey is 4 Z on your graph wait a minute we just plotted that is that possible yeah it just says that what's happened here is you have an initial Point that's also your terminal point why cuz we make it how many times around this ellipse just one time think about how the angle would work here Thea is an angle right it just says you're going zero you're making it one time around in this case well that's the way we can think about it is not exactly that way because we can change an angle but uh in our case we do one rotation around that ellipse we have an initial Point that's also our terminal point does that make sense now to prove that you only go one time around this and not two times or three times or something crazy if our angle is a little different what you have to do is plug in some points between there so I'd plug in points like well give me an easy one to plug in between zero and 2 Pi Pi be great give me another one pi over two and plug in those values and that way you determine that you don't go around more than one time you don't just want to make that assumption okay so because right here if you did that if you plugged in zero and 4 Pi you're still going to get initial terminal but you're not going to know it goes around twice unless you plug in those middle values make sense so we're going to plug in stuff like Pi we're going to plug in stuff likea / 2 Anda = 3K / 2 and we're going to get a variety of points but notice what I'm not doing I'm not plugging in my points first I'm not plugging my thetas first I'm getting my picture first that's important you want to figure out what it looks like that way you can put where starting point is on the graph and you can determine where all your other directions go not your directions your direction is and what your other points are already on the graph for you so if we plug in pi what we're going to get is -40 that's here if we plug in Pi / 2 we're going to get zero and we're going to get three here we're going to get zero and we're going to get -3 and what that shows you is that if you go in order it says we start here at 40 then then we go to 03 then we go to -4 0 then we go to 03 and we finally end up at 40 so we're going in this direction now we make one full rotation so what you do sketch it label your initial point it's got to be on your graph otherwise you've done this wrong label your terminal points got to be on the graph otherwise you done it wrong and then label your Middle Point somewhere that gives your direction CH hands have I explained this well enough for you okay we're going to do one more are there any questions before we keep on going you sure you're good with it it's not that bad right as long as you know to relate in some sort of a formula with an identity if you don't have this part then this is why I asked you to look at those trig identities before you start this lesson so if you don't have that part you oh man what am I supposed to do here just pluging a whole bunch of points it's going to take you for if you don't know what this thing looks like it's going to take you forever to actually figure out what's going on not forever but it's gonna take you a lot of plugin in points okay man what am I supposed to plug in I don't know uh well it's gonna take you a bit you know what the picture would like okay shoot that's a circle Starts Here ends here it's got to go either this way or this way plug in one point you're done all right same thing with okay last one this is a little bit more advanced so I want to walk you through one that is a little more difficult so you get used to it okay here we go so are we always going to be given an interal if you're not then you assume it goes from negative Infinity to Infinity all right with a trigonometric function like this because they are cyclical circles right or ellipses or what this is not going to be Circle well I'll get to that minute um it's going to often times repeat and so generally you're going to be given an interval for that because you got to have a starting point somewhere right got to land on the paper um the object has to land on the paper or on the plane and then go around it so no I think I gave couple in the last part of this lesson like last time where I didn't give you an interval um like the square root of T in which you said well the natural domain for for that parametric for that parameter is zero and positive well that gives it to you but then I gave you another one where it was T and then t^2 in which you don't have one you have to assume that your T starts at negative infinity plus plug that in figure out where your your graph starts that's why you graph them first CU what if I didn't give you an interval you literally have nothing to plug in right how you going to do that so you got to figure out what the graph looks like first before you start plugging in parameters can't do it can't do it done don't do that okay all right now let's walk through this one I'm going to try to go a little slower but we also need to get this done in this lesson so if we have xal sin T and y = sin 2T start from the beginning what type of an equation is this parametric equations right here what is the parameter in this case what's the parametric interval very good okay so we know that we're going to have a starting point at t 0 ending point at T = 2 pi true or false this is for sure a circle false false doesn't look very it doesn't look at all like what we've had before what we had was something cosine and something something sign and we had Theta and Theta or T and T you with me the parameter doesn't matter really what it is in our case um T is going to be like an angular relationship here so it's not going to be a circle we're going to have to do some work to figure out what this is now the idea is you want to try to isolate the parameter or at least if you're given trigonometric functions isolate a trig function with the parameter in it which is also isolated so for instance this one can I isolate the T do I want to isolate the T with a sin inverse don't use inverse can I isolate the T no can I isolate the s t done that's nice can I isolate the T no you don't want to use sign inverses can I isolate the s t that's what I'm going to work on okay I don't want to isolate sin 2 T I want sin T in there somewhere so if I start with like y = sin 2T so here's the start of our example if y = sin 2T that's really not what I'm looking for and the reason why I'm not looking for it is because I'm going to try to do this again I'm going to try to do cosine squ Theta or in this case cosine Square t and sin Square t if I have 2 T that's not going to fly very well make sense use an identity do you know an identity that gets rid of that two yeah yeah so maybe we got to use that you guys okay with this so far you sure now why you try to isolate those trig functions is because a lot of times when you're doing this if you've isolated the trig function it's going to give you an expression in terms of the other variable check this out do we know how much sign T is yes this right here is X so y = 2x cine T now can I isolate a parameter even if it has a trick function around it and make it in terms of X and Y alone are you listening to what I'm saying can I isolate the trig function here even if it has isolate the parameter even it has a trig function around it and make it in terms of X and Y how would I do that isolate say what divide by 2x okay so I get y / 2x = cine T I know that some of this is like wow what what why are you doing this um the idea behind this is you want to get a parameter isolated so that you can make a substitution or if you can't get a parameter isolated like in this case if you can't do that at least find something you can use in an identity a nice identity that will allow you to put those parameters together okay so for us we go hey parameter isolated not really but with a trig function yeah it's good this equals x why we get that is so you can make a substitution right here for an identity that's useful for you okay this one not good at all we can't we can't put this in an identity and make sense out of it where we can make both of these things together that won't there's no identity that allows you to put sin T and sin 2T together besides well this one right that that's it so what we're going to have to do is make this identity here well if you do you immediately can plug in X for s t that's nice this is x s t is X as given by definition of our parameter so that's cool now as soon as you make this into an X can you solve it for the other one and as soon as you do that as soon as you solve it now we have sin t = x we have cine T equals something in X and Y now let's use that identity so if we have 1 = cosine 2 t + sin 2 T stick with me here folks do I have an expression for cosine t y okay so if cosine T is y 2x then cosine 2 T is y 2x^2 plus do I have an expression for sin T that was the easy one that was given to us like that it's so if sin T is X then sin s t is x^2 so P feel okay with it so far all right let's continue working then uh let's start simplifying so this is 1 = y^2 4x^2 + x^2 so far so good this is nasty do you know how do now this was cool over here right the graph was very easy to see this was simply an ellipse is the graph easy to see here okay so simplify it a little bit if you can work with this then multiply everything by 4x^2 cuz I don't like denominators okay so 4x^2 = y^2 + 4 x to 4th can you follow me on the algebra maybe you get everything to one side we like functions looking like that so subtract this I get 0 = 4 x 4 - 4x^2 + y^2 can you verify my algebra on that one yeah subtracting this plus that now oh man so if hands feel okay with the algebra the idea behind it so again the idea isolate a parameter if you can't if you can't at least isolate the function around your parameter like sign or use an identity so that you can isolate cosine T isolate something you might have to use a substitution just to isolate that you with me on that one you sure mhm okay well then use an identity and put them together so if I have cosine T and sin T I know I can use this identity paging identity work it out make them in terms of X and Y the reason why we do this is not necessarily we like getting the picture right that's nice that's awesome but even if we can't get the picture for instance uh do you know what this graph looks like is this a circle no an ellipse no look like anything you've ever seen before probably right no it doesn't but at least it will give you some hints as to what this picture will do so that you can plug in less points the least amount of points possible for instance if I look at this do you see how my x's are both being squared what that tells you is that in terms of X this is an even function that means it's going to be symmetrical about the not the xaxis the Y AIS remember even functions how they do that basically it says this if I plug in negatives listen to why I know some of you know the term even function but you really don't understand what it means what it means is that when you plug in positives and when you plug in negatives you get the same thing out because you're taking to the second power and to the fourth power that means if I plug in two or -2 I get the same output does that make sense that means it's symmetrical about the Y AIS so these things right here this says it's even in terms of X that means symmetrical about the Y AIS what's that one tell you if Y is being squared about the xaxis that's right because when I plug in y = 1 or yal ne1 I would get the same X Out okay well that means it's symmetrical about the x-axis so here's the point I'm trying to make even though this doesn't give you an exact picture of what this graph is going to look like it tells you that it's symmetrical about the X and symmetrical about the y basically you just need to plot the points in quadrant one and then you get quadrant two for free then you quadrant three for free and by uh the transit property you get quadrant four for free I'm sorry I what I going backwards for you guys so you'd get if you do quadrant one you get quadrant two for free and quadrant four for free therefore you can get three either way you go so if it's if it's reflected across the y AIS and the x-axis or the xaxis than the y- AIS it's hard to move my hand that way you got to excuse me uh somehow you're going to get this one this one and that one that make sense okay that limits the amount of work you have to do you have to plug in every single value from 0 to 2 pi that take you a long time so by doing this well we figure out that we plot quadrant one and then we're going to quadrant two 2 4 and three and the direction has to work work with this uh so if we do quadrant one and the direction it's going to give the rest of it up for basically three so it's not useless this gives you a lot of useful information so what we're going to do since we have this goes through all four quadrants let's plot just the first quadrant so 0 to Pi would give us the first two quadrants 0 to Pi / 2 would give us just the first quadrant does that make sense so we're going to do a whole bunch bunch of points but they're all going to be in quadrant one so let's start here so what we're going to do is we're going to find some points between 0 and Pi / 2 and use symmetry to give us the rest of them what are some good values to plug in for T I know is one of them obviously and what's another good one we're going to plug in oh yeah Pi 2 yes Pi 2 we're going to need that Pi six is a good one yeah pi over 4 is a good one pi over 3 is a good one now put them in order what's in the middle what's in here six good six is here and Power Three is here is that okay yeah it's helpful to know a unit circle where are we going to plug in these T's are we going to plug it in here no no here here and there so don't forget then when you plug it in here how's that work what should you do two before you do the sign or after you do the sign okay so that's important that you know that so when we plug these things in I'll do it with you uh because we got to kind of go fast but I'm sure you can do it on your own let's take zero so we're going to plug in our T because it's a param equation to the parameter where we get our X and our Y coordinates from so what's sign of zero so therefore X here is z uh what's what's 2 * 0 of Z so we start at 0 0 I'm going to do this as we go our first point is what what do we call that I know it's the origin but in terms of that's very good initial point and the origin you're both right my bad I should have been more specific initial Point very good now well how about Pi 6 let's do uh let's do s of Pi 6 what is it and remember what you do here you do 2 * / 6 that's Pi 3 what's sign of Pi three okay how about P or four let's do sign of 4 what is it how about oh how about this one what's what's 2 * 4 2 * 4 is what's s of2 how about Pi 3 what's s of Pi 3 we already kind of did it that gives us our x coordinate now remember we multiply by two so 2 * piun 3 is 2 piun 3 what's s of 2 pi 3 you know look it up look at your I'll do the hard one for you okay I'll do this one and you guys you guys take care of that louder Jessica so s of Pi / 2 s of pi/ 2 is one and then if I do well 2 * 2 is pi s of Pi is I already did it for you oops zero figure that one out [Music] yet it's positive all students so sign is positive for the first 0 to Pi so um let's see sign counts up S counts up so s goes 0 over two then 1 over two actually of 0 over 2 of 1 over 2 of 2 over two of 3 2  3 over2 so where is 2 pi over 3 2 pi over 3 would be this would be pi over 3 and then this would be 2 pi over 3 so it's root3 over two double check that for make sure I'm not wrong too am I right that's right let's plot those points all right can you plot those points are they all numbers yes all right we already had the initial one 0 0 what's the terminal point for this uh this like sub interval that we have what's a terminal point so I know I'm going to make this kind of extended that way we have a good graph here so here's one let's make sure we get one right one and one okay here's what we know we know it starts here and it's going to end for our little sub interval at 1 Z quick head now if you're okay with that so far all right is it just going to go no darn it that'd be cool right this goes like this no it doesn't do that it goes along this course so we have 0 0 it's going to end at 1 0 for this little sub interval the next point it's going to go to after 0 0 is SO2 is right in the middle < tk3 over2 how much is root3 over two is it more than one or less than one it's less than one right let's just we're going to approximate right about there now when I plug in < tk2 2 < tk2 over2 sorry I'm going to plug in 4 I get < tk2 over2 and 1 where's < tk2 over2 in relation to 1/2 is it more than 1/2 or less than 1/2 it's more than 1/2 but it's less than one so if I plug in X = < tk2 over2 and 1 I'm going to get something right here how about < tk3 /2 < tk3 over2 where's < tk3 over2 in relation tok2 two is it so here's < tk2 over2 is it to the right or to the left to the right but not very much not not a whole bunch as right about here and then do we go up to one or just under one actually the same exact level as that was here's how our graph looks show pant feel okay with those points there's points on the graph use your calculator if you want to approximate with uh with decimals so this goes up to this point and then down to one I know I'm not a great artist but do you guys see the way that this graph should look yes no what direction is it going is it going this way or the reverse way way number one or way number two way number one now this is what is nice because we've already determined this is symmetric about the X and symmetric about the Y where is it going to jump to Now is it going to jump to quadrant number two or quadrant number three or quadrant number four it's going this way can can your bug do this I mean I know it literally can but can it can it stay on the plane and jump from here to here not unless it has like a wormhole a wormhole that's right you Star Trek dorks um Star Wars is where it's at fools just joking I like Star Trek too so it can't go from here to here that doesn't make sense it must continue along its path so here's how it looks it's symmetric so that means it goes like this but then it continues down here let's see uh right about there continues down here like this and does that do you see it and then it's going to continue well let's see this goes up or this goes down the direction goes up or down it must follow the path follow the path My Pan Learners starts here goes like this hits this one hey we hit our initial Point are we done no no cuz we also know symmetric about this and this so from here is it going to go down this way it's going to go up and you might want to plug in a couple points to do that but it can't it can't do this it's got to go this way so right up there second infity it's gonna continue this way gonna continue this way by the way could you plug in some points to to double check this you could always do that but at least now you have a picture of what this thing looks like it's nice lastly it's also symmetric about that we go this way and now we wrap it up so what's going to happen at zero we're here if I plug in pi over two I'm going to be here if I plug in pi I'm going to be back to here plug in uh 3 pi over 2 I'm going to be here plug in two P back to my origin so that is also my terminal but it does one full lap around that TR it's like a race car driver and then turns and it's going back to start and then goes around the other cor you ever seen those ones where they have like a figure racing that's crazy stuff that's what this is show hands that one made sense for you cool can you do it I think you can with some sometimes
