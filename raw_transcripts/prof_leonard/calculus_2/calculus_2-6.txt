Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 6.6:  A Discussion of Hyperbolic Functions
now what we're doing we're going to get on to a really interesting section uh what we're going to talk about is something called hyperbolic functions this is section 6.6 some instructors cover this some instructors choose to kind of gloss over it we're going to cover it because I think it's really interesting it's really useful so we're going to talk about hyperbolic functions you go what in the world is a hyperbolic function uh I want to show them to you right now the hyperbolic functions the reason why they're in this chapter in this this section here right after inverses is because hyperbolic functions look they don't look a lot like but they act a lot like trig functions so we call them hyperbolic trig functions sometimes let me give you an example what these things are here's the definitions for your hyperbolic functions so we start with sign to say that it's hyperbolic we just introduce a little H some people call this cinch say cinch cuz it's so easy CCH it's a CCH I know right I have a possibly the largest D you've ever seen so s hyperbolic sign here's the definition of it it's weird it is e xus e x / 2 what's really interesting about these things um you ever notice how when you drive next to like electric electric wires how they they curve like that it's called a catary uh they're actually based on hyperbolic functions so the way that a cable hangs between two points is based on some of this stuff really weird it actually happens in real life for engineering all the time so this is cinch or hyperbolic sign hyperbolic cosine K Kush looks really really similar really really similar the rest of the hyperbolic functions stem from these two so um really quickly if you wanted hyperbolic tangent no special name no tant or anything like that doesn't really sound good anyway just hyperbolic tangent hey now this is what's cool about this a lot of the same properties of trig functions carry over to hyperbolic function so whereas tangent equals s over cosine hyperic tangent equals c over C so this would equal hyic sign over hyperbolic cosine that's interesting imagine this over this and that is is what hyic tangent is I did it twice in a row come on let draw s Intrigue functions cosecant is one over s hyperbolic hyperbolic cosecant is one over inch that's right holic sign looks very similar same thing happens second this is now one over C and if tangent hyperbolic tangent equals cinch over Kos then hyperbolic Cent is yep it is the reciprocal it's okay with those those properties those are the definitions that we work with in these hyperbolic functions now I'm going to give you some identities the identities look really similar to the basic trig identities that you have but there's slight differences um so write these down have them next to you when you're doing your homework that way you can refer back to them okay so write these down and I don't expect you to memorize all of them U some of them you're going to because they're just so similar uh to the other ones but some differ just slightly okay so here's the identities that we're going to use hyperbolic sign if I plug in a Negative X it gives me now negative hyperbolic sign what this is saying and you can write this down next to it this is saying that just like s is an odd function you remember odd odd is symmetrical about the origin just like s is an odd function hyperbolic sign is also an odd function that's what this says basically the says a odd function now C think back to cosine is cosine even or odd even it's actually even because it's symmetric across the y- axis Kos gives you Kos when I plug in negative actually gives you back the positive that's saying this is an even function if you need to look up odd or even go ahead and look up what odd and even means later those are two identity spores now this is where some of the differences happen the Pythagorean identity for trigonometric functions what would go here to give us one A Plus would go there for hyperbolic it's a minus this is why I'm telling you have these next to your paper when you're doing it CU right now these are brand new okay it's a little bit different they're all hyperbolic so they're a little different also another one another Pythagorean that one it's also true I'm just going to State the rest of them some of them are going to look really familiar to you I hope they do they're on those those cheat sheets that I know a lot of you have when you in the back of your book or whatever all the the trig identities that you carry with you it's good thing for this one's kind of an important one this will look familiar to you remember this one it's called the double angle U if you had this basic old sign without the without the hyperbolic this would be equal to do you remember it 2 this be two sin cosine well same thing happens here it's two cinch gosh that's kind of cool that looks really similar in fact I'm going to prove this one for you in just a bit okay I swear this is it I'm tired of riding too arms were out already okay I know that's a lot of them but for those of you who are familiar with your trig identities don't a lot of those look really really similar to what you've learned yeah a lot of them are very very very close I mean this one exactly the same these ones close these ones exactly the same I mean they're they're all so so close well what I'm going to do now we're not going to you're not going to be required to do all of these proofs but I want to give you an idea about how you would prove one of these so let's take a look at uh which one I say that one let take a look at that one I'll prove that for you so we're going to prove number seven the way that you prove these I know you still writing some of you but the way you prove these you start here on the left side or start on one side and prove the other side okay you don't do them both at once you start on one side and work to the other so if I start with cinch of 2x okay follow me along here the only thing we have to work with as far as proofs go are other identities which probably not a good idea right now since we haven't proved any of them or these definitions and these are the only two definitions that we have that go back to e to the X so let's see what this would be please please listen very carefully I don't want to lose you right now if c x = e xus e tox since 2x would be e to 2x - e - 2x does that make sense whatever you have here is whatever you plug in there so then this equals e 2x minus E -2X all over 2 does that make sense let's rewrite it just a little bit I'm going to rewrite this as e to x s is that still legal to do yesus e tox SAR over two you okay with that one that my friends is a difference of squares do you see it yes no difference of squares can be factored so if we factor that this is e to xus e x * e X+ e x over two you still okay so far now do those look similar to some of these other definitions I'll make it okay I'll do one more Stu see by the blank looks on your faces that no the answer is no some of them don't check this out what if I did E to x minus E thex / 2 * e x + e x X look back at our definition for this please how much is this this is hyperbolic sign or cinch is this C where's the two where's the two so we're going to make a two do you agree that I can multiply by whatever I want as long as I multiply by one it doesn't change it so I'm going to multiply by 2 over two only I'm going to put this two here and this two out front did you catch that yeah this one goes here this one goes out front it's very similar to your identities that you did with sin x overx when X approaches zero and you had like s of 5x overx multiply by 5 over five and you get five so I multiply by 2 over two it's still one but now we have two this is cinch this is C and we've just proved it so on some of your homeworks are going to ask you to do these go back to these definitions and use them none of some of them are are pretty easy pretty straightforward this one's pretty straightforward did that make sense to you it's different from anything you probably ever done show fans if you understood it feel okay with it good that's fantastic Okay so we've proved it and that's not a problem now that we've done that what I'd like to cover are the derivatives we're going to do derivatives we're going to do the integrals um then we'll start working through some of these examples and and call it good do you have any questions on your identities I'll be referencing them uh but we won't we're not going to do a whole bunch of them today I just wanted to prove them for you you will be using them in your derivatives and integrals any questions all because I got to erase it okay let's talk about your derivatives I'd like to give you the first three just by some very simple proofs that way you understand where these things are coming from uh tell me something first though what's the derivative of s just sign okay what's the derivative of cosine very good and the derivative of tangent we're going to see if there's any differences with these things so let's start off with the derivative of cinch how do you know is coach are we guessing we're guessing I looked in the book already uh well let's go back to what the identities say okay we we'll prove it so if I'm going to do this keep in mind that what this is this is the derivative I'm going to Der very quick right now to prove these okay this would be the Der of e xus e x over two so we're going back to the definition you guys okay with that derivative of e remember this two you do not need a quo rule here it's a constant so Dera of e x is e x minus the derivative of this is e tox times1 see where netive 1's coming from that negative would change us to a plus this is yes the derivative of cinch is C isn't that kind of cool do you guys see the proof out of that one yeah interesting okay so how about we do now this one's going to blow your mind maybe this would be the derivative of e to x + e x / 2 check this one out firstly notice that is C what's the Dera of e to x d of e x e time so so negative e to thex over 2 how much is that cin not negative it's just cinch do you see it so this one just like regular trick functions this one not so much cuz we the negative but still the idea is very simar question can you one time why that to the constant you don't if I see that I automatic well you shouldn't because it's not a function of X over a function of X it's a function of X over constant if you did quotient rule hey everybody what's a derivative of two Z undefined half your no not undefined half your quotient is gone you just you're it's low D high right minus high D low d low the second half of your quotient is zero why would you do that now now that I just said you don't need a quoti rule okay so from our definition we know that this is equal to now if I could write it correctly yeah do we need a quotient rule here yeah we do we do because well this is a function of X over function of X that's different okay now here's the nice thing about this because we just proved these two derivatives we can use them we don't have to change into these we just proved it do you got me so all we need is quotient Rule now I'm going to do the quoti rule really quickly quotient rule says low d d High which is C does that make sense low D High minus high D L Square the bottom and away we go so low D High minus high D low Square the bottom and we're good to go oh let's see that's uh that's cos 2 x minus cinch s x all over cos s x look back at those identities I told you to have next to you at all times can you tell me how much this is 1 over cos 2 x now can you just bring it up now look back at that look back at your identities again your definitions one over Co one over Kos that's hard to say it is hard to say one over Kos was hyperbolic SN does that make sense so 1 s is hyperbolic syn squ so the derivative of tangent hyperbolic tangent is hyperbolic secant squ does that look similar to your triat functions Che a lot of them are going to I'm going to give you the list right now of all these things and I'm going to likewise give you the integrals right next to them we'll do that over here this will need little cheat thing yes so here's your table your new table of more derivatives and more integrals the table's getting pretty long now isn't it yeah table of D's and eyes derivative and integral please keep in mind what can happen every time you do a derivative what can happen always always looking for chain rules okay so still chain rules exist so if I'm talking since you then that's going to be C you C darn you get it uh do you d x by the chain rule what that means is that going backwards the integral of c u duu would equal what if the Der of cinch gives you cost integral of cost you just cinch what's nice about HP BS you have no negatives to worry about care there are none in cin and caution at least that's good to go that's kind of nice derivative of costu we just found it out was CCH U DX by the chain rule therefore the integral of cchu is what please that's right thanks we already did tangent over here if we do hyperbolic tangent then our derivative is good which means if I ever get the opportunity to make a hyperbolic secant squar then we end up getting hyperbolic tangent plus C are you guys okay with these so far the first three we've actually done already this the last three they are going to look so similar to the things that you've done of course some signs can be different because that's we find out with found out with s and cosine that well the derivative of of Kos is not negative sign it's just it's cinch so some of the same thing happened here when we did cosecant when we did derivative cose you got negative cosecant Cent correct same thing we get here so when do h cose we get netive hyperbolic cose times hyperbolic cang DX which means that our integral of hyperbolic cosecant Cent that's right this is what we typically do with our our integrals we usually don't have the negative in here we just say the the answer our our resultant is going to be negative which one am I missing okay see let's do see the derivative of a regular secant is secant tangent the derivative of hyperbolic secant is hyperbolic secant hyperbolic tangent but it's negative notice how some of the signs change which means that if I have a hyperbolic secant and hyperbolic tangent we're going to get Negative hyperbolic seant okay one more I swear I know it's dry I really do we're going to practice something just a bit if you know this is dry what's the last one what one is that normally what is the negative cosecant squ so when we do hyperbolic cotangent we end up do the same thing we get Negative hyperbolic cose squ it's hard to say isn't it there's so many hyperbolic in there and stuff so negative hyperbolic cose s of course d DX by our chain rule which means when we get an integral with the hyperbolic cosecant in there hyperbolic cosecant squ in there we know that that's going to be equal to negative hyper Cent Oh My Gosh okay that's it thankfully do yourself favor keep these handy keep your identities and your deriv and integrals on the same little piece of paper and keep them handy all the time okay cuz we're going to be using them not a whole bunch like I said uh a lot of this book doesn't depend on this section it's kind of a little Standalone section uh but it's a good section it is important in in real life I mean this this stuff does happen so I wanted you to be aware of it uh now we're going to practice what we're going to find out is that your derivatives and your integrals it really doesn't change from all the stuff that youve just learned how to do it's going to be a lot of chain rules it's going to be a lot of substitutions you're just trying to make them fit now there's just more stuff that you can fit it into does that make sense to you you don't have to make everything look like this to take a derivative now that we have all these we get to use them so that's cool and all this is what they are but we get to use this stuff which is nice you want to see some examples of this sure okay so so we are actually going to do a lot of derivatives let's do that okay so cos S 3 T ^2 + 1 is the argument of our hyperbolic Co cosine function uh tell me some first some things that you see here tell you what this is oh never mind I can't say that joke um anyway in this class it's kind of like in uh in math C or your intermediate algebra class when the teacher asks you what do you do here and you and 90% of the time you just have to say factor and you get it right uh here if I ask you what are you going to do here 90% of time you say uh chain rule yeah you're going to get right okay there's always going to be a chain rule involved so if you don't know the answer just say chain rule you look like a genius you couldn't do a subtitution here are you doing integrals yeah then you would not probably not want to do a substitution technically a chain rule is a substitution just don't show it you substitute for U you do it you do DX okay but that's the the substitution is the opposite of a chain rule okie dokie it's for integrals does that make sense now I see a chain rule in fact I see two chain two you need to know that hyperbolic cosine squared this means it's this squar that's what that means did you know that that that little two right there it's the whole thing is being raised to the second power it's we write it this to make it easier so with our derivative tell me the first thing we're going to do please quickly though I know it's chain Ru thank you for following my advice right now just yelling it out goad two to the front okay very good so two to the front do we change the inside on chain roll so this is going to be nasty this is going to be C of nasty crap raised to what power now and then we're done right no no we don't get off that easy so we bring down the two leave it alone subtract one now we do a derivative you know what I made a mistake did you catch my mistake this should be a t my apologies shame on Mr Leonard so bring down the two chain rule just general power rule if you know it by that name bring down the two subtract one keep the inside the same then you multiply by the derivative of yep the inside of that of them in one okay so now we have this one what is the follow the DDT the DDT tells you where you're doing calculus here calculus said just do the big thing first chain roll okay okay now we got that now do this thing what does that say I know what it says what are you going to do derivative of this so that's going to be negative C or positive right very good so oh yeah do you do the derive of this right now NOP no no chain rule says you leave that alone and then you do the derivative of the inside later oh my goodness let's do a 10c recap make sure you're okay with it does it look does it look any different than your normal derivatives it's just a slightly different idea because you're not dealing with trig you're dealing with hyperbolic functions so bring down the two no problem it's chain Ru D of this that's essentially the inside alone derivative of the inside we're almost done derivative of this is so this becomes 6t let's just rewrite it so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull this 6 T out front mash it together with this two is this okay with you so we're going to get 12T we are going to get C 3T ^2 + 1 time c 3 T ^2 + 1 make it that far you're good to go show F you okay with that one notice how the derivative ideas the chain rules they don't differ they're the same it's just that we have some different derivatives that we're dealing with you okay with that one tell you what let's uh I'm going to try to get to two more we'll see if we have time for that actually you want to try one just on your own sure I think you can do it oh yeah I want hyperbolic coent of hyperbolic cosecant of 2x yes I'm going to give you enough time as I erase this side of the board and then we're going to go for it actually let your dribs are up there so I'll leave it for this one did you do the first step already M thank you what is your first step what's the answer 90% of the time this question at least when you're dealing with derivatives yeah we're going do a chain Ru do you guys see the chain rule inside of the chain rule yeah this has of course a chain rule this has another chain rule so when we do it well it says take the derivative of the outside function if I look over there I see it's negative Co hyperbolic cose square of the inside so I'm going to leave this alone did you make it that far derivative of this is this leave the inside alone it's chain rule but then don't forget to multiply by the derivative of the inside so chain rule says derivative of outside function leave inside alone then multiply derivative of the inside function thankfully for us that's a really easy chain rule that's nice what's the Der of this cinch 2X and then time derivative 2x so we're going to get a two out of that okay derivative so this is done we did derivative outside leave inside alone times der inside we got this we're following the DDX here now chain rule again derivative outside is leave the inside alone times the derivative of the inside that's where we're getting that two from you guys okay with that one match all this stuff together if you can the two let's put that up front so -2 hyperbolic cose squ of 2x cinch 2x let's make sure we know that these are arguments of our hyperbolic functions take your the mouth it's crazy show F feel okay with that one good all right tell you what we got time for one more and next time just to blow your minds um we're going to talk about inverse hyperbolic functions all right but not this time not this time wor I know right oh my gosh got through this uh let's try let's see which ones I'm going to erase all this CU we're going to do an integral oh don't worry we're doing integrals so we'll need this stuff how would you say that H yeah our cost or hyperbolic cosine inverse inverse it's super fun to say makes you sound real smart it does yeah imagine if you would have seen this the first day of class huh I would true more okay we're going to work through it together together I'll give you some hints on this one I don't have enough time to really have you work on it but I'm going to show you some of the the ideas here one of the ideas is none of these things have a 3X in them they'll have U's or you can just make it an X just a single variable so anytime you see an argument with like a 3X 3X 5x 5x uh X2 X x s with an X out front just substitute do a very quick substitution to get rid of the 3x so what I mean is we would do U = 3x so then we'd have du over 3 = DX or the 3 goes up front whatever you want to say there so we get cos 2 U cinch U and then du over 3 does that make sense to you yeah don't put uh but we have the the over three we'll just pull that 1/3 out front now we can deal with this a little bit better so basic basic substitution remember you can substitute as long as you match up disregarding your constants so if the derivative is three man you're good to go get 3x pull this out front we get 1/3 integral cos^2 U Since U now does this look exactly like one of these then what are you going to have to use identi identi not identities what do you use in integrals when it doesn't look exactly the same you use substitution so this going to be a double substitution here okay well think about think about that you have to don't you don't you have to it doesn't look anything like that there's no identity that lets you put these together in any fashion so you need a substitution now substitutions work this way listen carefully please substitutions work this way the substitution is typically the inside of something and the derivative has to be there so let's look at the correct choice is this the correct choice for substitution no cost would be there but not cost squared that's a problem is this the correct substitution with the squared or without good it's the inside so what we're going to do here is we're going to pick pick a different letter like w and pick that for Posh U make sure your DW matches your W what's the derivative of c [Music] u c u hey look at this this is exactly this thing so when we change this I'm going to have 13 please watch carefully this was c u 2 I sub super Cost U what goes here W very good that's W2 this is W so now we have W squ you guys okay with that one that's gone now what happens to all of this stuff what is that these have to match now look at that can you do that integral that is an absolute piece of cake this is going to be 13 W cubed over 3 we haven't done one of those in a really long time have we I forgot about those we trig stuff you guys okay with that add one divide by the new exponent yeah so w 3 3 that means we get W 3 over 9 and then we leave it like that everything everything so so here's the here's the deal if we've got W Cub over 9 what is our W so then here we've got C wait a minute C 3 you can put one of two things you U or you can do the 3x I'm going to put the U so I give myself two steps here over 9 uh do I have it right no what am I missing so this was our W if we have W cubed We need c cubed of U over 9 and now last little step I'm going to erase this here last little step to make it final we're going to have cubed instead of our U what was our U over 9 plus C wrap it up did that make sense to you yeah so you can do a sub a double substitution just pick a different letter but you'll see it's the same stuff you've been doing really is same derivatives same same integrals it's just we have a new integration and derivative table so if hand feel okay with with that one okay obviously all right so last time we talked about hyperbolic functions now if you think about hyperbolic functions I know I didn't show you the graphs of them but you can look them up uh is actually in your book it's a one: one function they're all one: one functions which mean that if we have a one: one function there has to be some sort of an inverse to it so what we're talking about today are okay hyper bolics are 1: one we're going to talk about inverse hyperbolic here's the notation for it it's just like any other inverse we have hey hyperbolic function now inverse all these are holic inverses of the normal holic functions that we talked about last time I've given you the domain for each of them you can go ahead and write that down like I said we're not going to work a whole bunch with this stuff but I want you to be aware that they exist obviously they have to because they're coming from one to one functions now what I'm going to talk about specifically here is what they look like as logarithms you're like wait a minute as logarithms well think back to what hyperbolic are hyperbolic sign was was e xus e x over 2 you with me now what's the inverse of e to X log it's a log it's lnx actually does that make sense to you so if the inverse of edx and exponential is a logarithm Ln X for instance well then the inverses of hyperbolic because they they're all based on exponentials like e xus e x / 2 and E X Plus e x / 2 because they're based on those well then we can write these inverses also as logarithms I'm going to show you that right now so here's how these things look as logarithms these are definitions you can take them for granted so if we want to write s hyperbolic sign inverse you could also write it as Ln x + square < TK of X2 + 1 wherever you see this it means this wherever you see this you can actually write it as this they're the same thing their definition now tan hyperbolic tan inverse you can write that as 12 Ln 1 + x over 1 - x and last we only knew three because the other ones you can find as reciprocals of these three so it's kind of easiest to Define these three okay the last one well this one's going to look a whole lot like uh C inverse so this is C inverse would be Ln x + S < TK instead of x^2 + one we're going to have x^2 minus one just the difference of one little sign in there please write those down correctly make sure you have them exactly the way that I have them on the board I don't want you to write these down and then write them down correctly and then use it wrong for the whole class okay you guys okay with this so far do you want to see a proof yes I'm not going to prove all three I'll prove uh these two are very similar so I'll prove this one that way you get another one basically for free so here's a proof for this um let's start with cos inverse X and let's have it equal to let's say y well from what we know about inverses I'm going to go through this a little bit quickly but write it down if you want to you don't have to to memorize this proof uh just kind of I want you to follow it all right so if I'm going too fast for you to write down just review the video later or don't don't really worry about it I just want you to be a be aware of it uh understand where this thing comes from you guys with me so here we go if this is true then this has to be true true sure that's that's kind of the definition of inverses right C inverse of xal Y if only have c y equals equals x well let's use the definition then for c c y if you remember this from here I'm going to switch these sides okay then X would equal instead of c y the definition of c y is e to X+ e x over 2 do you remember that that's how I I initially gave you these things oh you know what I made one mistake did you see the mistake I actually made it the Y instead X's I do this all the time because we memorize it as X but if I'm going to say this is Kos y then this has to be Y and this has to be y did you guys catch that one okay now since we have xal well let's uh remember we're not we're not actually doing derivatives here this is just a we're not doing derives at all I didn't say the derivative of this equals this did you notice that it's not derivative not calculus I'm saying this literally equals this so we're not going to do any calculus at all we're basically going to do some algebraic manipulation trying to solve this thing for y if we can solve this thing for y look at the board here real quick if we can solve this for Y and Y equals this then we'll have an expression in terms of X that represents C inverse does that make sense to you so no calculus no derivatives nothing like that we're just solving this well one idea that we're going to do here we're going to say all right well this is cool uh what if we just multiply both sides by two then we get 2x = e y y plus e y all right now I'm going to do something uh do something here CU I'm going to manipulate this function a little bit or this equation I'm going to solve this for zero so I'm going to subtract 2x on both sides so I'm going to get 0 = e y - 2x + e y you guys okay with that so far now I'm going to do some Fancy Pants math the Fancy Pants math here is is this I don't like I don't like this negative y I don't like either negative y so what I'm going to do to get rid of this I'm going to multiply both sides of an equation keep in mind it's an equation I can do whatever I want as long as I do it to both sides I'm going to multiply both sides by E to Y if that's the case e y * 0 is still zero only here this e to the Y will distribute check this out I'm going to get watch e to the Y Y 2 you see it I'm actually going to keep it this way e y 2 I'm going to get - 2x e the y - 2x I'm also going to write this a little bit specially I'm going to keep this in parentheses you'll see Y in a second minus E Y and then oh look at this if I have e to y * e y that's going to create e to the0 or 1 plus one so feel okay with that one so far so we're just Distributing we got zero here we've got e to the y^ 2 we've got - 2x e y we've got + one because e y * e y gives you e 0 that's one so far so good yeah now look at this carefully this is kind of cool this is actually a quadratic do you see it where a the coefficients a is one B is is -2X I know it's weird but we're going to use an X here and C is 1 you with me so what we know from the quadratic formula is whatever my I'm going to treat this thing like my variable you can use a substitution and say hey let's make = e x or sorry e y in this case then you'd have U ^2 - 2x U + 1 you guys see that and we'd have U equal to whatever my quadratic is I'm going to eliminate that step I'm just going to say okay well because e to the Y is what my my term is I'm just going to have e to Y and then perform the quadratic formula so quadratic formula says negative B negative B so negative this would give me positive 2x you guys okay with that one plus or minus radical b^ 2- 4 * a * C all over 2 * a so this is B hey negative B sign changed CU I'm I'm taking the opposite of that so negative B plus or minus Square no problem b^ 2 this thing squared is 4x2 - 4 * a * C A is 1 C is 1 so we get - 4 all over two we okay with that so far okay so let's keep on working on that what are some things that you could do here can cross these out right now no Heavens no that's a plus and a that's double wrong all right plus and a minus jeez uh let look here maybe Factor the four 2x plus or minus this is going to be the square OT of 4 X2 - 1 do you see it square roots work like this when you have products you can take the square root of the first first Factor * of the second Factor so theun of 4 is actually 2 so e y = 2x + or - 2 < TK x^2 - 1 all over my two all over 2 now tell me something you can do now break up the FR you could break up the fraction I'm not going to factor the twos yeah if I factor these twos we get 2 * the quantity x + or - < TK x^2 - 1 all over 2 now can I simplify my twos now it's appropriate you can't simplify unless you have factored everything has to be multiplied together these are gone so e to the Y working over here now is X Plus orus < TK of x^2 minus one now I want to talk about the plus and minus real quick couple little little notes here e to the Y has to be positive do you agree with that exponential is always positive the domain our domain is 1 to Infinity that we're working with here here's the problem if I plug in numbers from 1 to Infinity most of them are going to be negatives uh sorry most of uh most of this is going to be negative so I plug in numbers like five or something if I did that 5 plus I'm good but 5 minus I'm not good this would be 5 minus theun 25 - 1 s 24 this would give me negatives which does not fall inside my domain does that make sense so for that reason it's really not defined for this so we're going to take that out so e to the Y because of our domain we can't have that e to the Y is got to be positive and if I plug in number in here this part the minus part this would not work very well this right here would give us negatives and we know that e to the Y has to be positive does that make sense to you so we we omit the the minus instead we keep just a plus and we're almost done how do we get rid of the E how would you do that yeah if I take natural log on both sides then Ln of left side equals Ln of right side do you see it that goes away we get y = Ln x + < TK x^2 -1 and last let's look back at what Y is what we defined y as Y is actually C inverse so make a little substitution C inverse of X is now Ln x + < TK x^2 - 1 and that is our proof should F feel okay with that one did you follow that fancy pants math right you know we it was nothing nothing really fancy actually uh it's all algebra all of it no calculus what do you see any derivatives see any limits no it's all algebra and it's really just quadratic formula that's it just quadratic formula and you work it all the way down take an L on both sides and and you're good to go the rest of them can be proved likewise similarly um what I want to talk about now if there's no questions I want to talk about derivatives do you guys have any questions on the proof I'm not going to make you do the proof I think they have an example uh in the homework where where they have you do the other one if you did this one can you guys see it's going to be almost exactly the same only thing it's going be different is that's a minus okay works exactly the same that's the idea what I want to do now is I want to talk about derivatives of these guys uh I'll prove one derivative I'll list the rest of them we'll do a couple examples and that'll be basically it for the section you okay any questions do you need this still do you have it written down good okay which one we prove the let's stick with that one let's find the derivative of this caution verse let's do that so remember that so what we know is that we just proved that hyperbolic cosine inverse is equal to Ln x + < TK X 2 - 1 so we know that for a fact here's the deal what I want to do right now is I want to start finding out the derivatives of these things what is the derivative of C inverse how do we find that well maybe we can do it right here since we have a definition we should be able to do that so tell you what let's take a derivative on both sides that'll give us derivative of cost inverse equals well because that's a function of X it's Ln do you know how to take a derivative of Ln yeah now we can take derivatives of these things so since we know the definition of it these shouldn't actually be very hard at all so if I want to find out derivative of C inverse it's actually the same as the derivative of this nasty piece of junk you know what I want to do I want to see if we can if we remember the derivative of Ln so we're going to do this kind of like an exercise I want you to do the derivative of this thing see what you get so go for it you should know how to do derivative of Ln right do it go for it do you see any chain rules always so derivative of Ln one over the inside times the derivative of the inside so derivative Ln one here's our inside one over the inside this is by the chain R so 1 over this times the derivative of the inside remember I told you about derivatives let the DDX tell you where the calculus is one over inside time derivative of inside we're done with Calculus here did you guys make it that far do you all do that one cool many of you are getting really fast at derivatives which is great so what's the derivative of x by the way what's the integral of one okay keep that in mind when you're doing these integrals if you get integral of DX integral DX that means integral of 1 DX that becomes an X okay just some people had a little issue with that so I want to make sure you guys know that so derivative of x is 1 not zero it's one plus I'm going to do this one in my head hopefully you get the same thing this becomes a one half so you bring down the 1/2 you would have leave the inside alone to thetive 1/2 goes you subtract one and then by the chain rule by the way those brackets are important by the chain rule we have oh sorry by the chain rule we have what derivative inside that's right we'd have the 2x I want to know if you made it down that far show hands if you did did you get that um if you didn't follow this the first time remember that this derivative is one no problem you can do these derivatives separately so this is x^2 - 1 to the2 bring down the 1/2 leave the inside the same subtract one derivative of the inside is 2X and that's our appropriate derivative now we're going to make it a little bit prettier so uh tell me something that you see here twos are gone like it okay so let's pretty this thing up we got 1/x + < TK x^2 - 1 that hasn't changed in a while we're going to have a 1 plus here's our 1 plus X over The sare < TK x^2 - 1 make sure you have brackets or parentheses or something wouldn't you multiply the X by both the one and the never mind okay you guys right with that one yeah now this looks pretty bad and if I gave you for a formula for if I gave this to you as a formula for derivative you'd be like uh I'm sorry what now so no we're going to make this thing prettier all right how we make this thing prettier is there's two terms here let's make them go together for one term let's make one fraction out of that we do that which is really easy because it's one we're going to have X2 - 1 over X2 - 1 so let's do that ^2 - 1 over < TK x^2 - 1 plus X X < TK x^2 - 1 if you didn't follow this this is exactly the same is this still equal to one this is still one yeah absolutely so all we're doing is writing that as as this fraction so that we have a common denominator I'm going to move over here now so with that in mind well now we can make this one fraction so we're going to have one over nasty stuff times worse nasty stuff Square < TK of x^2 - 1 and then plus X all over Square < TK x^2 - 1 okay once show hands you can follow me that far so remember this is a proof right now obviously you're not going to do this every single time you get a derivative of cost inverse you're going to do what I'm about to give you now do you see why we made it nicer do you see anything that helps us here I hope that you do do you see it do you see that this and this are identical by the commutativity of addition they're exactly exactly the same they are gone which says that let's go back to the beginning we had the derivative of hyperbolic cosine inverse of x and we worked on the right hand side with this logarithm all the way down and we ended up finding this is 1 over < TK x^2 - 1 and that is our first uh first formula for derivatives so this one actually works if we have C inverse of X we know the Der of cos inverse X is 1/ < tk^ - 1 do they look really similar to your hyperbolic functions they're going to be really similar all right really similar because they come from the same idea of logarithm so uh which you're going to get the one/ junk times derivative of junk so since they're all find as x's and square roots we're going the same thing so that's the first one by the way there's another way to uh to prove this if you want do you want another way to prove it or is this good sure another way another way uh if you did it this way so or different type of proof just for funsies if y equals c and I'm going to go really fast on this one C inverse of x uh this is happens if x = cos y if I take a derivative on both sides uh by the way keep this in mind we're going to use it later if I take a derivative on both sides this becomes one this right here we actually know the derivative for c y do you remember what it is C right times Dy DX because we got the chain you guys okay with the chain rule we get the chain rule so if we solve for this thing then Dy DX = 1/ c y I'll just divide that by both divide that on both sides now because of our definition let's see uh that right equals this so working from here if we wanted to solve for this guy right here what I'd probably do is I add this and subtract 1 so cos^2 y - 1 = 6 s y you guys okay with that one okay take a square root this is this is an identity I gave you like the First first day we had this stuff do you remember that one hopefully you do look at the video if you didn't it's very beginning the video take a square root on both sides and we get CCH y = Square t cos^2 y -1 I switch sides and take a square root and that's exactly what this thing is only think back to what cos y equals for us cos y is how much how much it's X so then since yalun of from here x^2 - 1 and that solves it for us again so 1/ < TK x one same same thing different way to prove it uh this one's a little bit more direct this one uses a different proof that we've already had in class but it's faster so one's kind of shortcut proof one is the long proof stemming directly from the definition of what uh C inverse is do you guys follow both of them good good for you that's fantastic now let me give you the rest of them so we know that if I do a derivative of C inverse we end up getting 1 over the < TK x^2 - one I'm just going to give you the rest of them not going to prove the rest of them some of the proofs are similar some are a little bit different uh but here we go hyperbolic sign inverse oh you know what can I do something for you to show you that these are going to be uh obviously what are you going to use with a lot of these derivatives what's the answer 90% of time when I ask okay good yeah you're going to use chain rule on a lot of these so I'm going to change them to use just so you recognize that we're going to do chain rule a lot so if we have let's see hyperbolic s inverse we'd have one over they s and cosine look at this really similar all the time especially with these hyperbolic so we have 1 < TK U ^2 + 1 DX if we want hyperbolic tangent inverse we end up getting 1 over 1 - u^2 to udx if we want hyperbolic secant inverse we get -1 / U then < TK 1 - U ^2 d u DX are these looking familiar to you they look so much like the hyperbolic which is why I said hey write these on a not card make sure they're all right that way you can look at them when you're going through your work okay if we want hyperbolic cosecant inverse of you it's going to look just like this one only let's see uh oh you know what I I'm sorry I read that wrong no I didn't I read right thought it made same very similar we're going to have U ^2 + 1 and lastly hyperbolic cotangent inverse we got which one tangent and coent are the same yeah let me check on that it in the book too it is right it's exactly the same which is really weird uh but yeah you get the same thing let's think about why sing from the definition of yeah that would be that's interesting check one more thing for me uh one of these things has an absolute value the other one doesn't which one is is it do you know Patrick um theose cosecant has the absolute value right okay but the secant doesn't okay good I know there's one little thing in there it's a little weird thing so what I want out of you I want you to be able to use these things they're just formulas for right now so what we're going to do is we're going to we're going to do one example of a derivative it's going to be really really really really similar to your let's find the derivative of this guy let's go through it as a team we're just going to do one example right now like I said we don't use this a whole lot and even if we did you got your derivatives they work really similar to your hyperbolic so uh you have the formulas you're going to have a little note card on them no big deal so let's let's go through and let's see if you you see the way I see this thing what's the first thing that you guys see on this product R gives away right there correct yeah go ahead and do the product rule So Pro rule says no problem we've been doing this since our last Calculus class derivative of the first 10 of second plus the first time der second so oh let's see if we know this one what's the derivative of e to X so we're going to get this whole thing back again e to X hyperbolic secant inverse of 3x nothing changes there plus e x does not change let's look at this one this is where you use this stuff um right here what acts as your U what is your U so 3x is what we're going to put see let's follow this down we are here so 3x is what you're going to put here and what you're going to put here and then you're GNA Square it did you guys do that yeah if you didn't make it that far can you follow me on this one yeah so we're using this because he it says hyperb inverse our 3x is our U so U here U here don't change any of this stuff and don't forget chain rule here so we've got1 I'm going write everything out not going to do a whole lot of math in my head here 3x then I've got a square root then I've got a one first then a minus then a 3X s and then and then what good this is where people forget a lot of constants right I'm off by three oh there's a three coming it's coming from right here or they're saying wow why isn't there a three up here I I got that three if something simplifies okay it's because you forgot the chain rule so don't forget the chain Ru make sure I mean I hopefully I've beat that in your head time and time again throughout this whole class rule chain rule chain rule so we're going to do it a lot of times so we keep on going we got e x hyperbolic secant inverse of 3x and then we've got an ed X we got a ne1 over all this stuff of course we'll make that 9x stimes 3 3x is 3 tell me some things that happened here gone and gone that's multiplied that's all multiplied that's connected that's fantastic we'll make it a little bit nicer what I'm going to do here is instead of a negative I'm going to make this a minus I'm going to put my e e to the X on the top of my fraction and we get e to the X hyperbolic inverse of 3x minus E X over let's see what's still there what's still there X is still there and that's the whole thing you want to factor out the Ed X you could you could if you factor out the Ed X you have just hyperic inverse 3x - one over this you could do that too should P feel okay with with that one is it doable for you guys after dealing with the hyperbolic yeah it's not a big deal okay you just have six more formulas to to really go through uh do you have any questions comments or anything at all are you sure are you ready to take a break from dealing with all this trigonometric and hyperbolic stuff for just a little bit now we're going to start section 6.7 there's no integrals we're not going [Applause] to now we're just going to leave it right there just kind of a a uh a fundamental level of approach on these derivatives we're not going to get to the integrals we're just going to do the do with these things okay keep it light this is pretty light right
