Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 9.4:  The Comparison Test for Series and The Limit Comparison Test
all right so today we're going to talk about the comparison tests uh as I was mentioning before I gave a preview of this in the last section we're going to talk about two types of tests firstly the comparison test and then secondly the limit comparison test test which I just said was very powerful so the comparison test we had a taste of this in sequences and the idea is if you can compare one sequence to another sequence where you know a relationship like one is always smaller than another or one is always bigger than another then sometimes you can use the convergence of one sequence to tell the convergence of another sequence or we can use the Divergence of one sequence to tell the Divergence of another we're going to use that same idea with series rather than sequences so here's the idea um the idea is we're going to compare one series to another series that we already know the convergence for whether it converges or diverges typically that's going to be like a geometric series or it's going to be like a p series you guys do I need to write that down or you guys got the idea do I need to write down okay I better write that down so here's the idea compare one series to another where you already know the convergence or Divergence typically this is the series that we've already talked about in this class like a geometric series or a PE series or a harmonic series simp like that so here's where the comparision test comes in says all right so suppose we have two series we have a series of a subn and we have a series of B subn and both of these are series with positive terms so suppose the series of a sub and the series of B subn are series with positive terms well there's going to be two cases and I'm hoping that you see the similarity between this comparison test for series and the comparison test that we had for sequences so here's the idea let's suppose or let's say if let's say a subn is less than or equal to B subn for every term so basically here's what we got we get these two series they both got positive terms but here's what we know we know that the series of a subn every term the sequence of that basically every term term by term a subn is less than b subn so for the first term a subn is less than or maybe equal to B subn next one as subn is less than or maybe equal to B subn and so forth and so forth and so forth so basically if I have my B subn like this my a subn is right below it or maybe equal with it but it's never above it do you guys understand that idea so term by term a subn is less than b subn quick hit not if you're you're all right with that let's further suppose that B suban that series converges what's going to happen what's going to happen if I have my Bend and I have my as subn and I say hey tell you what uh they're both positive terms so they're both above zero and I say for every single one of these terms a subn is less than or maybe equal to B subn it could be right on top of it who cares it's just not greater than that I say furthermore what I know is that this series when I add all these terms together for B sub this series converges so if the series of B subn converges and a subn is always less than that but it's never negative right it's always positive so it's basically it's bounded and it's less than a series that's convergent what's going to tell you about this uh the series of a what's going to happen with that it has to be so here's what the comparison test says it says compare one of your sequences to another one where you know the convergence for there's going to be two scenarios the scenario is going to be well if a subn is always less than b subn if b7n converges if the series of BN converges where add all together goes to one number then if as is always less than that it also has to converge okay let's see if you're paying attention I know some of you guys look like you got sleepy eyes so uh let's focus right now so now let's do this one okay check up here Eyes On The Board now let's suppose that b suben diverges if as subn is always less than B subn and B subn diverges what does it tell you about as subn why not is below it's below it well as suben is below the B sub so if B suben converges yeah if a is below it it's also going to converge that makes sense because it's kind of pushing it down here and getting closer and closer and closer to one number if I add those together when we're talking about the series now not just the sequence but the series so if the series of B sub converges and a sub is always below it then the series of a sub also has to converge but if the series of B suben diverges and the series of as suben is below it it tells us nothing Asen could diverge it could converge I don't know because it's not being forced anywhere this idea of the series of B ofen converges and A's below it the series of Asen is being forced somewhere it's being forced down and down and down and down and down if B were to diverge a would not be forced anywhere it could go either divergent or it could go convergent it would say nothing so fans you understand the idea okay what's it going to take what's it going to take to show that a series would be Divergent what would have to happen here to show Divergence has to be less than hang on two people talking go ahead will have a diverse to show that okay I'm going to State it as as subn being compared to B subn so let's say that uh let's say that right now B subn is going to converge if sorry um we already did conver did we let's talk about BN Di so let's say that b subn is going to diverge with a subn being below it does that show Divergence where would a a suben have to be in order for B sub to diverge and a suben must also follow suit and diverge it's got to be above it so that's our next case so if a subn is always bigger than or possibly equal to B subn for all n and the series of ban diverges well then the series of Bas event has to diverge here's this case it says all right so start off suppose that uh that for every single term here's B subn A subn is a little bit bigger here's B subn A subn is a little bit bigger here's B subn A subn is a little bit bigger so every single time well then a subn is not here anymore Ace subn says no no no I'm always just a little bit bigger now I'm up here term by term I'm a little bit bigger now suppose this suppose that the series of B subn is Divergent so this thing diverges if a subn is also a little bit bigger every single term if this thing adds to infinity or diverges or something you know the series adds to Infinity it's going to diverge and as's a little bit bigger where's the series of Asen going to go it's going to be bigger than that since it's term by term bigger if I add up all these these terms and it diverges then if I add up terms which are slightly larger than that it's also going to diverge so f understand that idea so now let's do this one let's say that bben converges if asen's a little bit bigger and bben converges what's it tell you about as suben nothing it says hey this one's bigger than that great bben converges okay what's tell about Asen nothing because asen's bigger it could converge I don't know it could diverge I don't know it's not being forced anywhere with B sub diverging it forces as suben to also diverge because a SP larger than that show pans feel okay with that idea would you like to try some examples you guys see the similarity in what we did between our sequences and this it's really similar it's just a series just had to make a a statement here so let's try a few examples are there any questions before we get going on and hopefully it's going to be pretty straightforward so let's try one let's really see if you're with it today by the way what's the first thing we should always check with series no matter what first thing what would ah we should always check that because it's going to be really quick so let's do the Divergence test does that diverge okay that's a horrible way to ask that question actually um are you certain that it might not divert that's a weird way to ask it does it pass the Divergence test so basically is the limit equal to zero if it wasn't equal to zero what would you know about this series for sure so it might not be diverent is basically what you know do we know it's convergent yet no no we don't know that but we know it might not be Divergent because the limit of our sequence from which our series is built equals zero as n approaches Infinity you okay with that one okay so we check that first nextly we go through a progression is it a p series no would that a p series yes okay you sure yes yes okay um say what now when p is greater than one when P would be greater than one so we know something about that but this is not now later on we're going to compare this is something very similar to that how about uh integral test could you do an integral test with this you actually could it'd be hard to do because that's not a perfect square but you could still do it you could do an integral test with that it's going to be some form of like a inverse okay if you if you were to do that not such a big deal you could do that is there an easier way to go about it yeah here's the easier way to go about it let's compare this to a series that we already know the convergence for so basically here's what we need to know first thing we need to say whether these terms are all positive are all these terms positive yeah okay so we know that because all these terms are positive this is greater than or equal to zero and now we're going to basee this on something that we already know the convergence for if we're trying to show listen if we're trying to show convergence you need to have this as less than something some Series where you know convergence for if you want to show Divergence you need to have this bigger than some series you know Divergence for it's silly to have something less than something divergent or bigger than something convergent that doesn't show you anything so what we're going to do is okay does that look like anything familiar and and you guys just said it you said it looks like a p series doesn't it yeah let's make this less than the P series is this true is that true for all n greater than one yes yeah well we know that when a denominator gets larger our fraction gets smaller so this fraction would always have to be less than this fraction you still okay with that one and this is true for yeah it's as a matter of fact it's true for all n but we only need it greater than equal to one so let's go back and see what this says um this says we're always going to have positive terms no matter what this says that well this is a true statement we're basing this on something we don't know the convergence for right here this is a piec that's fantastic well if that's a true statement then here's what the comparison test says it says well do you know that convergence for this yes yes okay let's go through it one time uh what's that called again P what's the P here two so we know that this is a p series p = 2 hey that's greater than one that's fantastic we know that if P were less than or equal to one we'd get the harmonic series or something below that and we' get something that would be di actually above that as far as sequences go we'd be Divergent so here we know hey it's a p series not a problem P equals 2 that's more than one therefore this series is what convergent now we're going to put the whole thing together put the whole thing together we start with some Series yeah you could do a couple other tests with this not a problem um can we do a comparison test well that depends are all your terms positive yes yeah it says right here you got to have positive terms so all our terms are positive no problem if is it less than a a series that you know is convergent that's what you ask now is it less than a series you know is convergent or is it bigger than a series you know is Divergent in our case I know that this thing is less than 1 n^2 it has to be that way because I'm just taking my denominator adding two between this fraction and this fraction between this sequence and this sequence or likewise our series and our Series so these are always going to be less than these terms for every single one term one term two it's always less than that if it's always less than our sequence we know is our series we know is convergent well then we got to look at that thing the series of 1 n^2 is a p series we know the p is equal to two that's more than one that shows convergence so what do we know about this series as well that also converges that also converges so our series of 1 n^2 + 2 also converges I want to make sure you guys really understand this before we go any further did that make sense to you show up hands if you did feel okay with that so basically what we're doing we're comparing one series to another uh we're comparing it to make it to show whether it's convergent or Divergent by saying well if it's below one series that converges our series converges if our series is above one series that diverges our series diverges as well that's the only two scenarios that we can really have there's only two cases have I explained this one well enough for you guys to get it can we move forward okay let's try a couple more let's give this one a try let's start from the very beginning with all of these series really go through the progression what's the first thing that we try anytime we get a series and we're trying to show convergence or Divergence what do we test first okay so we're going to take a limit of this thing uh does the limit of this thing equal zero yes if it didn't we'd stop right there if it does hey we're good to go let's continue with this thing so it says Hey the limit of the sequence goes to zero that means that potentially we could be possibly not Divergent we got to show that though we can't just stop right there it doesn't show convergence after that man we go through our our list of things to do um could we do integral test I don't know maybe but it's probably a little bit easier to do a comparison test right now here's why I see that um first I see are my terms positive all the time okay well that that's one condition we got to have that for comparison test so I know that we have all my terms are positive second thing I'm thinking about is this can I show that this is either greater than some series which is Divergent or less than some series which is convergent can I show that I don't know can you show that I can show that I know how to do it here's what I'm thinking I'm thinking that the one big the one thing about this is that three is kind of holding me back here does that make sense to you so the reason why the comparison test is so nice is if you haven't noticed this already it allows you to get rid of little pieces which are holding you back so you go hey that plus two that plus two hold me back man let's get rid of that well if I have a plus two in my denominator it's going to be less than one over whatever I have without that plus two does that make sense now here's the the little kicker for you what if it was a Min - two o greater than yeah that would be a problem because here that would be a minus two and that would be a greater than okay stick with me here I'm going back to this example now look we know that this series converges don't we but that series is bigger than that so this double inequality makes absolutely no sense says this is bigger than zero okay this is bigger than that so I can't use a squeeze THM if you're thinking squeeze THM right here because I don't have my double inequality set up the correct way this says all right those are positive terms fantastic but now this series is bigger than this one this one I'm sorry this one converges or or diverges conver tell me something about a series which is bigger than a convergent series does it tell us anything that would be a problem we'd have to do something different with that but if we have the plus man we're we're all set up we're good to get we're good to go in our case do we know that this is less than or equal to some series less than what you know I mentioned the squeeze theorem about 5 seconds ago do you guys see that essentially we can use a squeeze theorem here as well limit of 0 is0 limit of this thing is zero limit of this goes to zero that we could we actually did use that for sequences now the series a little bit different but basically the idea is about the same as far as comparing them so with comparison test we set it up all we have to do now is determine whether this thing converges or diverges let me let me make another point for you here if this were Divergent would it tell you anything about this no if this is convergent would it tell you anything about this so we want to see if this is convergent or not is it oh you got to show it to me you got to show me so let's talk about the series of one/ 2 the N tell me how that thing is converging tell me why and don't just say well if I take the limit it's zero you can't you can't do that isre say what now n is always increasing that's true explain that make the one the whole thing to the N power and then take out one okay so if I did this is that still true guys remember you're not trying to reinvent the wheel here right you're trying to base these on series that you already know the conversion for that's why I put at the very beginning base it on a geometric base it on on P series based it on harmonic series based it on one of those things does that make sense to you um you can do the integral test for some of these and that would work sure but it's easier if you based on things that we already have if you can do that quick head on if you're okay with this so far so we go okay cool well we we know that our terms are positive we know that our terms term by term this is going to be less than this one now this is great news for us because we know something about the series of 1 over two to the N the series of 1/ two to n the same as a series of2 to the N oh that's fantastic news why is that fantastic news what type of series is that now because it's geometric we can immediately determine whether this thing converges or diverges now um what I told you a long time ago few lessons ago was that this and this have to match now that's true if you need to find the sum does that make sense are we finding the sum of these series no so do I care not really I don't really care you can but notice that if I pull out a one2 to match my Powers if I pull out a 1/2 to match my Powers remember that whatever this is you have to match it 1 - one 2 - 2 3 - 3 if you were to find the sum because what remember what the sum of a geometric is it's a that's your first term over 1 - R I've already covered you can refresh your memory on that lesson uh as you want to but since we're not finding the sum it doesn't really matter as far as conversions goes the reason why it doesn't matter once you have this to a power I don't care how many of those factors you pull out that one half ain't changing does that make sense so all we're really looking at not really the a don't really care about it what I'm worried about is the r how much is the r absolute value of R is 12 that is less than remember that if we have the r absolute value of R less than one tell me something about that geometric series that's perfect so because this is a geometric series with r is less than one absolute value of R is less than one this thing is convergent or this converges um I'm hoping that you understand the reason why I'm not matching my powers do you do you understand why I'm not matching my powers we don't have to use trying to find the sum not trying to find the sum don't really care about it okay so let's refresh because on your test you are going to have to find the sum okay if you did have to find the sum would this be good enough no now you could do this remember I gave you a shortcut I said if you had to find the sum you just think about what your first term would be your first term would actually be if I plug in one your first term would be2 over 1 -2 does that make sense that's how you do it really fast no matter what that is even if they don't match it's your first term over 1us R not a big deal if they do match well you get to use your a it's a over 1us a is your first term always you can take your first term of 1us R it's not a big deal I covered it in a previous lesson you go back and check that now let's keep going with our our current problem so we start here we go cool positive less than 1/ 2 N that's a GE metric series that thing has an R of 1/2 Which is less than one it says that this series converges tell me something about the series that I'm given there why it's less very good the series we're given is less than or equal to some series that converges by the comparison test that means that this series also converges is it still making sense to you is it interesting to you it's similar to what we've done before I think it's kind of interesting kind of fun tell you what we'll try we'll do one more and we'll talk about something slightly different would you like to try one I'll give you about two minutes let's see if you can you can manage to to figure this one out if not no big deal so here's what I'm asking I'm asking you to firstly determine whether these terms are all positive you have to show that so the comparison test works when both of our series have positive terms so show me like this that our terms are always positive and make sure that you're right notice that this does not start at one this starts at three so show me that we have positive terms nextly determine what is going to work here whether this should be bigger than or smaller than a given series remember that if it's smaller than a given series that series must be convergent if it's bigger than another series that series that you're basing this on has to be Divergent so pick the correct one see if you can do it for tell me something are all the terms here positive yes did you see why we had to do n starts at three and not n starts at two or something if we said that n starts at two we'd have something undefined if we said n starts at one we'd have a negative and then something undefined so we said three so we get something that is positive so okay so yeah all the terms are positive now next up next up what is this going to be based on what's a good series for us to base this one on try to figure out whether it's diversion or conversion what is it do you remember me saying that when you have a constant like that that's the thing that's holding us back typically this is what's holding us back right here so we have 3 n/ 2 N - 4 and we have 3 n over 2 to the end check it out here's how you figured this thing out um would you be able to tell me convergence or Divergence for this guy okay cool uh specifically what would you be able to tell me it's diver okay so we're going to get to a diverent series right here now this one would have to be greater than or smaller than this one to show also diver so we got to figure it out is this bigger than this this is this way no no no heck no if I take a denominator and I subtract four from it it's going to make it bigger than my starting fraction so basically it says this fraction is always greater than this fraction my denominator is smaller therefore my fraction is larger sure be okay with that one are you sure okay do you guys see the point of trying to trying to do this or saying you know what this is always bigger than this series if I sometime possibly equal who cares so if this series if we can determine that this series diverges then we can show that this series diverges as well how am I supposed to write this series what should I do with it turn it into geometric yeah GE looks just like a geometric series that's great so we'd have 3es to the N power remember the idea is base your your given series on something that you already know the conversion for whether it's geometric whether it's a p series whether it's harmonic series one of the ones that we already know so for us we're saying man you know what this thing looks a whole lot like if I got rid of that constant it would look a whole lot like a geometric Series so let's get rid of the constant so if I get rid of the constant what that means is I'm basing that on something without my minus 4 well it's going to be bigger than 3 the N over 2 the N without the that's the idea since I know that this is geometric that's why I chose that one guys I'm not picking something out of a hat I'm picking something that looks really similar that I know the convergence for or Divergence for in our case I know that that's a geometric series with Ral 3 so we'd State this is geometric this has an R with the absolute value greater than one specifically we'd probably write it this way absolute value of Ral 3es that's greater than one tell me something about a geometric series when your R is greater than one in AB notice these are not arbitrary statements you you state it is geometric you state that the r is three Hales absolute value R is three halves it's bigger than one therefore this geometric series diverges Now is it going to be a problem that this doesn't match no no could you make it match yes you could you just pull out uh 3es to the 3 and you'd have 3 to the nus 3 not a problem why aren't we doing that this sum is not going to be the same as the sum it's saying that this is always bigger than that so I don't even really care what the sum is it's Divergent anyway why would I can't find the sum here so I'm not really concerned about the sum but if you're wondering why in the world are you not matching these up to an N minus 3 it's because the convergence or Divergence will not said this one time this is kind of an important note that you have down somewhere in your M Banks remember that convergence or Divergence will not change if I add or subtract a finite number of terms do you remember that the convergence or Divergence will not change if I add or subtract a finite number of terms the sum will change yes the Ser the sum will change but not the convergence or the Divergence so basically this right here look at the board please this right here has the same convergence or Divergence as this does it has to cuz all I'm doing is adding to it three terms or from here to here all I'm doing is subtracting from it three terms does that make sense therefore if this one conver this one diverges I'm subtracting three terms this one also has to diverge don't care that I can't find the sum we're not worried about that anyway we're not finding the sum here what we're doing is finding out convergence or Divergence now let's go one step further so because we know that my series is bigger than a given series for which I know Divergence tell me something about my given series and that's exactly how I want you to write it I want you to start with a given series I want you to base on something you know convergence or Divergence for typically you kind of have an idea in your mind hopefully you do before you start this like for here I'm thinking you know what uh if I cover that up that's going to be oh that looks like a that looks like a geometric to me with Ral 1/2 if I cover this up man that looks like a geometric with Ral 3es so I'm saying okay I'm going to try to make this smaller than a series that converges I did it looks like a geometric it's smaller than a geometric that converges therefore my series converges okay this one it's bigger than a geometric that diverges therefore my series also has to diverge this is the case where as subn is smaller than B suben it's forcing it to converge this is the case where as suben is bigger than B suben it's forcing it to divert Jo I explain this well enough for you guys questions oh um could we just skipped all this work we did the limit test limit comparison test yeah we're going to in a minute what do you mean limit it's like the diver Li that original thing yeah you could have but you didn't stop me you should have but you didn't thought you trying to make a point so I am making a point I did make a point uh but if you if you do the first thing you should always do is what I've said that every problem except for this problem right because I was making a point uh but if you did that well you have a fraction that's bigger than one raised to the infinity it's going to go to Infinity it's not going to go to zero this would fail the difference test it would not equal zero it would be diverent does that make sense okay stop right there good catch let's try one more uh any other questions before we continue you guys are awfully quiet today to blew my mind honestly this one the liit little comment di after I let it soak in oh yeah now doing this appropriately would take a little work because you can't just start with three to the N over over 2 the N minus without the minus 4 so you'd probably have to do the lals and say this is infinity over infinity to get rid of that four so you have ln3 3 the N over ln2 2 * 2 N then you do it uh then you go ahead and say that's a constant so pull out the ln3 over ln2 have a limit as n approaches Infinity of 3S to the n and then we think okay this is a fraction that's greater than one true fraction greater than one being raised to Infinity power that's going to grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow this equals infinity therefore this does not equal zero Divergence that's what you were talking about right and you could also show it that way so this was this was a twer we we could do Divergence test and it fails it hey cool no problem it's not equal to zero therefore serious Divergence or you can show it this way honestly for me they're about the same level of difficulty but you should be checking the Divergence test first that was a great point soens if you understood both of these good deal okay now we'll do one more more one more one more one more well that wasn't one more that was the same one so one [Applause] more okay I'm going to go kind of quickly through this one kind of quickly through this one so first thing are all of our terms positive yes no yes cool now what's the problem on our series that we can't can't do what we want to do what's our problem the plus one the plus one's a problem so let's base this on a series without the plus one cuz I don't want the plus one the plus one is the problem is this series greater than this series or is our given series less than our series that we just made less than less than for sure less than so far so good okay now here's the issue if I do the series of 1 to Infinity of one over theun n do you understand that that's the series from 1 to Infinity of 1 n 12 power tell me something about that Ser P series very good what's the p that's less than or equal to one tell me something about a p Series where the p is less than or equal to one now let's go back to our original series we have a p Series right here where the p is less than or equal to one this this series diverged right uhhuh what's it tell you about my given series crap why not this is the this is the time where you have B to the n and you have a to the n and I say hey look at this uh B to the N diverges what do about this one I don't know it could converge it could diverge I don't know because it's not being forced anywhere that's this that's this guy okay that's don't be this guy well this is the only thing that we could do I mean we can't make this smaller than a series that converg just we don't know what that is we don't know what's going to it's going to be we don't know anything about this the only thing that we could do is BAS it on this immediate one this one that says okay we know for a fact that this is less than u 1 over theare root of n we know that for sure but we know this thing diverges if that diverges and our series is less than this one it's inconclusive it's not a good test for us it the only thing we could do but it wasn't a good test now the point is we don't just stop here we have something else that we could do the other type by the way we didn't test this but hopefully you did this in your head could you do the Divergence test with this limit of this guy is zero so we know we should have moved forward with it unlike the last example so if ever we can't just use a basic comparison test like the ones we had what we had works great if your series is less than something convergent or more than something Divergent does that make sense if we're less than something divergent or more than something convergent it doesn't make any sense to do that we have another test for that we're going to talk about what's called The Limit comparison test here's the idea for the limit comparison test if the series of a subn and the series of B subn have all positive terms and and here's the big part okay so positive terms uh we had that from before right that's for any of these comparison tests they have to both have positive terms and the limit of A subn over B subn exists not exits sorry exits leaves the room it just gives up he exists and here's what we know then either both series converge or both series diverge they're tied together so closely that one is a predictor of the other and that's what the limit comparison test says um you could probably think of it this way you think okay well if this exists think about this think about this if this limit exists this is a ratio right of one series one the terms of one series over the terms of another if the limit exists at some point as n approach Infinity that means that those terms are so close together that it doesn't really matter does that make sense to you if they're so different that it does matter that thing's going to go to infinity or negative Infinity probably Infinity because they're all positive terms um but that thing would go to Infinity they would be so different does that make sense to you so we say Okay cool so if this limit exists then either both series converge or both series diage so again I'm not gonna write this down it's the same idea so we're going to compare our given series to a series that we know the convergence of and then we're going to take a limit that's the idea would you like a proof of this to prove that this is actually true yeah okay so here's the proof um let's suppose that this limit exists if this limit exists then the limit as n approach Infinity of a A subn over B subn would be equal to some limit True by definition of what a limit is what this means is that absolute value of A subn over B subn minus L would be less than Epsilon remember those Epsilon Delta proofs you loved them right woo that's what a limit that's a definition of limit it means that the different it's a very simple idea it looks really confusing it's a very simple idea it means that if this limit exists then the difference between those this fraction well whatever your function is between this function and your limit the difference between those and absolute value is less than whatever you say I can make it smaller that's what it means so you give me 01 I can show that this difference is smaller than that that's what the definition of limit is it says the difference between them is so negligible it doesn't matter what it is even if you give me Epsilon a really little number does that make sense are you sure okay so this is by definition is true so if this is true then for certain I can multiply by L and it's still true since L's a number it's it's still true well we're going to use that because we have an absolute value inequality we should know that we can solve this inequal well we can manipulate this inequality by doing negative absolute value negative sorry Epsilon that's absolute value negative Epsilon L is less than a subn / B subn minus L Which is less than Epsilon L well that would have to be true that's how absolute values work absolute value equalities work this way you go okay well I make that negative this is bigger than that if I leave it positive this is smaller than that is it now double inequality we're just going to solve for this so what we're going to do is we're going to add L to both sides if I add L to both sides I get lus Epsilon L is less a subn b subn Which is less than L plus Epsilon L almost done last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to factor and I'm going to multiply by B subn so we factor out the L no problems oneus e 1us Epsilon factor of L it's 1 plus Epsilon multip by B subn on all three sides by the way we can do that because B subn is what type of a number what type of terms they're positive it's not going to change my inequality so this is all based on that this the B sub has to be positive terms so we can do that does not change inequality now have you understand that that idea yeah okay so it's positive we're all good as far as inequality is concerned well here's the idea here's where this comes in do you understand that that's a constant e Epsilon is going to be some number right add one to it's still some number multiply by L it's still some number so the convergence of B subn is not affected by what this is likewise the convergence of B subn is not affected by what this is so think about this and this proves both of them this kind of cool if the series B suben converges if the series B sub converges as suben is less than that series do you see that okay you're not you're not really with me huh are you with me yes kind of sort of do you see the the comparison test out of this right now if bben converges asben is less than that if bben diverges as subn is bigger than that so just based on whatever we're we're looking at if B sub converges no problem as sub converges if B sub diverges a sub also diverges that's the idea if you understand idea that proves this guy that proves this uh this theorem here so I'll write that real quick and we'll be done if B subn converges since a subn is less than that and this does not by the way this does this is a constant it's not going to affect the convergence of our series it' just be our series multipli by whatever that constant is if B sub then diverges asent also diverges now of course I haven't done an example with this but we're going to do that last example I had with our limit comparison test so here's the the whole kind of put everything together a moment for you the first thing we start with all the time first thing we start with all the time is what liit di just take a limit if it doesn't equal zero you're done it diverges after that start thinking about easy stuff okay is it a geometric if it's geometric do it goodness six is it a p series is it harmonic if it's not one of those things then we start talking about okay well can I do an integral test with it maybe I can if it's positive continuous decreasing integral test Works real nice if it's not one of those things or it's maybe it's easier to do this you go okay well at this point I think well now with the comparison test is this always smaller than a series that is convergent or is my given series bigger than a series that's Divergent if it is man we're done if that's not the case if you go man now I have something that's smaller than divergent or bigger than convergent I can't really use the comparison to test straight up then what we do is we go well maybe a limit comparison test would work we'll say this one's so close to the other one so close that I'll take a limit of the ratio of them if I take the limit of the ratio of my series then if that limit exists my result will be the same for both my series they will both converge or they will both diverge does that make sense to you question with these tools can we do any or there some there just they can do anything no there's other things other techniques I'm going to show you you can do a lot with them I'll put it that way okay all right so let's wrap up this example so what we learned was that often times we can't use the comparison test just like it is for instance when we did when we tried the comparison test with this particular series we said sure the terms are positive that's fine sure it's less than 1 over the of n however because 1 the thir of end that series diverges and it's bigger than the given series that we want to show convergence or Divergence for that doesn't do us a whole bit of good because well if this is bigger than the series and this diverges it's not forcing this one to do anything therefore the comparison test by itself won't really work we need something that if we have our given series smaller than a series that converges that's good or bigger than a series that diverges that's good but smaller than a series that diverges doesn't do us anything so we invented this new thing we said all right well if the comparison test doesn't just straight up work let's try the limit comparison test so we said all right no problem let's compare these Series in a ratio no problem just some sort of fraction here and let's take the limit as n approaches Infinity if that limit exists what that means is that these series are so close together that the ratio exists to some number they're so close together that if one converges the other one's tied to it and if one diverges the other one's tied to it so basically what we do is We compare a given series compare a given series to one that we know the convergence or Divergence for and take a limit of it it's not a straight up comparison test is saying it's always less than or greater than because that won't work in this case but if we take the limit and we say all right tell you what by the way a is a subn is always your given series always what you start with b suban is always something you're trying to base your series on that you know the convergence orever 4 so we say all right our a subn here is 1 the < TK n + 1 over something that looks a whole lot like our series that we know the convergence or Divergence for so namely we'd say all right well let's compare it to the one over the square of n this thing's going to behave a lot like this that's where we're getting this from are you guys okay with this so far show hands if you are so it's it's looking just like this right only we're not doing a comparison test as it's always less than or greater than we're do a comparison test as far as the limits concerned that's why it's called a limit comparison test taking the limit of this comparison so far so good do you know how to do limits mhm of course you do so we just make this thing simpler since we have a complex fraction here let's make this we reciprocate and multiply 1 over the < TK n + 1 excuse me thank you time of one n over one all right well that's going to give us a limit as n approaches Infinity of theun n over the < TK of n + 1 tell me something about that what's the limit infity okay tell me what you could do you could if you wanted to uh now notice that you have the same thing of the same thing right so that that might be an issue for you I don't know uh maybe something a little bit easier something that we think can't split this one up because our denominator can't be split up so we can't do that what we could do is maybe just divide by the largest power of the denominator which is what we typically do with these things anyway so if we do divide by largest power in the denominator I think Frank said that in the back if we divide we're going to get the of n over the of n that's one we're going to get theare of n over the of n that's one we're going to get 1 over the < TK n and that saves us a whole lot of time we don't have to worry about ly tall's rules so don't skip some of the easy stuff when you're doing these limits um often times it's a lot easier to just divide by the largest power in the denominator if you have something that's rational like a rational expression or even square roots things like this almost like pols you guys okay with that so far so tell me what the limit is what's the limit of one what's the limit of one what's the limit of one over the of n is am how much is this limit okay now please listen carefully here's what this whole thing means what it means is that these two things were so close together that our limit existed it also means they're so close together that if one converges the other one has to converge and if one diverges the other one has to divert so please do not make the mistake of doing this do not make the mistake of saying hey the limit exists therefore it converges that is not what we're talking about we're talking about in the limit comparison test is since the limit exists they will both have the same result they'll both be convergent or they'll both be Divergent that is why you compare your given series to one that you already know the convergence or Divergence for you say hey you know what I know this one what is that is that convergent or Divergent diver that's Divergent why P ser very good and the p is so it's a p series of P less than one true that's Divergent so what this says is this doesn't mean it's convergent this means that this thing is going to have the same result as what you're basing on that's what it says so if the limit exists we go okay well since the limit exists since they both have positive terms which they both do we already checked that earlier here since the limit exists and the series of 1 < TK n diverges the series from one to Infinity of 1 the n + 1 tell me something about that one then diver also Divergence so we say all right the limit exists they're tied together so closely that they're going to have the same result either both converge or both diverge a limit existing here for the limit comparison test does not automatically mean convergent that's not what it means what it means is that whatever your series is and whatever series you're basing that on both converge or they both diverge if you know one of them diverges because this is a p series with P = 12 then you know this one also Di just because that limit existed of that ratio question um I'm kind of confused when we do limits and say we had a 1/x^2 took the limit as an approach or X approached Infinity um we say that that's zero right true but then we do like series and it's like a p series like that we say that it converges the P series does converge but does it just converge to like five or something or something like that where it would the infinity anyways I don't well the P series converges but a series is different than just a straight up limit now we check a straightup limit on the series just to see that the sequence is going to converge so try not to get confused with sequence versus series okay what we do immediately with the with the Divergence test is say hey look at your look at your sequence of numbers this is the Divergence test does your sequence go to zero yes it does that means that ultimately for a series what we're adding up are values that are zero now the series itself is not going to go to zero the series itself is going to add up a number of terms I don't know what that's going to add to in a lot of these things I do if it's geometric because we can find the sum of that okay but I don't know what that's going to be so when we're taking a limit here we're not actually finding a sum we're not actually finding out whether it's equal to zero or not we're not actually finding out basically anything besides these things are really closely tied together that's what the limit comparison test does it says these things are really closely tied together does the limit have to equal zero for this to work no no it just says that it has to exist it's got to it can't be Infinity can't be does not exist okay it's got to exist to be a number if it's zero cool if it's one cool I don't care what it is as long as it's a finite number that means these are tied together and the the Divergence or convergence will be the same between our two series now when we're taking um a limit of a of a series like uh like when we did the limit of this one again what you're just saying there is the Divergence test says the sequence from which your series is built has to go to zero because ultimately you got to add up terms that are close to zero for it to make no difference does that make sense if we would have had something like n over the of n we' add up terms that ultimately would lead us to Infinity that means that our series would go towards Infinity as well and we would not be able to add that together we' not be able to find a series that converges so convergence for a series just means that ultimately you're going to be adding up terms that are zero so ultimately you'll come up with a sum that is not Infinity that is an actual finite number did that clear something up for you yeah okay it's it's I know it's a little confusing because we talked about sequences right and now we're talking about sequences kind of but we're adding the terms together so some of the things are are along the same line and now I'm bringing up limits again and saying yeah the limit does have to equal zero doesn't and it doesn't mean that if the limit exists we're getting convergence doesn't mean that if the limit exists we're getting Divergence you have to read the problem you say hey this thing if it exists these two series will have the same outcome whether one's Divergent other's Divergent where one's convergent the other's convergent so it's a little different idea we're using a limit here not to show convergence or Divergence we're using a limit here to show that they have the same convergence or Divergence and I proved that that theorem last time okay anyway uh I'm going to move on here a little bit I'd like to get a couple more examples out of it see if we can do this one are there any further questions that was a good question thank you for that one any other questions before move on did this make sense to most of you did this make sense to all of you how many people did it make sense for feel okay with that one ify are we okay question so just to further clarify if this limit were to coach infinity or some um abstract number like that then um then you can't say a thing about it then okay we just you might try maybe a different series okay okay now for us usually we're going to pick them so that they're really close um I'm going to show you how to do that right now so maybe this will clear up your question question okay one and then two uh so a subn is the one that's given and B subn is the the one that you're using right always okay you want us answer it like that with the like sentence I would love it if you guys would answer it like that I'm guessing some of you won't but I would love it if you answer it just like that because that is literally what the the answer is it's saying because the limit exists because the series here diverges because it's a p series you have to state things like this okay you can't just say diverges you got to State why you got to show me your thinking here much of this is not going to be just math work much of it is thinking reasoning like well this is a diver series because it's a p series P equals one2 okay cool how's that relate to what we're doing well because the limit exists it says that they're going to have the same result they're both going to be convergent or Divergent one since one was Divergent the other has to be that's the idea any other questions those are all good let me show you another one last chance I waited this time I was nice and you go ah man what are we going to do here well listen we don't have to have a series that's exactly the same that's not the idea here we have to have a series that behaves kind of like this one that we know the convergence for so here's what we do when we're coming up with these especially when you have something that's rational or kind of semi-rational you have almost pols or square roots of polinomial listen do you guys know anything about limits as Intero Infinity do you know that with polinomial the limit is dictated by the behavior of your very first your leading coefficient your leading term I'm sorry your leading term did you know that so the think of the end behaviors of this of these functions so the end behavior of this function I don't even care what that is the end behavior is going to look a lot like 2 over n^2 does that make sense the end behavior of this does that three really matter as far as the end behavior goes no this is a whole lot like the square root of 4 n 7 that's really what we have there that's the end behavior so when we're doing these we're going to compare this to this one why well this is going to act really similar as n approaches Infinity now are all the terms going to be the same no but as we get towards Infinity these terms are going to be really close to that one so the end behaviors will be very close so what I want you to do is think of and behaviors basically with pols that's really easy because that's just the leading term that's what a that's what a limit is it's n approach infinity or X approach Infinity is just the leading term term with the largest power that was it so um let's be kind of nice about this can you simplify that hey that's why this thing's going to be nice because if we simplify this we will find out what the convergence or Divergence is of it so let's do it um how do I simplify it say what pull the four out and then pull the four okay so 2 n^2 over 2 N 7 Hales we could do that can I keep going how much is it two is gone yeah okay that's good news what about n^2 n to the 7es can you do that 1 let's see this would be 4 - 7es that's n the -3 or we get 1/ n the 3es yes we get 1 over n 3es you guys okay with this so far yes are you sure you should be cuz that's freaking just some algebra and you should be okay with it now tell me something about this series tell me something about that series it's a p series what's the P so this is p series with a p equals to 3es greater than tell me something about a p series with a p equal 3es greater than one what do you know that's convergent P series beautiful now let's think about what the limit comparison test is going to do for us here so we probably already would have done the Divergence test hopefully you would have done that now the limit of the sequence here without the series The Limit would be zero we're good to go it says we might not be Divergent then we go ahead and we think well is it a straight up P series is it geometric is it any of these things that we can do is it integral test um is it a comparison test I don't know looks pretty hard for comp comparison test can I do a limit comparison test yeah yeah think of the end behaviors end behavior would look like this guy this guy is a convergent P Series so what we're going to do now now that we've determined that this is a convergent P series or even if it was a Divergent P series We compare this as a limit as n approaches Infinity uh what's going to go on the numerator of this Rao the original one the original one very good we put so the original series that's our a sub then over what the end say what now one over the n n the n one so this one you could even use this one whatever you want now that's fine I don't think it really matters uh what which one you use we doing Bas I'd use that one because it's nicer basically and you can do these a couple ways okay basically what I like to do I like to find out what I'm going to compare my original series to I like to simplify that as much as I can because they all should be simplified because basically you're getting rid of everything but the leading terms did that SN in that means they're all going to simplify hello you're getting rid of everything but the leading terms should be just one term over one term you simplify that I like to find out whether it's going to converge or diverge first I like to have that in the back of my mind then I like to compare it with the simplest form that should make sense right that way I don't have to re simplify in my problem well this is a whole lot easier to deal with than that one is isn't it so why would I put that back back in I'm going to use my simple tell me the next step what would you do simplify multiply by reciprocal we could do that are you starting to notice all the algebra you're going to do so we'll have 2 n^2 + n over the square < TK of 4 n 7 + 3 * n 3 over one now I'm going to move over here what now yeah okay we can do that two and to the what no mind you guys are going to make me start drinking aren't you sorry I drink guys just I want to punch more papers we just pull more ins out I think that's what we end doing any s yeah seven spot you guys figured out me you better figure out okay last time I checked yeah last time I checked it was it was seven Hales damn do you know what you do when you multiply common bases you add plus how much over nasty square root don't do a l TS rule don't that just divide by the largest power in the denominator so if you divide by the largest power in the denominator here's how you figure that out you cover up all but the leading term that would be the largest power so cover up all that that thing and write that as a power so we're going to divide by by what divide by n 7 so we're going to divide by n to the 7es Over N to the 7es works out I want you to understand that these are equivalent do you understand that they equivalent one we've written as uh rational exponents one we have as radicals now please listen carefully you don't always get to do this just like it is you have to verify that your radican the inside part is actually positive because this is positive we can make that straight up move does that make sense to you so that we're we're good to go so if we divide this we're going to have a limit as n approaches Infinity of 2 N 7 over n 7 I'm show you every step here plus n the 5es Over N the 7es all over big square root because that has a square root that has a square root we'd have 4 n the 7th Over N 7 + 3 over N 7th I want to make sure that you guys understand that we are not multiplying here we're dividing we're dividing by each of these terms okay so it's getting divided it's getting divided that's why we have this over into the 7 Hales and over into the 7es and over end the 7th because we have two square roots here we can make that one large square root over end the 7th and over end of the 7th show you okay with the AL over there let's simplify it so we have a limit and n approaches Infinity how much does this give you two plus 1 over what Z over this would be square root of 4 + 3 n 7 can we take the limit now now that we got rid of all that stuff what would you get what's the limit of two as n infity what's the limit of this as apprach infity that goes zero how about the limit of this one how about the limit of this one what's 2 over the < TK of 4 what's that tell you the limit exists the limit exists that's what it tells you says the limit exists which means that going back here it says that what we have and what we compared it to will have the same result if this one's convergent the one we're given is convergent if this one's Divergent the one we're given is Divergent does this always tell you convergent or Divergent no no the first example we had it existed yet it gave us Divergent now we have limit existed yet it's going to give us so the way we write this is limit exists since the limit exists and the series of 1 n 3 as n = 1 to Infinity converges then we have the series from one to Infinity of our nasty junk also converges that's the idea do you understand the idea show F if you do you feel okay with this stuff easy medium hard different probably little different it'll get easier the problem with all this stuff is that there's so much stuff that's the problem with this it's because some of this will get confused in your heads and some of you will will think back to the comparison test for sequences forget about the limit comparison test here some of you will get confused with the Divergence test taking a limit of uh sequence here saying equal to zero and automatically think it converges some of you will think well since this doesn't equal zero it must diverge that's not what we're doing you need to get the test straight I know it's new and there's a lot to it there's a lot of stuff that we're doing so I'm going to try my best to reinforce the ideas here the ideas are you start with a Divergence test and you take a limit of this sequence from which your series is built if it does not equal zero you stop right there your series is Divergent does that make sense after that you keep going with one of the meth methods that i' I've used so far geometric P series integral test comparison test limit comparison test there's several now we do a limit comparison test but you understand with a limit comparison test that if you equal any number besides infinity or does not exist that means the results are tied together both converge or both diverge not necessarily one of the other Okie doie would you like to try one more one more okay one more any questions before I raise it are they kind of fun though kind of fun right I enjoy them it's totally different than doing all those integral stuff in it kind of like a puzzle you just got to get creative with picking a new Bea then that's why it's kind of like a puzzle it can be puzzling especially with this one let's start from the beginning first thing what uh what was you do first you do it let's pretend that we did it okay but you want to start there let's pretend we did it diverence test it equals z what should you do going or stop it equals zero going equals zero what would you do stop keep going okay what would you check here would you want to do integral test no can you do the integral of that thing probably not a good idea uh does it look like p no look like a geometric series no look like something we could compare it to yeah but not a real easy one huh cuz I don't know that that's always less than something are always greater than something so if it's not something easy like that like we had with a couple of them that were nice we go well maybe we want to try to limit comparison test so let's try to see if this is if this compares to something so this compares to what can just get rid of an L well here's the thing you're going to get rid of part of it right but you you need to keep the fastest growing part first I you know I've been skipping a couple things you need to make sure that this has positive terms and I'm kind of taking that for granted that's not a trivial point you do have to make sure it has positive terms does this have positive terms as long as n is greater than one yes it does because n between zero and one here would be negative terms maybe well actually I would for for here so we do have positive terms that we need to check it now if you're going to talk about end behaviors that's what I told you right and behaviors of this one that's going to be pretty easy what goes on our denominator yeah that's fast piece of cake end behaviors of this one can get a little tricky what you want to do you want to keep the fastest growing part the fastest growing part will give you the end behavior does that make sense to you that's why we keep the largest uh Power that that leading term because that's giv us our end behavior it's the fastest growing or fastest falling apart well in our case what grows faster square of n or Ln L better I don't know many of you are guessing right now youch it into your and look at the gra they're very similar square root of n decreasing as it gets larger L get bigger untrue they both increase put some high number in both put some huge number in both of them that'll prove everything that's a great idea uh well you could think of it as Ln of n is an inverse of e to x correct so if e x starts climbing real fast Ln is going to climb but slower and slower slower less of a pace than Square Ro of n square root of n is the faster increasing one now how do you show that here say show maybe you consider FX = s < TK X and F ofx sorry G maybe G of X I don't get confused on that g ofx = Ln X the derivative is 1x the derivative is 1 / 2 x you can verify that later if you want now here's the whole point this is kind of interesting to think about hopefully hope you're with me on this one you guys okay on the derivatives right derivatives tell how you're increasing in this case how you're they're both increasing graphs tells how you're increasing so whichever one goes to zero whichever derivative goes to zero faster that's the one that stops increasing sooner I'll say that one more time so it makes sense okay this is how your functions are increasing are you with me they're both they both they're both positive with n greater or X greater than one so this is how they're increasing whichever since this shows how your graphs are increasing or your functions are increasing whichever one goes to zero faster is the one that stops increasing sooner did that sink in which one goes to zero faster this one does that goes to zero faster so this goes to zero faster than this therefore F ofx increases faster than G of X at the end it will in you can think of it as increasing longer increasing faster this is the Bas basic idea does that make a little bit of sense to you it's kind of weird right you're using a derivative to say well which one goes to zero faster which one uh slows its increasing Behavior faster since this goes to zero faster this slows its increasing Behavior faster than this one does that's the idea this will always be increasing at a faster rate than this one does that make sense to you okay don't just plug in numbers please I'm paying uh pluging de I don't know no don't do that okay actually go through the math here so what are we going to pick for this one again is going to be Ln of n or square root of n square root of n yeah it's going to be square root of n because this one is going to be the end behav the model for end behavior since this increases faster than this one end behavior we use that now can you simplify it definitely if you have only one term over one term you better be able to simplify these things let's simplify what is it 2 so one over don't leave me hanging huh one over n the 3es exactly what that is does that make sense to you we have square of n that's n the2 12us 2 is3 we'd have one over n 3es tell me something about that Series so we're talking about this comparison to the series I'm kind of admitting that but this is what we're doing this is what now same as last it's exact same thing it's a p series I love P series me too I really do they're so easy P series P = 3es greater than 1 tell me something about this particular P series which we are comparing our given series to brilliant so tell me this if we compare this to this and the limit exists what do we know about that it also conver it also converges very good what if limit doesn't exist done can't do it so let's do our limit comparison test so we start off with the limit as n approaches Infinity of what goes on our numerator please that's going to be nasty N2 + one all over what over what yeah that's right and then we start working with it this is a limit as n approaches Infinity of < TK n plus Ln of n over n^2 + 1 that's a lot of n dang n 3es over 1 that is a lot that is a lot from there what would we do distrib let's distribute so if we distribute this we get a limit as n approaches Infinity of of if this is a one power you'd have two Hales plus three halves it would be five halves but this is a 1/2 Power one2 Plus 3es is that's n 2 plus n the 3 Ln was right n over n^2 + 1 goodness gracious me that's a lot of stuff going on what's the next thing that you might want to consider doing would you try like a ly talls right now or something is that a good idea no you get that plus right there that's not a good idea because this would be infinity plus infinity we don't know what that is okay it's got to be indeterminate form for you to do a ly TOS now I'll give you caveat to that that you can do L talls on individual portions of this because you could split up parts of your limit you could do that do that a minute so what would you do so let's divide by N2 everywh so this is a limit as n approaches Infinity of N2 / n 2 yeah I'm going to write it out plus n 3 Ln n/ n 2 all over n^2 n^2 + 1 n^2 just so we see where everything's coming from limit as n approaches Infinity oh goodness uh what's become what's this one plus Ln of n Over N 12 exactly this is one this is 1 over n to the 2 can I have a show of hands if you feel okay getting down that far on your own on your own okay what's the limit of one one what's the limit of one what's the Lim of 1 nity so this is going to zero what about that one it's an indeterminate form why is it an indeterminant form infinity infinity brilliant exactly right so off to the side that you can do this it's okay here's why you can do it you can separate this limit by addition we can do a limit as n approaches Infinity of Ln n/ n^ 12 this thing equals infinity over infinity so we'll do oh what are you going to do with infinity over infinity again love ly tall he's much better than L short joking um that was a horrible joke I get my sense of hum from my dad love you dad I don't know if he watches these he should he really should give him something to do besides working on this never mind don't watch that Dad so uh what's a derivative of lnn derivative of n that looks sloppy doesn't it n the one2 what's the Der of n the 1 okay one two okay let's do that yeah one over two s of n if my math serves me correctly I don't think so is it a negative no no it's not I don't think so cuz you bring in the one2 you take one away from the exponent becomes negative that's a negative exponent that goes to the denominator so 2un of n let's go ahead and let's reciprocate and multiply so we have if we reciprocate and we multiply we're going to have what is that [Music] any reciprocate and multiply so far so good y okay well yes but be smarter about this okay I should have taught you something I know that I did before you start doing lals rules again and again and again and again and again simplify simplify this thing before you go any further because right now you're going to be done oh yeah so don't just arbitrarily jump into a lalls before you simplify we should have learned that a long time ago when it said with lyall's rule before you do it again you must simplify the fraction and that goes without saying hopefully for you so with us this is going to be 2 over the n yes no tell me something about the limit as n appr infinity of 2 of n what is it okay so now we know this thing is zero so we have a limit as n approaches Infinity actually we let it I'm sorry we let it approach Infinity what's this limit going to equal we have 1 + 0 over 1+ 0 how much is so our limit equals one come out I can't say that no I don't know just depends just coincidence so what so um the limit of that is one over one because that in determin form approach is zero right you know I'm going to go out there on a limit say yeah they probably do because if you're talking about end behaviors and you're saying they're very close you have basically the something over the same thing so a lot of them should work out to one what's the next statement that you're going to make do you know that next statement you're going to make since the limit exists since the limit exists so write that down since the limit exists andies of is convergent because is greater than one very good then what do you know about our given series it also converges that's exactly what we should write so word for word since the limit exists and the series of 1/ n the 3es is convergent by P series p is 3 greater than 1 then and this is the only part I'm going to write because I'm R room then the series that we were given also converges I should be a period also converges here's what I'm wondering um does a limit comparison test make sense to you it's kind of a cool thing isn't it it's saying use the N Behavior make a limit out of it it's just a ratio saying if the N behaviors are very similar make a ratio if that limit exists then sure enough they're both going to be convergent or both Divergent because they model after the same curves basically at the end beh here this that's the idea so we have a number of things now and the here's the wrap up the number of things first thing you always check for is yeah always take a limit of the sequence from which your series is stemming okay just the terms if it equals zero you must keep going if it doesn't equal zero you're done because that whole thing is Divergent okay after that check for the easy ones don't make this stuff harder than it is I would automatically check for geometric maybe I can make it uh I would automatically check for p series I mean that'd be a piece of cake that'd be kind of nice after that I check for if it's an easy integral I do integral test if I can do that or we could do now a comparison test like an easy comparison test would be kind of cool to do because there's less than something that's sometimes really easy to do if that's not the case we got to do a limit comparison test so for some of these nasty looking ones limit comparison test is the way to go if if you can show what the N behaviors are appropriately so for us remember that was this whole piece right here saying well we want to stick with the square root of N and not Ln of n because that is really the end behavior of that function does that make sense that's the numerator our sequence as it work after that it's pretty straightforward if the limit exists you're good to go whatever series you base this on compared it to that's going to be the also the uh the result of your given series whether it's convergent or Divergent
