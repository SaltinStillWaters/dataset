Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 6.7:  Evaluating Limits of Indeterminate Forms
all right well let's move on what we're going to talk about in section 6.7 we are going to talk about indeterminate forms of limits let's explain what that is in just a bit as we go through it actually indeterminate forms of limits and how we can approach these in an easier fashion than you were probably used to if you took calculus one at this particular school so indeterminant forms in determin forms of limits limits oh you guys remember limits they're back limits are the fundamental idea of calculus if we don't have limits we don't have calculus in fact everything we do in calculus revolves around limits and your your Calculus one teacher should have mentioned that that derivatives are essentially a limit idea it's a limit of a difference quotient it's a limit of a slope that's all the derivative is remember that how you took the two points if you watched my previous videos on calculus one I took the two points and made them really really really really really close remember that the idea really close is instead of two points this one you can't make it one you can't get one point because you can't find the slope at one point but you can make it so close that it doesn't make a difference and that idea is called a limit and then we find the slope of that so that that limit ideas how we get this idea of calculus so we're going to talk about indeterminate forms of limits and how to deal with them here's what an indeterminate form is one of the first ones an indeterminate form is something like this if we've got a limit as X approaches some number of a function of X over a function of X and if when we evaluate this limit you guys have seen this before trust me in your in your Calculus class and it gives us 0 over 0 have you ever seen those before yeah yeah that's typically where you divide out the largest power in the denominator remember that and when like X approaches infinity and things like this well uh or you get infinity overin same same idea well here we're going to do something a little bit different uh this is also when X approach is an actual number and this happens we can do the same thing here so a little bit different from what you were taught this right here is called an indeterminant form uh of the the form 0 over Z so there's several forms we'll get to one in just a little bit that's different than this but in general these things are pretty difficult to compute um sometimes they're easy because you can Factor you can simplify but often times they're pretty pretty difficult so one idea that someone came up with is instead of looking at directly let's look at how the derivatives of this and this are behaving let's look at how the the ratio of those derivatives is behaving so so that idea of the ratio how the ratio of the derivatives is behaving gives us the same limit of these functions it's called the lalls rule say lall yeah looks like l hospital except it's missing a couple letters um so let me show you the the idea here this is not approv I'm not going to prove it okay I'm going to show you the idea of why it works through examples so to to show you that the answer you get is the same for these two examples it's not approv so I'm going to skip over this proof for ly talls uh you need to know that it works so the idea behind ly talls for indeterminate forms of 0 over Z is that I'm going to look at the derivative of this guy over the derivative of this guy I'm going to see how those behave and the way those behave in relationship to each other or in ratio to each other is the same end behavior as what these things are going to do do you follow that you you want me do an example for you yeah okay here we go so I want you to look at the limit as X approaches 2 of 4 * x^2 - 4 over x - 2 okay please listen carefully in order for this next thing I'm going to show you to work you have to make sure you have an indeterminant form what you have to do first indeterminate form indeterminate form that's right you have to make sure it's 0 over 0 if it's not 0 over 0 you cannot do this is that clear so you have to make sure so plug in the number shoot number that about limits if you plug in the number and it works you're good just plug it in you're good to go so plug it in first plug in the two what do you get over here Z over that's the problem so we actually get 0 over Z if we plug in that two so we get 0 over Z we go all right well that's of this this first type of indeterminant form so we can work around that with limits and do things like this this is what you're used to what you're used to is doing all right well this is x - 2 x + 2 over x - 2 and if I can get rid of the problem for instance if the discontinuity is removable you have a removable discontinuity a whole remember that from your your calcul one class if you can cross it out it's a hole if you can't cross it out it's an ASM toote so if you can cross out the hole here the the removable disc continuity then you can find the limit really easily because limits don't care what happens at the point happens right before that if it's going to the same thing not at it but right before the limit still exists that's fantastic that's what we're using here so this ISS all right cool as soon as you cross those out now can I plug in two yeah of course I can this is 16 we okay with that one yeah we also used so some proofs that we used uh that we found out earlier so if I had sin XX as X approaches zero well look at this what's sign of zero Z what's uh Z that's 0 Z that's another indeterminate form you with Me Now by definition that was proved for you in your Calculus one class we know this we know that that was true do you remember that one whenever you get sin XX as X approaches Z the limit of sin XX is actually one I I'm not going to prove it to you it's by the squeeze theorem it's actually not that hard um but if you want that again Watch one of the calculus one videos it's proved on there right so that that's proved now please don't do this oh well Mr Leonard said anything over anything gives you one anything over itself gives you one that's not what I'm talking about all right there's an actual proof that goes along with this obviously that is not true for this one uh so this is indeterminate absolutely and we know this definition now what I'm going to show you is that there's another way to go around this besides factoring because you can't always Factor besides using definitions because there's not definitions for everything does that make sense we're going to use something called lal's Rule so here's another idea this is the big idea again called lyall's Rule looks like l hospital doesn't have the S so we be here's the idea a limit of a function of X over a function of X as X approaches a is the same thing same limit as the the derivative of f ofx over the derivative of G ofx but but please please recognize this this is only if it's what only if it's in determinate form only if the original limit is 0 over Z okay also one more thing uh just make it make a note on your your papers here am I talking about a quotient rule here no no no it's not it's not that hard some of you guys are in the habit of making this math really really hard or way harder than it has to be I'm not talking about quotient rule I'm talking about really easy derivative of the top over derivative of the bottom not a quotient rule write that down not a quotient rule so tell you what we're going to do these examples one more time I'm going to show you how this works and you're probably going to love if you didn't already love me you're going to love me right now all right get ready to love me it's almost Valentine's Day so I like chocolate we doing two okay 4x2 - 4 over x - 2 okay check this out awesome it's really cool here's the things you need to check uh do we have a limit if I plug in the number do I get 0 over zero yes you already have that over here so what I know is that this is true my original limit is 0 over Z lal's rule is in effect so what I get to do and I always put like a little arrow with a l l tall or an H doesn't matter what you do I used L you can use H you like H's better than L's l r l rules my last name is Leonard so booah that's why I use it the Leonard rule so here's what it says you keep everything the same for your limit just take the derivative of this don't use silly things like product rule because you don't need it four stays there times what's the derivative of the inside what's the Der of this stop when you plug in the number and you don't get z0 Z over Z anymore so if you plug in two does it work plug in two how much you get how about that which one's easier that one that's easier only if 0 over Z but then that works every time check this one limit sin XX I made no statement whether this had to be poly b omals or or this this works with functions okay so if it's 0 over Z you can do it if you plug in zero do you get 0 over Z let's try this one if I do L tall's rule I get a limit as X approaches zero of remember it's not a quotient rule it's not what we're talking about we're talking about derivative of the top your numerator derivative of your denominator so what's the derivative of sinx what's the Der of X bam now you have have to check every single time that you do lby tall's rule you don't just say I'm just going to do it five times and we'll see what we get okay that's not the way this stuff works you guys have to check it so if you plug in zero do you get Z over zero no no obviously not this is a one there's no way this going to become a zero cosine of Z is over bam there you go so lal's rule works for pols no problem all also works for trick functions as long this is a big deal here as long as you have very good all right we're going to continue our talk about how to do limits of an indeterminant form now so far we've just looked at this one what happens if a limit of some rational function what rational expression here equals 0 over 0 if that happens what we learned is that instead of thinking about the limits of the functions themselves we can think about the limit of the derivatives of those functions again not a quoti rule just a derivative of FX over the derivative of G ofx and figure out what that limit is and it's going to be the same limit as what we started with uh that right there is called the lals rule we've used it a couple times but we're going to start adding to our repertoire now uh we're going to start seeing well is there other things that we can do and one of thing that we can look at is what happens if we don't have 0 over Z but maybe we have a limit where the functions equal Infinity Infinity well consider this if you have Infinity over infinity then you can actually manipulate this so that if you did instead of f ofx over G of x if you manipulated it notice that this is this is equivalent if you did 1 over G ofx over 1 over f ofx u first I need to make sure that algebraically you're okay with this do you understand that this is is this yeah do you see that so if F ofx went to Infinity 1/ F ofx goes to zero did you catch that so you're just flipping the that's right I'm just kind of doing uh basically the reverse of a complex fraction complex fractions say that what you do is you multiply by the reciprocal this would of course be F ofx over G of X it's the same thing only we're using it this way saying well check this out if G of X goes to Infinity 1 over G of x 1 over infinity would go to zero if F ofx goes to Infinity 1 over F ofx would go to zero what this basically says is that and you don't have to show this okay you don't have to show it what it says is that if you have Z over zero this will work also if you have Infinity over infinity because you can do this this will also work so we basically have um have two statements here we say that if FX over G of x = 0 0 or if we have f ofx g ofx equal Infinity over infinity we can do L talls in either case does that make sense I'm just adding one more condition so that we don't have to change it to Z over zero if you ever get infinity over infinity it's basically the same thing so one a couple little little notes for you I'm just going to rewrite this statement if the limit of our functions equals 0 over Z or now we have a new one Infinity over infinity then the limit of FX over G ofx as X approaches a is equivalent to the limit of the derivative of FX over the derivative of G of X as X approaches a that's the whole thing that is what lal's rule says if you have 0 over zero or Infinity over infinity show hands if feel okay with with this okay a couple other little notes that you need to be aware of this doesn't just work as X approaches a this will work as X approaches a from the right or from the left so remember those one-sided limits you guys did a long time ago lal's rule will still work for that it'll also work if x approaches Infinity both positive and negative so uh some other notes Here Also work for X approaches a from the right or X approaches a from the left or X approaches positive infinity or X approaches negative Infinity all those things are fine so basically what it's saying is that lal's rule works all the time for for whatever you're approaching positive Infinity no problem they Infinity okie dokie uh a from the right a from the left or a altogether not an issue so we can use lalls rule basically all the time there's only one thing and it's an important thing that you got to do before you do lyall's rule we talked about it briefly last time but I want to make sure you have this written down in order to do ly tall's rule you must verify that this sorry we this or this is actually true you have to have this so what I'm going to write down is you must check that it is an indeterminate form before you do lall's rule please do that thank deal you must make [Music] sure you have 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity first you have to do it let me give you an example about why give you an example about y let's say that I give you the limit of cosine X overx as X approaches zero from the right hand side look at what's going to happen here if I plug in Z remember that this is continuous so you can just plug in zero and it's the same thing as a one-sided limit you don't have to worry about that so just plug in zero what's cosine of Z what's uh what's this as X approaches Z from the right is that an interminate form no no this actually is going to go to Infinity so this thing is positive Infinity however let's say that we said oh well wait a minute can't I just use lows all the time look what would happen if I did lals rule I would get a limit as X approaches zero from the right what's the derivative of cosine please derivative of x one this would give us 0 over one or 0 did we get the same thing no no what this is telling you is that lal's rule does not work unless you have 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity that's why this is important you have to make sure that you have that indeterminate form before you start doing all this Lal junk does that make sense so pans if you feel okay with with that one all right so we can't do it if it's not zero Z or Infinity over infinity um now when it is oh my gosh it's so nice so I want to practice some examples they'll gradually get a little bit more difficult we'll start off nice and easy I want to make sure that you guys see the concept here and then uh of course what are we going to be doing all the time what's LS do it does whatever what Z INF 0 Z infinity infinity but how do you do lby TS rule what are you doing derivative of the quotient or top and bottom top and bottom good so that's really all we're doing a lot of derivatives and then checking every time by the way every time you use lal's rule you want to check again if it's 0 over Z you can actually keep going with it do another derivative no problem or Infinity over infinity no problem keep on going until you can actually solve your your limit that's the idea you see some examples yes sir okay let's do limit as X approaches zero e to x -1 over 2x okay ladies and gentlemen what's the first thing that you've got to do in order to solve this limit what are you to do okay so we got to make sure we got to verify that it is one of these forms so let's do that if we plug in zero this is by the way what you should be doing every time you get a limit anyway just plug the number in because if it works you're good to go if it doesn't work well now we have a couple scenarios that we can work with so if we plug in zero what's e to the 0 one - one so this is 0 over 2 * 0 can we use low with that fantastic so we're going to show that all right well let's do a l TS rule I know I'm keep asking you but I want to make sure quotient rule or just derivative of the top just our numerator so let's do it look how nice this becomes by the way when you're doing limits I don't know how strict your Calculus one teacher was because I wasn't him uh or her I'm definitely not a her but uh wasn't him either so you need to be writing the limit every single time until you get to actually evaluate the limit okay what you can't do is go I'm going to ignore that and do the D that doesn't make sense okay you have to have that limit every single time until you actually get the answer does that make sense you got to do that so derivative of e to X what's that of one so this is I love that over der of 2x is just two now every time you do a ly T you you reevaluate you see if it works if it works you're done if it doesn't work if you get zero over zero you keep going if you don't and you can't use Li TOS you to do something else so can we plug in zero here let's see e to the 0 is notice here I have the limit here I've actually evaluated it worked out for me I don't need to write the limit anymore our answer our limit is 1 12 you guys okay with that one is there any time where you'll just keep taking like a second third oh absolutely you have multiple and we're going to get there right now I'm keeping it kind of easy so you just want to make the variable disappear event uh no not NE I'll just stick with me here I'll show you some let's look at the limit as X approaches Infinity of Ln X overx now we already talked about this is it okay for X to approach Infinity with lital ro yes so that's not an issue for us what is an issue is we got to make sure we have 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity so let's check it out if I plug in in Infinity let's think about that what is lnx as X goes to Infinity infity also Infinity okay how about X as X approaches is that something that satisfies our conditions yeah it's indeterminate form so what that says is shoot just do a lital rule um by the way I am not going to be spending a whole lot of time showing you derivatives like these anymore I'm going to kind of expect that you you get that all right so some of the chain R I'm going to be this doesn't involve chain rule it doesn't involve coent Ru it's pretty easy but just heads up from now on I'm probably not going to be showing you explicitly the chain rule uh I'm kind of expecting you you understand that okay uh so when I have like sine of 3x I'll probably just be doing 3 cosine 3x or cosine 3x * 3 and the chain was kind of implied there does that make sense so just to keep it a little bit quicker because I don't I'm not supposed to teach you chain rule every single time all right um but if you have questions let me know can you the derivative of Ln X 1X over over what so derivative of Ln X is 1x der of X is one derivative of the numerator no problem D denominator got it let's plug in the infinity again how much is one over infinity Z so we get 0 over one you don't even need the one really it's just 0 over one this is just zero so this becomes zero our limit zero do you see how nice Lal R makes that my goodness it's so much better so much easier can we do some a little bit more difficult ones yes do you guys understand these so far yeah having fun yet yeah do you like this section you should compared to some of the other stuff we've done it's nice okay let's let's see that one limit as X approaches Pi of 2 sin^2 x over 1 + cosine X tell me again the first thing that we need to do before we start working with this limit let's check that is it uh let's find out let's find find out do you know what s of Pi is uh Z it is zero so 0 squ is still * 2 is0 how about cosine of pi how much is cosine Pi 1+ 1 is z is lo going to work yeah I made no statement about whether these were pols or trigonometric or or square roots or anything it works all the time so if we have trig don't worry about it just do low rule again remember it's not quotient rule it's just derivative of the numerator over derivative of the denominator so when we do this um show me what you're doing though put a little L some people use the H for the the H part of Li tals I use l i don't know why just do keep writing your limit as much as you need to take you down to evaluate so if we're using derivatives here for our numerator what's going to happen is this is a chain do you see it 2 * 2 gives you four you'll leave the inside alone you'll multiply by the derivative of the inside 4 sinx cosine x uh quick head now if you're okay with that one by the chain rule good now denominator what happens to the one disappear gone can you do derivative of cosine good I like the negative that's fantastica sin also what should we do next after we've done those derivatives check it again I would check it right now what I would do is probably simplify if I can maybe can you simplify make this problem easy if you if you can do you see sign over sign yes hello now am I doing another L rule right now so don't don't put the L or the H if you're not doing lal's rule what we're doing is just we're simplifying guys we're not doing anything major just a little bit of algebra we have -4 cosine X there's no denominator at all anymore now after you simplified here's where you're probably going to want to plug in the number to see if you if you can get something out of it so if you plug in pi cosine Pi is time4 it's four okay show hands we're okay with that one you guys getting the idea so far the idea is check for z00 0 Z or Infinity over infinity if you have that cool man do a derivative of the numerator do a derivative of the denominator simplify first then plug it in again repeat process okay number one thing we're doing is we're checking to see if our limit even works we're plugging in the whatever X approaches and seeing if we have zero Z or Infinity over infinity because we can do stuff with that if we actually get a number that's easier you're just done all right but we got to check this so let's plug in Infinity what do we get if we plug in Infinity infity sure this is definitely Infinity this is two time okay that's 8 INF that's Infinity over infinity is Lal is going to work yes in full effect so we're going to do a Lal rule here we'll have our limit X approaches Infinity so tell me what's going to happen on the numerator can you do derivative of the numerator now let's do derivative of the denominator what's going to happen here uh be it is chain rule so derivative of this is e 2x time 2 because of the chain rule so e 2x stays there remember with chain rule you're taking the derivative and multiplying by the derivative of this inside part if you want to call it the exponent so derivative of 2x is 2 and then we have it e 2x you guys okay with that so far yeah now check this out what's that going to give you infinity over infity can I do lall's rule again yes keep going until you can't okay that's the idea here so notice we're checking again this is still Infinity over infinity so I'll do lals again if I do Lal rule again since I had Infinity over infinity it's indeterminate form L works I get 6X and I get let's do the same thing we have another two that'll be four e 2x again another two because of the chain rule yet again we still have Infinity over infinity let's do it again so we checked for it we had in indeterminate form LS rule we had it again L rule we had it again L rule derivative of the numerator is what please over what are you going to get on the denominator so another chain rle we add a four notice the chain R is going to give you another factor of two that's 8 e the 2x now we're going to check it again do we still get infinity over infinity no no we get six over infinity you get see it how much is six over infinity it's zero zero you have a constant over something going to Infinity that's zero now question if you're really thinking what if this was x to the 31st instead of just the third we have been doing it a lot you keep doing it 31 time 32 times and you're going to get zero again do you see why yeah the e to the x is never going to away so it's going to be Infinity no matter what if you have a polom that's going to gradually reduce down to zero which is very interesting in that some I would just look at that me now you're not going to do this because you're going to show you work I would look uh polom something that's always infinity that's that's zero for sure but you're going to show me more of that okie dokie anyway that is the idea now we're going to make it just a little bit more funner funner means harder do you guys have any questions so far before we continue have I explained this well enough for you to completely understand the idea here yes does that mean if there's an e over another E there's no way to ever solve because it'll always be Infinity it depends depends on what that is sometimes you can manipulate that um sometimes you can sometimes you can do other techniques for that if we come across one I'll I'll be happy to show you which one we just okay this one's going to take us just a little while so stick with me here what's the first thing you do you walk me through this what what are you doing here okay so we plug in the zero uh what do we get when we plug in the zero that is not that is not a trivial thing to do you actually have to show that it is in determinate 0 over Z you guys okay with the 0 over Z so if you have 0 over Z what are you guys doing go ahead and do it so nice is not a quotient rule right these are just these are I mean should be fairly straightforward most of the time did you get 3x^2 1 - SEC x d of tent is see squ now what are you to do do here what check see do so we're going to plug in zero again what's this go to Z over this is one let's plug in zero to secant keep in mind secant is one over cosine cosine of 0 is one 1 over 1 gives you 1 1 - 1 gives you what are you do now keep it going go ahead and do it again the numerator is cool denominator is kind of stinky it's going to get kind of bad here real quick let's see what's going on so numerator hopefully you got 6X that's pretty pretty basic derivative of one gives you that piece is gone that's nice do you see it here what is that R that's a chain roll that's exactly what we did over here so we're going to have -2 SEC x times the derivative of see X follow me on this one this is what I said I'm going to be doing the chain kind in my head here so check it out this is zero it's gone this is chain rule bring down the two so -2 leave the inside alone so -2 s x times the derivative of the inside which is our secant x are you with me so we bring down the two that's -2 SEC X derivative of SEC X is SEC X tangent X you get yeah we're going to simplify it you're always simplifying and making this as nice as possible before you move on especially if you have to do another lals I mean think about that there's a multiplication and you you don't want to do a double product rule right make this thing a little bit nicer so we're not doing LS rule so don't show me you're doing L rule if you're not we got 0 6X over -2 sec^2 x Tan x well that was fun by show hand you feel okay with that one yes yes no chain rule bring two der inside leave inside what are you going to do now it in so plug in zero what's this become what's this become undefined I don't even care what this is this is zero this is tangent of zero is zero so I don't even care what this is cuz this part is z is that clear for you yeah so 0 0 tangent of 0 is z what are you do now yay go ahead do not look don't a product rule yeah you're right it's a product rule let's let's do this together okay do you see the product rule yeah inside the product rule you have another chain rule almost exactly like the one we just did so these things can explode especially with these trig function like secant so numerator man numerator is nice we just get six like that one here we're going to have derivative of the first time the second plus the first time der of the second um if you want to do it just below there maybe that's what I'll do here derivative of the first don't forget the C on secant thanks one of you who got that cuz it just doesn't look right so derivative of the first * the second plus the first time derivative of second I want to double check on my work did you guys get the same thing that I got shouldn't there be another you know what I forgot it oh dear you're right I bet maybe I better write out take my own advice gosh darn it okay derivative of the first times the second because we definitely don't want to forget anything plus the first times the derivative of the second thank you for that yeah I did forget one der of the first * the second plus the first times the Dera of the second just take that -2 and put it with a sec squ that's fine to do that so here this is very much like this one just we have -2 so derivative here gives us -4 SEC x to the first Power Times the derivative of the inside by the chain rule we got secant x tangent X but then we have another Tan x that's right so -4 leave the inside Alone multip by derivative of the inside the derivative of secant x is see X tangent X and then we have the tangent I need show hands if you okay with with that one just make sure okay good moving on let's change that to a minus - 2 secant 2 x time Dera of tangent is another sec 2 x okay if we put everything together we have -4 SEC 2 x tangent 2 x - 2 sec to 4th X it looks nasty it's not that bad when you really think about it uh first I want to know are you okay with with this part isn't the SEC Cub what did I do have to leave the No it should be it should still be secant squar the chain will brings us two down so you have a secant * a see gives you see Square okay it's see Square Tang Square this is this is correct okay good comment any other comments or questions are you seeing ladies and gentlemen where everything's coming from you kind of shut up on me here for a little bit are you okay with it yeah like oh my gosh are you all right with it it's it's trick but we know derivatives right so we know chain rule we know product rule we know derivative of secant and tangent so we should be okay with this stuff see Square Tang squ see 2 4th now what do we do here does the six change don't worry about this CU it's connected to this what's tangent of zero so this whole piece Z zero now we already did secant x where X is zero how much is secant of zero it's one how much is 1 to the 4th power time -2 remember this whole thing is so what this is we stop writing the limit because we're done with the limit we have six we've actually evaluated over -2 our answer is3 that limits ne3 okay that that's pretty bad but I wanted to give you a hard one that way you understand how to deal with this I don't want to give you all easy ones and then you get your homework go oh my goodness so this is a little difficult right stick with it all it's all this is is check for 0 over Z check for Infinity over infinity and then do lals rule tell you can't do it anymore after that hopefully you can evaluate your limit show hands be okay with these ones now that's all well and good but sometimes let's you we're going to have some different indeterminant forms so I want to check those out so question is what about the cases where we have Infinity minus infinity what about the cases where we have one to the infinity or zero uh infinity to the zero or something like that something crazy well if ever you get this rate of infinity minus infinity something that don't do this well Infinity that's zero Infinity minus infinity hey zero done no we can't do that what you have to do is somehow manipulate this and so until you get 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity so you usually what that is is finding a common denominator and making one fraction out of it does that make sense to you so if you have this what about this we're going to use some algebra to get either 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity same thing happens with this uh if you had Infinity time0 something like that if you got Infinity time0 oh my goodness don't just say that that's zero I know it seems weird but that's not always the case we actually have to manipulate it to get infinity over infinity over z z this one's typically pretty easy and I'll show you that so quick example let's look at the limit as X approaches Z from the right hand side of 1x minus 1/ 1 - cosine X oh goodness hey what's the first thing that you should be doing on liit plug it in the zero let's do that let's plug it in if you plug in the zero from the right hand side from the right that it's from the right because this limit doesn't exist unless we go one-sided okay cuz it does this so you can't say at zero I had to give you a oneid limit for this specific case are you with me on that one so from the right this thing goes to Infinity this is infinity this thing goes well this is 1 over Z that thing goes to Infinity so we have Infinity minus infinity here do you guys see what I'm talking about all right if we got Infinity minus infinity we don't just say it's zero we got to work on this and one good way to work on this is if you have two fractions man just make them the same fraction put them on one fraction because then if you can get 0 over zero or infinity infinity you got lals question so one over Zer is also one would it be Infinity one over zero is infinity that's right as we go to the right that's a positive number right so we one over a number going to zero so this is from the right these are positive numbers so from the right is going towards zero this way it's doing this the graph is actually doing this but X itself is getting really close to zero but positive so if you're taking a number a constant number dividing by something really close to zero that's going to be Infinity it's going to Infinity question so that plus is what's giving you the infinity right if that plus or minus wasn't there you just plug in zero you have to think about the graph if you're going to do it graphically this is the graph going from the right hand side not to the right hand side from the right hand side it's going this way on this graph that's how that looks like we're going this way hey what's happened to my graph when I'm going this way it's doing that positive Infinity if that was a minus it would be negative Infinity does that make sense if it was this the limit would actually exist we could just say at zero because the limit would be positive Infinity they're both going that way you with me on that one okay shouldn't have done that that was just a recap of limits but hopefully that helped you all right so maybe one thing we can do is make this one fraction get everything on one fraction get a common denominator and then see what we got so if we do that notice I'll have to multiply by X over X I'll have to multiply by 1 - cosine X over 1 - cosine X you guys with me on that one yeah so we're going to get out of this is 1 - cine x - x all x * 1 - cos x you guys okay with that one you sure just some algebra just some common denominator stuff we're multiplying by 1 - cos x over itself and xx that's why we're getting 1 - cosine X from here - x when multiply by X the denominator is going to be the same one more thing I'm going to do I'm going to distribute this because if I have to do lal's rule I'd rather deal with a smaller product rule than a bigger one you can do either way you know what you want to leave it this way we could leave it that way no fine okay so I'm going to distribute that and I'm going to get x - x cine X still okay with it hey what's the next thing that we should do if we plug it in we get zero so plug in zero here how much you get one 1 - one is z minus one z Oh zero this whole thing is zero this is zero this is zero doesn't even matter what this is 0 - 0 is do you guys see that this is0 Z yes this is another litar rule let's go ahead and see if you can do litar rule I'm going to do on the board this one should be pretty easy pretty straightforward this one you're going to have what are you going to have here not a chain rule oh that would be that's a product rule keep in mind when you're doing the product rule uh you know I'll show you in a minute I'll see if you catch it go ahead and do it what's a derivative of one what's the derivative of cosine X is that netive so if this is neg so we'd have negative sinx negative would be this would be positive sinx are you okay with that one yeah um how about this one yeah did you already take care of the Der of the bottom well okay work on I'll give you another minute if you're going to do this product rule put a bracket up there or something because when you subtract that minus sign will have to distribute you catch that yeah so we're going to have derivative of the first hey that's not a big deal so der of first is 1 time the second plus the first time the derivative of the second this hey that's one minus we got a minus we put put a bracket up there derivative of the first is 1 * the 2 cosine X plus the first leave that alone derivative of the second is negative sinx of course I'm assuming you know how to do product R really really well right yeah all right so moving on what are you going to do with this stuff uh distribute the negative yeah probably I would probably move this here then distribute the negative so we'd have a limit as X approaches zero from the right we'd have sin x minus one notice we're not doing any calculus right now we're not doing any we've done uh just a common denominator we've done L's rule here but now we're we're not doing anything we're just kind of combining some stuff 1us cine X what's that sign going to Bei yep see plus that would change this to a minus that changes it back to a plus okay all at once all at once all on uh now what are you going to do zero let's do that so if we plug in zero here look it sign's a uh is it's continuous so the limit as X approaches Z from the right is the same as the limit as X approaches Z no no big deal so just plug in zero what's sign of zero minus one ah so we're not getting Z over zero here so L we can't do lob whatever happens we can't do litol rule after this are you clear on that can't do it so this is going to give you1 on the denominator let's do this I've got a one how about cosine of zero one- one plus one okay so one over what's that going to beity exactly right show P be okay with that one that's a little weird but my point is that when you get down to this you can't do ly talls rule anymore you can't just go ah I just want to do it again it doesn't work I already prove that to you so we have to actually manipulate this and see what happens here once you're done with Z over zero or Infinity over infinity just find out what the limit is uh work it through like you you already know how to do okie dokie let's do tell you what I think we'll do one more and then I'll show you a different interminate form oops I'm sorry this limit to Ln yeah sometimes all it takes is just a little manipulation to make this thing look the way that you want it to so for instance if we plug in zero right here does anybody know cose of zero remember that this is one/ s correct how much is sign of Z so this would be 1 over Z how much is that that's Infinity this one if I plug in what's sign of Z 1 - Z One Ln of one this is infinity time0 is what this is do you guys see what I'm talking about you got you got to do it you got to think through it but this is infinity time Z is what that is can you do Infinity time Z the way it is right there no no you don't put Infinity you don't put zero we actually have to do the work this is going to be kind of interesting to see that it's not going to be either one of those two numbers infinity or zero so this was Infinity because it's one over sign this is zero because we have Ln of one all right well you know what let's just think about what cosecant actually is cosecant is what again so if this is one/ s then we can change this limit into Ln 1 - sin x over what please did you guys follow that cosecant is one over sign therefore if cose is 1/ s you're just multiplying 1 sin x * Ln of this nasty stuff we're going to get Ln of 1 - sin x over sinx can you simplify the sin X's yet no heck no not at all what should you do right now now if you plug in the zero hopefully you see this this isn't going to change this is still going to be zero we didn't change that one at all this one well because we changed an Infinity down to a denominator that's going to be how much Z this is 0 over Z Now what can you do you do l so just by changing some things around make it make it something different make it one over sign instead of cosecant hey no big deal then it becomes 0 over Z not you have to be okay with that one it's a little manipulation here so we're changing these problems little by little go ahead and see if you guys can do the ls on this oh goodness so we had Infinity time Z we said hey this this is fine I like that one this one let's rewrite a little bit cant is 1/ s therefore we have Ln over s and that gives us 0 over Z that's we're able to do lals rule if you do the lals rule here one of these parts is really easy what's the derivative of sinx I'm sorry what's the [Music] D do you remember how to do the derivative of Ln what do you have to use here 90% of the time you're right yay chain Ru that's right so we'd have one over in one over the inside times the derivative of the inside let's look at the Der inside everybody derivative of one is derivative of s so we're going to have negative that's right negative cosine X so you okay with that so far you sure don't plug anything in yet don't do that what I want you to do right now is simplify right after you do that to simplify if you can do you see something that simplifies cosiness are done yeah they're gone so if we simplify our cosiness wow the problem that looked like it was going to be really hard becomes really easy so we get no ly TS rule we don't have to do that we're just simplifying here folks you're not always doing ly talls rule this only took one of them so we're going to have a limit as X approaches zero from the right we got -1 see where the negatives coming from yeah over 1 - sin x and now we should try to do that do do the plugin now we should try to evaluate the limit since we have1 we know that Lal rule will not work anymore hopefully this thing will work for us s of Z 1 - 0 so we have1 over one we have one that's the idea quick show hand feel okay with with that one now sometimes and this is where it gets a little bit little bit more interesting it really is more interesting these are these are fun and good and all but they actually get kind of tedious I got z z no problem sometimes we get some really interesting things interesting limits and we can do something pretty cool with them it's probably going to blow your mind a little bit like a m grenade you ready for it what if I asked you to do the limit as X approaches zero from the right of this and you go wait a minute what now uh where's X going to Z to the power of Z so this is 0 to the power of zero one one Z to Z is not one what is z to the z z I would say zero ah it's in determinate because we don't know CU you anything to zero power is one okay but zero to any power is zero so what do we have oh God which one uh zero or one I don't know crap let's make up something that will work we're just going to make up our own math here okay let's make up something that will work I'll give you a note and this is probably we'll end it and I'll start here probably next time but look at this for any limit if you have a function of x raised to another function of X can you please verify that's exactly what I have going on here yes no function of X raised to a function of X I'm not talking about X squ here okay I'm talking about x to the X something with an X here if this equals 0 to the 0 or Infinity to the 0o or 1 to the infinity if it's one of those try this this is interesting instead of instead of thinking this as F ofx to the G ofx we can actually do a little trick here it's the same trick I hope you remember this it's the same trick that we did with logarithmic differentiation the same idea only we can't just put Ln here's what we're going to do we're going to say hey you know what this good this was the same thing as this wasn't it yeah okay therefore this is the same thing as this do you believe it yes now what does that allow you to do with that g of X bring FR yes so then this becomes e to the G ofx Ln FX that's the idea here let me show you the way this works in practice I'm just going to give you the first U First little part we're going to call it good we'll we'll finish this problem up next time but so can you guys verify that right now I have Z to the zero not a good thing so what we're going to do instead is so we're going to write this as e to the Ln of x to the X only I'm not going to leave the X there what I'm going to do with the X so then this is limit X approaches Z from the right X Ln X are you okay with that one now there's one more interesting thing about this because E's continuous because e is that constant base continuous I can actually pull the e out of the limit this is equivalent to this instead of taking limit of e as that approaches I can do e of the limit as X approaches zero from the right of x l x so what that means is this listen carefully you ignore the E ignore the E just work on this limit figure it out and then put it back as an exponent B does that make sense to you so it's like a constant kind of like that e continuous so and and it's a constant base what that means is that uh the limit of e to a power is the same thing as the limit of the power and then take e to that power same thing so what we're going to do here is we're going to rewrite these things all three of these forms as something like this work on this limit I'll show you how to do that next time this by the way is uh 0 time infinity negative Infinity so we rewrite it using some of the stuff that we just did 0 * infinity and then put that as a power and that's all we've got to do does that make sense to you I'll show you more on that next time all right we're going to continue so what we're talking about in section 6.7 of course is the indeterminate forms and what we know is that if we have a limit of a rational expression somehow not even polinomial over polinomial just any sort of fraction where our limit is and we checked it we place number and we get 0 over 0 or we get infinity over infinity those two cases then we can do L tall's rule immediately we just take the derivative of the numerator we take the derivative of the denominator no big deal that's it so 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity of course one big thing we found out last time is we had to check that it doesn't work if it's not 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity does that make sense to you yeah now what we're doing here is we're discovering there's a few more indeterminant forms the last thing we did last time was Infinity minus infinity when you have that it's a really good idea to make one fraction because then most of the time it changes to Infinity over infinity or0 over zero remember that problem had a cosine in there I believe or if we have 0 times infinity okay rewrite one of them that way you have Infinity over infinity or 0 over Z no big deal now we're looking at some special cases of when we have a function of X raised to a function of X and one thing we learned the very last thing from last time was well if you have aun function of X ra to function of X we can always rewrite this just use e to the Ln remember that e to the Ln is a is an identity that gives you back exactly what you have I think I gave you this one last time 2 equal e to the Ln 2 every time that's the idea 2 to the X would equal e to the Ln 2x no problem that's basically the idea that we're doing here we're saying all right well if I have a function of X raised to function of X do this with it and I can move that function of X down front now as far as our limit goes that says that when we get something that we can't can't actually really do directly I mean think about that we always try to plug these in correct always so if we take our zero plug in zero what do you have Z to the we got that something looks just like that let's try this and let's see what we can do with it so this is the same thing as a limit as X approaches zero from the right of well it says that we're going to take e to the Ln this is this is just an identity statement that says you can write anything as e to the Ln of that thing e to the Ln x to the X now why do we do this what's it allow you to do again that that's the idea get rid of that exponent so we have a limit as X approaches Z from right e to the X Ln X now there was one more thing I told you last time I'm not sure if you remember I know we were kind of rushing because we only like two minutes left when we were doing this problem do you remember what I can do with the e that's right we don't really take it away the where it's gone forever but we take it away out of the limit absolutely so with this we can actually write it instead of the limit of e to this expression we can write e to the Limit of that expression so basically we're going to ignore that e for a little while no problem we're just going to look at the limit as X approaches zero to the right of x * L and X so should be okay with L now take take a look at the limit as X approaches Z of x l and x what do you get when you plug in Zero from the remember from the right means going this way it's going towards the left it's from the right what do you get here what do you get here you get zero what do you get here no you don't get one you get Negative Infinity that's correct so this is basically 0 time Infinity I'll give you a real big hint here if you ever get something like 0 to the 0o Ln of zero is going to become negative Infinity you're going to get something like 0 time Infinity what you're required to do here and this happens almost all the time with us okay what you're required to do is just rewrite this piece can we do 0 time Infinity no we can't do that that was one of those indeterminate forms we dealt with last time so rewrite just this little piece here's the idea the piece which is easier to take the derivative of you're going to move that to a denominator you're going to make it a denominator it's hardly ever the Ln hardly ever this it's typically this one let me show you what I'm talking about so again we can't do 0 * Infinity what we can do is 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity does that make sense so if I have 0 times infinity and I make the zero go to a denominator it's going to become another Infinity it's going to change 0 time Infinity into Infinity over infinity does that make sense to you so we're going to change the look of this a little bit by the way I know I already said it but you make a little mental note here we hardly ever change this guy the reason is you're going to see in a minute this would be hard to take a derivative of when it's on the dener this one is easy okay so check it out do we still have an e it's going to be there the whole time I would recommend to you that you keep on writing it uh that way you don't forget about it at the very end of your problem go my goodness how they're getting one I got zero okay so we got e limit don't forget the limit X approaches zero from the right leave the Ln X make make this thing become a fraction you can always make an expression become a fraction if you take it and put it under one so instead of X you could write this as 1 /x isn't this still technically can't can't you move that to the den the numerator from this denominator to the numerator then this is valid this is exactly the same thing show feel okay with that one now check out what happens this is going to make sense about what I just explained to you if I take zero now look at this if I take Zero from the right Ln of Z from the right is it negative Infinity you need to understand the look of the graph of Ln Ln looks like this does that okay so it's going NE INF as we approach Zero from the right it's going negative infity so this is negative Infinity over check this out look look what happens here if I take zero What's one over Z Infinity this counts by the way negative that's that's fine negative Infinity over infinity counts as Infinity over infinity hey can I use l talls r with this now yeah as soon as I change it to this that's great could I do it here there's not even a denominator how would you do that so make it have a denominator check it make sure you get Z over zero or Infinity over infinity do I have to switch any of this around do I have to switch any of this around heck no it's Infinity over infinity that's fine just start lal's rule from right here 0 over 0 or Infinity over infinity are you guys clear on that one mhm well let's do it so that was perfect now let's do our ly tall I still got an e nothing's going to change about that I still got a limit Zero from the right how we do L talls hopefully the last time I don't explain this we take the derivative of the numerator we take the derivative of the denominator is not a quotient rule so let's do the derivative of the numerator everybody derivative of Ln X cool okay so 1/x no problem how about the derivative of 1 /x all I heard what I'm hoping you said is yeah that's right I heard you that time you have to get attitude with me jeez so this derivative is 1x yes this derivative is negative do G see what's negative you think about this as X to the1 okay X11 goes down subtract one from the exponent it becomes -21 x s quick head out if you're okay with that one now before you go any further of course our idea is simplify before you do another or before you try another uh low tall or whatever you're going to do simplify these things so can you simplify this stuff of course so no ly TS rule we're just going to simplify e still there limit still there as X approaches zero from the right let's see this guy would become 1X time remember that when you have a complex fraction instead of division we can multiply by the reciprocal can you simplify that that's really nice yeah Negative X okay so we have now e to the Limit as X approaches zero from the right of x e to hey can we take that limit now can you do limit ofx as X approaches Zer from the right how much is it the Zer plug it in how much is it Z Zer so e to the this is why you don't forget to write the e I think I said it earlier if you're going man if you forget to write the e on all these things okay I just forgot to write it and then you're going to get zero you go wait a minute they're getting one in the back of the book how in the world are they getting one I'm getting zero well because you're forgetting the E you don't just take Ln we do e to the Ln so the E's got a be here and the E's got a B here and the E's got to be here making this a one interesting isn't it 0 to the 0o in this case is going to give us one should P be okay with that one good all right is it does it make sense cool tell you what we're going to only try two more these are a little bit more complicated I'm going try to give you some really difficult problems uh that way we we can work through them together and you can see all the ins and outs of all this stuff uh these are these are what I would consider to be Hardin question um when we simplify something like say were to simplify that and it didn't come out to be something as easy as X could we continue doing lall's rule or Absol look at lyall's rule works every time you have 0 over zero or some form of infinity over infinity Okie doie so as long as you still check that as long as it's still indeterminate you can do lals rule it's not just a oneandone all right so if you if it was didn't work out nice and you had like uh if you had one /x now you couldn't do LS rule there because it' be one over zero that would be Infinity you'd have e to the infinity it would be Infinity okay but you can do ly's rule as long as you simplify it and it's still or you can manipulate it and still Z over zero or Infinity over infinity are all the problems involving the E always going to turn out to be one nope no not all the time something um some a lot are some some are but some are so no okay let's give this a try I know this one's going to it's going to be a little bit more difficult that shouldn't be a problem for us I want you guys to kind of lead me on what you would do how you would think about this problem cuz right now honestly we only have two more examples so you guys should be kind of kind of pros at this at this point kind of understand what's going on what would you do first plug in and let's see if it works uh what's tan pi/ 2 from the left not to the left from the left this way what happens here say what positive Infinity that's right do you know the graph of tangent you have any idea what it looks like this is pi/ 2 from the left okay how about cosine of pi/ 2 we had to go from the left on that one because for tangent it would be undefined the limit wouldn't exist if I said the limit at pi/ two you can't do it because one does this one does this all right so I had to say from the left that that's defin that the cosine doesn't care uh because it's defined from the left it's defined from the right so therefore it's defined and both of them it goes both in each case cosine of 2 is what Z good so this is infinity to the zero is it one of the indeterminate forms that we can work with yes look over there is it one of the indeterminate forms that we can work with yeah now here's the idea if I didn't mention it before here's the idea we are always always trying to get this down to the form of 0 over Z or Infinity over infin now you help you understand that concept we can't do anything with this right now we can't do anything with that so we're going to work with it we're going to use probably this technique that's why I said try this for each of these cases try doing this it'll help you because if you can do this if you can rewrite it as Infinity over infinity or Z over zero then we can do a lby tals rule rule so we're always trying to work with these things to get them down to an indeterminate form which we can work with so changing this type of form into 0 over Z or Infinity over inity okay now that we have the idea tell me the next step please what would you want to do okay let's all do that you know what you could even do it right now if you get the hang of it you could write e to the Limit cine X Ln Tan x you guys see that that's what we're going to get ultimately I'm going to show you the steps but you could do it right now that's what I would do if if it was my paper I'd write e to the Limit cosin X Ln Tan x so e Ln 10x cosine X the two things we're going to do which is why I said this earlier if you get in the pattern of this because you're going to do it a lot okay this moves down all the time doesn't it that exp moves down all the time this e comes out all the time so we end up getting e outside of our limit to the Limit X approaches < / 2 from the left cosin x * Ln t x you know what every step that you do you got to check what type of form you're working with now so let's see if this works okay always be checking to see if it works uh pi/ two let's do this how much is that it's not going to change what's right we just want to check the form to see what we can and can't move so that's zero um how much is is that that's Infinity l l of infinity is still Infinity which one would well I'm sorry I I didn't I should ask you this what should we do now move one of them to the bottom move one of them to the bottom okay which one are we going to move to the bottom the Ln or yeah it's rarely the Ln because if you imagine this from over here if I move this to the denominator I'd get 1 over Ln X you with me mhm that's really hard to do 1 over lnx would take the derivative of 1 over Ln X that's going to get a little difficult okay we'd have a chain rule we'd have Ln X to the1 we bring 1 have -2 and then we have a chain Ru after that but it's possible it won't work out for you it's possible to do you can do the derivative of one L and X but it's not going to work out like this okie dokie so I'm just going to give you the hint here you're r if ever going to put this one on the denominator because you're going to get lots of chain rules that way does that make sense to you this one is the one we're going to move down we might get chain rule we might not but that one's going to be easier than l in most cases so we still have the E we still have a limit / 2 from the left we got Len we got Tan x see we got 1 over cosine X you guys okay with that so far so you can do that every time you say hey cosine x no no no let's just put it over one over cosine X it's it's the same idea now of course we can simplify this a little bit maybe we don't want to work with 1 over cosine X we might want to work with 1 cosine X is what let's call it secant okay now that we've done that now that we've done one more step let's check to see what typ of form we have hopefully this process it should work for you guys it should make it a z over Z or an Infinity over infinity let's see um now this shouldn't have changed from here this should be the same so when I plug in Pi / 2 tan from the left Tan x is still Infinity correct that means Ln of infinity is still in this is still Infinity see X as X approaches Pi / 2 remember that this is 1 / cosine how much is co remember it was this how much is cosine of pi 1 Z infity so this is infinity over some form of infinity can we do Lal rule right now then do it hey what are you going to have to do for your derivative of Ln t x what is that 90% of the time that's the correct answer that's right yay let's see if you knew what you were doing here uh ladies and gentlemen the derivative of Meers does not think goodness this is not a quoti rule uh what's the derivative of this guy X here How We Do derivative of Ln is one over the inside time derivative of inside so we have one over inside here's one over inside got it yeah times derivative of ins what's the derivative of tan X so we' have see s x over tangent X show can should be loc with that so far one over inside that's where we get the tan X on the denominator times derivative of inside that's our sec Square uh what do you think we should do now check to should we check it or should we simplify it yeah simplify it first before you start checking again and again let's simplify it so can you simplify that yes take a little side road here so we'd have sec^2 X over Tan x right times if you put this over one if you put that over one division is the same as multiplication of the reciprocal so we would multiply by what's what's going to be on the numerator one cool all right let's do it uh what's going to happen gone almost gone so we'll have X over tan^ 2 x you guys okay with that one yeah now here's a here's a here's an issue uh if you try to do the secant x that is going to give you infinity isn't it this is going to give you infinity you probably could do another Lal if you wanted however sometimes it's worth your while is that Infinity also Infinity Square so Infinity right also it's worth your while to simplify as much as you can so what I'm seeing here is that if I write this just a little bit different if I write this as SEC X look at tan^ 2 x is the same thing as coent squ sorry one over one over tan^ s x same thing asent s x are you with me on that one we use some identities here well what I'm seeing out of that one is that that I could do 1 / cosine x * cosine 2 X over sin^2 X this is our secant you guys follow me on that one this is cotangent squar you follow me on that one you with me still yeah can you simplify that yeah yeah why not let's do it cosine cosine s so yeah we did a lot of trig in this one I want to make sure that you guys are okay before I go on uh you okay that this is definitely true yeah and this is true true and this is the same thing as one/ cosine hey this same thing as remember if tangent is s over cosine cotangent is cosine over s so we have we have that simplify it now let's just pretend we have a limit out front if I do cine of Pi / 2 how much is cosine of Pi / 2 again how much is s of pi/ 2 again one I have 0 over one is it okay to have 0 over one then we've just evaluated our limit without having to do another lals rule does that make sense we kind of avoid this whole secant tangent thing and then two tangent see squar that that's that's ugly so make it Easy by simplifying as much as you can not just once as much as you can that a lot of times makes your problem that much easier did you guys understand that the concept here yes you probably could do another ly tall should you probably not probably simplify as much as you can so let's wrap this thing up we've got and E we've got a limit we got X approaching / 2 from the left and now we have well the only thing that we we did here's our star we we did our star and now we have cosine X over sin^2 X okay let's do it one more time you guys okay with going from here to here yeah what was cosine as we approach x 0 over so this would be e to the of course I said no it's not always one and then I gave you an example that was one again uh but just a coincidence okay so we get to the Z again we get one show hands feel okay with that one that's a tough problem It's Tricky that's a lot of stuff in that problem I look at all the steps we have in that would you like to try one more yes okay ideas don't change though ideas are if you have an indeterminant form try to work with it make it Z over zero or or Infinity over infinity and then you do Lal rule after you do Lal rule you simplify it every time after you simp simpy you check it again and if you still have Lo R cool if you don't then you value your limit that's simp right okay this one's going to take us a while too okay now you really need to tell me what to do okay what would you do first try try good let's do it let's plug in infinity and see what we get uh what's one over infinity what's 1 - 0 one and what's that go to so this is one to the infinity is that one of those indeterminate forms that I gave you in that little sheet so if it's that one what should we try e that e to the Ln thing why don't you do that go ahead and do the e to the Ln thing um notice I'm going to give you the shortcut right now of course you can write this out and then write this out but I'm going to do it in one step here uh when you get the hang of this this is absolutely fine just don't for oh my goodness don't forget about the E okay don't forget that e it's important so what I know is that I could write this as e to the Ln of this argument well well that's the same thing as pulling out the E having the same old limit having the X come down because I have an Ln of the inside okay I really do need to make sure that you guys are okay on going from here to here do you guys see that I'm basically doing the same thing only in one step show P you okay with that one okay that's everybody that's good good so same idea it's still e the Ln isn't it and this is still an exponent but I'm bringing it down okay now let's check it again nothing really should change I should have a one up there somewhere and I should have uh an Infinity that's still Infinity now this thing let's look at that that's going to change a little bit look what happens here here's an Infinity when I plug an Infinity here what what do I get Zer one- Z one how about Ln of one Z oh so I have Infinity time Z oh that's one of those indeterminate forms that I can actually work with isn't that kind of cool when we do the Ln it changes from that that that U that one to that Infinity that's cool so I'm sorry to the zero I'm Miss spoke which one would we want to move here the Ln or the X let's do that so go ahead and do that how do I move it do I just move the X to the denominator what do I do okay yeah that's that's the way that we can do that can you also say x the 1 or yeah you can I do that one because it's easy for me to see the limit of that sometimes I see X to ne1 oh that's hard for me to think I can do that again but you can yeah you can do that so let's make sure that we we actually have an indeterminant form we already figured out that this one's zero let's look at this one remember the zero came from here that's that's that's Infinity time Z so if I move an Infinity to a denominator the infinity changes from Infinity to another Z that's zero now I got zero over do you guys see the zero over zero yeah this is zero it's one Ln of one is zero over zero hey what can I do every time I get Z over zero why don't you go ahead and work on LS this is going to be a little interesting okay a lot of stuff going on here the denominator fairly straightforward we actually already did that one in one of the previous examples so when I have 1/x of course that's really x 1 as you said bring down the 1 subtract one from it put over the1 over the denominator of X2 you guys okay with the- 1/x^2 yes have you guys finished this one yes okay so derivative of Ln says hey one over the inside where you're not changing anything no problem one over the inside times the derivative of the now let's look at the derivative of the the derivative of 1 - one I haven't done this in a while but it's kind of nice so one over the inside times derivative of inside I want you to see what happens here so e limit X approaches Infinity we've got -1 /x^2 we''ve got 1 over 1 - 1X times what's the derivative of one what's the derivative of One X so if I have minus a negative that's going to become so this whole thing gives us 1 /x^2 hopefully you understand why the same reason this gives you 1x^2 we have minus a negative so basically it's 0 minus negative like that that's really the derivative der of 1 is z minus minus D of this thing hey it's the same it's 1x^2 so be okay with that one so what they gives us in the long run is positive and they cancel positive 1 x s okay cool theat probably simp probably simplify it I probably deal with this maybe do youall see that that's going to distribute across that denominator so we'll get big fraction 1 over looks like we get x^2 - x X2 there are other ways to do this by the way I'm just showing you one so x^2 - x this is -1x squ all right that looks a little better at least we have fraction over fraction we know that when we have a complex fraction like this instead of having the division we can always multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator all right well that's e man just some algebra now one over tell you what I'm going to do now what what am I going to do that factor out X I'm going to factor x that's right x * x -1 and I'm going to have x^2 over 1 division is the same thing as multiplication by the reciprocal so I'm going to reciprocate now I'm going to simplify what simplifies here and okay so this thing's completely gone this thing's almost gone and let's rewrite it let's see what we got remember the idea is do lal's rule simplify it rewrite it and then reevaluate what's on our numerator oh x x denominator I've got X okay check it out we're going to re-evaluate right now so take our Infinity plug it back in this is what we do every time right every single time we reevaluate hey what's uh Negative X is X approach to Infinity infity this is negative Infinity that's right what's this as X approaches Infinity okay what's infinity minus one like little kids I'm better than you by Infinity I'm better than you by infinity plus one okay that's still Infinity that counts it's an Infinity over an Infinity what are you going to do now and that's should answer your question can you do it more than once of course you can anytime you have listen just because it has an e on it it doesn't matter it's still a limit right it still falls into the whole idea of if it's Infinity over infinity do a littley talls with it so we've got e to the limit of x approaching Infinity uh everybody derivative oh this is so nice goodness gracious how much is that over so this is going to equal e to the1 or Z so we our final answer you want to be in the notation of that whatever answer this is literally exactly what you have every single step this is what you should have so you should have writing it as uh e with your your function of X moving forward than Ln you should be showing me all this work you should be showing me this stuff our simplification getting down to here then you go okay uh this right here this is still you write a limit because when you do the lital rule that's your your resultant of that this is your derivative it is negative one the derivative of this is one and then you go well hey a derivative sorry a liit of a constant is the constant so no big deal it just happens to be that limit of1 is1 e to the1 just want to read that's it sure feel okay with that does it make sense this whole idea that's kind of a tough one right there's a lot going on on that problem but do you have any questions at all question on the second Arrow right here can you just like 1/x^2 over the one overx can you just cross like cancel those both out cuz they're products of each other these ones yeah yeah you could do that that's what I said there's a couple different ways that you can can actually do this uh that would work out I I think the same actually might be even a little bit better cuz if you did this multiply by the reciprocal these are gone this thing right here this becomes negative this thing right here is zero right 1 0 is one you just get negative 1 so yeah same thing I did want to show you this way that way you understand because we had a question earlier uh can you do a lowol rule again even if you have an e the answer is yes in this case you do in the other case you wouldn't have to just like we had over here could you have yes did we have to no so we probably could have made this a little bit easier absolutely uh but there's multiple ways to to do these um my suggestion would be simplify as much as you can I probably didn't do that um here probably could have simplified that and made it just a little bit quicker we okay with that one yes sir this would be a great time for questions are there any other questions at all so do you know what I mean by indeterminate form of limits indeterminate forms of limits what are you try what's your goal what are you trying to get once you get Z over zero or Infinity over infinity what do you use that's right that makes that makes these limits so much easier than any other way that we have okay that lit's rule is lal's Rule a quotient rule oh my goodness that'd be harder this is just derivative of the numerator over derivative of the denominator we look at the comparison of the derivatives of the functions rather than the comparison of the function themselves and limits end up being the same [Music] um last thing are you okay that we can always do e to the L of a function and it's still exactly the same okay that's the idea well we always see it not
