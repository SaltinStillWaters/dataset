Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 9.3:  Using the Integral Test for Convergence/Divergence of Series, P-Series
okay so the integral test has one idea it says can we use integrals to test for convergence or Divergence of a series and the answer is yeah yeah we can here's what's interesting uh when you think about what an integral is the integral adds up little rectangles of area don't it add stuff up well what's a series do it adds stuff up so we're going to add up areas and pretend they're like terms of our sequence that's kind of ter yeah terms of our sequence and if you add up the terms of our sequence we have a series if you add up little area rectangles well that's an integral that's what that means so we're going to use an integral to say whether or not our series is going to a finite number or whether our series is going to an infinity or whether it diverges so we pretend that our sequence is a function now I'm going to use X is in just a little bit I'm going just kind of give you the brief outline here so we let our our sequence so the terms of our series that's our sequence we let our sequence be represented by some function we say if F of n is continuous it's got to be continuous you can't have any breaks can't go to Infinity like like this can't do that it's got to be continuous it's got to be positive and it must be decreasing but if the function that we're using to represent the sequence from where we're getting our series is continuous if it's positive and if it's decreasing then we can use that integral to show convergence or Divergence of our Series so basically then this and this this is where I'm making a little jump here so uh I know I said f of n because it's based in terms of n but really this would be function in terms of X okay just like we did before um I forget what we did with that was the we used a function in terms of X with a with a sequence before we're going to do basically the same thing here we say hey if this is true if this function is continuous positive and decreasing then this series of a subn and this integral of f ofx from 1 to Infinity notice we start in one we're start in one going to Infinity going to Infinity then this integral will have either the same we'll have the same result they will both converge or they both diverge but either way they will have the same result so practically what we're doing is we're checking our integral to find out something about our series which is a really nice idea again the the the really basic idea is well um integrals add up stuff right series add up stuff let's just model our integral after our series and add the stuff up yeah we're not adding up everything in between because we're not talking about real numbers with our series we're talking about just positive integers but the idea is the same um one more thing about this is the idea is the same because I'll get to in a minute um another idea practically what's happening is that our integral is acting as an upper Bound for our series that's practically what's happening if we know that our integral is going like this so we can find the sum of this and it's a finite number then naturally if this is an upper Bound for our series our series is going to have to fit somewhere under here right or or or on it it doesn't really matter but if our if our integral is an upper bound and that integral goes converges goes to an actual number well then our series must also the integral a is an upper Bound for our series if it's continuous positive and decreasing so fans you understand the concept behind this okay now a couple key notes that I want to tell you about first key note this will tell you about convergence and Divergence if this is true if this if you can make this happen it will tell you about convergence or Divergence but it will not necessarily give you the sum so if you do the integral and the integral equals some number you go hey hey it converges that's great is the number converges to the sum of your series no it's not it just tells you that the series also converges but it doesn't tell you what the sum is does is are you very clear on that okay so this will tell convergence or Divergence but does not necessarily give the sum of this series secondly say what it sometimes can be the sun sometimes but not necessary so what is kind of cool and we get this from this we can sometimes cheat at this a little bit um you see convergence or Divergence is not affected by the addition or subtraction of a finite number of terms of your Series so if I take out the first few terms or add to it some terms in the middle convergence is not affected towards Infinity as long as it's a finite number of terms I can't add an infinite number but if I say let's add five terms or let's subtract the first 10 terms the sum would be different are you listening the sum would be different because obviously I'm adding or subtracting yes it's going to be a little different but the convergence will not be different and since this doesn't tell us about the sum anyway who cares it's going to tell us whether it converges or diverges not telling us some anyway so whether we subtract or add a few terms uh to to tell us whether we can go to the right tell whether our our integral is going to converge or not to tell us whether our series converges or not that's what we're looking at so we can sometimes cheat at this because convergence is not affected by the addition or subtraction of a finite number of terms of our series so basically here's what this is saying it says we can judge the convergence of this series with this series here's what I'm talking about um so hopefully you understand this let's say that the first few terms of this series are you listening first few terms of this series don't really mesh up real well with our integral okay we got a problem there something I don't know uh just because of continuity or positive or decreasing whatever specifically like the decreasing part is what we we go with typically the continuity is our problem with our interval typically the uh if it was our series wouldn't happen because if we had that issue if we had a discontinuity here we'd probably have a discontinuity somewhere in our series those terms W even make sense but usually for us it's going to be decreasing sometimes this this decreasing idea doesn't work so well with these exact terms so we say well let's forget the first few maybe we don't start at one maybe we start at n here's what this is saying folks it says I don't care how many terms you subract you can't subtract all of them okay but if you subtract a finite number of terms say I don't want to start at the first term I want to start at the third term I don't want to start the first ter I start at the seventh term I want start at the first ter I start the whatever the nth term big what that says is that yes the sum will be different the sum will be different don't care about that it's not going to give us a sum anyway but the convergence or Divergence will not be different does that make sense to you this is the idea some will be different the SU some will be different but the convergence will not so if our integral is affected by this we go man those terms aren't so great let's make it start a certain place therefore we can start our integral a certain place and tell us something about our original series this is the plan you guys want to see the plan in action you want some examples does this make sense to you the theory behind it it's kind of interesting right let's do a couple real fast ones just to get our feet wet okay one more recommendation I know I've said this before but I'm going to say it again and again please do not forget about the Divergence test now none of these for us are going to be Divergent uh by the Divergence test because that's too easy for us at this point but don't forget about that because on a test or a quiz or your homework or something you look at that you go okay the first thing I'm doing first thing we're off the bat I'm taking the limit of this if the limit of this as n approaches to Infinity does not equal zero what do I know about the series it's diverent don't even have to worry about it there's not going to be a sum don't have to worry about the integral because it's Divergent already here so we take the limit is the limit of 1 n^2 + 1 equal to zero yes so it says we're we're we're sure well we're not sure whether it's convergent or Divergent but it fails the Divergence test it's it's not Divergent by the Divergence test it might be Divergent some other way but not by that does that make sense do we know it's convergent no we don't know that it's basically inconclusive so here's what we do first thing is okay well um it's not telescoping can't Factor it so it's not definitely not that we can't break that up then we try the integral test because you know what I see I see let's look at FX = 1x^2 + 1 I'm not using n uh I know I did up here but I'm not using n I'm using the function in terms of X because what we're doing is we're modeling this function after this sequence and we're saying okay basically every term of this sequence is in here somewhere a lot more terms besides these terms are in here yes but at least this contains all of these terms does that make sense to you so we're going to say if this contains all these terms this will act as an upper Bound for the sequence provided it is positive provided it is continuous provided it is decreasing so let's think about this is this always positive absolutely it's x + 1 so this is positive is it continuous yes since it's always positive well yeah it's it's actually always continuous oh but wait one thing um do we have to be continuous everywhere we actually only have to be continuous on that interval right there so it's continuous yeah is it decreasing what keeps getting smaller it does keep getting smaller because this is a constant isn't it so constant by something that's going 1 2 3 4 5 it's decreasing obviously decreasing now we're going to State this on the interval 1 to Infinity because we don't care about anything else we don't care about anything else because what we're trying to do is model this function on this series this series starts at Hey where's the series start at so as long as this function is positive continuous and and decreasing on one to Infinity we are good to go show fany understand that concept okay so even if this had been like um oh man this is going to change something a little bit minus one I'll show you something here real quick is this positive not all the time yeah if it is it positive on one to Infinity no not CU you plug in 1.1 it's positive is it continuous no not at one so what you do is you go hey can I subtract a finite number of terms heck yeah let's start at two there you go is it positive continuous and decreasing done okay so we can do things like this now we're not there yet we're going to get there in the next couple examples so the next idea is shoot if you know how to model this series on a function and you know it's positive continuous and decreasing do you need to check for this every time you certainly do and you have to show each one of them some are obvious this is obviously positive obviously continuous and obviously decreasing okay then when we say is then this series and this integral from where to where of 1x^2 + 1 DX these two things because of this statement these two things will either both converge or they will both diverge that's what this says if this diverges this diverges if this converges this converges do I know the sum no but it converges don't know what two but it converges do you see it that's why we did last chapter what is that oh no no no no no it's improper inter it's an improper integral which you must show me appropiately how you solve you remember thing about appropri integrals that's an infinite interval one to Infinity we say hey B goes to Infinity take a limit of that no problem do we know how to do the integral of 1x^2 how much is the integral of 1x2 + 1 it's tan inverse if you didn't know that you could do your triangle x^2 + 1 you could do your X over one hey tangent look at that tangent you have a secant squar in there somewhere it simplifies get the integral of one that integral of one would be Theta Theta would be tan inverse of X so this right and look you can look that up for our I've done that example several times so look that up in the video or in your notes this right here is the limit as B approaches Infinity of tan inverse X from 1 to B integral of this is 10 inverse X going from 1 to B no problem we have a limit still yeah of course we have a limit still what's the next step what are we going to do evaluate it it sure we got 10 inverse of B minus tan inverse of 1 now you better be able to tell me what tan inverse of B and what tan inverse of one are you might want to have your your unit circle out or have something out that lets you see this pretty easy for me it's not a big deal because well of course you know I know this in my head if you don't know in your head have a little cheat sheet when you're doing some of these problems especially with our tangent so let's think about tan inverse of b as B goes to Infinity tan inverse looks like this tan inverse looks like that where you have a horizontal ASM toote here at pi over 2 and a horizontal as here/ 2 so this is 2 as tan inverse approaches I sorry as B approaches Infinity tan inverse of B approaches p 2 minus tan inverse of 1 it's 4 because tangent of Pi 4 = 1 tan inverse of 1al Pi 4 equals now question did we get a number yes this limit this limit this is why the limits are important this limit tells you that the limit exists right this says the limit exists therefore this improper integral was convergent that's where we had the F that convergent the first word right the first time we had that was in improper integrals because the limit exists the integral is convergent because the integral was convergent based on this function which was positive continuous and decreasing which acted as an upper Bound for our series if this thing is convergent tell me something about our series good so both the integral and the series are convergent do I know what the sum of my series is is this the sum of my series not necessarily I don't know but we know that that series converges show fans if you understand the idea of this kind of a cool idea right let's practice a couple more examples get right into it I'll try to do as many as possible in our time allow here for you okay so I'm I'm still going to walk you through this because I know you guys are fresh fresh at this only one example so the first thing we do first thing is my goodness take a limit take a limit if the limit does not equal zero the series diverges now most of these I'm giving you here they're not going to that's not going to happen but I want you to get happen to that is the limit of this thing zero as n approaches Infinity yes it is constant over infin is infinity so the limmit is zero does that make sense that means we got to keep going with something the something here is going to be our integral test so we're going to base our function on our Series in terms of X of course then we're going to check for three things what are the three things we must check for for the integral test to work for everything or just a certain interval aha so is this positive not always not always but I don't care about that is it positive on where am I starting is it positive on this interval yes yes is it continuous on this interval notice that 1/2 would be a discontinuity does that make sense is 1/2 in my interval then I do not care is it decreasing on my interval that's a constant over a variable that is growing bigger decreasing so feel okay with that positive continuous decreasing well then what we're going to do is say since this function is positive continuous and decreasing on my interval the same interval as my series I'm going to take an integral of this the integral will act as an upper Bound for my sum my series if the integral converges this thing converges if the integral diverges this thing diverges so let's take our interval integral where's our integral start one yeah same thing as this 1 to Infinity so wherever this function is positive continuous and decreasing that's where you integrate do you guys see how many times you're going to be using limits here these are all going to be improper integrals so we're going to have a limit as B approaches Infinity from 1 to B of 3/ 2x - 1 DX oh my gosh it's an easy one tell me what we should do with integral of 3 2x -1 pull three out do do a Uub very easy if we do a Uub we're going to get U = 2x - 1 du = 2x DX sorry 2dx du over 2 = DX so long story made real short we have a limit as B approaches Infinity of 3es integral 1 over U du well that's a li um I'm going fast here is that okay with you that I'm doing these integrals really quickly yes just because well frankly I mean we should know how to do all those anyway you guys okay with this one so far we go hey you know what um 2x + one 2x - one is our U so we have three halves pull it up front integral 1 over U no problem du integral one over U is Ln absolute value of U now tell me something when I plug in my 2x - one do I need the absolute value here yes well think about my interval do I need the absolute value here no I don't what I do need to do is evaluate from one to B and then take my limit so let's do that this would be a limit as B approaches Infinity of three Hales you know what you can do you can even pull three halves all the way out front if you want to you don't even need it here a constant can be pulled out in front of a limit so let's do that let's have three Hales up front we'll have Ln of 2 B -1 minus Ln of 2 - 1 I got to make sure you guys are okay with this before we go any further are you guys okay with this one because it's always positive don't we never need the absolute values on any of them don't we never need I don't uh you know I I can't I'm not going to make an absolute statement there it's going to have to depend on what you have what if you had x's over X's I'm not sure okay I don't know how work there I'm I'm not going to make an answer I don't know what I want to know is are you okay making it this far yes this is exactly the same stuff that we've done already in this class well see what pull out three Hales of course that's you know we do that for a while so three halves out front tell me um what's 2 - one what's Ln of one what's uh B here going to Infinity what's 2 * Infinity INF Infinity minus one infity what's Ln of infinity is this integral convergent or divergent This thing is infinity minus 0 that's infity * 3 this is infinity therefore this integral is Divergent tell me something about the series is the series going to be divergent or convergent this is interesting because I said the integral X is an upper bound it also acts as a lower bound it acts as a bound so the integral is the Bound for our our series it's either an upper bound if it converges or a lower bound if it diverges which is really neat therefore the series also diverges and this is exactly the way you st on your homework and you test you say the integral diverges therefore the series also you don't just end it with diverges you make a statement about the series you say okay so they're both convergent or they're both diverging you say because this one diverges the other one diverges makes some sort of a statement like that so hands feel okay with with this one tell you what I'm going to talk about one more thing we're not going to finish this but I want to show you something while we're we're Super Fresh on this material Min fresh minty fresh calculus fresh aqua [Applause] fresh Okay so this is the first time we've had an N function over an N well not function but an N over an N the first thing you would do here check your limit now if you did lows you're going to find out that this limit does equal zero but you would check by the Divergence test first are you with me on that one always check that secondly you go okay well you know what I know that this series if I model this function after that that sequence after the sequence and I determine that the integral of this function is convergent the series convergent Divergent the series Divergent as long as this is positive continuous and decreasing now let's talk about those three things and then we'll end for today okay uh so is this positive should be X oh I'm sorry thank you yeah good yeah my bad good save good catch not M crush anymore tepid and rancid whatever uh FX Ln X over X is is it positive yes is it always positive no no is it positive on this interval yes yes after one Ln of one is zero after that it's positive over something that's always positive after one you'd have something that is positive is it continuous the only discontinuity here would exist at x equals what it would be discontinuous for both of them actually after that it's continuous is is it decreasing this is not an obvious one obviously decre here obviously decreasing that's a constant that's over number that's growing that's decreasing this one not so obvious this time you're going to have to check for decreasing so here's our check for decreasing you must show these things show decreasing how I would show decreasing with a function man I would take the derivative of that function do you remember doing that now we just did that stuff right to show that this is decreasing if it's decreasing the the derivative has to be negative decreasing means the derivative is negative so if we do the derivative it's low D High minus high D low Square the bottom and away we go so our first derivative is 1 - Ln x^2 you guys okay with that so far well here's the whole thing we're trying to show decreasing correct we're trying to show when this thing is less than or equal to zero that's what we're trying to show now here's the whole point is X2 ever negative then this will only be negative when 1 - lnx is negative this happens when this happens you guys okay with that one yes no are you sure yes yes yes yes no okay if I solve for this I get 1 is less than or equal to Ln X that's not good enough I want to solve for x well if I take both sides as an exponent of e e to the first would be less than x e the L and X is X so take e on both sides don't take e that's bad for me uh but put e on both sides this is X B here's what this says to me and hopefully to you what it says is that this function is certainly positive it's certainly continuous it will be decreasing as long as X is bigger than or equal to e how much is e 2.7 then what if I made this three if I said this is decreasing on 3 to Infinity would it be true yes if it takes X being bigger than or equal to e to be decreasing then this the function will certainly be then f ofx is certainly decreasing on three to Infinity because 3 is bigger than e it said X has to be bigger than e well 3 is bigger than that therefore this is also decreasing on the interval from 3 to Infinity so our integral where's our integral I'll see if you can put all together where's our integral going to start three three not one it's not decreasing there but just start at three this was the um this is the first thing that we talked about one of those notes it said that I can subtract a finite number of terms listen carefully the last little bit okay I can subract a finite number of terms I'm subtracting the first term and the second term I'm starting at the thir third term I don't want to start at e okay I want to make this an actual integer that matches up with our series I'm going to start it at three so check positive check continuous you guys okay with the decreasing part of this derivatives have to be less than zero for decreasing so show it hey look it this would be less than zero when this happens or when this happens take e on both sides when this happens X has to be bigger than e make it three three is Speaker than e therefore this will be positive no problem continuous and decreasing on 3 to Infinity starts your integral at three we'll finish it up next time so we're going to finish up this problem so if you were with us last time what you saw was whenever we have these series and we can determine that our function that's based on our series is positive continuous and decreasing we can take integral of that function and what that function does it stands for a lower Bound for Divergence or an upper Bound for convergence basically it says that uh every term of this sequence from which our series is built is found in this function therefore if the integral of this function remember integral means add up stuff if the integral of this function diverges means the sum or a series is also going to diverge if the integral converges means the sum of the series is also going to converge that's the idea that we have now does the integral necessarily tell us the sum of of our series no it doesn't give us the sum it just tells us whether it will have a convergent sum or a Divergent sum that's basically idea so what we've done here so far is said all right let's call this function lnx overx we've modeled it on our sequence we've determined hopefully obviously to you it is of course positive it's definitely positive that's positive and that's positive after one therefore positive over positive gives us a positive it's definitely positive after one it's continuous the only problem we would ever have is at zero since zero is outside of our inter interval from 1 to Infinity no problem the problem we came across with this problem was the decreasing how we show decreasing often times with our functions take a derivative if a derivative is less than zero if a derivative is negative that means that our function is decreasing if a derivative is positive that means our function is increasing for a given interval what we're trying to show is that this function is always decreasing does that make sense to you so we take a derivative our derivative you should know how to do that we say okay when is this derivative going to be less than zero well this derivative is less than zero when the numerator is less than zero you see the denominator is always positive so it can't change your sign so it's always the numerator less than zero for this example no problem well if the numerator has to be less than zero for a derivative to be less than zero that means that one's got to be less than Ln X if I take e both these sides as an exponent upon e I'm going to get e to the first is less than e to lnx no problem what that basically says is that is this the derivative of our function will be negative when X is greater than or equal to e that's the idea does that make sense to you so basically it says our function is decreasing everywhere after xal e that's what it says well then what we're going to do is we're going to pick some number after this after e well what's slightly bigger than e three three is we're say well you know what tell you what did you follow this logic down by the way yeah decreasing means less than zero that means this would have to be less than zero that means this would have to happen this would have to happen and X would have to be bigger than e that's what that says well Pick X = 3 and then we know for sure that our function will be decreasing at xal 3 and further all the way to Infinity show fans if you if that makes sense to you now the re why we're allowed to do this I gave you the statement last time you can actually add or subtract a finite number of terms from your series and that the resultant of convergence or Divergence will not change so I know that our series where's our Series start where's our integral going to start that's two terms difference actually so we would ignore the first term and the second term and start of the third term is the sum going to be the same no it's going to be different who cares it's not going to give us the sum anyway so it's just going to tell us well if I subtract a finite number of terms who cares it's going to give us whether this this series is convergent or Divergent anyway does that make sense to you I think I explained last time but I wanted to make sure that you guys actually got to it so we check positive easy check continuous easy on this interval on one to Infinity that's both positive and continuous good to go decreasing take a first derivative work it down find out what x has to be for this function to be decreasing for us it's anything bigger than e well 3 is bigger than e so let's make our intergral from 3 to Infinity now what that says is that the integral of this function will have the same result as the series does either both will be convergent or both will be Divergent so we just got to do this integral fortunately for us man it looks so familiar we've done that that's an improper integral so what's our first step with an improper integral please Li from what from 3 integral from 3 to B lnx X DX now of course we're kind of past the whole integration phase of this class we're still going to use it but these are going to be quite a bit simpler than what you're used to so think easy on these things right now how would I do this you what's our sub y du = 1X DX do you see it it's right there this is X therefore we have a limit as B approaches Infinity the integral from 3 to B of well since I do my substitution U equal Ln X so I'm going to have U du is 1/x DX so du is this piece well that was pretty pretty painless that means we're going to get L limit of u² over 2 as B goes to Infinity from 3 to B so fancy feels so far so good on this thing now there's one little issue what's the little issue that we have bounds are different from our variable right now and since we haven't changed bounds what we're going to have to do is we're going have to resubstitute back in so instead of having u^2 over two we're going to make this the limit as V approaches Infinity of2 uh what was our U anyway and take that from one to B sorry 3 to B my you all okay with that so far cool let's go for it is any of this hard for you at this point no we know how to do simple inter it's not a problem we know how to evaluate so when we do this we're going to have a limit B goes to infinity looks like it'll be 1 12 lnb sarus 12 Ln 3 squ can you please tell me what's going to happen what's going to happen with this limit what is um what's ln3 no idea but this is going to be some sort of constant isn't it so this is going to be some constant how much is Ln b as B approaches in remember B is approaching Infinity how much is Ln B what's infinity s still infinity infinity minus a constant tell me something about this integral is it is this improper integral convergent or Divergent why toity the limit goes to Infinity therefore this integral is Divergent so or the integral diverges now what we said was because this function is modeling this series it contains every term of our sequence and it's adding stuff together just like our our our series would do a series adds the terms well the function basically adds up areas basically the same thing since this is modeling this it's an upper Bound for convergence it's a lower Bound for Divergence what that means that is if our limit of our integral basically if our improper integral diverges tell me something about our series yeah you have to say that okay you don't just leave it diverg it done you say so because the integral the improper integral diverges the the series also diverges so we say so series of lnn /n also diverges quick show hands feel okay with with the so far all right well tell you what we got a little bit left to do in this section I'm going to go through what what what called what is called the P series uh go through that one I'll do one more example of this very similar to this problem just to get our our brains wrapped around one less time and then we're basically done with our section so last little bit we get to talk about is something called the P series here's what the P series stems from it says suppose you got a series suppose it starts at 1 to infinity and it's 1/ n to the P where P does not change the N is what changes I want you to think about what this would look like okay let's think about the first few terms just to get our headr around what what the world the P Series so notice n's our Index right n is what's changing so would the P change no no the p is going be something like two three four whatever uh P's going to be a some sort of a positive number not equal to one well it could be one but then we have something that's not very interesting so here's what happens actually is interesting it's just something we've already covered I should say it that way here's what happens if I plug in one I'm going to have one over what what is n one what's one to any power one excuse me hope I didn't blow the speakers out on people's computers that was loud well if p is a power hey P power cool if p is a power then I'm basically taking one over one to the whatever power it's going to be one do you see that so I'm going to get one for my first term next I'd get one over what would my NB two what would my P be I don't know it'd be whatever I tell you it is it's going to be two to the P plus one over what's the next one going to be 3 to the what the is the P changing no it's going to be whatever's defined in your Series 3 to p + 1 4 to P plus forever that's what a p series does it's basically taking your n and raising it to some power over under one one over whatever that happens to be you guys okay with the idea of a p series now we're going to talk about when this converges and when this diverges and basically we have everything in hand to do that so this will always converge when something happens and it will diverge when something happens it's not going to be based on the N this time because n is going to go through its its sequence of numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 it's going to be based on the P so can you tell me let's let's talk about the Divergence first can you tell me when this series would diverge what do you think when p is neg you're right when p is NE there's also one more thing one what about one one now now listen carefully if p is 1 if p is 1 we would get 1 + 12 you know WR over here when p is 1 we would get 1 + 12 + 1/3 + 1/4 are you seeing where these numbers come from yeah tell me what series that is you should know that's harmonic series very good is the harmonic series convergent or Divergent diver diver very good so what we know is that it's not only negatives but it's actually anything less than one anything less than or including 1 does that make sense to you this is a harmonic Series so when P equals 1 it's Divergent if p is less than 1 if p is less than one well the Divergence test will actually show that to you if p is less than one imagine this this is actually we for both but if you take a limit of 1/ n the p as n approaches Infinity if you do that and P is less than one we're going to get something that's Divergent for sure now when will this converge when p is when p is greater than one you can think about this if p is greater than one then 1/ n p if you model this with the function if p is greater than one this is positive yes any positive number ra to any power should be positive this is continuous and is never zero it's also decreasing on the interval 1 to Infinity because this will give you positive continuous and decreasing we basically I'm kind of skipping a step here okay you'd model this on the function of x to the P FAL x to the P this would be positive continuous and decreasing if that's the case sorry I'm trying to go faster than I really should we'd model this on FX = 1X p and if we did that this is positive this is continuous this is decreasing therefore by the integral test also all the the integral this thing is always going to be uh we're going to find something that that converges integral test is going to tell us this is also convergent so because of this so here's the thing one more time if you have your p as less than or equal to one if you have your p as less than or equal to one what do you know about your P series harmonic series or anything lower than that for for power is going to diverge if you have your P greater than one not equal to one one's over here okay if you ever P greater than one what do you know about it it's got to because any sort of a function like this where p is more than one your integral from 1 to Infinity of 1x P DX it's going to converge you can do the limit on that if you want to uh you do a li from you do a limit uh of whatever your integral says from 1 to B 1X to P DX if p is greater than 1 this becomes a pretty easy integral to do this would be like x to the -2 or x to the 3 or X to the4 are you with me on this one whatever's going to happen is you would add one to your power that would give you at most x to the 1 if you add one to your power does that make sense to you because you you'd have at least x to the 2 there well that's not quite true you could do this with decimals as well but you'd have something that would still be a negative exponent does that make sense that would be one over infinity when you plugged in that b one over infinity gives you that 0 plus whatever constant you have that's going to be convergent so we have something that is convergent here show hands if that made sense so you feel okay with it okay so P series diver p is less than equal to one p series converg p is greater than one by our integral test and you can do this in general when p is greater than one now let me show you how this works and how nice this is trust me you're going to like this here's why you're going to like it I want you to consider that series firstly is that a specific type of series that you know yes yes is it geometric no it's not geometric but we have lots of different types of series here is it a piece Series yeah very good hey what's the p is two more than one yes tell me about the series am so you have to State something like this you say okay this is a p series the p is 2 which is greater than one therefore this series converges do I know what the sum is no do I know what converges yep that's what a asking here so depend if you if you like that stuff huh don't you like that let give me 30 of these on the test huh 100% 100% we'll kick some calculas in this [Music] class okaying now you tell me what type of series was that it's still a p series now you might want to write it as a p Series so how in the world is that a p series well it's a series N 1 to Infinity 1 / n to the every type of root is automatically a power this is a power so we say this is a p series p is equal to what's our P now remember this is not zero it's not talking about ative of course every negative p is going to give us a Divergent uh series here but it's not zero it's less than one so even if we get something like 1/3 what's that tell us about our series here this is less than one or equal to one you can put that too less than or equal to one therefore this series diverges is this making sense to you yes kind of nice little break from doing all the other stuff right okay we'll do uh we'll do one more true or false this is a p series true or false false true or false that's a p series but wait a minute it's not one over something power you better be smart enough to do that right okay so if you have a if you got a negative power you need to understand that this is the same thing as 1/ n to the positive Pi power that's a weird power but I didn't say anything about P being an integer I didn't say anything about that all I said was P was a power p is an exponent if p is less than or equal to one your P series diverges if p is more than one your P series converges so is this a p series yes it is you might want to write it as such so it's a p series the p is what's the p yeah Pi is about 3.1415926 something whatever I don't know the rest of them uh but what I'm asking is is that bigger than one or is that less than one that's more than one so what does our P series say about that because we've done this in general or p is anything bigger than one we can say that all the time we don't have to reinvent the wheel and prove it every time we know that if p is less than equal to one that series is going to diverge if p is more than one that series is going to converge you better make darn sure that it actually is a p series though okay so spend some time really think about it but if it is goodness gracious isn't that nice so if you don't recognize the P series you have a lot of lot more work that you're going to have to do right you do the integral test with this when you don't actually have to we've done the integral test basically once and for all for this this is what we why we talked about this stuff if you didn't catch that go back and Rewind it or or watch this video watch the video again or something to catch that the P series P series here really is an integral test over and over and over and over and over and over and over again that's all it is if you have any P listen listen if you have any power that's less than one any power less than like 1/3 what happens is that this is this would become x to the 1/3 power correct you would add one to it on an integral that would become POS 23 power when I let B approach Infinity that is going to approach Infinity that series is going that that limit is going to diverge that means my integral diverges that means my series diverges does that make sense to you that happens anytime your p is less than or equal to one if it equals one you got L and X we already determined that well this this harmonic Series diverges so that takes care that equal to one anything less than one I'd have X to a p power if p is less than one when I add one to it X gets to a positive power does that make sense what that means is that when I evaluate my limit as B approaches Infinity that thing's going to go to Infinity that's why anytime p is less than or equal to one I get a series of diverges the opposite is true for convergence if p is more than one I would have x to the ne P correct but if p is more than one when I add one to it the power is still negative that means I have 1 over X to some power I don't care what it is when B approaches Infinity that's going to approach zero make sense then I'd have a constant or something therefore my integral would converge that's the whole idea so don't be doing integral test all this stuff it's it for sure would work absolutely but we've only done it like once and for all here so don't reinvent the wheel that's the whole point show hands if you understand the point good deal tell you what we're not going to do any more P Series this is hopefully straightforward to you I want to do one more kind of a little bit more advanced idea of um of series show you what you can and can't do with it basically dealing with a little bit more with how to show uh decreasing because the whole integral test says you got to have something that's positive you got to have something that's continuous and you have to have something that's decreasing so I want to go through one more of those and then we'll call it good on this section you guys have any questions on the P series at all that I can answer for you yeah pretty much the only qualification for that your variable has to be in your denominator just to any power it can't be like added to anything right it just has to be like you know variable to power then you use P Series in your denominator I didn't quite catch that like all right like for p series your your give me an example uh let's just say one over what let just say 1 over n to the 7th plus one you couldn't use P series on that like that yeah no it just has to be that but in the next section we're going to cheat a little bit and do it oh all right cool you want to see how sure is this for sure less than 1 n 7 it sure is yep does that converge P series if this is always less than that one tell me something about this one now converges comparison test that's the next section now so yes we are going to use the P series a lot Okie doie a lot but we're going to normally do it it's not as easy as what I gave it to you we're going to normally do it as a comparison test we're going to base our other series on something we already know about we're going to base them on geometric series we're going to base them on P series we're going to compare them to them I'll show you how to do that but first I want to do this example okay so here's how we would go through this I kind of did this for integrals for you so I'll kind of show you how to do this for series as well the thought process the thought process is the first thing you check for is the diver test that will be the first thing you check for in this case the Divergence test is going to show you because you do a couple well L TS rules there you're going to get a zero out of that then your diverence test tells you zero what's Divergence test say if it's not zero what happens if it is zero what's it say maybe be not Divergent don't know undetermined we got to figure this thing out okay so for us we already determined that next thing you check for is this a simple series is this a geometric no it's not here's how you tell is it a number raised to the N under a number raised to the N no no it's n raised to a power that's not a geometric series does that make sense geometric is a constant raised to a power this is not that and you can't make it that so no it's not geometric is it a p series no no it's got to be one over something that would be a p series there does that or a constant over something because a constant you can fold out this is not a constant does that make sense so Divergence test well it's it's it is equal to zero so it might not be Divergent get check geometric series no P series no and hopefully you just caught on how to check for that because I just explained it right now so what's our our last option for us right now well our last option is an integral test so we got to look at this thing and pretend that we get a function of X actually make a function of X that models this sequence e 1X x^2 okay in order for you to use integral test and you guys should all know this in order for you to use an integral test what must this function be on my interval for my series what must it positive very good what else Contin Andre the hardest one to show is usually decreasing decreasing positive is pretty easy to show you just go uh that's always positive because it's e to some power that's always positive because it's squared positive over positive is a positive it's definitely positive does that make sense to you continuity continuity is usually pretty easy to show this is only discontinuous at zero that's it e is continuous everywhere e to a power is always continuous how about uh X2 well it's always continuous except at zero do we ever hit zero in our interval no it's always continuous hard one here is decreasing decreasing you go I don't know how do you do how do you show increasing for a function you got to do one of two things you got to show that a subn + 1 is less than a subn which is sometimes very hard to do or you take a derivative if it's something that you can take derivative of that's probably the easy way if you have n factorials and things have do you know how to take a derivative of a factorial yeah no so you'd have to show that a subn plus 1 is less than a subn and go for that way show that it's decreasing we did that once if you remember do you remember that with SE we did it in this case because I don't have any factorials I have nothing horrible going on and I can take a derivative of this you can always show decreasing of functions by showing the derivative is what decreasing functions always have derivatives that are negative so if we can show that this is NE this derivative is negative for our interval we show that this is decreasing on the entire interval now here's here's a little Cavo I showed this before if it's not decreasing on the entire interval is there a point where is decreasing if there is a point where it's decreasing like like last time it was decreasing after e remember that if there's a point then we can subtract a finite number of terms from our series and get the same result they're both going to converge or diverge so it's just find out whether this thing is decreasing on a certain interval and that that's all about the derivative so we're going to take the derivative I'm going to do it very quickly um I know you guys know how to take derivatives so if you do the derivative remember it's not lobit talls it is a quotient rule it's low minus high D low Square the bottom away you go so low D High gives you x^2 e 1X * x² uh sorry * 1 over X2 1X s minus so that's low D High minus high D low Square the bottom and way spend some time on your own if you need to and do that derivative on your own I'm doing it really quickly of course but chain rule it work here don't forget about those chain rules we'd have low derivative of e e 1X is e 1X * 1X by the chain R keep the high one derive the low one you get 2x e the 1 over X and then Square the B so if we do this we're going to get e 1X - 2x e 1X all over x 4 let's make this a little nicer we're going to factor out NE e 1X if I factor out e 1 /x what we're left with is POS 1 + 2x can you verify that for me that if I factor out e to 1x I get pos1 + 2x can you verify that okay over x 4 tell me what we just found derives derivatives derivatives show decreasing when they are okay so what we got to ask our question is is this thing negative is this thing less than or equal to zero on my interval well let's think about it all you're trying to do is show it you're just trying to show that it is decreasing if you can't show it if it's not decreasing you can't use this stuff so hopefully it's decreasing for you let's see where does our interval start here one it starts at one is this decreasing on one well let's let's think true or false this is always positive true or false this is always positive if x is greater than or equal to one I don't care about negative numbers series doesn't start negatively starts at one so this is always positive right this is always positive yeah now think about this one is this always this without the negative is this this always positive e to any power is always positive so we got a positive we got a positive we got a posit so you're telling me for any value of x this expression will be positive correct are you sure me too because that's positive that's positive and that's positive when X is greater than one what would that do so is this always negative for X is between 1 to Infinity this is positive for xal 1 to Infinity this is positive for xal 1 to Infinity this is positive for x = 1 to Infinity therefore this whole thing is negative when x = 1 to Infinity because my first derivative is negative on this interval because my first derivative represents increasing or decreasing because my first derivative is negative on this interval it shows that it is decreasing on this interval that's the idea that's the hard part the rest of it's pretty easy so FY if you understand that part you feel okay with it can you go ahead and try to do the rest of this try to do that integral okay go for it see that you still have the chops to do integration so because this function is positive continuous and decreasing and because it's based on the sequence of our the sequence from which we get our series the integral from one Whatever interval is where it is positive continuous decreasing our interval is 1 to Infinity where that happens our integral from 1 to Infinity e to the 1 /x x^2 DX will have the same result as our series if this is convergent our series is convergent this is Divergent or series Divergent of course what we know is that this is an improper integral we must treat it as such [Music] yay did you find the appropriate substitution not so bad right not so bad it's just a substitution most of these things are going to be just substitutions for you not horrible if you do U = 1X then our integral becomes from 1 to b e to the the U now what else happens let's see if you if you did this right you guys okay with the U equals 1X reason why we see this is because the derivative of 1x is 1x^2 somehow without the constant so that derivative is up there this counts as a 1x^2 so U = 1X du is 1x2 not a problem move the negative over here netive du = 1x2 DX that is this piece right here so what is after my e cool that's about the easiest integral I can think of right there actually so this is a limit as B approaches Infinity of what is it going to be negative I like the negative what from 1 to B now there's a problem here do we want to plug in B and one right now no if you do this you're going to get a Divergent limit you're going to it's going to look like it's if you if you plug this in what's the what's the big problem with doing that these aren't in terms of U they're in terms of X actually so for us we absolutely must substitute back in before we evaluate our limit so this has to be e to 1 /x that's going to make a big difference did you catch that you got to make sure you substitute in make sure your bounds match match your variables your bounds are in terms of X which they will be your resultant from your integral better be in terms of X as well so we need to make sure we substitute back in if we've done a substitution well what that means is we got a limit as B approaches Infinity e^ 1 B minus E 1 over 1 let's see what we got personally did you get the same thing as I did good good for you that's fantastic how much does this all make this going be plus e somehow negative negative well minus negative is plus e the 1 is e how much is let's do this how much is B going towards how much is one over infinity is e to Z so this whole thing equals -1 Plus or E minus 1 now do I care that it's -1 + e or E minus1 well not so much because it doesn't necessarily give me my sum for my series but what's it tell me about this limit this limit is is equals a number doesn't equal Infinity it's not it does not exist limit it converges so what's it tell me about my series from where I got this so by the integral test this is convergent so this converges so my series also converges and that ladies and gentlemen is what the integral test does for you it will have the same the the integral if your function from where you that's based on your sequence is positive continuous and decreasing on an appropriate interval sometimes subtracting some terms sometimes not finite number terms if that limit of your improper integral converges your series converges if that limit of your improper integral diverges your series also diverges show fans if that made sense to you do you guys have any questions at all on on any this stuff yes no n s not n the N what I do n the N series your series oh cool I just like NS all right assuming all right well that's it for the that's it for theal test next thing I want to give you is the comparison test what do that next time
