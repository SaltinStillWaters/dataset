Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 10.5:  Calculus of Polar Equations
so calculus of polar [Applause] equations I want to start by looking at how to find the area Bound by a polar curve area bound bipolar curve so let's start with one so here's our polar axis here's our origin and here's the deal we know that our polar curves are given by an angle and that angle dictates what the r is so basically a polar curve can be defined arbitrarily by saying we're going to start at some angle it's called Alpha we're going to end at some angle call it beta and we have some curve R is a function of theta what we're going to try to find here is we're going to try to find the area that's Bound by this polar curve the area would be do you see where the area is going to be it's not going to be this area from the polar axis to here what the area we're looking at is it says well we're starting here aren't we we're going to here the curve is here it's this that's the area that we're looking at that's the area Bound by polar F show P if you understand the the idea of it do do these symbols make sense to you it says that we're going to start at a certain angle Alpha we're going to end like a except it's it's not uh it's not so we're going to say that this is Alpha it's angle we're going to end it another Alpha Beta no problem we're going to go along this curve r r is a function of theta and the area that's Bound by that it's kind of like a cone but it depends on this curve you see you see the cone I'm talking about actually it's more like a sector we're going to talk about that in a second so here it is how we find the area I'm just going to give it to you and you're going to see why it's going to be very straightforward right now here it is now uh these functions are they based on X are they based on y they're based on so when we integrate remember the area is always an integral type of idea so we're going to integral says we're adding up a whole bunch of slices of stuff we're going to talk about what slices we're adding up in just a second I'm not going to prove it for you uh because I think I can just explain it well enough if you remember anything about calculus one when you do integrals uh the Ron sums that you added up they were little slices little rectangles remember that add up an infinite number of them we're going do the same idea that's what integral does it adds stuff so here's what we're going to add we're going to say well where do we want to start if it's not X and Y we got to start at some Alpha so we're going to start here we're going to end at beta and we're going to have here's what we're going to have if you think about this what we're really doing is we're finding the area of a little teeny sector the area of a sector is given by this if you seen that before that's the area of a sector it's 12 R 2 theet you can look it up it's formul I'm not going to go through the proof of that formula all right that's the area of a sector it says take half the radius squared and then multiply by whatever angle you have well here's what we're going to do okay are you listening now R is a function of theta isn't it so for us it says what we're going to do is we're going to take a whole we're going to take a real teeny little sector of this thing a teeny little one and then we're find the next one and the next one and the next one and the next one we're going to allow that distance that angle the distance of the angle between them to go to zero uh and if that's the case we're going to have an infinite number of teeny little sectors that we're going to add up so when we're saying we're starting Alpha you're going to have all these sectors starting at Alpha adding up to Beta and we're going to say all right cool well uh we're going to have the 1/2 we're going to have a function we're going to let R change based on Theta R is a function of theta but then we're going to integrate with respect to to Theta and the reason why we integrate with respect to that variable is because when you integrate that like a DX that's saying that DX the distance between the X values are like infinitesimally small giving you an infinite number of rectangles when you do a basic area for us it says we're going to do D Theta saying that our angle is infinitesimally small we're adding up an infinite number of little sectors we're letting the the angle change little by little by little by little by little so fany you understand the the idea there so where's this coming from chirp chirp little crickets where's that coming from area of a sector you guys see the area of a sector I'm trying to show you here this is the area of a sector you're just allowing the angle to change that's all you're doing here make sense it's cutting this into really little teeny sectors adding up the sectors from alpha to Beta so this is adding up remember the integral it's like an S uh comes from a summation notation so the integral is we're adding up all the Teeny sectors teeny sectors here see it teeny teeny sectors adding from alpha to Beta that's what it means so let's do an example real quick to to illustrate this it's better to know where the formulas came from than to not know so I want to find the area Bound by R2 = 4 cosine 2 th before you say what in the heck is that I need know where to go we've seen this before in fact in the last section we graphed that it didn't look exactly like this it looked like this it looked like Ral Square messed up already it look like this R = 2 cine 2 is that ringing a bell at all yeah that was the last example that we grabed all right so what this graph looks like and you could probably just see it if you thought about here if I plug in zero look at this if I plug in zero it's two * Z okay good and thenine z and then 1 * 4 take square root two our squar so if I if I do angle of zero I got two remember that at all yes and I plugged in uh 2 2 again 2 cos 2 0 * 4 R 2 Ral so we got to here and we we learned about the Symmetry we learned that anything past P or four was undefined you remember that so we said okay well that can happen so what we got really was this this shape that did this well that's pretty good for me make the points bigger appla I know right that's pretty good just don't don't look at that one well here's the deal if we know that's what that looks like and we know about the CM I'm not going to reinvent the wheel okay if you want to figure out how to actually graph that thing well you'd watch the last section okay cuz the we've we've already done this we knew it was symmetric about the polar axis we know it's symmetric about the Theta 2 AIS you with me so let's think about this when we plugged Ina = 0 it gave us 2 when we plugged in Theta = 4 it gave us zero does that make sense so our angle our angles go from Z to Pi 4 and it gives us this little Lo right here gives us that Lo now let's use that to our advantage if we use it to our advantage well let's set this thing up I want to find the area Bound by this curve what that means is all of this stuff do you understand it does it does not look like it from my picture but you get that this and this and this and this are all the same area yes how many pieces are there four so if we integrate from zero where do I want to go zero to where pi over four 4 Moves me from here to here that's where I want to go so if I did 0 power 4 how many pieces is this going to give me from 0 to Pi 4 four no from 0 to Pi 4 it's giving me just this piece what do I have to do to make all of it multiply it by four sure ADV if you understand that that concept are you sure yes no yes okay so we said I know from from probably the previous sections how you'd graph this you know you go back there you figure out how to graph it I did it very fast here uh because for the sake of time we know that at Theta equal 0 I get two so I'm starting here at Theta = pi over 4 I was at zero so from 0 to pi over 4 I get this little load If I multiply 1 2 3 4 just go from 0 to Pi 4 I'm going to have the whole entire area of that shape you get me now use the formula what's our formula to start2 very good and then R now be smart about this look it we already have r s so if this is r s I'm just going to have four cosine 2 th uh see if you're really just paying attention should I square that yes or no no because this is R 2 and then D Theta wrap that thing up with d Theta show guys feel okay with with that one okay let's make this thing what are we going to do probably take the 1/2 out also going to take the four * 12 * 4 is we going to get 8 8 integral 0 to Pi 4 cine 2 oh my gosh have you done stuff like this in this class yeah we covered chapter seven yay you know how to do integrals of trigonometric functions do it what would you use for that is it a hard one no it's an easy one what would you use what would you use substitution good yeah a u substitution is what you would use yeah you do it in fact I'd probably do it in my head because at this point you probably can do that so when I would do this one I'd say okay here's my eight the integral of cosine is s not negative sign verifi that sign of whatever's under my hand divided by the derivative of whatever's under my hand which is just two the two goes on the denom do you understand that a Uub says hey uh take the derivative of that and divide by it that's that's basically what we're doing here what now simp yeah let's simplify okay so we're going to have four S 2 th and now what yeah let's go for go for valuation 0 to 4 can you plug that in hello yes no that should be pretty easy so we're going to have 4 * s of 2 * 4us 4 * S 2 * of 2 * 0 well that should be pretty straightforward uh what's 2 * 4 good what's s of / 2 and 1 * 4 is what's s of zero so this whole thing goes to zero this thing goes to one we get four * 1 well it's really really interesting the area that's Bound by this polar equation this polar curve is equal to does that blow your mind that it's not some random weird decimal that doesn't end that area is four that's crazy what's the area of one of these things one yeah 1 two 3 four that's neat show P if you understand that one okay tell you what let's do one more we need just do as many as we can so area by r = 1 + cine th we've seen that several times now what is that the butt come on I should have said that to you what is that cardid it's cardioid that's right so you said it was facing up cuz it's pluses first I said a heart you said a butt like the butt on the top or on the bottom this is sideways this is the laying down this one is this one the spooning one whatever it was this one mine looks  but it's okay that one okay that's that one I think I threw it backwards a little while ago did I yeah yeah I did draw it backwards oh shame on me darn it oh well do really matter that you uh so that's a cardio that makes a lot more sense for our slope anyway whatever so let's find the area Bound by this cardioid now there's two ways that you can do this firstly do you understand the cardioid is symmetrical so if I make sure I get it right my dyslexia is kicking in if I have that if I have that that point is at Theta equal 0 and this point is at Theta equal Pi Pi that's right so I can do this one of two ways the first way I could set this up up we could set up the integral from we could do it from 0 to 2 pi that would actually work so if you want to go from 0 to 2 pi that's fine let's set up that way first so if I went from 0 to 2 pi that would be the entire region all at once are you listening all at once let's do the uh the formula what would be inside of there okay the 1/2 is there very good and then what 1 where are we getting the 1 plus cosine Theta from R R uhhuh square oh why do we have to square it R is not Square okay very good so this is 12 r squar d thet show F feel okay with with that one now if you work this out you're going to get exactly the same answer as if you were to do this one so let's let's change our our thought process a little bit let's say that I don't want to figure out the whole thing at once I just want to figure out this one do I still go from 0 to 2 pi no no where do I go from and then what do I do multip two ah so that is another option that you could do there there's a couple ways to do this because there's a lot of symmetry involved in these polar equations so fans you can understand that that idea so two different ways does it matter does not matter in this example I would use a symmetry because I like smaller bounds but it does not really matter so let's go ahead and let's go through this um you want to do it this way so maybe you don't have to deal with a fraction 2 * 1 12 no problem so our area is 0 to Pi 2 and 1/2 are gone you're going to have to distribute that so we're going to have 1 + 2 cosine thet plus cosine 2 Theta D Theta can you double check me on that one hey uh could you do the integral of and you understand why we don't have a two or 1/2 anymore right we're just Distributing this don't just square that and square that actually distribute it can you do this integral of one can you do the integral of cosine 2 cosine Theta that's pretty easy can you do the integral of cosine squ Theta oh really what is it they were just on a roll with saying yep yep yep that's it's in the book that's book I guess it's in the book don't just say yep yep I forgot you forgot about your even functions when s and cosine are both even when s and cosine are both even break it up you do this you don't just throw out random guesses you use an identity to say this is 1 12 1 plus cine 2 Theta that should ring a bell to you s Bells be ringing do you remember that at all I hope that you do if you don't you might want to refresh your memory on some of this stuff because hey you're going to be us this before you start integrating do yourself a favor and just combine some like terms okay so I will integrate my one and my 1/2 just make that three Hales and then integrate it so we're going to go 0 to Pi we're going to have 3es plus 2 cosine Theta + 12 cosine 2 thet d does that look better let's see if we can do all the integrals now okay and don't just say yep uh can you do the integral of three Hales yep uh how about the integral of 2 cosine Theta and this one yeah we actually just did that it's a little substitution we'll do it in our head so go for it let's see if you guys can do okay [Applause] I got a three half Theta did you get a three half Theta those constants don't just go away uh I got a two sin Theta did you get a two sin Theta no negatives I got a one okay I got a 1 half but then this right here that's sin 2 Theta over two because of our U substitution we divide by the derivative of this little piece that's going to give my4 show fans feel okay with that so far okay we're good what do we do now down y let's evaluate where we going to go from Z okay so if we go from zero to Pi that says we're going to do which one do we do first again so 3 piun + 2 * s of piun + 1/4 * s of 2 piun minus well you know what I'm going to cheat a little bit not cheat but let's look at it if we plug in zero that's going to be what Z that's going to be this whole thing is going to be this is all zero are you with me on that one now if this was cosine would I want to do that no no because you're going to get ones out of those okay so this is big Z now let's do it uh how much is s of Pi come on quickly s of Pi zero how about s of 2 pi zero wow that was a lot of zeros what do we get that's it our area is 3i / 2 so when someone asks you do you have a large heart you say no really uh my heart is only an area of 3i / 2 it's a finite number that was really dumb anyway so uh the area of our card by the way do I have to multiply that by two since I yeah okay we already did that so we took care of it whatever way you work it I did it the other way too if you don't if you go from zero to 2 pi works out the same you're going to get 3 pi over two show pant if that one made sense to you cool all right we got a couple more examples uh we'll probably take care of them just next time okay so so the back end of our section here almost done what we've done with on last time was we found out how to find the area that's Bound by a polar curve do you guys remember that from from yesterday well the way we did it was we said all right what we're going to do is we're going to take the area of a little sector and we're going to integrate that we're going to allow that sector to uh have an infinite number of teeny little pieces which we're going to add together and that that came up with the area of our of our are well the area of our our polar curve area Bound by our polar curve now what we're going to do is just extend that concept a little bit we're going to find the area Bound by two polar curves so let's suppose that we got two polar curves we got R1 = F of theta and we have R2 = G of Thea so just two simple polar curves and we're going to integrate these on a certain interval if you remember anything about calculus one this is very similar to finding the area between two curves you remember finding the area between two curves do you at all it was an integral right it goes from A to B and it just said top curve minus bottom curve that's that's all it was area under the big curve minus area under the little curve well that's what this is going to look like except think about this for a second the area Bound by a polar curve looks a whole lot like the area of a sector because the area of a sector is what we're integrating and so this is going to be big curve minus little curve but it's also going to fit our idea of area of a of a uh bound bipolar curve like like a sector so let me show you what this is so suppose we have two curves F of theta and G of theta those our two polar curves and suppose that we know the intersection of them or we just going from two angles uh Alpha to Beta then the area between these two curves is going to look like this uh Let me refresh your memory here real quick area under or area Bound by one curve would do this it would do alpha to Beta it would have 12 R 2 and then we have D Theta does that look from the don't write that down you already have it okay does that look familiar to you do you remember this this was look at this this is area of a sector as we're letting the angle change we're adding up all little sectors so adding up all the sectors as our as our angles change and or with little teeny teeny angles show F if you feel okay with with that one now if we have two of these then here's what we're going to do basically we would say all right well you know what we do we'd have don't I'm going to kind of work with this for a little I'll kind of semi proove this all right what we would do is say hey here here's um here would be the the big area so if we want to find the area of this just the area Bound by this one we'd go from alpha to Beta 12 of R1 2 D Theta we we'd find that integral does that make sense if we want to find it between a big polar equation and a small polar curve then we would do what remember this find the area between these two curves what do you do so if that's x-axis find the area between those two curves what do you do little one from big one little one from subtract little from a big one so we' find all of this and we' subtract that remember that well we're going to do the same thing here we'll find all the area of the big one and we would subtract the area of the small one I'm going to work with this for just a little bit so you can see where this is coming from we'd subtract on the same bounds of integration the area of the small one does that make sense hello yes no okay so if we put them together because they have the same bounds we end up getting Alpha the beta 12 I can even Factor the 1/2 R1 2us R2 2 D Theta can you make make it there algebraically just factoring the one2 we're grouping these two things together well let's go one step further the one step further says is that R1 is actually equal to some function in terms of theta so instead of R1 we could write okay let's try this again that was weird let's try this again instead of R1 R1 is actually equal a function of theta so instead of writing R1 we could write F that's right instead of writing R2 we could write that's exactly what we're going to do and this is the formula that you guys are going to find so we'd say Alpha the beta we'd have the one half we would just have F of theta sarus G OFA squ D Theta that's the whole idea this is what we're working with right now should P be located with with that so far do you guys see what it's doing do you see how it's taking the area of the big sector minus the area of the little sector do you see what it's doing just saying hey big one minus little one that that's it that's going to give us the area between these two polar curves you guys want to try an example real quick to see what this is all about yeah okay so let's do that so I want the area between R 3 and R = 2 + 2 cosine thet find the area between R = 3 and R = 2 + 2 cosine you know what I'll show you how to do every bit of this um but we might want to think about what this even looks like before we get started on this so firstly do I have two polar curves what do you think yeah is that a polar curve for sure can you think about what that looks like if you can't do a little manipulation with this so might want to think of this as R = 2 * 1 + cosine thet hey look at that what's R equals y'all should know what's r = 1 + cine Theta cardid the cardioid what's two times that just a bigger cardioid a bigger a larger heart now is this the one that's like this or the one that's like this on it side yeah that's on its side that's right that's the spooning cardioid is what we like to say well what I like to say it's just funny um anyway so this is a bigger butt this we like big butts and Cann I've been working on that that one for a while these other brothers they can't deny when a cardioid walks in matter okay so that's a cardioid it's on a side just a little bigger now what's Ral 3 is there a Theta there no now think about this this says Ral 3 no matter what the Theta is R is a constant R does not change what do a curve look like when it has an r that doesn't change no matter what the Theta is cirle not a line a circle it's a circle can you imagine something that just has a radius of three uh what is it it's a circle so what this says is that our curve looks something like this we have 1 2 3 and four our Circle would have a radius of three so notice this this is what it's saying it says that if you allow the angle to change and the r doesn't change it says Hey R is always three R is always three r r is always it's going to be a circle one two three two three two three so our Circle would look like oh man I hope I get this right oh it's okay like that so F feel okay that rals 3 equals that circle now how about the next one check this out R equals this cardioid this bigger cardioid now here's what cardioids normally do look up here at the board please typically this cardioid would have a point at zero and would have a point at two do you remember that it would look like this well if you take all those values those R values and you multiply them by two it just doubles that so instead of having Z oh well we still have zero don't we because 0 * 2 is still zero so we're going to be Crossing at the the uh the pole at the origin but if we normally went to two now we're going to be going to very good so our cardioid is going to be outside and inside of our Circle so here's how it's going to look cardio cardioid looks something I'm going draw a purple so you can see the difference looks something like this says normal cardioid hey goes like this so bad at this normal cardioid that an enlarged heart would do this would say now we're taking all those RS and we're multiplying it by two so every distance is going to get a little bit further from the radius it's going to all those RS are going to double does that make sense to you all the RS double looks something like this okay I'm a you know what I'm a little off my heart's got a bad heart about like that off okay let's kind of just assume all right it wish I wasn't a perfectionist just leave it's [Music] called okay obviously I'm not a good artist okay my bad do you get the do you get the picture no pun intended but do you get the picture of the idea here so Ral 3 Circle radius of three uh Ral 2 plus 2 cosine Theta it's a cardioid it's just a bigger cardioid do you see that these curvs are going to intersect so what we're looking for is the area Bound by these curves the area Bound by these Curves in this instance that I want to look for is this I'll look for that now these things intersect the intersect here and here at those two points we need to find out what these are here's why we need to find them think carefully on this stuff look at this look it look it look it notice that our equation here deals in angles do you get it doesn't deal in X and Y it says I need your starting angle I need your ending angle we need to find out the angle where these things intersect and angle where they stop intersecting where the intersection stops show hands if you understand that that concept here so in order to do that how how would we do it how do you ever find the intersection of two curves what do you do subract NOP how do you fine NOP usually in Calculus if you don't know the answer say take a derivative and you're right and this class says take an integral but no not this time uh this goes back to algebra actually how do you find the intersection of two curves people you need to know how to find where two lines cross them make them equal to each other there look it hey if Ral 3 and Ral 2 plus 2 cosine could you make them equal to each other hey that's going to give you where they intersect they always it always happens where if you set two curves equal to each other you're going to find out where they're equal where they cross where the intersection is quick head now if you understand that concept it goes back to algebra if you ever want to find out where two curves intersect set them equal so we're going to set them equal to each other to find out what these intersections are so setting them equal 3 = 2 + 2 cosine so far so good solve it how we going to solve that probably good idea so we have subtracting 2 oneals 2 cosine Theta divide by two so I'm going to flip the sides cosine Theta equal 12 now stop and look at your picture this is why we usually like to have pictures here think about where cosine thet = 1/2 if you know anything about trigonometry you know that cosine equal 1 positive 1/2 in quadrants 1 all students take calculus quadrants one but not two and three and then quadrant four does that make sense that's where cosine equal positive2 what is cosine Thal pos2 for Quadrant 1 what's for Quadrant 1 very good I had to think for a second but yes how about cosine Theta equal 12 for Quadrant 4 5 3 that's right now I need to clear something up for you right now please listen please listen we need this area right here are you with me so what I need to do is I need to go from here to here we're going to be going in the positive direction for angle change well the problem is is if this is 5i 3 and this is pi 3 can I possibly go from 5 3 and go positive and end up at Pi pi over 3 no that's a bigger angle that's a problem now if I switch around and I go pi over 3 to 5 pi over 3 remember that this is going to go positively in the positive direction so if I set up my integral from 5 piun 3 to Pi three I have a problem because I can't go from Big angles to small angles and still be positive does that make sense sense if I go backwards and do 5K 3 over sorry 3 to 5 3 it's not doing this it would actually be doing this you'd find this area does that make sense to you that's also another problem unless we're looking for it okay what we want to do is we want to start here and go here but still gain angle so still go in the positive direction so instead of 5 Pi 3 what could I call that call it negative 3 that way start here that's still negative 3 right it's co- terminal with this so 3 I'm going to go positive to Pi 3 that makes sense and I'm also going for only this range only that angular range show hands if you understand that concept so you have to think about this you have think about what your quadrants are and what your picture really looks like that's what we talked about graphing all these these pictures so we're not going to use 5 3 we're going to use negative pi 3 because that will give me this did I explain that one if you understand it why we're not going from 5 Pi 3 to Pi 3 firstly because we can't because that doesn't make sense uh do you understand why we're not going from pi over 3 to 5 Pi three CU that's this way that's this that's that's not this area this is the area we're looking for so let's go ahead let's set this thing up and then we'll work on the integral together okay so uh our area we're ready to go where's our integral going to start please very good where's the integral going to stop what am I going to have here okay that's our formula 12 one I just like threes you know 12 what's going to go first what's going to go first now what's going to go first is think about this when I gave you the curves over here you took big curve minus little curve big here means the one furthest away from the origin so big curve minus little what's the outside one is it the three or is the 2 plus 2 cosine Theta 2 + 2 that's the outside one so we're going to have 2 + 2 cosine Theta keep going come on help me out square oh the whole thing gets squared that's going to be yummy and then what minus what perfect because that's the inside one in this case okay let's double check uh do you understand why we're going from PI 3 to pi over 3 yes no see where the 1/2 comes from it's our formula it's area of a sector we're just taking big sector the most outside minus little sector the one most inside and then we're integrating D Theta show feel okay now let's work on this one what's the first thing we're going to do in fact if there's no questions I'd like to move over here do you guys have any questions on this okay so I want lots of space okay tell me what what are we going to do go from 0 to 3 and just get the2 oh that's a good idea why is that a good idea so we could do this couldn't we is this symmetrical we know circles are symmetrical we also know cardioids are symmetrical about the polar axis so that means that our area is also symmetrical so if I wanted to man that one half' be kind of nice instead of going from negative pi 3 to Pi 3 let's go from 0 to pi over 3 do you guys want to do that let's do that if if we go from 0 to pi over 3 then we still have 12 and we still have all this stuff I'm actually going to distribute this right now so we have four plus how much cosine S no well that's going to be up there yeah but what's the next thing let's try Distributing this correctly okay we have four then we have how much no 8 cos uh do youall see where the 8 cosine Theta is coming from if you distribute it's this times itself so we get four then we got two and four and four that's 8 cosine Theta then we have our 4 cosine Theta if you don't know how to distribute these quickly you just Square this multiply this multiply by two and then square that so you're going to have 4 cosine squ and then we're going to have Min - 9 and then we're going to have a d Theta now we talked about something here real quick you guys okay um since since we changed bounds wouldn't the one half disappear we're talking about that right now actually so I I want to make sure you guys are clear on exactly what's happened before we go any further do you understand where all this stuff came from right here we're Distributing this we're just squaring our N9 now what we did we changed our balance we're not going from piun 3 to Pi 3 anymore we're going from 0 to pi over 3 if we're going from 0 to pi over 3 that's only giving us half of the eror we want how do I make this thing fit that M that's right so what this is representing right now the way it is it's representing this area if I want all the area I just times it by two because it's symmetrical does that make sense okay now let's start working on this thing couple things we can do what's going to happen two that's kind of one one of the reasons why we did this because firstly zero is nice to plug in rather than negative power 3 so when we get to the very end I don't want have to do that so zero is nice also it's getting rid of all of our constants uh that we have outside of our integral so we got 2 * 1/2 gone also maybe we combine some like terms here so we got area equals 0 to pi over 3 in our integral we're going to have four actually we're not what are we going to have not five plus 8 cosine Theta + 4 cosine 2 thet and then D Theta of all that stuff easy medium hard what do you think doable yes have you seen this before oh yeah can you integrate that piece of K can you integrate this piece of K can you integrate this yes right now the way it is no can you change it yes yes oh you guys are the yes crowd I forgot about that no or yep yep uh yep yep yep no 12 1 + cosine 2 Theta D Theta yeah we're going to use that identity so this says well keep the four this is 1 12 * 1 + cosine 2 theet what's nice for us we got even numbers so 4 * 1/2 is 2 we go all right cool we got 0 to piun 3 we got -5 + 8 cine Theta + 2 if this whole thing is two then I have two plus 2 cosine 2 thet I know I'm doing a couple steps at once I'm simplifying and I'm Distributing are you guys okay with it okay why don't you go ahead and see if you can do the the integ actually you know what we might want to do one more thing what's the last thing we might want to do com probably combine these guys so let's do that and then I want you to integrate it did you integrate it yes how many people did it integrate you got it how many people did I'll give you some more time I want you all to integrate this it shouldn't take you long I don't care if you evaluate it I want you to just integrate it just get the integral done uh we'll evaluate this together in just a minute so as long as you get the integral done that's what I care about have you got the integral Done Yet guys over here yes no okay so if we integrate here we're going to have remember it's D Theta so we're going to have -3 Theta we're going to have Plus 8 s Theta we're gonna have plus cosine sorry plus uh S 2 th actually what you get is 2 sin 2 th over 2 you get 2 sin 2 th divide by the derivative here but your twos are going to be gone so depends if you made it that far on your own that's great that's fantastic so I'm going to raise my twos now what say what way where does it start it's kind of nice to have a zero isn't it so we don't have to plug in all those NE pi over 3 to all the stuff because that would be kind of that'd be nasty and we could do it it'd be the same answer but we don't have to now which one do we plug in first so we're going to plug that in we're going to get netive 3 * 3 + 8 sin 3 plus S 2 pi 3 minus now let's check this okay don't make the mistake of just leaving this hanging out okay a lot of people especially students who are just coming through this the first time or something uh when they see Zero they go oh it's always going to be zero that's not true if you had coine here it's definitely not going to be zero now 3 * 0 okay s of0 okay s of0 okay so all the rest of is going to be zero but you do need to check this does that make sense so this is all zero yes so minus 0 gives us well let's think about that uh what's -3 * 3 Pi okay how about s of pi over 3 do you know what s of pi over 3 is32 so we have Plus 8 < TK 3/ 2 we'll simplify that in a minute and then s of 2 piun 3 what's s of 2 piun 3 that's right quick your hands feel okay with that so far now you can choose to do a couple things but I probably wouldn't do this I wouldn't simplify this right now because right now we have a common denominator and we also have a common root so if I have 8 < tk3 2 + < tk3 over2 that's 9 < tk3 /2 does that make sense so our area = 9 < tk3 / [Applause] 2- not a nice looking area but we found it that's kind of cool so the area between a large heart a large cardioid and a circle this particular circle is 932 minus Pi could you find an approxim for that if I asked you to that's the whole idea show be with this one all right tell you what the last thing that we're going to do in here I'm going to give you some formulas on how to find Arc Length on how to find area of a surface revolutions going be really similative stuff you've done before not going to give you examples on that there's formulas that you will know how to plug stuff in for okay you know how to do integrals right you know how to plug stuff in right so it's it's going to be just formulaic at this point after that I'll show you how to find the intersection between two polar curves which is very useful like this sort of stuff uh and we'll talk about some interesting things that can happen so uh just a couple formulas at first but do you have any questions on this before I continue have I explained this well enough for you guys to to get it okay so few other calculus Concepts dealing with polar equations and the first one is Ark length to find the length of a polar curve you can use this formula AR length is the integral Alpha Beta those are our angles square root so far does that look familiar the square root do you remember anytime we ever found length of a curve we've always had a square root in calculus one it looks like this it's 1 + frime of X2 under that square root you remember that how it looks for uh for parametric it was DX dt^ 2 + Dy dt^ s remember that for us it's going to be similar to this one what we do is we take a square root and we do Dr D Theta squared so far it looks ex very very similar to uh a parametric and then we do just R 2 that's where it changes just a little bit because our R is a function of theta we have a little bit different of an idea than than parametric but that's the idea of Arc Length feel okay with could you if I asked you to find the length of a curve between two two angles sure what are you going to do well the first thing you're going to do is take like for not that one okay that's that's pretty easy uh but like that one first thing you do is do what take a derivative with respect to Theta then Square it not a problem that'd be pretty easy to do wouldn't it so take a derivative Square it then do you know how much R is yeah sure you do take the r plug it in square it combine your like terms figure out how to do the integral it's under square root so you might have to use some manipulation there but that's the idea feel okay with the idea not a problem all right so how about area of a surface of revolution we'll talk about the polar axis and then about th = Pi / 2 a or what pi 2 y uh which one do we usually call the polar axis what is that X or the Y yeah it's like the x axis and the pi/ two that's like our y now of course we don't really have those in polar equations but we can think of them like that for this instance because I I want you to want you to really consider where we get these um where we got all of our surface of of Revolution surface area Revolution we got this we said okay if I'm going about if I'm going about the x-axis of some curve well whatever my curve is I'm going to need to know the height of it because What's Happening Here is if you remember how this was and if you if you don't you can watch calculus one i' explain how to do all of this at length and prove all of it what happens is we take we take little circles right and we find the circumference of each circle if we find the circumference of each circle and integrated about the length of the curve so you say hey here what's the circumference here then add it up then add it up then add it up then add it up then add it up add and we do that while we integrate across the length of this whole curve then what we end up getting is a whole bunch of circumferences added together gives us our surface area now of course the circumference is multiplied by a little infinitesimal width which is how we actually get to add them up okay we that's our integration idea invols a limit but this is the plan the plan is do circumference times length and then integrate that's the whole idea circumference what's the circumference of a circle oh good what is it no it involves a pi and an R it's not squared that would be if you square a unit do you understand you're going to get an area out of that I'm looking for circumference 2 pi r 2 pi r it's 2 pi r so what I'm trying to do here is take the circumference times the length listen do we already have an expression for the length yes yes that's the length so all we're going to have to do about the xaxis to say okay well here's Alpha here's beta I'm going to going to do circumference time length the length is going to be taken care of for us already the length is this it's Dr D Theta 2+ R 2 and then of course we're going to do D Theta you guys all understand that's length right so all I want is circumference times length because I'm just adding up all the little circumferences times a little bit of little bit of width giving us a surface area of each little little kind of it's it's almost like a miniature cylinder and we allow that cylinder to change shapes so it's 2 pi r okay 2 well wait a minute 2 pi r 2 pi well we don't really want R we let's not let our RS get confused here R for Polar R for polar equations stands for this this distance here what we want is the r the radius of our little circles what is this if I have it X Y AIS what's the radius of our Circle it's y it's y only in terms of us remember back at the very beginning of polar equations uh we had two definitions we said X was equal to R cosine thet and Y wasal to R sin thet remember that so instead of Y what am I going to put here R yeah also I'm going to move this 2 pi out front I'll write better now I'm not going to give you an example about how to do this I'm hoping that you can figure out that it's a formula so let's let's look at this for a second you already told me that you guys could find length right yes so if I ask you find the surface area Revolution about the polar axis the xais think about what this means all I want to do is find the circumference times the length do you guys see that this is circumference times length here look at this Here's 2 pi r well the r in that the r is the y height because if I'm going around the x- axis the height of my circle the radius of my circle is just my y my y component Y is R sin Theta so we have 2 2 pi radius the radius is R sin thet because that is the height of my y quick head now if you understand that's the most tricky part here do you guys get that part so circumference 2 pi radius y r times length hey length and then we integrate that now can you tell me what the only difference between this and this is going to be what do you think R say what now R that's right why I mean because why that's confusing yeah that's right so if I was going around the Y AIS this way so around the Y AIS then my radius is going to be the X component since X is R cosine Theta we have 2 pi radius or x cosine Theta and then we have because it's polar and X and Y don't exist in polar right would it still you take your X component and your y component and say well you know what if I'm trying to figure out how what my radius is so a polar curve would look H you know what do here polar curve even if I have just like this just an arc if I want to revolve that I need an X component and a y component depend on where they're going around the x axis or Y AIS so if I said all right I want to revolve that just something simple like that one if I want to revolve that this way I need to find out the radius of the circle it's going to make so this is going to make some sort of a circle right right where I want to find out my radius the radius is just the Y component so what we need to do is basically convert a polar equation into well kind of think it through think instead of polar let's think XY because I'm going around kind of the x axis the polar axis I just want my component my y component because my y component is my height so if my y = r sin Theta then I have 2 pi radius it's 2 pi y y is my radius but I need it also in the form of a polar equation that's where I get our R sin Theta from and in the X in the uh around the Y AIS it's X instead of Y and so we get our our cosine Theta the length length is easy length is what we had before so it's circumference times length that's basically the idea in a nutshell I mean I would like to prove it but I obviously don't have time and I've proved it before this idea before in calculus one so you can always go back and watch that show you understand the concept of this one so if I had you do this could you plug in the appropriate things yeah we we could find R not a problem take your R multiply by sin Theta take Dr D Theta no problem it's just your length so Dr D Theta squar R squ and then might be a nasty but you you do know how to do those things now I want to cover one unless there's any other questions anymore at all with this you sure okay one more I want to show you this example because interesting things happen when you try to find the intersection between two polar curves I'll show you that right now so what we're going to do is we're going to find out without having to graph this where these things intersect so Ral cosine Theta R = cosine 2 Theta where are these going to intersect I don't know what these things look like or at least let's pretend I don't know what these things look like let's try to find out the intersection Now ladies and gentlemen I ask you this already today how do you find out where any two curves intersect provided their solve for your variable your dependent variable R provided it's not like an r s or something yes just set them equal so Ral cosine thet and Ral cosine 2 Theta if I want to find out where they intersect I just set them equal and I try to solve for Theta are you listening still okay so let's do that let's set them equal to try to find intersection now where in the world is cosine Theta going to equal cosine 2 Theta without having to think a whole whole bunch of stuff here well um and we're going to come back to this in in about 3 4 minutes too but hav do that let's use some identities and maybe come up with an equation that we can use the one thing I don't like I don't like how that's Theta and that's 2 Theta because that's causing my brain some trouble right now so let's change this one so I'm going to do cosine Theta and I'm going to use that formula that we often use in but we're going to use in Reverse remember how cosine squar = 1 cos 2 well what that means is that we can do that in Reverse so let's see = 1 + cosine 2 if we solve that for cosine 2 th then we get uh 2 cosine 2 - 1 = cosine 2 th does that make sense to you we just solve that we use that in Reverse so this therefore equals cosine 2 * cos 1 now if you don't see it I don't blame you but do you see do you see this is kind of cool um this is actually a quadratic equation do you see it we get something squared we get the same something not being squared why we didn't we wanted to stay away from signs and stuff we want to make them all cosin because right now if I solve this for zero on one side I can get that now what's interesting is this is still factorable just like anything else it'd be like doing 0 = 2x 2 - x -1 in fact you could do that just call that X for now Factor it put your cosine back in So if you factor not cuz I just got in the habit of it um uh 2x what is it 2x do you know it pretty sure it's that but you double that would give us 2x^2 - 2x + x that's - x and then - one can you verify that that's the correct one okay well now that we have cosin instead of x's we get 0 = 2 cosine th + 1 * cosine th - 1 just from our basic Factory now what's interesting is that the zero product property that always works for us so if we have a product and we have that product equal to zero what that says is that each of those factors has to equal zero let's deal with this one first cuz it's going to be a little bit easier for us all right let's solve that how would I solve it cosine Theta equal one now this one's easy okay cosine theta equals one you tell me right now if cosine theta equals 1 how much is Theta Z very good zero you with me okay now now think about this for two look back up our original equation do you remember we want points right we want intersection points intersection points look like this they look like R thetas you get me we now have a Theta we need an R this is going to be easy one but do you understand that we're not done right here we just have this is like saying hey find out where the uh the lines intersect and you say they intersect at xal 3 does that give me a point no it tells me somewhere in Infinity at xal 3 they're going to intersect I don't want that I want to know the angle and how far out to go I don't want hey the intersect at the equal zero cool where that that doesn't help me at all I want to know where I want a point you get the point okay so zero now look at this if r equal cosine thet look down here how much does cosine thet equal how much does r equal then equal 1 therefore r equal 1 so from here here r = 1 we now have a point we have a point which one comes first the r or the Theta R so 1 Z these are going to intersect at the polar coordinate of one and one and zero an R of one and angle of zero so it says hey uh angle zero go out one these things are going to intersect right there so you understand that one okay now let's let's work on this one real quick uh do you understand that here we're going to have cosine Theta = 1/2 yes no okay cosine equal 12 cosine is negative in quadrants two and three very good so cosin's 12 where Pi 3 so if it's a pi over 3 for 1/2 it's going to be 2 piun over 3 for2 and 4K 3 for2 so these thetas are 2i 3 you can check your unit circle if you want and 4 3 so Pence you okay with that one are you sure now is my R going to be one for these points as well what's my R look up here what's my R you got it cosine thet equal R yeah so if cosine Thal -12 that means R = 12 and so we we get two points here but they're both going to have the same R we get - 12 2i 3 and we get - 12 4 Pi be a weird what I want to know is does that make sense to you show hands if it does you're like okay that that makes sense these are weird yeah because you have to go 2 pi over 3 but then go negative one2 all right so it's in quadrant four uh and this this one says you go 4 piun 3 can't even do that and that's negative so it's in quadrant one actually but that's what those intersections are that's this is right on the Polar axis do you guys feel okay with that one so find use an identity find an equation solve it then just don't forget that you need to find your R you don't just give me Theta is here Theta is zero sure but R is one so 1 zero uh f is 2 pi 3 and 4 Pi 3 but that also both work with the r cos is R of2 so we have2 2K 32 4K 3 now the last bit this is this was not that interesting this is what makes it interesting you ready plug in cosine of Pi / 2 what's cosine of Pi / 2 zero what's cosine of 3 pi/ 2 good I almost go to sleep for a little bit okay good all right um do do PI four so that was for this one do you understand that you are going to have an R of zero do do you get that point yes so if I plug in so this is kind of a the this is the interesting part so if I do theta = / 2 or 3 Pi 2 I get zero with me that means I'm going through the pole I'm going through the origin you follow do this plug in pi 4 here it's 2 * pi 4 what's our R weird okay plug in 3 Pi 4 3K 4 * 2 is 3K 2 what's cosine 3K 2 I get zero here did we have an intersection of Ral 0 anywhere up here no no they said Ral 1 they said ral2 yet we know for sure that both of these curves are going to go through the origin at some point do you get that why it doesn't show up is because they go through the origin at different times so what's weird about these polar curves is that even if you solve it all the way down we don't make any mistakes here you can still go through the same point but at different times so the angles aren't the same when they hit that point cuz here we're multiply those * 2 that's what's weird so we do have another intersection so one more intersection intersection happens at2 2K 3 intersection happens at-2 4K 3 intersection happens at 1 0 intersection also happens at R = 0 because they're both going through the origin right there isn't that interesting that's kind of cool right weird just different times so F if everything made sense up until this last little part did this last little part make sense did it blow your mind it should blow your mind a little bit like w that's weird because almost like parametric it's it's just happening at a different time it's reaching that point at a different angle anyway that is it for this section
