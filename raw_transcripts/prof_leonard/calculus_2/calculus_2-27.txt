Transcript for: Numerical Integration With Trapezoidal and Simpson's Rule
okay for us our very last section talking about numerical integration kind of going back in time to our calculus 1 days or first semester calculus here's what numerical integration is all about what it allows you to do is approximate integrals definite integrals that you couldn't otherwise do that we don't have a formula for that man we I don't know how to do this one or something we haven't covered because there are going to be some integrals that we have not covered even though we've done all our techniques integration there's somebody looking up I don't know as a possible action no it's a trick I don't know well we can approximate those definite integrals with these two processes one's called the trapezoidal rule and one code is called Simpsons rule so we're going to talk about trapezoidal rule first then Simpsons rule they're very similar and what you do what this is doing again it's giving you an approximation of a definite integral without having to even do the integral you with me okay so like I said I think I just mentioned this to you guys but put yourself back into your first semester calculus days when we haven't done a lot of integrals okay so the ones we're going to do on the board they would be something you learn in calculus two what we've all we've already learned them but back then these integrals would have not been really possible for us because we would not have learned them yet you with me okay so with that in mind let me introduce you the trapezoidal rule so the trapezoidal rule says this if you want to approximate a definite integral remember the definite integrals have bounds of integration they go from like an e to e they go somewhere of any function that you want we can approximate it hits our squiggly equals here we could we can approximate it by doing this and really interesting here's how it works it says I don't define these in just a minute but they should look familiar if you took calculus 1 this looks familiar Delta X you guys have seen Delta X before Epogen will talk without the finance second if you don't remember what it is you take Delta X u divided by 2 and you multiply it by this sum by f of X sub 0 plus 2 times f of X sub 1 plus 2 times f of X sub 2 plus and you keep all those twos and tell you get down to 2 times f of X sub n minus 1 plus f of X sub n no - that's the trapezoidal rule now I'm going to define a couple of these things for you personally what Delta X is if you don't remember it's okay Delta X is B minus a where do I get my B minus a from do you know that's a certain iman say it's just your your integral so B minus a divided by N and it's going to be given to you so n is going to be some finite number because we're approximate right now now listen we can't let n go to infinity because if we did well we wouldn't have an approximation anymore and this is going to we would have a finite number of terms add up and one via approximation we can't actually do that we couldn't do this forever the idea of doing this forever is the actual integrals add so because do the integral well then we're left with a finite number of terms to approximate our value and then X sub I which means that X sub 0 X sub 1 X sub 2 X sub 3 X + 4 X sub n minus 1 X sub n it's given by this you start with Eddie again a is just right here and you add to it your index times Delta X that might look a little confusing you get a treasure on this this is not that hard to do I'm going to prove that to you right now with an example so write down the formula I'm going to show you how to do it just make sure you write down correctly okay there's no two in front of this there's a 2 in front of every other term that you have until you get to the very very last one and then there's not a 2 there quick hit up you're ok with that so far okay so let's do our example so what we're going to do is we're going to approximate 1/2 - 1 over X DX and what we want to do is approximate this with N equals 10 if N equals 10 what that's going to mean for us is that we're going to get 11 terms here we have an X sub 0 through X sub 10 we're going to end on the X sub 10 term does that make sense to you so we need eleven terms stop it N equals 10 now if you look at that many of you're going to think well I'll just do the integral what's the integral of 1 over X would you know that in a late transcendentals class like we have for calculus 1 as I kept this one we don't cover that so that's why I said put yourself back into calculus want first semester calculus class at our College we have what's called late transcendental some people have early where they do this in calculus 1 we don't so we do it later so for us this would have been impossible back in calculus 1 so all we would have done is try to approximated here's how we're approximated the first thing we do we'll figure out Delta X of course that's going to be important for us so to figure out Delta X Delta X is B minus a over N all those things are going to be given to you if you have a definite in a roll what's our beat - over and perfect that's going to be 110 okay what we're close to place and putting this in our formula now we got to figure out our X sub 0 or X sub 1 X sub 2 - X sub 3 and X sub 4 blah blah blah in fact you can think of this is because I'm going to be some calculators you can think about this is 0.1 if you want to you might make things a little bit easier for you if you want so it looks kind of weird like how am I going to figure it's not that hard here's what it says if I want X sub 0 X sub 0 says start at a would say add 0 D X's so we're just going to have one does that make sense exit sorry X 1 1 missed one exit 1 says this started a what's what's a 1 and add 1 Delta at one time is Delta X so it'd be one plus point 1 or just 1 point 1 X sub 2 says start a it's 1 plus 2 times Delta X well that would be 1 plus 0.2 1.2 can you tell me what the next one's going to be going through what's the next one and then 1.5 and 1.6 then 1.7 1.8 and 1.9 at the very end we're going to get to X sub 9 that's going to be one point and then X sub 10 gives you I wish so hands feel okay with where those are coming from can you follow that should be a little easier because it's back to factor this one stuff it just plug in numbers in it just says hey start here start whatever that is and just add Delta X so for X sub 0 yet none of them so just one and then add this one point one add it again one point two add it again 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 and then to one point n - yeah so we get to now what the trapezoidal rule says is after you've all if you've done all that the integral can be approximated by doing this you take Delta X what's our Delta X so we have Delta x over 2 and then you're going to do this you're going to have f of X sub 0 F of what plus what's the next thing I'm going to right now our to store two times F of what yeah plus 2 times 1 point 2 plus 2 times F of 1 point 3 plus the reviews all the way down till we get to 2 times F of 1 point 9 and then we're going to have do we have a two on the very last term no oh just F of 2 okay I want to do like a 20-second recap just to make sure that you give this so the idea behind these numerical integrations is sometimes we can't integrate or sometimes we don't know how to integrate it and this would be one of those cases where at the time we would not have known how to do this now I'm giving you a very simple example okay just so it makes our math easy so you get the idea you could do this with some pretty hardcore integration I know that you don't know how to integrate if it's a definite integral to understand that if it's not a definite integral this this doesn't work because I'm plugging numbers in alright so we say is all right now where's your integral starting whatever where it is stopping whatever you can find Delta X with that provided you're given the number of iterations and your your your rule so in this case we have N equals 10 that's 11 terms that we're going to be going through so it says okay cool well if that's my Delta X then I start with my a I just add my Delta X for every new term so I added them add it than that until I get up in my last one plug in the formula we have Delta x over 2 no problem f of X of 0 f of X sub 1 so 1 1 will point you all the way to the very end notice though into two terms that don't have two s on the first one and the last one you follow now what's nice about this do you have a function that you can plug these things into yeah that's right there it's just 1 over X so we're going to do this we're going to start by taking our Delta X it's 0.1 divided by 2 and then we're going to have F of 1 so that's 1 over 1 plus 2 times F of 2 so check it out it's going to be 2 times 1 over 1 point 1 plus two times one over one point two plus two times one over one point three plus we do this for a while for a finite number of terms and we're going to end off with two times one over one point nine plus one over two I want you to see if you can you can go through that you mine data that actually makes sense to you so fans if that does make sense to you okay so here's what you're going to do on your calculators what you're going to do is you're going to figure out what all these things are I'm not writing all because it takes too long so but I'm hoping that I've made this clear on what this this is you guys see what what it is we're starting with just a function evaluated at whatever RNA is just one and then we add to 2 times F at one point 1/2 times F at 1 point 2 2 times F of whatever our exit 3 exit for X upon all the way up till we do our X sub n minus 1 look at that X is 1 is 9 some of you guys on your tested X sub n plus 1 for this one you were counting further than you should have been counting before not after so X sub n minus 1 gives us our 9 and then our last one whatever it is in 10 in this case no to here we plug them into our function that's what we have our one over this one over this one over X of 3 1 over X sub 10 and we just figured decimal equivalent so in our case on your calculator you get 1 plus 2 over this it's 2 into this through that and then multiply that by 120 now as you're doing that I'm going to go ahead on actually I did this on purpose I did the integral because we can actually do it I want to see how close this actually is so if we were to really do the integral so people work on this some of you guys really go through this okay I want I want an actual answer so but if we were to do an integral with what we know now we know the integral of 1 or X is Ln X and we would evaluate that from 1 to 2 that's Ln of 2 minus Ln of 1 well ml element 1 is 0 so we get Ln of 2 + Ln 2 is about equal to someone who's not working on this can you tell me what Ln of 2 is about equal 2.6 died and 3 14.6 not saving in 6 9 31 or okay it keeps on going because it's it it consider a rational number it goes on forever without ever meeting have you got this one what you get yeah is it exactly the same is it close tenths hundredths step it's the same to the thousands it's off by a little over six ten thousandths so with if you but here's the point this was clicker because we know how to do it right if this was an integral that we did know how to do this would be the best way because you don't know how to do it so you okay we'll call let's evaluate this approximately let's use our trapezoidal rule and then we get something that's relatively close now question how do you make this better more terms na plus C cos is definite integral how do you make it better we're in Morgan's do that to like a hundred it's really close I don't mean very much but really close because what's happening is you're taking our interval and make it really really living bill it's the same idea with doing Vermont sounds with more and with N equals larger numbers you're making smaller rectangles smaller rectangles well hey if you have smaller rectangles that means you're missing less and less area when you add up those rectangles if you remember back to your your month sums that you did in calculus or that making sense to you so the major that is the more close this is going to be I just want to do this one to show you hey you know what you can actually proximately get it pretty darn close dividends if I explain that long for you okay this is it for trapezoid rule that's how it works I'm going to give you a super sense rule show you how Simpsons rule differs here's how Simpsons world works Simpsons rule is going to look really really similar here's only difference instead of taking Delta X divided by two you take Delta X you're going to divide by three then what you do yeah it's cool it's awesome electors - then what you do is you take and you start with the same f of X of zero but this becomes a four that stays in tune and you're going to go for two four two four two four two four two and end of the pole right there and then that last one doesn't get anything now this will only work if n is even and it's got to be even so you can't do this if n is five you could do it if n is six sort of ends eight or two or like what even numbers are you do it evens but other than that this small report make sure I wrote down right to it in from memory but yeah I think I got it years when do an example your real quick yes because this makes sense to you that we're going to alternate fours and twos just you don't end the to you that that's going to happen if you have an eating okay so it's going to be nothing then four two four two four two four two four nothing thank you for your very less terms will happen as me so let me change this just a little bit how about 1 over square root X plus 1 from 0 to 2 with N equals 7 is that ok why not it has to be even find sticklers is 6 and 6 go through the same way that you would normally do the trapezoidal rule only now we're just going to plug into a different formula the Delta X is calculated the same way the X sub i's are calculated the same way and it just has to be satisfying the tens even ok so Delta egg what's nothing X is going to be going to be 1/3 that's right I'd probably leave that as a fraction 1/3 because I don't want I do not do not want you to approximate in just 2.3 or 0.33 because you're going to be losing something there ok and you're essentially going to be losing it every time you multiply every time you have a term because of that distribution property the approximation be way off so leave this as a fraction unless you can have a finite decimal you listening right now okay so leave it as a fraction okay well cool now let's do our X's so we want X sub 0 we want X sub 1 like sub 2 and so on what's X sub 0 going to be what's X sub 0 say it louder what you say 0 yeah you start with a 0 0 no problem ok well now if I have X sub 0 0 what's X sub 1 you know that one it's give me 1/3 because you guys see that the point in doing this well maybe you don't see the point in actually doing this we're trying to approximate intervals integrals without actually doing them we start with that number you just keep on adding this your Delta X per term that's what this says is that start with your a Judas NRA is 0 right now you get it you start with a just add Delta X that's it just add it every single time so what 0 plus 1/3 if we do know how to do fractions so what's 1/3 plus 1/3 2/3 now 100 X sub 3 what's up 2/3 plus 1/3 3/3 1 what's X sub 4 4/3 what's X sub 5 5 thirds and what's X sub 6 6 thirds yay so it makes me locate with that one so what I don't have all the all the terms in this particular one just so we feel through it again sometime so our integral can be approximated by doing this we start with Delta X how much is done X 1/3 1/3 we divided by what people carry very good and then we have this wholesome we have how's it start we see the apps f of zero very good f of zero then we add oh what's the next thing for board starts before four times f of 117 plus what 2 2 goes you know it works starts with nothing then it goes for then it goes to F of 2/3 then it goes to what for fo and then it goes back to 2 with a head for 4/3 then it goes back to for F of 5/3 and then it is what please F of yeah but notice there's nothing here so see how it's going to work it's going to always start with a full clips are done they there with nothing start with 4 and with a 4 and we're going to have one extra force it's going to pair up Bam Bam with an extra 4 it's not going to go back to the deciding to get there we use our even ends you're going to be located with this one are you sure ok and you can see if I went to N equals 8 what's going to happen is I'm going to have another tuna to the four go into tentative another children before it's always going to end with that 4 and then then that last term without anything in front of it so what do we do with all these numbers what are we to do with them look you pull you into what function yep right there so this is going to be approximately 1 9 3 okay 1 over square root 0 plus 1 plus 4 over square root of 1 3 plus 1 plus 2 over square root of 2/3 plus 1 plus 4 over square root of 1 plus 1 plus 2 over square root of 4 thirds plus 1 plus 4 over square root 5 30 plus 5 plus nothing 1 well not nothing 1 over square root of 2 plus 4 and if you do that and add them all up and then multiply by 1/9 then we get an approximation what I'd like to know is a show fans if you understand where all these things are coming from 2 events if you do guys on the right are you guys ok with this ok so this is what I had to bring your calculate in your calculator because there's a what I can be able to do this in our heads very easily so we're approximate here where it's okay to get our decimals so we got one that you add that X square divide 4 by it and so on and so forth and so on and so forth and so on and so forth now I've already done it you guys can go ahead and see if you can check my work but just for the sake of time it's going to take a little while right so here's what it is what it ends up giving you is approximately one point four six four to one is what that is Japan's relocated with the idea now what I want to do I want you guys to do the interval because we do know how to do this one we were kind of pretended we did don't want you to do that integral over here and just see what how good that approximation is all right so go forward like you to check my work to make sure that we all got the same thing did you get about that I should just get exactly that shouldn't know you got the two square root of x plus one if you plug back in the X before you start evaluating perfect that's fantastic so we got two or three minus two how much is two times the square root of three minus two one point eight four six four 101 is that one more time one point four six four one zero one six okay that's good enough that's our our decimal place is it exactly the same is it close it's really stinking close look at that this is a one point four six four one this is one point four six four two it's off by a little over one ten-thousandth after only six n equals six so six iterations that's that's not too bad so that's pretty darn close for approximately something if we didn't know how to do it so that's a lot of the trapezoidal rule works that's how Simpsons rule works have I explained it well enough for you guys to understand yeah oh wait no I'm just kidding
