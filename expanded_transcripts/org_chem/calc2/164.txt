Transcript for: Integrating Exponential Functions By Substitution - Antiderivatives - Calculus
in this video we're going to focus on integrating exponential functions so let's go ahead and begin what is the antiderivative of e to X DX what do you think the answer is for this function it's simply going to equal the same thing it's e to X plus C now what about this one what is the anti-derivative of e to 2x DX this is going to be e to 2x / the derivative of 2x which is 2 plus C that technique Works only if you divide it by a constant if you divide it by a variable it's not going to work so what do you think the answer for this one is e to NE 5x DX it turns out that it's going to be the same thing e to 5x / the derivative of 5x which is5 plus C now let's prove the last one using uh U substitution so let's make U equal to 5x du is the derivative of 5x which is5 time DX and solving for DX it's du /5x so now let's replace -5x with the U variable and let's replace DX with du over5 now let's take the constant neg5 and let's uh move it to the front so it's ne5 anti-derivative of EU or e to the U du now we know that the integration of e to the x is simply e to X so the anti-derivative of e to U is simply e to U plus C and now we can replace youu with 5x so the final answer oh by the way this should be uh negative one over5 because the five is on the bottom so just keep that in mind almost forgot about that but the final answer is -1 over5 e to 5x + C which is the same thing as what we have which was e to 5x /5 + C here's another one X Cub * e to x 4 DX go ahead and integrate the function so we can integrate by substitution let's replace U with x 4 so therefore du is going to be the derivative of x 4 which is 4xb * DX and now let's solve for DX that's du over 4xb so let's replace x to the 4th with the U variable and now let's replace DX with du over 4X cub and so we could cancel X Cub now let's move the four to the front so it's 1/4 anti-derivative e to U du the integration of e to the U is just e to U * 1/4 + C and now all we need to do is replace U with x 4 so the final answer is 1/4 e raised to the x 4 plus C and as you can see it's not that bad so that's it for that problem and now let's move on to the next one here's another one you could try e to X time theun of 1 - e to X DX so what do you think we need to do first in this example we should make U equal to 1us e to X if we do that du is going to be netive e to X DX the derivative of one is zero the derivative of e to X is e to X so the derivative of negative e to X is e tox now Sol for DX it's du over e tox so this is going to be e to x times the square < TK of U and DX is Du / e to X so we can cancel e to X so we can move the negative in front the square root of U is basically u^ 12 and then time du so now let's integrate let's add one to the exponent 12 + 1 is 3 2 and instead of dividing it by 3 over2 we can multiply it by 2 over 3 let's add the constant C so now we need to replace you with 1 - e to X so the final answer is -2 over3 1 - e to X raised to the 3 over 2 + C and that's it for this problem here's the next one e to x + e tox / e to x - e x DX so let's integrate this what should we make U equal 2 the bottom one or the top one in this problem we want to make U equal to the bottom one so it can we can get rid of the top one so U is going to be e to x minus E tox so now let's find du the derivative of e to the x is just e to the X the derivative of negative e to thex is going to be negative e tox * 1 and all of this is multiplied by uh DX so e x * 1 is basically POS e so solving for DX it's du over e to the X Plus e to thex and this is good because we can see that this is the same as a numerator which means that it's going to cancel soon so let's rewrite what we have let's replace the denominator with the U variable because they're equal to each other and let's replace DX with du over e x + e tox and so these two will cancel and now what we have is the anti-derivative of 1 U du which is going to be Ln U plus C and now we can replace U with this so the answer is the natural log of ECX minus E tox plus C and let's put this in absolute value and so this is the solution let's work on another one e to 1x^2 / X Cub DX so what do you think we should make U equal to in this example let's make U equal to 1/x^2 and before we find a derivative let's rewrite it this is equal to X raus 2 so du using the power rule is going to be -2 x to -2 -1 or -3 time DX now before we solve for DX Let's uh simplify let's get rid of the negative exponent we could do that by moving X from the top to the bottom SO3 will now become posi3 and now let's get DX by itself so first let's multiply both sides by X Cub so these will cancel and so we have X Cub du is equal to -2 DX so now let's divide both sides by -2 to get DX by itself so DX is equal to X Cub du / by -2 so now let's replace 1 /x^2 with u so this is a e raised to the U / XB and let's replace DX with what we have here and that's X Cub du over -2 and so let's cancel X cub and let's take the -2 move it to the front so it's going to come out as-2 integration e to u d which is equal to2 e to U + C and now all we need to do is replace U with what it was so the answer is going to be -2 e to the 1 /x^2 plus C and that's it for this one now what about this problem what is the anti-derivative of e to 3x + 4 e to x + 5 / e to X DX what do you think we should do here so we have a fraction and there's only one term in a denominator what we can do is split the fraction into three smaller fractions so it's e to 3x over e to x + 4 e to X over e to x + 5 over e to X now what's E to 3x ID e to X well we go back to algebra x 7 / x^2 is x 5 you need to subtract the exponents 7 - 2 so here we got to subtract the exponents 3x - x or 3x - 1 1 x is 2x so right now we have e to 2x now 4 e to X over e to the X these cancel because they're the same x - x is Zer so you just get four e to the Z is one by the way now this e to X we can move to the top and it become e to the negative X or 5 e to X and now we can integrate it in this form the anti-derivative of e 2x is simply e 2X 2 integration of 4 is just 4X and for the next one it's going to be 5 e tox divid the derivative ofx which is1 plus C and so that's the solution
