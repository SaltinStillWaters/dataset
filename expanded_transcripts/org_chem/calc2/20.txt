Transcript for: Horizontal Line Test and One to One Functions
consider this function let's use a linear function as our example and let's call it f of x so does f of x have an inverse function determine if f of x have an inverse function you have to show that it's a one-to-one function you have to show that it passes the horizontal line test so if we draw a horizontal line that's a terrible horizontal line if f x touches the horizontal line more than once that means f of x is not a one to one function it does not have an inverse function but in this example it only intersects the horizontal line only at one point so f of x is a one-to-one function which means that it has an inverse function so let's look at some other examples so what about this parabolic function does it have an inverse function well if we draw a horizontal line notice that it touches the horizontal line at two points so therefore let's call this function g of x g of x does not have an inverse function if you try to draw the inverse relation it's not going to be a function it's going to look something like this this is just like a rough sketch and notice that it does not pass the vertical line test so therefore the inverse relation is not a function so we can say that g of x does not have an inverse function because it's not a one to one function let's look at some more examples so go ahead and determine if the following functions have inverse functions let's call this f of x let's call this one g of x so f of x does not pass the horizontal line test it is not a one-to-one function and so it doesn't have an inverse function g of x passes the horizontal line test it touches it only at one point so g of x has an inverse function and it is a one-to-one function so what about this one this function does not pass the horizontal line test it touches it at three points and so it's not a one to one function and it does not have an inverse function so that's it for this video now you know how to determine if a function contains an inverse function and if it's a one-to-one function so keep in mind if you have some function f of x if it's a one-to-one function that means that it passes the horizontal line test and it does have an inverse function let's say we have g of x if it doesn't have if it doesn't pass the horizontal line test it is not a one-to-one function and it doesn't have an inverse function you
