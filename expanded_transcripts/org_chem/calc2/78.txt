Transcript for: Product Rule For Derivatives
in this lesson we're going to go over the product rule for derivatives so let's say if we have a function f multiplied by another function g the derivative of f times g is going to be f prime g plus f of g prime so let me give an example let's say if we want to find the derivative of x squared sine x so notice that f is basically x squared and g is sine x so let's write f is equal to x squared and g is equal to sine x now what is the derivative of x squared the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of sine x is cosine x so now all we need to do is plug in what we have into that expression so f prime is 2x times g which is sine x plus f which is x squared and then g prime is cosine x and so that's the answer now if you want to you can factor out the gcf which is x so if i take out an x i'll be left with 2 sine x plus x cosine x if you want to simplify now let's try another example go ahead and differentiate this expression 5x minus 9x cubed times eight plus x squared go ahead and find the derivative of this entire expression so let's say that f of x is five x minus 9x cubed and g is going to be the other function a plus x squared so first we need to find f prime which is the derivative of 5x is 5 and the derivative of nine x cubed that's going to be nine times three x squared which is 27 x squared now for g prime the derivative of a constant is zero and the derivative of x squared is 2x according to the power rule so using the expression the derivative of f times g is equal to the derivative of the first part f prime times the second part plus the first part times the derivative of the second so f prime that's 5 minus 27 x squared and g is eight plus x squared plus f which is five x minus nine x cubed and then g prime is two x and so this is the answer now let's try an example with trig functions so let's say f of x is 4 sine x tangent x go ahead and find the first derivative of the function now it's good to separate it into two parts this is the first part and you can call that f if you want and then this is g the second part so to differentiate it we need to find the derivative of the first part of the function the derivative of 4 sine x is 4 cosine x now the second part g we're not going to change it and then plus we're going to keep the first part the same but we're going to find the derivative of the second part the derivative of tangent is secant squared so as you can see this is f prime this is g g was not change let's say this is f and g and then f is unchanged here and then that's g prime so now we need to simplify the expression tangent is sine divided by cosine secant squared is one over cosine squared so there's not much that we could change but for now i'm gonna just write it as one over cosine squared so i can cancel cosine on the left so i have four times sine x you know what i'm going to leave it as four sine x secant squared because i can take out a four sine x and so i'm left with one plus secant squared and i'm going to stop here so that's f prime that's the first derivative of 4 sine x tangent x now let's move on to the next example so let's say f x is 5x sine x minus x cubed tangent x go ahead and find the first derivative of this function now we need to use the product rule on this term and on this term separately so for 5x sine x we can say 5x is like f and sine x can represent g now for the second one x cubed can be f and g could be tangent x you know what let's call this h so we don't confuse it with the other f so let's determine h prime of x so let's differentiate the first part of the function the derivative of 5x is 5 and then leave the second part the way it is and then plus keep the first part the same that's going to be f times g prime so differentiate the second part the derivative of sine is cosine now let's apply the product rule to this expression so let's enclose it in brackets the derivative of the first part x cube is three x squared and then leave the second part the way it is plus keep the first part the same and differentiate the second part the derivative of tangent is secant squared so don't forget to distribute the negative sign to everything so we have five sine x plus five x cosine x minus three x squared tangent x plus x cubed secant squared now there's nothing else that we can do with this problem so we're going to leave it the way it is oh i almost made a mistake this should be a negative sign we need to distribute that negative so this is the answer now let's say if r of x is equal to x squared plus 6 times 7 minus 8x plus 3x x cubed what's r prime of x in this example in this problem we have three factors instead of two so how can we use the product rule when we have three factors we can call this f g and h so what is the derivative of f times g times h so what you need to do is differentiate the first part f and leave the other two the same and then differentiate the middle part g leaving f and h to the same way and then differentiate the last part h so r prime of x is going to equal the derivative of the first part the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of a constant is zero so f prime is just 2x and then we're going to rewrite g and h plus we're going to rewrite f and then times g prime the derivative of 7 minus eight x is simply negative eight and then times h which i'm running out of space and then plus f which is going to stay the same and then g is going to stay the same times h prime which is 3 minus 15 x squared so this is the answer there's no need to simplify at this point unless you can but i will leave it the way it is now let's say if f of 3 is equal to 4 and f prime of 3 is negative 7 and g of three is negative eight and g prime of three is five what is f g prime of three how can we evaluate that expression well we know that the derivative of f times g that's equal to f prime g plus f g prime so if it's f g prime evaluated when x is 3 this is going to be f prime of 3 times g of 3 plus f of 3 times g prime of 3. so all we need to do is plug it into the expression on the right side so f prime of three is negative seven and g of three that's negative eight f of three is four and g prime of three is five negative seven times negative eight that's positive fifty-six four times five is twenty and fifty-six plus twenty is seventy-six and that's all you need to do in order to evaluate something that looks like this f g prime of three now you might be given this information in table form so you can still apply the same principle to evaluate it so that's it for this video that's all i got thanks again for watching you
