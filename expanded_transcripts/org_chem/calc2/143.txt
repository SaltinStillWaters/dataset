Transcript for: Marginal Cost and Average Total Cost
in this video we're going to go over basically this problem on marginal cost and average costs so let's say if we have the cost function c of x and let's say it's equal to 1500 plus five x plus point zero one x square so find the cost average cost and marginal cost to produce two hundred units so let's find the cost at a production level of two hundred so all we need to do is replace x with two hundred so it's going to be fifteen hundred plus five times two hundred plus point zero one times two hundred squared now five times two hundred that's a thousand and two hundred squared is forty thousand times point zero one that's going to be four hundred so fifteen hundred plus a thousand that's twenty five hundred plus four hundred so that's twenty nine hundred so the production level at 200 so that is the total cost of selling 200 units is 2 900 now what about the average cost let me write per 200 units so what's the average cost per unit the average cost is basically the cost divided by x so it's going to be 2900 the total cost to make 200 units divided by those 200 units and so we could cancel the two zeros and then it becomes 29 divided by two which is fourteen dollars and fifty cents so that's the average cost to make one unit of an item now what about the marginal cost how can we determine the marginal cost to produce 200 units the marginal cost is basically the first derivative of the cost function so it's c prime of x the derivative of a constant like 1500 is zero the derivative of five x is five and the derivative of x squared is two x times point zero one so that's going to be point zero two x now we need to evaluate it at a production level of two hundred so that's five plus point zero two times two hundred now two times two hundred is four hundred point two times two hundred will be forty so point zero two times two hundred is four and then four plus five is nine so this is basically nine dollars per unit so what does this tell us what's the basic idea behind the marginal cost the marginal cost tells us the additional cost that it will take to make one extra unit so we said that the total cost to make 200 units if you recall was 2 900 so what is the total cost to make just one extra unit so 1 plus 200 is 201 well let's plug it into this equation and let's see what's going to happen so it's 1500 plus 5 times 201 plus 0.01 times 201 squared so this is still going to be 1500 now 5 times 200 is a thousand and five times one is five so that's going to be a thousand and five and then 201 squared times .01 that's 404.01 so let's go ahead and add the three numbers so this will give you 2909.01 now look at the difference between the cost at a production level of 200 and the total cost at a production level of 201. the difference between those numbers if you take 2909.01 and subtract it by 2900 that will give you a difference of nine dollars and zero one cent so the cost to make an additional unit increase by nine dollars approximately and that's what the marginal cost tells us it tells us how much it will cost us if we're going to produce one extra item and you can see that based on the difference between these two values now let's move on to part b find the production level that will minimize the average cost so how can we do that in order to find the minimum average cost or the production level that leads to the minimum average costs you need to know a simple fact and that is that the average cost is a minimum when the marginal cost is equal to the average cost by the way c of x i'm going to use that to represent the total cost function and when you see this line above the c i use that to represent the average cost function just in case you're wondering now we said the marginal cost was basically five plus point zero two x now the average cost is basically the cost function divided by x now the cost function which is what we had at the very beginning that was fifteen hundred plus five x plus point zero one x squared now we need to divide this function by x and then it becomes the average cost function so i'm going to divide every term by x separately which is the same as dividing the whole thing by x so everything on the right side now represents the average cost function so all we need to do at this point is solve the equation x represents the production level so we need to calculate the value of x so the left side is going to stay the same for now and on the right side we're going to have 1500 divided by x 5x divided by x the x variables will cancel and so that's going to give us 5 and x squared over x that's just x and we're going to have 0.01 x now if we subtract both sides by 5 they will cancel so that's just going to disappear and then we need to subtract both sides by 0.01 x so on the right side these will cancel and on the left point zero two minus point zero one is point zero one and that's equal to fifteen hundred divided by x so now what we need to do is cross multiply fifteen hundred times one is fifteen hundred and then point zero one x times x that's point zero one x squared so let's divide both sides by point zero one fifteen hundred divided by point zero one when you divide by point zero one is the same as multiplying by a hundred so this becomes a hundred and fifty thousand and that's equal to x squared so now we need to take the square root of both sides and so x is going to be 387.3 but we need to round to the nearest unit so we're going to say it's about 387 units so that's the production level that will minimize the average cost so at this production level the average cost should be the lowest value part c we need to find the minimum average cost so we need to take this x value and plug it into the average cost function now we said that the average cost function is the total cost function divided by x now the total cost function was fifteen hundred this is the original problem that we had or the original equation plus five x plus point zero one x squared and to find the average cost you need to divide it by x so the average cost function is 1500 over x plus 5 plus 0.01 x so let's calculate the average cost at 387 units so let's see what answer we're going to get so this will give us 12. and 75 cents so this is the minimum average cost now to verify that we do indeed have the minimum average cost i'm going to calculate the average costs at a number below 387 and at a number above 387 so let's try 350 and 420 so at 350 this is going to be 1500 over 350 plus 5 plus 0.01 times 350 so let's see what that's going to be so it's going to be 12. and 79 cents which is more than 12.75 now let's do the same thing at a production level of 420. let's see what we're going to get and so it's going to be 12 and 77 cents which is still more than 12.75 so therefore this is the minimum the lowest average cost per unit and the production level that gave us that minimum average cost is 387 so this answer is the answer to part b that's an x value and part c is the value in dollars so this is the answer for part c and that's it for this video so now you know how to calculate the average cost the marginal cost and you know how to find the minimum average cost as well thanks for watching you
