Transcript for: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 2
in this video we're going to talk about the second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus now some books may call it the first part but you can go with whatever your textbook says so the basic idea is that you have a function f and it's continuous on the closed interval a b and capital f represents the anti-derivative of lowercase f so in that case then according to the fundamental theorem of calculus the definite integral of f of x that's lower case f x on the interval a to b that's equal to f of x evaluated from a to b which is f of b minus f of a so this theorem describes the process by which we can evaluate a definite integral so let's go over some examples go ahead and evaluate this particular integral feel free to pause the video if you want to try the anti-derivative of 3x using the power rule is going to be 3x to the second power divided by 2 and the anti-derivative of 4 is 4x so let's evaluate it from two to five so f of five is going to be three times five squared over two minus four times five minus f of 2 so if we plug in 2 into f of x now keep in mind this is lower case f of x and this represents the capital f x the anti-derivative of f so this is f of five minus f of two so that's going to be three times two squared over two minus four times two now 5 squared is 25 4 times 5 is 20. 2 squared is 4 divided by 2 that's 2 and 3 times 2 is 6. 4 times 2 is 8. now 3 times 25 is 75 6 minus 2 is negative 2 times this negative sign so that's a positive 2. negative 20 plus 2 is negative 18. now we need to get common denominators so this is going to be 75 over 2 minus 36 over 2 and 75 minus 36 that's going to be 39 and that's the final answer 39 divided by 2. let's work on some more examples so use the second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate the definite integral now before we could find the anti-derivative we should foil this expression so what we have is 2x minus 3 multiplied by another 2x minus 3. so first we have 2x times 2x and that's going to give us 4x squared and then it's 2x times negative 3 so that's negative 6x and negative three times two x is negative six x and then negative three times negative three that is positive nine so now what we need to do is combine like terms and this is supposed to be a 4. negative 6 minus 6 is negative 12. so this is what we now have now lowercase f is 4x squared minus 12x plus 9. now we need to find the antiderivative capital f of x now let's start at the top so the antiderivative of x squared is going to be x cubed over three and for x it's x squared over two and the antiderivative of a constant it's going to be the constant times the variable of integration which is x so this is capital f of x and we're going to evaluate it from one to four so we have now is f of x one to four and that's equal to f of four minus f of one so let's start with f of four let's plug in four into that expression so it's gonna be four times 4 raised to the third power divided by 3 and 12 divided by 2 is 6 so it's going to be 6 times 4 squared plus 9 times four and then minus f of one so one to the third is one times four over three and one squared times six is just six and then plus nine times one or nine now four to the third power that's 64 and if we multiply that by four we're going to have 256 divided by three four squared is 16 16 times 6 is 96 and 9 times 4 is 36 and then we have minus four thirds and if we distribute the negative sign plus six minus nine so the first thing we could do is combine these two fractions because they share the same denominator 256 minus 4 is 252. negative 96 plus 36 that's negative 60 and 6 minus 9 that's negative 3. now 252 divided by 3 is 84. and 60 minus well negative 16 minus 3 is negative 63 so 84 minus 63 is 21 and that is the final answer let's work on this example find a definite integral from 1 to 4 of the square root of 5 over x so what do you think we should do in this problem well first we can rewrite the expression like this it's equivalent to the square root of 5 divided by the square root of x and the square root of 5 is a constant which we can move that to the front and so this is what we now have we can rewrite the square root of x as x raised to the one half and we're not done rewriting so now we need to take the x variable move it to the top so we could use the power rule so this is x raised to the negative one-half and now we can use the power rule so negative one-half plus one is one-half and then we need to divide that by a half which if you multiply the top and bottom by two over two one half times two is one so we just put the two on top and we're going to evaluate this from 1 to 4. so what we now have is 2 square root 5 times the square root of x from 1 to 4. so let's plug in 4 first and then we could plug in one so the square root of four is two and the square root of one well that's one and two times two is four so we have 4 square root 5 and 2 times 1 is 2 and then we can subtract the coefficients so 4 minus 2 is 2. so the final answer is 2 square root 5 and that's it let's work on one final problem use the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate this integral so what techniques should we employ because the 4 is a constant i'm going to move it to the front so this is equivalent to 1 4 and then we're integrating x plus the square root of x which is x to the one half the antiderivative of x is x squared over two and for x to the one half it's going to be x to the three over two divided by three over two or multiplied by two over three so now we can evaluate it so let's plug in one first so it's going to be one squared over two so that's one half and then one raised to the three halves is just one so that's gonna be plus two thirds and then if we plug in zero everything is going to be zero zero squared is zero and zero raised to the three over two is zero so we're left with one fourth times one-half plus two-thirds so we need to get common denominators so i'm going to multiply one-half by three over three and two thirds i'm going to multiply that by two over two so i'm going to have three over six and two times two is four three times two is six and then three plus four is seven so it's seven over six times one fourth seven times one is seven four times six is twenty four so the answer is seven over twenty four and that's it for
