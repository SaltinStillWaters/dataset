in this video we're going to go over the baseball diamond problem so we have a baseball player running from second base to third base at a speed of 20 feet per second he is currently 50 feet away from the third base and the baseball diamond field it has the shape of a square where all the side lamps are 120 feet so we need to determine the rate at which the distance between a player and the home plate is changing let's start by drawing a picture so this is going to be first space second third and this is the home plate now the player is somewhere between second and third base and he's moving towards the third base at a speed of 20 feet per second and he's currently 50 feet away from the third base now the baseball diamond field is the shape of a square and the side length is 120 so this is 120 this is 120 every side of this field is 120. so the distance between the home plate and third base is 120 feet now our goal is to focus on the rate at which the distance between the player and the home plate is changing so notice that we have a right triangle so let's redraw the picture somewhere on the side here let's call this x y and z so the goal of this problem is to determine the rate at which z is changing so we need to calculate dz dt so how can we figure out the value of dz dt what do we need to do first we need to make a list of what we know already so we have the value of x x is 50 and we have y y is 120 we currently do not have the value of z but what is the value of dx dt what is that now we know that it has to do with this number 20 feet per second is x increasing or decreasing as the player moves from second to third base this distance highlighted in green will decrease and that is represented by x so x is decreasing which means that dx dt has to be negative so in this case it's a negative 20 feet per second so now that we have this information we no longer need the pictures so let's get rid of the pictures at this point and make some useful space now we still had a right triangle so we have this equation z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared so let's calculate z x is fifty y is one twenty fifty squared is twenty five hundred and one twenty times 120 is 14 400 now if we add these two numbers this will give us 16 900 and that's equal to z squared so let's take the square root of both sides to get z so z is 130 feet so now that we have z we can calculate the z t so let's go ahead and find the derivative of this equation with respect to time so the derivative of z squared is two z dz dt and the derivative of x squared is two x d x e t the derivative of y squared will not be two y d y dt dy dt is zero so if you recall in this picture this is why this is x and this is z the person is moving towards the third base so therefore x is changing but as he's running toward the third base y is not going to change it's going to remain 120 and so because y is fixed it doesn't change it's a constant at that instant until he's moving from third base to home plate until he's moving in this direction that is then only then will y be changing but until then while he's going from second to third base y is constant and so we need to treat it as a constant and the derivative of a constant is zero so we have this expression now let's divide both sides by two and let's replace x with i mean z with 130 and x we can replace that with 50 and dx dt is negative 20. so let's divide both sides by 130. so the first thing we could do is cancel a zero and so we have 50 times negative 2 which is negative 100 divided by 13. so this is the answer it's negative 100 over 13 feet per second and let's convert that to a decimal so that's about negative 7.69 feet per second so that's the rate at which the distance between the player and the home plate is changing this is the final answer you
