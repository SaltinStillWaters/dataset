Transcript for: The Graphs of Hyperbolic Trig Functions
in this video we're going to focus on the graphs of the hyperbolic functions so let's start with hyperbolic sine let's discuss the graph of this function now hyperbolic sine is a combination of two exponential functions it's e to the x minus E to the negative X divided by 2. so think of it as being one-half e to the X and then minus one half e to the negative X or C it this way see it as the sum of these two graphs so one half e to the X Plus negative one-half e to the negative X so what we're going to do is we're going to graph each of these components of the hyperbolic sine function let's start with one half e to the x so one half e to the x is an exponential function that looks like this now if that's one half e to the x what's the negative one-half e to the negative X so to graph that we could use transformations first let's start with negative one-half e to the positive X here Y is negative X is positive with this graph we're reflecting it over the x-axis so it would look like this as you can see this is a reflection of this graph over the x-axis now if we were to plot negative one-half e to the negative X add in this negative relative to this function what's going to happen is we're going to reflect over the y axis so instead of this graph going this way it's going to be going that way like this so that's a negative one-half e to the negative X relative to the original function because we reflected it over the x axis and the y-axis the combination of that is basically reflecting it over the origin relative to that function now e to the zero is one so when you multiply that by a half this point is at one half this point here is negative one-half of course it's not drawn to scale but that's what those values should be hyperbolic sine is the combination it's the sum of these two functions so when you add a half and a negative half it's going to add up to zero so at the origin it's zero now when X goes to positive Infinity in other words as we move to the right one half e to the x is going to go to positive Infinity negative one-half e to the negative X will go to zero so when X becomes very large this portion becomes significant that is this portion and this part of the graph becomes it goes to zero so what that means is that as we move to the right hyperbolic sine its graph is going to look like one half e to the X when X becomes large so it's going to follow this asymptote now as we move to the left as X approaches negative Infinity and this part of hyperbolic sine as we can see it goes to zero it becomes insignificant and this part goes to negative Infinity as X gets as X goes to negative Infinity so hyperbolic sign is going to mirror this graph as we go to the left so that's how we can graph hyperbolic sine from the exponential functions the domain for hyperbolic sine is negative Infinity to Infinity the range is also negative Infinity to Infinity now that we have hyperbolic sine already on the page for us let's graph the reciprocal hyperbolic cosecant so knowing that hyperbolic cosecant is the reciprocal function of hyperbolic sine how would you draw the graph for hypolic cosecant when when the Y value of the hyperbolic sine function becomes very large the Y value of hyperbolic cosecant will be very small so for instance let's say this has a y value of 10. 1 over 10 is basically 0.1 in other words as this goes up hyperbolic cosecant is going to go towards zero now as we approach the origin the Y value becomes smaller and smaller so let's say over here where the Y value is one-half for hyperbolical secant the reciprocal of one-half is two over here where the Y value might be 0.1 over 0.1 is 10. so as we get closer to zero hyperbolic cosecant is going to go to Infinity it's going to become larger and larger so at one half it will be at two and as we move to the right where y increases for hyperbola hyperolical secant wise constant decrease is going to get closer and closer to zero and as we approach zero hyperbolical secant is going to go towards Infinity now the same is true for the other side over here the values are negative so hyperbolical secant will be negative over here as we go towards negative Infinity in the y direction hyperbolic secant will go towards zero as we approach zero it's going to go towards negative Infinity so that's the graph of hyperbolic cosecant it's a rough sketch of it but I want you to understand how we get it from hyperbolic sign by the way the domain for hyperbolic cosecant notice that X can be everything except zero so if we look at it from the left side it goes from negative Infinity we have a vertical asymptote at zero and it goes to positive Infinity so this is the domain four hyperbolic cosecant for the range is the same thing it goes down towards negative Infinity we have a a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero and then it goes all the way up to positive Infinity so this is the range for hyperbolic cosecant y could be everything except zero now let's talk about the graph of hyperbolic cosine hyperbolic cosine is very similar to hyperbolic sine but instead of e to the x minus E to the negative X is going to be e to the X Plus e to the negative X over 2. so we can break it up into these two exponential functions one half e to the X Plus one half e to the negative X now we already know the shape of one-half e to the x is going to look like this at least that's a rough sketch of it now one half e to the negative X we have a negative in front of X but not in front of Y so it's only going to reflect over the y-axis not the x-axis so that's positive one-half e to the negative X hyperbolic cosine is the sum of those two functions so at x equals zero both of these functions have a value of a half one half plus one half is one so hyperbolic cosine is going to start at a y value of one now when X goes to positive Infinity this part goes to zero this part goes to Infinity so hyperbolic cosine is going to mirror this graph when X becomes very large so it's going to follow this asymptote as we move to the left and go as X goes towards negative Infinity this part one half e to the X goes to zero as you can see here and one half e to the negative X goes to positive Infinity so this is going to have a greater contribution to this function when X goes to negative Infinity therefore hyperbolic cosine is going to mirror one half e to the negative X as we move to the left because this goes to zero that goes to positive Infinity 0 plus positive Infinity is just positive Infinity so that's the graph of hyperbolic cosine the domain is all real numbers X could be anything but the range is limited the lowest y value for hyperbolic cosine is one and one is included so we're going to use a bracket and it goes up to positive Infinity so now that we have the graph of hyperbolic cosine we can talk about the graph of hyperbolic secant secant is the reciprocal of cosine so looking at hyperbolic cosine the graph for it how would you draw the graph for hyperbolic cosecant what would you do so looking at this point it's one one over one is just one so at one we're going to have the same point let's say this is one here now let's say this point has a y value of 2 and this point has a y value of 3. this point two will also have a y value of two this one will have a y value of 3. when Y is 2 1 over 2 if we take the reciprocal of two we get one over two which is a half so at this point it's going to be over here it's going to be at one half now if we take 1 over 3 this will be at 1 3. and then one over fourth one fourth and so we could see what's happening here as the Y values go to Infinity as they get larger and larger the Y values of the reciprocal function is going to go to zero now the right side is a reflection of the left side dude they're symmetrical so this side it's going to be the same so hyperbolic cosecant will look something like this so that's the graph of hyperbolic secant it won't go past one as long as there's a one fungus if you put a 2 in front of it everything doubles so it'll go up to two but for unmodified hyperbolic secant the range is going to be from negative actually hyperbolic secant doesn't go below y equals zero so the range is going to be from 0 to 1. Now 1 is included we have an actual point here so we are going to have a bracket for the range of hyperbolic secant as for the domain you can see that it's rival numbers analyze it from left to right X goes to negative Infinity it starts from negative infinity and goes all the way to positive Infinity so that's the graph of hyperbolic secant now let's move on to hyperbolic tangent if you've seen my previous videos you know that hyperbolic tangent has three forms there's this one hyperbolic sine over cosine and there's this form e to the x minus E to the negative X over e to the X Plus e to the negative X and then there's this form e to the two x minus one over e to the 2x Plus 1. now it's easier to graph hyperbolic cos I mean hyperbolic tangent using this form of that function so if we were to make a table and let's say we were to plug in 0. into this expression what would we get so this would be e to the 0 minus 1 over e to the zero plus one anything raised to zero power is one so one minus 1 is going to give us zero so hyperbolic tangent of zero is zero which means it touches the origin now let's look at the end behavior of this graph as X goes to positive Infinity what happens to y well this becomes e to Infinity minus 1 over e to the infinity plus one the minus one and the plus one they become insignificant now both of these are e to the two x they're going to grow at the same rate and because they grow at the same rate as X increases when X becomes very large they will cancel and this is going to approach one so as X goes towards positive Infinity y will approach one now what about when X goes to negative Infinity what happens to y so this will be e to negative Infinity minus 1 over e to the negative infinity plus one e to the negative Infinity is one over e to the affinity and 1 over a large number is a small number so 1 over e to Infinity is virtually zero it gets closer and closer to zero zero minus one is negative one zero plus one is one and this approaches negative one so when X becomes very large when y approaches 1 which means that we have a horizontal asymptote at one when X becomes very small when it goes to negative Infinity y approaches negative one so that's going to be another horizontal asymptote so hyperbolic tangent as we go to the left it's going to get closer and closer to negative 1 and as we go to the right it's going to get closer and closer to positive one so the graph it looks like this it passes through the origin it starts from one asymptote and gradually Works its way towards the other asymptote so that's how you can graph hyperbolic tangent if you know just one point in this case the origin and if you know the end behavior of the function so now that we know the graph for hyperbolic tangent let's focus on the reciprocal graph hyperbolic cotangent so what can we say about hyperbolic cotangent now over here the Y value is one if we were to find the reciprocal of that one over one is one but keep in mind this is not equal to one but it's less than one so let's say if it's 0.9 1 over 0.9 is a number that's close to one but just above one so what's going to happen is hyperbolic cotangent will have the same asymptotes at one and negative one the difference is as we get closer to one but we're still under or below one hyperbolic cotangent will approach one but it's going to be above one as opposed to below one so it's going to approach the asymptote but from above it rather than below it so it's going to be on this side here and the proof of that is just remember one over point nine if you were to plug it in your calculator I don't have one with me right now it's going to be a bit A number close one but bigger than one and the same is true over here here it might be like negative 0.9 1 over negative 0.9 might be like negative 1.1 or something so we need to know is that for hyperbolic cotangent it's going to approach the asymptote but rather than from within the two isotopes it's going to be outside of it now as we approach Zero from the right side let's say this is 0.1 over 0.1 might be like Point like positive 10. so as we approach Zero from the right side it's going to go up towards positive Infinity as you approach Zero from the left side this is not going to be like positive 0.1 but negative 0.1 over negative point one is like negative 10. so this is going to go towards negative Infinity from the left side as you get closer to zero so that's the graph of hyperbolic cotangent is going to look something like this it's not a perfect sketch but that's the general shape it's outside of the two horizontal asymptotes and because this goes to zero we're going to have a vertical asymptote at x equals zero because one over zero is undefined so now let's talk about the domain and range the domain for a hyperbolic tangent we can see that it's all real numbers ask for the range it's bounded by the two horizontal asymptotes now for hyperbolic cotangent we need to incorporate the vertical asymptote so looking at it from left to right X goes from negative Infinity it stops at zero at the vertical asymptote and X can continue towards positive Infinity so we just have to take out zero so it's going to be negative Infinity to zero Union zero to Infinity as for the range we're going to analyze it from the bottom to the top the lowest y value is negative Infinity then it stops at this asymptote at negative one it starts back up at positive one and goes to positive Infinity so for the bottom half the range is going to be negative Infinity to negative 1. and it's going to stop there and for the upper half it's going to start at positive 1 and go to positive Infinity so that's the graph for hyperbolic cotangent of x so hopefully this video gave you a good introduction into understanding the graphs Behind These functions and how they work because once you understand where they come from you can easily remember how to draw them rather than simply relying on memorization
