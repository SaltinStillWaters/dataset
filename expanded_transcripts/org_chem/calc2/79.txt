Transcript for: Product Rule With 3 Functions - Derivatives | Calculus
what is the derivative of x squared times sine x times ln x what do you think the answer is to that question well in this video we're going to talk about how to do that now you need to be familiar with something called the product rule the derivative of f times g is equal to f prime times g plus f times g prime so that's if we have two things multiplied to each other but here this problem has three components multiplied to each other three different functions so the formula is going to be a little different we want to find the derivative of f times g times h so we need to do is take the derivative of the first part f which is f prime and then you're going to multiply by the two other components g and h next we're going to take the derivative of the second part g leaving the other two functions the same so it's going to be f times g prime times h for the last part we're just going to differentiate the last function h leaving the first two the same so it's going to be f times g times h prime so that's the formula that we want to use in order to find the derivative of this function so at this point what we want to do is identify what f g and h are so f is going to be let me write that here f is going to be x squared g is going to be sine x and h will be the natural log of x so now let's find f prime the derivative of x squared is going to be 2x as for g prime the derivative of sine is cosine and as for h prime the derivative of the natural log of x is 1 over x now for those of you who might not know these things if you need a review of derivatives i'm going to post a link in the description section below where you can review the derivative of trigonometric functions natural logs and how to use the power rule so feel free to take a look at that if you need to review that but let's continue with this problem so now all we need to do is plug in these values into this expression so the derivative of this function is going to be f prime which is 2x times g which is sine x times h that's ln x plus f that's x squared times g prime which is cosine x times h which is ln x and then we have f g times h prime which is 1 over x now this is our answer but we can simplify it a bit x squared times one over x which is x squared divided by x that's simply x so this term reduces to x sine x the last thing that we could do is we can factor out an x because we have it in each term so if we want to we can write our answer like this x and then times 2 sine x ln x plus x cosine x ln x and then plus sine x and that's as far as we can go with this problem that's all we can do so now you know how to use the triple product rule when you have a derivative problem that looks like this so that's basically it for this video that is the end of the lesson now if you haven't done so already don't forget to subscribe to this channel also when you get a chance take a look at the description section below in this video the reason for that is i'm going to post some links where you could find more problems on derivatives such as derivatives of exponential functions logarithmic differentiation product rule chain rule quotient rule and other things that you might be tested on that relates to this topic so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance and thanks again for watching
