Transcript for: Finding Particular Solutions of Differential Equations Given Initial Conditions
let's say if we have the differential equation f prime of x is equal to 3x and also we're given the initial condition that f of 0 is equal to 7. with this information find a particular solution to this differential equation so how can we solve that differential equation well let's begin by finding the anti-derivative of both sides of that equation so the anti-derivative of f prime of x is equal to the anti-derivative of 3x so the integration of f prime of x is just going to be f of x and the anti-derivative of 3x is going to be 3x squared over 2 plus c now what we need to do is we need to solve for c anytime you want to find a particular solution of a certain differential equation so what we're going to do is plug in the initial condition f of 0 is 7. so 0 is the x value 7 correlates to the y value or the function value so we're going to replace the function with 7. so i'm going to write it like this first f of 0 is equal to 3 times 0 squared over 2 plus c now we know that f of 0 is 7. so i can replace this with seven so seven is equal to zero squared times three over two is zero so seven is equal to c so now i can rewrite the function replacing this with c so i could say that f of x is equal to 3 over 2 x squared plus c and this is the answer i'm looking for so that is the particular solution to this differential equation now let's go ahead and work on another example let's say that f prime of x is equal to six x squared minus five and we're given the initial condition that f of one is four go ahead and solve that differential equation so let's begin by finding the antiderivative of both sides of the function so on the left side it's just going to be f of x on the right side the anti-derivative of x squared using the power rule you need to add one to the exponent 2 plus 1 is 3 and then divide by that number and the anti-derivative of five is simply five x and don't forget the constant c so now let's replace x with one so f of one is going to be six divided by three which is two times one to the third minus five times one plus c now let's replace f of one with four because f of one is equal to four so we have four is equal to two minus five plus c two minus five is negative three and to solve for c we need to add 3 to both sides and 4 plus 3 is 7 so c is equal to 7. so now that we have the value of c we can write the final answer so this is the goal if you could solve for this then you can get the answer based on this expression you just need to replace c with 7. so f of x is going to be 6 divided by 2 which is this supposed to be a three by the way six divided by three which is two x cubed minus five x plus seven so this is the solution to the differential equation now instead of being given the first derivative sometimes we may receive the second derivative of the function let's say the second derivative is 2x minus 3. this time we need two initial conditions one for the first derivative and one for the original function so if you want to try it go ahead and determine a function for f of x solve this particular differential equation so let's begin by integrating both sides of that equation so the antiderivative of the second derivative f double prime is the first derivative f prime of x and on the right side the anti-derivative of x is going to be x squared divided by two and for negative three it becomes negative three x plus some constant c now we need to use this particular initial condition to solve for c so f prime of 1 that's going to be 2 over 2 which is 1 times x squared so that's 1 squared minus three times one plus c and f prime of one is equal to two one squared is one three times one is three and so this is what we have one minus three is negative two so i need to add two to both sides two plus two is four so c is equal to four so now we can write the general equation for f prime of x so f prime of x is going to be 2 divided by 2 is 1 so that's just x squared minus 3x and c is 4. so this is the first answer but we need to go all the way to f of x so now let's integrate both sides of that function so we have the anti-derivative of f prime of x and that's going to equal the anti-derivative of x squared minus 3x plus 4. so on the left this becomes f of x and on the right we have x cubed divided by three minus three x squared over two plus four x now instead of using c again we're gonna use a different constant of integration so let's choose the next letter d now f of zero is three so we have f of zero and zero to the third power is zero zero squared times three over two that's zero and then four times zero plus d now f of zero is three so d is equal to three so now we could write the final answer and that is that f of x is equal to one third x cubed minus three over two x squared plus four x and then replace d with three so this is the solution to the differential equation let's try another example so let's say that the second derivative is x squared minus four and f prime of two is three and f of one is negative four go ahead and solve the differential equation so let's start by integrating both sides so on the left the anti-derivative of the second derivative is going to be the first derivative on the right the anti-derivative of x squared is x cubed over three and for negative four becomes negative four x and plus c now we know that f prime of two is three so let's replace x with two so we have two to the third power minus three i mean divided by three minus four times two plus c now f prime of two is three and two to the third power is eight and four times two is eight so now let's add eight to both sides three plus eight is eleven and so we have eleven is equal to eight over three plus c now to get rid of the fraction i'm going to multiply everything by three and so 11 times 3 is 33 8 over 3 times 3 is just 8. and then c times 3 is three c so now let's subtract both sides by eight thirty three minus eight is twenty five and then we need to divide by three so we have c is twenty five over three so now we can write the final answer f prime of x is equal to one third x cubed minus four x plus 25 over 3. so if we plugged in 2 we should get 3. so now let's integrate this function so the integration of f prime is simply f and the antiderivative of x cubed is going to be x to the fourth divided by four and for x it's x squared over two and then for the constant 25 over three it's going to be 25 x over 3 plus a new constant d so now let's determine f of 1 so 1 to the fourth is just 1 and 3 times 4 is 12. and then 4 divided by 2 is 2 times 1 squared which is 1 and then it's going to be 25 over 3 plus some constant d now let's replace f of 1 with negative 4. so we have 1 over 12. minus 2 plus 25 over 3 plus d now to get rid of all the fractions i'm going to multiply everything by 12. i guess i don't need this information anymore so negative 4 times 12 that's negative 48. 12 divided by 12 is 1 2 times twelve is twenty-four twelve divided by three is four times twenty-five so that's gonna be a hundred and then plus twelve d now 100 minus 24 is 76 plus 1 that's going to be 77. so we have negative 48 is equal to 77 plus 12 d so negative 48 minus 77 that's negative 125 and then we need to divide both sides by 12. so d is negative 125 over 12. now we can write the final answer and that is that f of x is 1 over 12 x to the fourth minus two x squared plus twenty five x over three minus one twenty five over twelve and so this is the solution of the differential equation it was a little bit longer than the other problems but that's how you could find it so that's it for this video thanks for watching you
