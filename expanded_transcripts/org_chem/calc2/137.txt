Transcript for: Concavity, Inflection Points, and Second Derivative
in this video we're going to talk about how to determine the inflection points of a function and the intervals where the function is concave up and concave down so let's talk about concavity first so in this picture the function is concave up everywhere so that's how it looks like and this is the shape of a graph that's concave down now whenever the function is concave up the second derivative is positive which means that the first derivative is increasing when it's concave down the second derivative is negative which means the first derivative is decreasing so make sure you understand that about concavity now to determine the inflection point the inflection point occurs when the second derivative is equal to zero and there's something else that must occur as well at the inflection point the concavity must change either from negative to positive or positive to negative so let me give you some examples so if we focus on the left side of that curve notice that it's concave up you can see the concave up shape and the right side is concave down so at some point in the middle the concavity changes so the point where the concavity changes and that is the inflection point now for the curve on the right it's the reverse so here the graph is concave down and on the right side we could see that it's concave up so in the middle it has to switch from concave down to concave up so anytime the concavity changes from positive to negative or negative to positive we have an inflection point in the middle so the inflection point typically is between the two relative extrema here we have a maximum and here we have a minimum in between those two extreme values exists an inflection point here we have a minimum and on this side we have a maximum and in between those values we have the inflection point so those are some things that you want to keep in mind but now let's work on some practice problems let's put this information to good use so let's say that f of x is equal to x cubed minus nine x squared plus seven x identify all inflection points and determine the intervals where the function is concave up and concave down so the first thing that we need to do is we need to find the second derivative of the function so let's begin by finding the first derivative the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of x squared is 2x times 9 that's 18x and the derivative of x is one times seven so that gives us seven now let's move on to the second derivative the derivative of x squared is two x times three that's six x and the derivative of negative eighteen x is just negative 18. now once we have the second derivative set it equal to zero and find the inflection points so if we factor out six six x divided by six is x negative eighteen divided by six is negative three so we have a potential inflection point at three if you set x minus three equal to zero and add three to both sides you'll get x is equal to three now let's create a sign chart on a number line let's say if we plug in a number that's greater than three like four will the second derivative be positive or negative four minus three is equal to a positive number so it's going to be positive on the right side if we plug in 2 a number less than 3 2 minus 3 is negative so on the left side it's concave down because the second derivative is negative on the right side is concave up all the way to the left we have negative infinity and to the right we have positive infinity so now let's write the intervals so the function is concave down from negative infinity to three and it's concave up between 3 and positive infinity now notice that the concavity changes at 3 it changes from negative to positive so that tells us that we have an inflection point at x equals three now sometimes you may need to find a y coordinate if you do plug in three into the original function to get the y coordinate if you want to write the inflection point as an ordered pair so let's go ahead and do that but first i'm going to make some space so let's plug in 3 f of 3 is going to be 3 to the third power minus nine times three squared plus seven times three if we multiply three three times we'll get twenty seven three squared is nine and seven times three is twenty one twenty seven plus 21 is 48 9 times 9 is 81 and then 48 minus 81 is negative 33. so the inflection point exists at 3 comma negative 33 for this problem so you can write that as an ordered pair now let's work on another problem so let's say that f of x is x to the fourth plus four x cubed plus one so go ahead and find all of the inflection points and the intervals where the function is concave up and concave down so feel free to pause the video if you wanna work on this problem so let's begin by finding the first derivative just like we did before so the derivative of x to the fourth using the power rule is 4x cubed and the derivative of x cube is 3x squared times 4 that's going to be 12x squared and the derivative of a constant is 0. now for the second derivative if we differentiate x cubed that's going to be 3x squared times 4 so that's 12x squared and the derivative of x squared is 2x times 12 that's going to be 24x so let's set it equal to 0 and let's take out the greatest common factor which is 12x 12x squared divided by 12x is x 24x divided by 12x is 2. and so if we set each factor equal to 0 we're going to get two points of interest x is equal to zero and x is equal to negative two so let's create a sign chart and let's put these numbers in ascendant order now let's pick a test point that's greater than zero so let's try one twelve times one is positive one plus two is positive if we multiply two positive numbers it will give us a positive result now let's pick a number between negative two and zero so let's try negative one twelve times negative one is negative but negative one plus two is positive a negative times a positive is a negative and now if we pick a number less than negative two like negative three twelve times negative three is negative negative three plus two is negative so if you multiply two negative numbers it will give you a positive number so here it's concave up in red and it's concave down in blue let's not forget the infinity symbols so at this point now that we've completed the sign chart we can now write the intervals where it's concave up and concave down so let's start where it's concave up it's concave up between negative infinity and negative 2 and then union for the other section 0 to infinity so you just got to write it from left to right negative infinity to negative 2 and then to connect to the other side union 0 to infinity now it's concave down between negative two and zero now we need to determine the inflection points at negative two the concavity changes from concave up to concave down so that's an inflection point and zero is also an inflection point because the concavity changes from negative to positive from down to up so now let's get the y coordinates that correspond to the x coordinates for the inflection points so let's plug in zero first so if we plug in zero into the equation this is just going to equal one so that one of the inflection points is going to be zero comma one now for the other one let's plug in negative two negative two to the fourth power is positive sixteen negative two to the third power is negative eight 4 times negative 8 is negative 32 and 16 minus 32 is negative 16. negative 16 plus 1 is negative 15. so the second inflection point is going to be negative 2 comma negative 15. and so that's it so that's how you can determine the inflection points and the intervals where the function is concave up and concave down so keep that in mind it's concave up whenever the second derivative is positive and it's concave down when the second derivative is negative or less than zero and the inflection point occurs where the second derivative is equal to zero and if the concavity changes if it doesn't change then it's not an inflection point so for example let's say if we performed if we got the second derivative and these were the points of interest so let's say the second derivative is positive when x is greater than 5 but negative between 4 and 5 negative at between 1 and 4 but positive 1 is less than one so one would be an inflection point because the concavity changes and five is an inflection point but four is not an inflection point because the concavity doesn't change across four it doesn't change sign so this would not be an inflection point so keep that in mind the concavity has to change for it to be in a flexion point you
