Transcript for: Increasing and Decreasing Functions - Calculus
in this video we're going to focus on finding the intervals where a function is increasing and when it's decreasing so let's say if you have a graph anytime the graph is going upward if it's going up then the function is increasing the first derivative is positive now if the graph is going down it can be going down in many different ways when it's going down the function is decreasing and the first derivative will be negative so anytime the function is decreasing the slope is negative and when it's increasing the slope is positive so let's say if we have this particular function let's say that f of x is equal to x squared minus three x plus one so what we need to do in order to find where the function is increasing and decreasing without graphing it we need to find the first derivative set it equal to zero and make a sign chart and then we can determine where it's increasing and decreasing so the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of 3x is 3. now let's set that equal to 0 and if we add 3 to both sides we see that 2x is equal to 3 and if we divide by 2 the only critical number that we have in this example is 3 over 2. now let's make a sign chart so let's put 3 over 2 in it now let's pick a number that's greater than 3 over 2 let's say 4. if we plug in 4 into the first derivative will it give us a positive number or a negative number two times four is eight minus three that's five so that's positive so the first derivative is positive when x is greater than three over two but now what about when x is less than 3 over 2 let's say if x is 0 2 times 0 minus 3 is negative 3 so when it's less than 3 over 2 the first derivative is negative so with this information how can we write the interval where the function is increasing and when it's decreasing now all the way to the right we have positive infinity and to the left we have negative infinity so we could say that the function is increasing between 3 over 2 and infinity and it's decreasing when the first derivative is negative and so that's between negative infinity and three over two so it's decreasing in this section but it's increasing in this section let's work on another example so let's say that f of x is equal to x cubed minus nine x squared plus 24x so go ahead and find the intervals where the function is increasing and when it's decreasing if you want take a minute pause the video and go ahead and try this example give it a shot so let's start by finding the first derivative of the function the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of x is one so we have three x squared minus eighteen x plus twenty four and we can set that equal to zero so let's begin by factoring out the gcf which is 3. 3x squared divided by 3 is x squared negative 18x divided by 3 is negative 6x 24 divided by 3 is 8. so now we need to factor this particular trinomial so what two numbers multiply to eight but add to the middle coefficient negative six four times two is eight but negative four plus negative two adds up to negative six and still multiplies to positive eight so it's going to be x minus four times x minus two so if we set each factor equal to zero this will give us two critical numbers the first one is at x equals four and the second one is at x equals two so now let's make a sign chart i kept this part because i want the first derivative in its factored form it's going to be very helpful for analyzing the sign shine so let's put the critical numbers in a set in order so we have 2 and 4. now the multiplicity of each critical number is odd that means the signs will change across each critical number so if we find the first sign we can easily find the rest so let's start with a number that's greater than four let's try five so five minus four is positive five minus two is positive if you multiply two positive numbers it will give you a positive number so the others should be negative and positive they're gonna alternate so if we try three three minus four is negative three minus two is positive a negative times a positive will give us a negative result let's say if we try something less than two like zero zero minus four is negative zero minus two is negative a negative times a negative is equal to a positive number so now at this point we can determine the intervals where the function is increasing and decreasing don't forget to include your infinity symbols in the number line so the function is decreasing where it's the first derivative is negative and the function is increasing where the first derivative is positive so it's decreasing between two and four but it's increasing between four and infinity and negative infinity and two so let's write the final answer the function is increasing from negative infinity to 2 union 4 to infinity and it's decreasing only between 2 and 4. and so that's it that's how you can find out whether or not a function is increasing or decreasing here's another problem that you can work on this time we're going to have an absolute value function so determine where the function is increasing and decreasing write the intervals for it now for this one there's no need to find the first derivative because it's very easy to graph this function so let's start with the parent function make a bigger graph so if we were to graph the absolute value of x it would look like this it's going to open upward it has a slope of one and the vertex will be at the origin when x is zero but now let's say if we wanted to graph the absolute value of x minus three it's going to shift horizontally 3 units to the right so it's going to look like this now if we were to graph our original function it's still going to shift 3 units to the right so it's going to be somewhere over here but because of the negative sign it's going to open downward instead of upward but with a slope of 2 so it's going to be more narrow so to speak so with this information we can tell where it's increasing and when it's decreasing it's increasing when the function is going up as you view it from left to right and it's decreasing when the function is going down so it's decreasing on the right side increasing on the left side so if we were to make a number line it changes at 3 when x is 3. so to the right of three the function is decreasing which means the first derivative is negative because as you can see the slope is negative on the right side on the left side the function is increasing so the slope is positive so it's increasing on the left of three and decreasing on the right so now to write the final answer the function is increasing from negative infinity to three and these represent x values and it's decreasing from 3 to positive infinity and so that's it so to identify this point all you need to do is take the inside x minus 3 and set it equal to 0. when you do that that's how you can get x equals three so for example let's say if i have this particular a function let's say two x minus eight actually let me use a different one let's say uh three x plus four so to find the vertex i'm gonna set the inside part of the function equal to zero and so the graph is going to change at negative 4 over 3. so when i graph it it's going to look like this negative 4 thirds is like negative 1.33 but this graph is going to open upward instead of downward so notice that it's decreasing on the left side and increasing on the right side so we can write the final answer like this it's increasing from negative 4 over 3 to infinity and it's decreasing from negative infinity to negative 4 over 3. you
