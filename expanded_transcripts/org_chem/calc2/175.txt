Transcript for: Work Problems - Calculus
in this video we're going to talk about how to solve work related problems as it relates to calculus so let's start with the basics how much work is required to lift a five kilogram book two meters high above the ground so if you wish to calculate the work done by a constant force the work is equal to the force multiplied by the displacement and you need to know that force is mass times acceleration and the acceleration in the y direction is g which represents gravitational acceleration so for this problem replacing f with mg the work required to lift up something is mgd m is the mass in kilograms that's five kilograms g is the gravitational acceleration that's 9.8 meters per second squared and d is the distance in meters 5 times 2 is 10 and 10 times 9.8 is 98. so the answer for part a is 98 joules and that's it now for part b how much work is required to lift a 30 pound box four feet off the ground the units are different now when you see the weight in pounds this doesn't represent mass weight is a force so all we need to do is use this equation so the work done is going to be the force of 30 pounds multiplied by a distance of 4 feet so 30 times 4 is 120 so it's going to be 120 foot pounds which is another unit of work number two find the work done in pushing a car a distance of 15 meters with a constant force of 500 newtons so anytime you wish to find the work done by constant force you can use that equation so the force is 500 newtons and the distance is 15 meters so we could just multiply those two numbers and don't forget a newton times a meter is a joule so the work done is going to be 7500 joules and that's all you need to do for this problem number three a variable force in newton's acting on an object is represented by the function f of x is equal to x squared minus four x plus seven where x is the distance in meters from the origin how much work is required to move the object from x equal one to x equal four the work done by a variable force is the definite integral from a to b of the force function times dx so in this case a is one b is four based on the values that we see here f of x is x squared minus four x plus seven the antiderivative of x squared is x cubed divided by three and the antiderivative of x is x squared over two and the antiderivative of seven is seven x so let's evaluate it from one to four so if we plug in four it's going to be four to the third over three and then four divided by two is two and then times four squared plus seven times four and then we need to plug in one so it's going to be one over three and then two x squared so two times one squared plus seven times one now four to the third is 64 and four squared is sixteen seven times four is twenty eight and on the right we have one third minus two plus seven so this is sixty four over 3 2 times 16 is 32 and if we distribute the negative sign it's going to be negative 1 3 plus 2 minus 7. so now let's combine like terms so we can combine these two 64 minus one is 63 so that's 63 divided by three negative 32 plus 28 is negative 4 and 2 minus 7 is negative 5. now 63 divided by 3 that's 21 and negative 4 minus 5 is 9. 21 minus 9 is 12. so the answer is 12 joules number four a force of 50 pounds is required to hold a spring stretch 5 inches beyond its natural life how much work is required to stretch it from its natural life to 10 inches beyond its natural life and foot pounds so let's talk about springs so let's say this is a spring that it's in its natural state in order to stretch a spring you need to exert a force and in order to hold it at this position you have to apply a certain force the spring wants to snap back and so there's a restoring force that wishes to pull it back so to calculate the force that's required to hold it at the new position that force is equal to the spring constant times x where x is the distance between its natural length and its current lift now k is a constant and k can be found by taking the force divided by x so in this problem we need to find k 50 pounds of force is required to stretch the spring five inches beyond its natural left so x is 5 and 50 divided by 5 is 10 so k is 10 pounds per inch so now that we have k we can write the force as a function of x so it's going to be k times x or 10x so that's the force required to stretch the spring at any distance x from its natural life so if we want to stretch it let's say 20 inches from its natural length the force would be 10 times 20 or 200 pounds so now we can calculate the work the work done is going to be the definite integral of f of x dx so we wish to calculate the work required to stretch it from its natural length that's when x is 0 to 10 inches beyond its natural length which x is 10 x is the distance from the natural length to its current position so the work is going to be the integral from 0 to 10 f of x which is 10x times dx the antiderivative of 10x is going to be 10x squared over 2. and so ten divided by two is five so it's going to be five x squared evaluated from zero to ten and that's five times ten squared minus five times zero ten squared is a hundred and so it's five times a hundred which is five hundred and the units are pounds times inches now we wanted to convert it to pounds times feet so one foot is equal to 12 inches so the unit inches will cancel and so this becomes 500 divided by 12 foot pounds now we can reduce 512 so 500 we can write that as 125 times 4 and 12 we can write that as 3 times 4 and so we could cancel a 4. and so the final answer is going to be 125 over 3 pounds times feet and this is it number five a force of 60 newtons is required to hold a spring that has been stretched from its natural length of 12 centimeters to 17 centimeters how much work is done in stretching the spring from 15 centimeters to 20 centimeters so the first thing we need to do is calculate k so we know that the force required to hold a spring beyond its natural length is k times x where x is the distance between where you're holding the spring and its natural life so let's say this is the natural length of the spring that's 12 centimeters and we stretched it beyond its natural length so this distance here that's x 17 is the total distance between point a and point b x is the difference between 17 and 12. so in this example x is 5 centimeters when a force of 60 newtons is applied so 60 equals k times 5 so k is going to be 60 divided by 5 which is 12 and it's newtons per centimeter now let's get k in newtons per meter so let's convert five centimeters to meters one meter is a hundred centimeters so five divided by a hundred is point zero five meters now k is f divided by x so we have 60 newtons divided by .05 meters and so that's going to be 1200 newtons per meter so that's the force in terms of x as a function it's k times x or 1200x so the work required is going to be the definite integral from a to b but we're comparing these values to its natural length of 12. so the difference between 12 and 15 is 3 centimeters but in meters that's 3 divided by 100 so it's 0.03 and the difference between 20 and the natural life of 12 is 8 centimeters or 0.08 meters and then it's going to be f of x dx so the anti-derivative of x is x squared over two evaluated from point zero three to point zero eight and twelve hundred divided by two is six hundred so we have six hundred x squared so now let's plug in point zero eight so it's 600 times .08 squared minus 600 times .03 squared 0.08 squared times 600 that's 3.84 and .03 squared times 600 is 0.54 and so the final answer is 3.3 joules and so that's the work required to stretch the spring from 15 centimeters to 20 centimeters number six an 80 foot long rope with a weight of three pounds per foot hangs over the edge of a building that is 200 feet high how much work is required to pull the entire rope to the top of the building so let's draw a picture so let's say this is the building and here we have a rope that hangs on the building now let's say this is 0 and this is 80. let's make this the origin so we want to lift that entire rope to the top of the building how much work is required well we know that work is equal to force times distance and force is basically weight weight is a force and you can describe the weight as being the weight density of the rope which is pounds per feet times the left of the rope which is in feet if you see it that way notice that the unit's feet cancel and it gives you the weight in pounds which is a force now this expression is similar to f is equal to kx x can be measured in feet k for the spring constant can be measured in pounds per fee because k is f divided by x where if f is in pounds and x is in feet k is pounds per feet so the generic force equation is going to be the weight density of the rope in pounds per feet times the length of the rope or the distance that the rope travels which is x so in this case it's three pounds per feet times x so that's the function that tells us the force that's required to lift up the rope in terms of x now to calculate the work required it's going to be the definite integral from a to b f of x dx now we need to determine what a is and what's b a is going to be 0 b is 80. so it's going to be from 0 to 80. f of x is 3x and then dx so the antiderivative of 3x is 3x squared over 2 evaluated from 0 to 80. so that's going to be 3 over 2 times 80 squared minus 3 over 2 times 0 squared now 80 times 80 that's 6400 if we multiply that by 3 over 2 this will give us 9 600 and the units is going to be pounds times fee for this problem now let's try another example part b how much work is required to pull half of the rope to the top of the building so let's draw a new picture so let's say this is the building and let's say this is the rope now it's best to break it up into two parts so the rope is 80 feet long and we need to move it up by some distance x now you want to calculate the work that's required to lift the upper half and the bottom half separately so let's calculate the work that's required to lift the top portion of the rope now this entire part is moving to the top of the building so the entire first half for the rope is going to be lifted to the top so we can calculate that answer using the same technique as part a and so it's going to be the integration from 0 to 40 3x dx because that part is going to be lifted up by x so it's going to be 3x squared over two evaluated from zero to forty so that's three over two times forty squared minus zero squared 40 squared is 1600 times three over two so that's going to be 2400 pounds times feet now to calculate the work that's required to lift the bottom half you need to realize that the bottom half doesn't move by a variable distance x all of it moves exactly by 40 feet because this part is not going to go over the top of the building it's still going to be hanging along the side of the building so that entire segment moves up by a distance of 40 feet because that's half the length of the rope so everything is going to be the same but the distance here won't be x it's going to be 40. now we're going to integrate it from 40 to 80 but it's going to be 3 instead of x so it's not going to be 3x but 3 times 40 dx so which is 120. the antiderivative of 120 is 120x evaluated from 40 to 80. so to 120 times 80 minus 40. eighty minus forty is forty and forty times one twenty is forty eight hundred so if you add up these two values twenty four hundred plus forty eight hundred that's going to be seventy two hundred with the units pounds times feet and this is the final answer another quick way to get this answer is it's always going to be three-fourths of the answer in part a so in part a it was 9 600 pounds times feet to lift up the entire rope to the building now if you want to lift up just the first half to the top of the building it's going to require three fourths of the work required to lift up the entire rope it takes more work to lift up the first half than the second half because as you lift up the first half you're pulling up the entire rope when you're lifting up the second half it's just the bottom portion which is a lot easier to do so when you begin to lift up the rope it's hard to lift up at the beginning but towards the end it gets easier because there's less of it that's hanging down so anytime you wish to calculate the work that's required to pull half of the rope to the top of the building it's going to be 75 percent of the work required to pull the entire rope to the top of the building 9 600 times 0.75 is 7 200. number seven how much work is required to lift a 300 pound crate up a distance of 200 feet using a rope that weighs four pounds per foot so there's two parts the first part is we need to lift up the crate so how much work is required to lift up a box or a crate the work required is simply force times distance and so the force is the weight of the crate which is 300 pounds and we're lifting it up by a distance of 200 feet so it's going to be 300 times 200 and that is 60 000 pounds times fee so that's the work required just to lift the crate now we need to calculate the work required to lift up the rope by a distance of 200 feet so first we need to write an equation for the force that's required to lift up the rope in terms of x and it's going to be the weight density in pounds per feet times the distance that we're lifting it up so the force equation it's going to be 4 pounds per feet times x or simply 4x so the work required is going to be the definite integral from a to b so from 0 to 200 we're going to integrate 4x dx so the anti-derivative of 4x is 4x squared over two evaluated from zero to two hundred so four divided by two is two so we have two x squared and so that's going to be two times two hundred squared minus 0 squared 200 squared is 40 000. if we multiply that by 2 that's going to give us 80 000 pounds times feet so the total work required to lift up the crate along with the rope is going to be the sum of these two numbers and so sixty thousand plus eighty thousand is a hundred and forty thousand let's see if i can fit that here so it's gonna be 140 000 pounds times feet so that's the total work required to lift up the crate and the rope you just need to calculate the work required for each item separately and then just add it up let's work on this last problem an inverted circular cone with a height of 12 meters and a radius of 5 meters is filled with water to a height of 9 meters how much work is required to empty the tank by pumping all of the water to the top of the tank well let's draw the inverted circular cone and then this is going to be the water level now the cone it has a radius of 5 meters and the height of 12 meters the height of the water is 9 meters and so this distance here between the top of the cone and the top of the water level that stream that's 12-9 how can we determine the work required to pump all of the water to the top of the tank the generic formula that you could use is this equation the work required is going to be the density of order times the gravitational acceleration times the definite integral from a to b of the volume of a cross section as a function of x times the displacement and then dx so if we draw a cross section which is going to be the shape of a cylinder with a height of delta x we need to write an expression that tells us the volume of that cross-sectional cylinder now if you're wondering how to get this equation or at least the foundation of it here's what you could do we'll get back to this cross section we know that work is equal to force times distance and force is mass times acceleration the acceleration in the y direction due to gravity is g gravitational acceleration so you can replace f with mg and d is basically the displacement now density which is indicated in physics by the row symbol is mass over volume so mass is density times volume so the work is going to be density times volume times gravitational acceleration times displacement and so it's going to be density times gravitational acceleration times the integral of the volume as the function of x times the displacement as a function of x dx from a to b but that's where this equation comes from if you wanted to know that now this cross-sectional cylinder has a radius r and the height we said is delta x the volume of the cylinder is pi r squared times the height now the height is delta x we need to write a relationship between r and x and we're going to use similar triangles to do that so we have this triangle and this part of the triangle what is the height of that part of the triangle well first this cross sectional area we're going to say it's x units deep therefore this portion has to be 12 minus x so this is going to be 12 minus x and the entire height of the triangle the large triangle that's going to be 12. this part is 5 and this portion here is r so for the small triangle we can say the ratio is r over 12 minus x and for the large triangle it's has a ratio of five to twelve if we look at the radius to the height so if we multiply both sides of this equation by 12 minus x we can see that r is going to be 5 over 12 times 12 minus x so the volume as a function of x is going to be pi times the radius squared that's 5 over 12 12 minus x squared and the height is delta x now in dental of integrals we're going to replace delta x with dx 5 squared is 25 12 squared is 144. so the volume is going to be 25 pi over 144 times 12 minus x squared dx now what about the displacement so this cross section this little piece we're going to pump it out to the top of the tank so we're going to lift it up by a distance x so the displacement function for this problem is simply x now let's plug in everything to our definite integral so the density of water in kilograms per cubic meter is a thousand g is 9.8 then we have the integral from a to b where those values represent the depth of water so the depth of water ranges from 3 to 12. the top part of the water is three meters below the top of the tank and the bottom part is 12 meters below the top of the tank so we're going to integrate it from 3 to 12. now at this point i don't need this picture anymore because it's taking up space so let me just rewrite this expression on the left side so it's going to be a thousand times 9.8 times the integral from 3 to 12 and the volume function is what we have here that's 25 pi over 144 times 12 minus x squared and the displacement we said is simply x for this problem so we're going to add x here now if you type this expression into your calculator you should get this as your final answer 6.82 times 10 to the sixth joules and that's it hopefully you have one of those graphing calculators that has the ability to evaluate definite integrals if you need to uh do it by hand you need to foil this expression and then distribute x you can move this constant to the front and then integrate the polynomial from 3 to 12. and then you should also get this answer as well if you do it correctly and avoid making mistakes so that's it for this video thanks for watching you
