Transcript for: Intermediate Value Theorem
now let's talk about ivt the intermediate value theorem the intermediate value theorem states that if f is continuous on a closed interval a to b and f of a does not equal f of b and k is any number that's between f of a and f b then there's at least one number c on the interval a to b such that f c is equal to k now let's go ahead and apply this information so how can you use the intermediate value theorem to show that there's a root or a zero in this function within the specified interval where the interval is from 0 to 2. how can you use the intermediate value theorem to prove that go ahead and try so first we need to find the value of f of a and f b in this case f of 0 and f of 2. a is 0 b is 2. so f of 0 is going to equal negative 2. now let's find the value of f of b or f of two which is two to the third plus four times two minus two two to the third is eight four times two is also eight eight plus 8 is 16 minus 2 that's 14. so f of a is negative 2 f of b is 14. now keep in mind k is between f of a and f of b so k is between negative 2 and 14. and our goal is to show that there is a root or a number that's equal to zero so we got to show that there's some value c where k is zero and zero is between negative two and fourteen so there is some value out there where k can be zero because zero is in within this range if you think about it if we have some function where f of 0 is negative 2 and f of 2 is 14 so that's probably way up here and if it's continuous at some point let me draw a better line at some point the curve has to cross the x-axis so there's some value where f of c is equal to zero and keep in mind f of c is k so there's some value where k is equal to zero so there's going to be a root or zero in the equation in order to find it we need to set f of x equal to zero and then we could solve for x we know it's somewhere between zero and two it's not one because if we plug in 1 we're going to get positive 3. so technically it's going to be between 0 and 1. let's try a different example so let's say that f of x is equal to x squared plus x minus one on the interval zero to five and that f of c is equal to eleven so the instructions are going to be different from the last example verify that the intermediate value theorem applies to the indicated interval and find the value of c guaranteed by the intermediate value theorem so first we got to make sure it applies to the interval so we've got to find f of a and f of b so f of 0 is 0 squared plus 0 minus 1 which is negative 1. so that's f of a f of b which is the same as f 5 is going to be 5 squared plus 5 minus 1. 5 squared is 25 plus 5 that's 30 minus 1 that's 29 so that's the value of f b k has to be between negative 1 and 29 now keep in mind f of c is equal to k so therefore k is 11. so 11 is between negative 1 and 29 so the intermediate value theorem does apply to this function within this interval so now we got to find f of c i mean not f c but the value of c f of c is 11. so we're going to set 11 equal to the function f of x and find the value of x so let's subtract both sides by 11 to begin with so x squared plus x minus 12 is equal to zero so now we can factor we need to find two numbers that multiply to negative 12 that adds to the middle coefficient of one so this is going to be positive four and negative three so therefore we're gonna have x plus four and x minus three so we can see that x is equal to negative four and positive three so now which x value is the actual value of c is it negative 4 is it negative is it positive 3 or is it both now we need to find out which one is in the interval negative four is not between zero and five but positive three is between zero and five so c is equal to this particular x value so c is equal to three f of three is eleven and three is in the interval it's between a and b so this is our answer c is three here's a problem that you can work on use the intermediate value theorem to show that there is a number c where f of c is equal to 9 on the interval 0 to 3 given a function f of x is equal to 2x squared minus three x plus seven in addition find the value of c so first let's evaluate the function at a and b so let's find the function value when x is zero so let's plug it into that equation so it's going to be two times zero squared minus three times zero plus seven so that's equal to seven now let's evaluate the function when x is equal to three so it's two times three squared minus three times three plus seven three squared is nine and two times nine is eighteen three times three is nine and then eighteen minus nine is nine nine plus seven is sixteen now f of c is equal to nine and nine is basically the k value so we could say k is 9. so notice that k or 9 is between 16 and 7. therefore c which is an x value has to be between a and b so c is between three and zero now let's go ahead and calculate c so let's set the function equal to k or nine so two x squared minus three x plus seven will be set equal to nine so if we subtract both sides by nine seven minus nine is negative two so we're going to have negative two on the left side now we need to factor this trinomial and the leading coefficient is not one it's two so we need to multiply the leading coefficient by the constant term two times negative two is negative four and we need to find two numbers that multiply to negative four but add to the middle coefficient negative three so that's negative four and one now we're going to replace negative 3x with negative 4x plus 1x and then factor by grouping so in the first two terms take out the gcf which is 2x 2x squared divided by 2x is x negative 4x divided by 2x that's going to be negative 2. now in the last two terms there's nothing to take out so take out a one if we take out a one we're still going to get x minus two now we need to factor the greatest common factor again this time it's x minus two so if we take out an x minus two we're going to get two x plus one so now we have everything that we need and this is still equal to zero by the way so now we need to set each factor equal to zero so if we add two to both sides we can see that x is equal to two for this one we need to subtract both sides by one so two x is equal to negative one and then divide both sides by two so x can be equal to two or negative one half now which of these two answers should we choose two or negative one half which one is between zero and three negative one half is outside of that range so therefore c is equal to two f of two is equal to nine and two is between zero and three so this is our answer right here c is equal to two you
