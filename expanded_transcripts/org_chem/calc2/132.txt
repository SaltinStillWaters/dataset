Transcript for: Application of Derivatives - Formulas and Notes - Calculus Study Guide Review
in this video I'm going to go over some formulas you need to know if you're studying the application of derivatives so the first thing you need to be able to do is calculate the average rate of change the average rate of change is basically the slope of the secant line a secant line is a line that touches the curve at two points so this is the average rate of change form it's F of B minus F of A over B minus a so let's say if you have a curve that looks like this this line will be a secant line because it touches the curve at two points the first point at which it touches the curve that is point a the second point is point B so this is the average rate of change formula now sometimes you need to calculate the instantaneous rate of change the instantaneous rate of change is basically evaluating the derivative at some point this could be Point C the instantaneous rate of change is equal to the slope of the tangent line so at this point at some point C the slope of the tangent line will equal the slope of the secant line and that's the basic idea behind the mean value theorem so here's the basic definition for the mean value theorem if f ofx is continuous on the closed interval ab and if it's differentiable on the open interval AB then there is some number c in the interval AB or between a which we could see C is between a b such that fime of C is equal to F of B minus F of A over B minus a so that's the basic idea behind the mean value theorem which I'm going to abbreviate mvt so for the main value theorem as you could see the slope of the secant line and the slope of the tangent line they're the same at this point the average rate of change formula gives you the slope of the secant line and the instantaneous rate of change will give you the slope of the tangent line but when dealing with the mean value theorem those two will equal each other now the next theorem we need to be familiar with is rolls theorem if f ofx is continuous on the closed interval ab and differentiable on the open interval ab and if F of a is equal to F of B if these three conditions are met then there's going to be some number c in the open interval a where frime of C is equal to Z so here's a good example of this let's say we have a graph that looks like this and let's say here this is a and this is B notice that these A and B have the same y value so this is f of B and and this is f of a because they have the same yvalue they are equal to each other so if the end points of an interval are equal at some point between A and B there's going to be a horizontal tangent and at that horizontal tangent frime of C will be zero so C is basically the intercept of the curve and the horizontal tangent and the derivative at that point will be zero so that's the basic idea behind rolles theor by the way for those of you who want all of these formulas uh you could find it in the formula sheet in the description section below now if you need to calculate average velocity you can use the average rate of change formula so it's s of B minus s of A over B minus a so if you want to find the average velocity for the closed interval a you could use that formula so s represents position A and B will be specific time values on a position time graph because velocity is average velocity well velocity is displacement over time and displacement is the change in position so SB minus sa that's the displacement now the average acceleration it's going to be the change in velocity divided by the change in time so you can also use the average rate of change formula but instead of having the position function on the top you're going to have the Velocity function on the top so that's how you can calculate average velocity and average acceleration on the closed interval AB now if you wish to calculate the instantaneous velocity it's the derivative of the position function and if you wish to calculate instantaneous acceleration it's the derivative of the Velocity function so those are some additional formulas that you need to know if you ever need to find critical points you need to find the first derivative set it equal to zero and solve for x x is going to be your C value if you need to find critical points a critical point can also occur if frpr of C doesn't exists that's also that can also be a critical point so in that case you would look for a vertical tangent now here's some other things you want to know f ofx is increasing whenever the first derivative is greater than zero or basically when it's positive f ofx is decreasing whenever the first derivative is less than zero or when it's negative and F ofx the function is going to be constant if the first derivative is equal to zero which is basically where you have a horizontal tangent now the function is concave up that is f is cave up when the second derivative is greater than zero or positive f is concave down when the second derivative is less than zero or negative so anytime the second derivative is positive f is concave up if the second derivative is negative if or less than zero f is concave down so if we had a shape that looks like this we could see this one has the up upward u shape this part is concave up this one has the downward U shape so uh that is concave down at some point the concavity changes from up to down and that's going to be the midpoint between uh the local minimum and the local maximum so at this point when the concavity changes that is the inflection point so notice that the second derivative changes at that point so here the second derivative is positive because it's concave up so I'm just going to highlight that part in red where it's concave up and then here it's concave down so that's when the second derivative is negative so when the second derivative changes from positive to negative it has to cross zero so at the inflection point the second derivative is equal to Z Z so that's how you could find the inflection point if you if you want to find a critical point you would set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x and your x value will be your C value if you want to find the inflection point you would find a second derivative set it equal to zero solve for x however you just need to make sure the concavity changes so you may need to use a number line to check if it changes sign so let me give you an example of that so let's say the second derivative is zero when X is 2 and five and let's say this is positive this is negative this is negative so since we're dealing with the second derivative here it's concave up concave down concave down this would be an inflection point because the concavity changes even though the second derivative is zero here now the second derivative is zero at five as well however the concavity does not change so this is not an inflection point so you got to check the sign to make sure that it changes when F Prime is zero if it doesn't change then you're not dealing with a an inflection point so to give you an example of that here it's so here it's concave up then it's concave down let's see and then it could be like this so I'm going to highlight this part in red is concave up and then concave down but notice this part is also concave down so here where it's green the second derivative can be zero but here it's concave down second derivative is zero and then it's concave down again so this will typically be considered a saddle point as opposed to an inflection point now there are some other formulas associated with the application of derivatives I'm going to post those other formulas in the formula sheet so if you want the rest of the notes that's associated with this video feel free to check out that formula sheet down in the links below so that's going to be the end of this video thanks again for watching and feel free to check out my other videos and my playlists at
