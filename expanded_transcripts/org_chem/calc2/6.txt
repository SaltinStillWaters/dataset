in this video we're going to focus on increasing and decreasing functions so a function is increasing when the graph is going up as you move from left to right it's constant when it's just maintaining the same y value if it's horizontal and it's decreasing if it's going down as you move from left to right so in this region the function is relatively constant i know my graph is not perfect but we're going to be reasonable with it in the second part it's increasing it's going up in a third part it's constant and then in the last part it's decreasing it's going down so let's focus on the intervals where it's increasing first so it's increasing and we're going to use the x values to describe it it's increasing starting from negative 2 and ending at negative one so we're going to write negative two to negative one now it doesn't include negative two or negative one because at this exact point you can't say it's increasing our constant so we're gonna use parentheses now let's talk about when it's decreasing so it's decreasing when it's going down and it's going down starting at one but ending that three so it's decreasing from one to three now when is the function constant let me use a different color to describe it so it's constant starting from negative four to negative two and starting back up from negative one to one so for the first part it's constant from negative four to negative two and then union we need to connect that with the second part where it's constant and that's from negative one to one and so that's it so now you know how to determine when the function is decreasing when it's increasing and when it's constant you know what i put d for this one this should be c for constant so let's just fix that so let's work on some more examples let's try this one so notice that in the first part the function is decreasing at this section and then in this section it's increasing so i'm going to put i there for increasing and then it's constant and then after that it's decreasing so let's put a d there and then it goes up it's increasing so let's determine the intervals where the function is increasing first so it's increasing starting around negative four doesn't have to be exact and then it stops approximately at negative two and then it increases again starting around two ish and we have an arrow so that's gonna continue on to infinity so we could say that it's increasing starting from negative 4 to negative 2 that's the first part and then union let's connect it to the second part from 2 to infinity now when is the function decreasing so it's decreasing in this section all the way to the left it starts from negative infinity and then it stops decreasing at negative four and then it starts back up around zero that's an x value of zero to two let me write that better now it's constant only from negative two to zero and that's it so here's the last example finding intervals on which the function is increasing decreasing a constant so during the first part notice that the function is increasing and then in this part here notice that it's decreasing and then here it's increasing again and then finally it's decreasing so it's not constant for any significant period of time so we could say the function is increasing starting from negative infinity and then it changes direction at negative two this is known as a local maximum or a relative max this is called a relative minimum and here is a relative maximum so it's increasing from negative infinity to negative two and then union it starts to increase again from at this point zero to two and then it's decreasing from negative two to zero and then union it decreases again starting from two and then based on this arrow it continues forever to infinity and so that's it you
