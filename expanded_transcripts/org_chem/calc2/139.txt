Transcript for: L'hopital's rule
how can we evaluate the limit as x approaches infinity for this expression x squared over e raised to the x well we could try direct substitution so if we replace x with infinity infinity squared is basically infinity and e raised to the infinity is infinity now this is an indeterminate form what is infinity divided by infinity is it one is it zero is it infinity we don't know so when you get into a situation like this you need to use l'hopital's rule and the basic idea of l'hopital's rule is this the limit as x approaches some number c of f of x over g of x is equal to the limit as x approaches c of f prime of x divided by g prime of x so basically what we can do is turn f into f prime and g into g prime we could do so by taking the derivative of the top and the bottom separately and then maybe we can simplify into a form that we can get the answer so the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of e to the x will remain the same now if we use direct substitution we still won't get the right answer it will still be an indeterminate form so we need to do it again the derivative of two x is two and e to the x will stay the same now at this point we can use direct substitution e to the infinity is infinity and whenever you have a fixed number divided by an infinite number you're going to get zero and this time you have a bottom heavy expression where the denominator is very high compared to the numerator this will give you zero one divided by a large number will give you a very small number and this is the answer let's try another example go ahead and evaluate this particular limit the limit as x approaches infinity of the function ln x divided by x so if we use direct substitution this is going to be ln infinity which is infinity divided by infinity so we have another indeterminate form so let's use l'hopital's rule so let's differentiate the numerator and the denominator separately with respect to x the derivative of ln x is one over x and the derivative of x is one so one over x divided by one is just one over x at this point we can use direct substitution so this becomes one divided by infinity which is equal to zero so anytime you have a fixed number divided by infinity it will always give you zero now let's move on to our next example let's evaluate the limit as x approaches 0 for sine 7x divided by sine 4x go ahead and try it so let's jump into l'hopital's rule because if we plug in zero right now sine of seven times zero which is zero sine of zero is zero so this is going to be zero divided by zero and we don't know what that is it could be eight it could be one it could be zero it can be infinity so let's use l'hopital's rule so the derivative of sine seven x is cosine seven x and then according to the chain rule we need to find the derivative of the inside function which is seven and the derivative of sine four x is cosine four x times four so now we can use direct substitution so if we replace x with zero seven times zero is zero so we're gonna have cosine zero times seven and on the bottom four times zero is zero so we could cancel cosine zero because they both equal one and therefore the final answer is seven over four so that's it so that's how you can use l'hopital's rule to evaluate limits here's another example let's try the limit as x approaches 0 sine 8x divided by 3x so if we use direct substitution this is going to be 0 divided by 0. so let's not do that so let's find the derivative of the top and the bottom separately the derivative of sine 8x is going to be cosine 8x times 8 and for 3x it's just going to be 3. so now we can use direct substitution so this is cosine 8 times 0 times 8 over 3. now cosine zero is one and so we have one times eight over three which means the final answer is eight divided by three now what about this problem what is the limit as x approaches infinity of x times ln x so if we use direct substitution we can replace x with infinity and we'll have ln infinity as well the natural log of infinity is infinity and if you multiply a large number by another large number you're going to get an even large number so infinity times infinity is infinity therefore this is the answer now what about this example what is the limit as x approaches infinity of x raised to the 1 over x now if we replace x with infinity it's going to be infinity to the one over infinity one divided by infinity is zero and infinity to the zero power is indeterminate so there's nothing we can do right now except using l'hopital's rule now we don't have a fraction so we need to use a different process here we're going to set the original expression equal to y so y is equal to the limit as x approaches infinity x raised to the 1 over x now we need to take the natural log of both sides the reason why we want to do that is because we can take this and move it to the front now that we have a natural log in front of it it's one of those properties of logs that you need to know so we have 1 over x times ln x which we can write that as a fraction so we could say that's ln x over x so now we can employ l'hopital's rule on the right side so the derivative of ln x is one over x and the derivative of x is one and so we have the natural log of y is equal to the limit as x approaches infinity one over x using direct substitution on the right we can see that the natural log of y is equal to one over infinity and one over infinity is zero so ln y is zero now the base of the natural log is e so e raised to the 0 power is equal to y and anything raised to the 0 power is 1 so y is 1. now recall that y was equal to the limit as x approaches infinity for the original problem x raised to the one over x so we know that y is one therefore the limit as x approaches infinity for x raised to the one over x is one now let's check the work let's see if we indeed have the right answer so let's make a table and let's plug in some values so let's pick a large number let's start with 10. so 10 raised to the 1 over 10 as a decimal that's about one point two five eight nine so it's relatively close to one now let's choose a larger value for x let's try a hundred a hundred raised to the one over a hundred is one point zero four seven one so it's getting closer to one so let's try a thousand a thousand raised to one divided by a thousand that's one point zero zero nine so as x gets larger and larger as it approaches infinity we can clearly see that y is approaching one where y is basically x raised to the one over x as x approaches infinity let's try one more example what is the limit as x approaches zero of one minus two x raised to the one over x go ahead and try that so first we're going to set that equal to y and then we're going to take the natural log of both sides so ln y is going to be the limit as x approaches 0 ln 1 minus 2x raised to the 1 over x basically i reverse the equation i want y to be on the left side so now that i have the natural log i can move the 1 over x to the front and so i can write this as a fraction so i have ln 1 minus 2x and instead of multiplying by 1 over x which is the same as ln 1 minus 2x divided by x now let's use l'hopital's rule now what is the derivative of ln 1 minus 2x to differentiate natural log of u it's going to be u prime divided by u so it's the derivative of the stuff inside which is going to be negative 2 divided by whatever was on the inside which is 1 minus 2x and the derivative of x is 1. so what we now have is the natural log of y is equal to the limit as x approaches zero negative two divided by one minus two x so now we can use direct substitution let's replace x with zero so we no longer need to write the limit expression two times zero is zero and so what we have is one minus zero which is one so therefore ln y is equal to negative 2 over 1 or negative 2. and this is base e so e raised to the negative 2 is equal to y and so once you have the value of y you have the final answer which is e to the negative two so we can write the original problem so we could say that the limit as x approaches zero of one minus two x raised to the 1 over x which this whole thing equals y and y equals e to negative 2. so the limit is equal to e raised to negative 2 which if you want to you can write it as 1 over e squared both answers are acceptable and that's it so now you know how to use l'hopital's rule to evaluate limits of the indeterminate type you
