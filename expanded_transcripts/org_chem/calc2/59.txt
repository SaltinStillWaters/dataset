Transcript for: The Power Rule For Derivatives
in this video we're going to focus on the power rule for derivatives so let's say if we have some function f of x and it's equal to a variable raised to a constant x raised to n so x is the variable n is the constant what is the first derivative of that function according to the power rule it's going to equal n times x raised to the n minus one so let's say for example if f of x is equal to x squared then the first derivative we're going to take this constant move it to the front so it's going to be 2 and then times x raised to the 2 minus 1. so notice that in this example n is 2. so we have a 2 here and a 2 minus one on top two minus one is one so we get two times x to the first power or simply two x now let's try another example let's say if f of x is equal to x cubed what's f prime of x using the power rule so in this case n is three so it's going to be three x to the three minus one which three minus one is two so it's three x squared now for the sake of practice go ahead and try these so d dx simply means that you're differentiating x to the fourth with respect to x feel free to pause the video as you work on these examples i want you to master this topic that's why i'm giving you so many examples so using the power rule which is n times x raised to the n minus 1 this is going to be 4 x raised to the 4 minus 1 which is 4x to the third power so that's the answer for the first one what about the other ones so n is 5 for this example so it's going to be 5 x raised to the 5 minus 1 5 minus 1 is 4 so it's 5x to the fourth power here n is 6 so it's going to be 6 x to the 6 minus 1. and so that's going to be 6x to the fifth power and the last one n is seven so it's going to be seven x raised to the seven minus one and seven minus one is six so it's seven x to the sixth power and so that's how you can use the power rule to differentiate monomials now what about this one what is the derivative of x feel free to pause the video and think about that use the power rule to get the answer now what is n in this example well keep in mind what we have is x raised to the first power so therefore n is equal to one so this is going to be one x to the one minus one one minus one is zero and what is x to the zero anything raised to the zero power is one so this is going to be one times one which is simply one so the derivative of x is one now what about the derivative of a constant like four what's the answer now if you saw a previous video in my calculus playlist that is the constant rule for derivatives you know that the derivative of any constant is zero but how can we show this using the power rule well first we need to rewrite this expression four is the same as four x to the zero because x to the zero is one and four times one is four so these two expressions are equivalent to each other now we can use the power rule on x to the zero so in this case n is zero so we're gonna have four multiplied by zero x to the zero minus one now zero times anything is zero so the whole thing is equal to zero and that's one way we can show that the derivative of a constant is equal to zero using the power rule now sometimes you may need to differentiate rational functions how can we use the power rule to differentiate 1 over x what is the derivative of one over x what do you think we need to do here if you get a rational function which is basically a fraction rewrite the expression that's the first thing you need to do so take the x variable and move it to the top so this is going to be x raised to the negative one so you need to be familiar with properties of exponents for example if we had one over x to the fourth this is the same as x to the negative fourth if you move it to the top whenever you move a variable from the bottom to the top the sign of the exponent changes so it changes from positive four to negative four so in our example we had one over x which is the same as one over x raised to the positive one so as we move the variable from the bottom to the top it now has a negative exponent instead of a positive exponent so keep that in mind now we can use the power rule because it's in the form x raised to the n and we know that the derivative of x raised to the n is n x raised to the n minus one so in this example n is equal to negative one so this expression here that's going to equal negative one x to the negative one minus one so that is negative one and negative one minus one is negative two so the derivative of one over x is negative one x to the negative two now you can simplify this expression because most often the final answer is not going to have a negative exponent so what we need to do is take the x variable and bring it back down to the denominator of the fraction so the negative 1 will stay on top so we're gonna have negative one but on the bottom x to the positive two so the derivative of one over x is negative one over x squared and that's it now let's try another example let's say if f of x is one over x squared what is f prime of x use the power rule to get f prime of x so first we need to rewrite the function let's take the variable and move it to the top so we know it's going to be x to the negative 2. and now we could find the first derivative by using the power rule so in this example n is equal to negative two so following this expression f prime of x will be equal to negative two x raised to the negative two minus one so negative two minus one is negative three and once we have this answer which is the first derivative we simply need to simplify it so let's take the x variable and move it to the bottom again so the negative 2 will remain on top and on the bottom we're going to have x cubed so that's the final answer that's the first derivative of one over x squared it's negative two divided by x cubed now let's try one more example with rational functions go ahead and differentiate one over x to the fourth power so let's rewrite the expression first let's take the variable and move it to the top so this is going to be x raised to the negative 4 power and now let's differentiate it using the power rule so the exponent will move to the front so it's going to be negative 4 x and keep in mind n is negative 4 in this example so it's n x raised to the n minus one so to negative four x raised to the negative four minus one and negative four minus one is negative five now we need to rewrite it so let's take the x variable and move it to the denominator of the fraction so the negative 4 will remain on top and on the bottom we're going to have x to the fifth power so it's negative 4 divided by x to the fifth power now let's say if we have a radical function like the square root of x what is the derivative of the square root of x go ahead and try that so using the power rule we need to rewrite it the square root of x is basically x to the one half so there's a one in the exponent of x if you don't see a number it's a one however if you don't see an index number for a square root symbol it's always a two so it's x to the one half let's say if i had the fourth root of x cubed this is x to the three fourths if i have the seventh root of x to the fifth this is going to be x to the five over seven or if i have the sixth root of x to the eleventh this is x to the eleven over six so you could see how you can convert it from radical form to basically an exponent now in this example n is one half so this is going to equal one half x to the n minus one or one half minus one now we need to get common denominators one is the same as two over two and one minus two is negative one so one over two minus two over two is negative one over two so let's rewrite this expression as a single fraction so right now the 1 is at the top and x is also on the top the 2 however is on the bottom but we need to move x to the bottom so it's going to be 1 over 2 x raised to the positive one half now keep in mind x to the one half is the same as the square root of x so we can write the final answer as one over two square root x and so that's the derivative of the square root of x you
