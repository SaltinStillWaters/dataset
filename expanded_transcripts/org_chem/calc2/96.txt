Transcript for: Derivatives of Inverse Functions | Calculus
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the derivative of an inverse function so let's say if we have the function f of x and it's equal to x cubed plus 3 we want to evaluate the derivative of the inverse function when x is 11. so how can we find the value of that expression now here's the formula that you need to know and this is the version that i like to use the derivative of the inverse function is 1 over the derivative of the function at x equals at x sub 1. now you might be wondering what is x sub 1 and what is x sub 2 and clearly they must be different so first let's talk about inverse relations let's say if we have the point 3 comma 7 and this corresponds to the original function f of x to find the coordinates for the inverse function it's going to be seven comma three and so x and y they're switched so i like to call this point x one y one which corresponds to the original function and the point that corresponds to the inverse function just to keep track of everything i like to call it x two y two now notice that these two points are the same and also these two points are the same so therefore x1 is equal to y2 and y1 is equal to x2 because they were switched and it's important to know that f of x1 is equal to y1 and the inverse of x2 is y2 now we need to determine what this number represents is that x1 x2 y1 or y2 so that number inside of the inverse function is x2 so keep that in mind so to keep track of everything i'm going to write x1 comma y1 and x2 y2 so we know that x2 is 11 which means that x i mean y1 is also 11. so we need to determine x1 and y2 now keep in mind y1 is f of x1 so this is f of x1 and this is x1 to the third so x1 and y1 corresponds to the original function f of x so we can say that y1 is equal to x sub 1 raised to the third power plus 3. and we know that y1 which is the same as x2 that's 11. so we need to set this function equal to 11. 11 minus 3 is 8 and the cube root of 8 is 2 so x1 is 2 which means that y2 is 2. so now that we have the value of x1 we can now find the value of the derivative of the inverse function so the formula is this the derivative of the inverse function is 1 over the derivative of the original function so x2 is 11. we have that here and this is going to be 1 over f prime where x1 is 2. so let's find f prime of x that's going to be 3x squared so f prime of 2 is going to be 3 times 2 squared which is 2 squared is four times three that's twelve so the answer is one over twelve now let's see if we can get the same answer using implicit differentiation so we have y one is equal to x one cubed plus 3. now to find the derivative of the inverse function we need to switch x and y because right now we're dealing with the original function so once we switch x and y we're going to have this x is equal to y to the third plus three but because we switched x and y the subscripts will change so i'm gonna put the subscript of two which tells us that we're dealing with the inverse function as opposed to the original function now let's differentiate both sides with respect to x so the derivative of x is one the derivative of y to the third is three y squared times d y d x and the derivative of the constant three is zero now keep in mind the subscript for this is two to solve for dydx we need to divide by 3y squared so dydx represents the derivative of the inverse function and that's 1 over three y squared with a subscript of two now y two is two so this becomes one over three times two squared which is one over twelve and so that gives you the same answer but you need to know that you're dealing with y two and not y one so be careful of that and that's why it's important to write this so you don't get confused whether you should plug in 11 or 2 because that's where most students get mixed up with so this is just a method that helps you to keep track of everything let's try another example let's say that f of x is equal to x raised to the third power plus four x minus two and let's say that we want to evaluate the derivative of the inverse function when x is 3. go ahead and find the answer for this so first we need to determine these variables x1 y1 and x2 and y2 now the number that's inside the inverse function that will always represent x2 and recall that these two they share the same value so y1 is 3 as well now we need to determine x1 and keep in mind f of x1 is y1 so this is f of x1 and these are x1 values so y1 is x sub 1 raised to the third power plus four x sub one minus two now we have the value of y one and it's equal to three so three is equal to x cubed plus four x minus two so what is the value of x if we subtract both sides by 3 we can't really factor it unless we use like synthetic division or something but maybe we can guess the number let's add 3 to both sides negative 2 actually we need to subtract 3 from both sides so negative 2 minus 3 that's negative 5. now there's something called the leading coefficient test where you look at the constant term and the leading coefficient and the factors of 5 are 1 and 5 and the possible zeros of this function could be plus or minus one or plus or minus five so let's start by plugging in one if we plug in one the one to the third plus four times one minus five does equal zero so x one is equal to one if we plug in negative one it will be negative one minus four minus five that doesn't equal to zero if we plug in five five to the third plus four times five minus five that doesn't equal zero and if we plug the negative five that's not going to work either so this is the only one that can work if you use the leading coefficient test so x1 is one which means that y2 is also one now as soon as you complete this you can get the answer so let's write the formula the derivative of the inverse function is equal to 1 over f prime of x sub 1. so x two is three x sub one is one so now let's determine f prime of x it's going to be three x squared plus four so f prime of one is going to be three times one squared plus four which is seven so this is one over f prime of one so the answer is one over seven now let's confirm the answer using implicit differentiation so we know that y one is equal to x sub 1 raised to the third power plus 4x minus 2. now for the inverse function we need to switch x and y so x will be equal to y to the third plus four y minus two now because we're dealing with the inverse function the subscripts will change from one to two so this is x sub two and these are y sub two now let's find the derivative of both sides with respect to x the derivative of x on the left is simply equal to one on the right the derivative of y to the third is going to be three y squared times d y d x and the derivative of four y is four times d y d x and for a constant it's zero so what we need to do is factor out d y d x and so this is gonna be three y squared plus four now don't forget the subscript is two so now we need to divide both sides by this term so dydx that is the first derivative of the inverse function it's 1 divided by 3y squared with a subscript of two plus four now keep in mind x one and y two the same so you can rewrite d y d x as one over three x sub one squared plus 4. you can do that if you want since these two are the same but let's not worry about that so now let's plug in y2 so y two in this example is one so d y d the derivative of the inverse function is one over three times one squared plus four and so that's three plus four which is seven so the final answer one over seven and that's how you can confirm your answer using implicit differentiation you
