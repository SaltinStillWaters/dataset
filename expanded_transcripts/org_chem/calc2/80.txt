Transcript for: Product Rule With 4 Functions - Derivatives | Calculus
consider this problem what is the derivative of x squared times sine x times e to the 4x times the natural log of x so we have a product of four terms how do we find the derivative of that well we need to use the product rule i'm sure you've seen this equation the derivative of f times g let's say if we have two terms it's going to be f prime g plus f g prime you take the derivative of the first part leaving the second part the same and then you leave the first part the same taking the derivative of the second part so what about if we have three terms let's say if we want to find the derivative of f times g times h so what we would do is take the derivative of the first part f prime leaving the other two parts the same next we would take the derivative of the second part leaving the first and the third part the same and then finally we will take the derivative of the last part so for four terms we're going to follow a similar pattern let's say we have the derivative of f times g times h and then going in alphabetical order let's say times i so it's going to be f prime g h i plus f g prime h i plus f g h prime times i and then finally plus f g h i prime so we're going to use this formula to find the derivative of the expression so let's go ahead and begin so let's begin with the derivative of x squared what is the derivative of x squared well we have a variable raised to a constant x raised to n using the power rule it's going to be n times x raised to the n minus 1. so it's going to be 2x raised to the first power or simply 2x the other three parts we're going to leave it the same so it's going to be 2x times sine x times e to the 4x times the natural log of x now let's move on to the next term so we're going to keep the first one the same x squared and then we're going to find the derivative of sine x the derivative of sine x that's going to be cosine x and then the remaining two parts we're gonna leave it the same e to the x times the natural log of x i mean that should be e to the four x and then plus now we're gonna take the derivative of e to the 4x and here's the formula for that the derivative of e raised to the u with respect to x is going to be e to the u times the derivative of u which is u prime so the first two parts will remain the same that's going to be x squared times sine x and then we're going to write the derivative of e to the 4x which is going to be e to the 4x times the derivative of 4x which is 4. and then times the last part which is the natural log of x now for the last term we're going to rewrite the first three terms x squared sine x times e to the four x now we need to find the derivative of the natural log of x and here's the formula for that the derivative of the natural log of u where u is a function of x it's going to be u prime divided by u so u is x the derivative of x is 1 divided by u which is x that's 1 over x so the derivative of not the natural log of x is 1 over x now let's see what we can do to simplify this expression the first thing we can do is factor out the gcf the greatest common factor which is e to the 4x because it's found in all four terms so taking out e to the 4x we're going to be left with everything here except e to the 4x so that's going to be 2x sine x times ln x and then for the next term we're going to have x squared cosine x ln x and then for the next term we're going to have everything but e to the 4x so it's going to be plus 4x squared sine x ln x and for the last one x squared divided by x is just x so we're going to have plus x sine x so this here is the final answer and that's as far as we could simplify it so now you know how to use the product rule when you have a product of four terms or four functions so that's it for this video thanks again for watching
