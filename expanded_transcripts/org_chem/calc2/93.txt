Transcript for: Introduction to Logarithmic Differentiation
how can we differentiate a function that looks like this a variable raised to a variable what is the derivative of x raised to the x how can we find the answer well first we need to use a process called logarithmic differentiation let's set y equal to x to the x so we need to find d y d x now before you take the derivative of both sides of the equation you need to take the natural log of both sides so you can take this exponent and move it to the front so we're going to have the natural log of y is equal to the natural log of x raised to the x now in this form we can take this variable and move it to the front so ln y is equal to x ln x at this point we could take the derivative of both sides with respect to x now what is the derivative of the natural log of y the derivative of l and y is one over y and times d y d x now on the right side we need to use the product rule the derivative of f times g is going to be the derivative of the first part f prime times the second plus the first part f times the derivative of the second g prime so in this case f is basically x and g is ln x so the derivative of the first part x is one times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second part and the derivative of l and x is one over x now let's simplify what we have on the right side so we have the natural log of x and then x times one over x is basically one so now what we need to do is we need to multiply both sides by y y times one over y is one and so on the left side we're going to have d y d x on the right side it's going to be y times the natural log of x plus 1. now if you recall we set y equal to x raised to the x so therefore we need to replace y with that expression so the final answer d y d x it's equal to x raised to the x times the natural log of x plus one so that's how you can use logarithmic differentiation to find the derivative of a variable raised to another variable and this is the answer so now you see how to differentiate x to the x now it's your turn go ahead and find the derivative of x raised to the sine x try that problem so what's the first thing that we need to do the first step is to set y equal to x sine x next we need to take the natural log of both sides so ln y is equal to ln x sine x once we do that we can take the sign move it from the exponent position and put it in front of l and x and so we have ln y is equal to sine x times ln x now at this point we can differentiate both sides of the equation so let's write d over dx on both sides and we know that the derivative of the natural log of y is one over y times d y d x and on the right side we need to use the product rule so we need to find the derivative of the first part sine x so the derivative of sine is cosine x times the second part which we're not going to change lnx plus the first part unchange times the derivative of the second the derivative of l and x is one over x so this really not much we can do in terms of simplification so at this point we should multiply both sides by y so we have that d y d x is equal to y times cosine x ln x plus sine x divided by x now the last thing we could do is replace y with what it's equal to keep in mind y is x raised to the sine x it's the original problem so now we can write the final answer d y d x is x raised to the sine x times cosine ln lnx plus sine x over x so as you can see as long as you follow the steps logarithmic differentiation is not that bad you can learn this here's another problem that you could try find the derivative of ln x raised to the x so what's the first thing we need to do what's the first step if you recall the first step is to set this equal to y so y is equal to ln x raised to the x now what is the next thing that we need to do the second step is to take the natural log of both sides so ln y is equal to ln of ln x raised to the x and the third step is to take the exponent and move it to the front so we have ln y is equal to x times ln of ln x now at this point we can take the first derivative of both sides so the derivative of l and y is going to be 1 over y times d y over dx once again we have to use the product rule so this is f and this part is going to be g so f prime is 1 times g so ln of ln x plus f which is x times g prime now what is the derivative of ln ln x let's focus on that how can we differentiate this expression well first you need to know that the derivative of a natural log function l and u is equal to u prime divided by u and so u we can clearly see that u represents ln x so if u is equal to let me write this here ln x what's u prime well we know that the derivative of ln x is one over x so the derivative of ln l and x using the u prime over u formula it's going to be one over x divided by u which is l and x now to simplify that expression we need to multiply the top and the bottom by x one over x times x is one and so it's one over x ln x so this represents g prime which we can write it here at this point now let's simplify the expression that we now have so we have one over y times d y over dx and that's equal to the natural log of ln x and in this expression we could cancel x x divided by x is one so this is gonna be plus one divided by ln x now we can multiply both sides by y and so y times one of y will cancel and so we're gonna have d y over d x and that's equal to y times ln of ln x plus 1 over ln x now the last thing we need to do is replace a y with what it's equal to the original problem ln x raised to the x so this is going to be the final answer this is it let's try one final problem go ahead and find the first derivative of x raised to the one over x so to begin we need to set y equal to x raised to the one over x and then we need to take the natural log of both sides so we can move this to the front so we have ln y is equal to 1 over x times ln x and now we could find the first derivative of both sides so on the left side it's going to be the same 1 over y times dydx on the right side we have a product rule situation so what is the derivative of 1 over x let's focus on that first now we have a rational function so we need to rewrite it and we can rewrite it as x to the negative one and now we can use the power rule so it's negative one x to the minus two and we can rewrite that as negative 1 over x squared by the way so that's the derivative of the first part and then times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second part the derivative of ln x is one over x now let's simplify on the right side we have negative one over x squared times ln x one times one is one x times x is x squared so we can factor out one over x squared if we do so we're going to have negative 1 over x squared and then this is going to be ln x minus 1. or let's say if we take out positive one over x squared this would be negative ln x plus one and then we could just reverse the order of negative ln x plus one we can write it as one minus ln x it might be better to just leave it like that now let's multiply both sides by y so d y d x is equal to y times one over x squared one minus l and x and recall that y is the original problem x raised to the one over x so the final answer is going to be x to the 1 over x times 1 over x squared times 1 minus ln x so you can leave it like this but we do have a common base x so we could simplify this expression what is x raised to the one over x divided by x squared because if we multiply these two and this will go on the top x squared will remain on the bottom well let's say if we have x to the seven divided by x to the third you know it's x to the fourth it's x raised to seven minus three so this one is going to be x raised to the one over x minus two so you could write the final answer like this x to the one over x minus two times one minus ln x so you could leave it like this or you could leave it in this form both answers are acceptable you
