Transcript for: Finding Derivatives Using Logarithms - Differential Calculus
what is the derivative of x raised to the natural log of x how do we find the derivative of a variable raised to another variable in this video we're going to talk about how to do just that so we're going to need to use logarithms specifically a process called logarithmic differentiation so the first thing we're going to do is set this expression equal to y and our goal is to find the derivative of y or d y d x because that's going to equal the derivative of that expression but before we take the derivative of both sides of this equation we need to take the natural log of both sides first the reason why we want to do that is because there is a special property of logarithms that we can employ here for instance the natural log of a to the second power is equal to we can move the two to the front and so it's equal to two lna so therefore we could take this natural log and move it to the front and so we're going to have the natural log of y is equal to ln x times ln x or we can write that as ln y is equal to ln x squared now at this point we want to take the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to x so let's write d y d x i mean d over d x on both sides of this equation now what is the derivative of l n y to differentiate a natural log expression let's say we have a generic variable u it's going to be the derivative of u divided by u so if we want to find the derivative of let's say ln x we take the derivative of x which is 1 divided by whatever was here which is x the derivative of ln y is a little bit different the derivative of y is 1 divided by what we see here but because we're differentiating y with respect to x we're going to get d y d x as well differentiating x with respect to x if we were to write d x over d x that would make no sense it would just cancel so we can just leave it as one over x so now let's go back to the problem so the derivative of ln y we said it's 1 over y times the d y over dx now what about the derivative of ln x squared because it's different than just l and x we need to use the chain rule whenever you have a composite function you could use this process to find the derivative so first you want to take the derivative of the outside part of the function that's f while keeping the inside the same and then you want to multiply that by the derivative of the inside function you can think of the outside function as being u squared or x squared so we need to deal with this exponent first so using the power rule we're going to move the 2 to the front imagine if you're taking the derivative of x squared it will be 2x to the first power so it's going to be 2 times the stuff on the inside raised to the first power but keeping the inside function the same we're just going to leave it as ln x and then times g prime or the derivative of the inside function which is going to be 1 over x so that is the derivative of ln x squared so right now we can organize what we have so this is equal to 2 ln x divided by x our next step is to multiply both sides by y we want to get d y d x by itself on one side of the equation so those two variables will cancel and we're going to have d y d x is equal to what we see here but now we're not done remember our original expression is equal to y so we need to replace y with our original expression so we have 2 ln x over x times x raised to the ln x so this is the answer now sometimes it's good to see if we could simplify our answer and there is something that we can do let's move this x to the bottom of that expression so this is x ln x over x or over x to the first power when you divide by a common base you can subtract the exponents for instance x to the seventh divided by x to the third is x to the seven minus three so therefore we could say that d y d x is equal to 2 ln x times well let's put that in parenthesis x raised to the ln x minus one so you just subtract those two exponents so that's another way in which we can represent the final answer so that's how you could find the derivative of x raised to the natural log of x for the sake of practice let's try another example go ahead and find the derivative of x raised to the e to the x take a minute and work on that so let's set it equal to y first so we have y is equal to x raised to the e to the x so now what we're going to do is we're going to take the natural log of both sides so ln y is equal to ln x e to the x and then we're going to move the exponent to the front so we have lny is equal to e raised to the x times ln x so now at this point we need to take the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to x so we're going to add d over dx to both sides now we know that the derivative of ln y is one over y times d y d x but what about the derivative of e to the x l and x well we have the product of two factors so we need to use the product rule the derivative of f times g is going to be f prime the derivative of the first part times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second so the derivative of e to the x is simply e to the x times the second part which is just ln x plus the first part e to the x times the derivative of the second part the derivative of l and x we know it's one over x so that's what we have right now now notice that we have a common factor e to the x so that tells us to factor out the gcf so we're going to have 1 over y d y over dx and that's equal to e raised to the x times ln x plus 1 over x now at this point we want to multiply both sides by y so we're going to have d y over dx now let's replace y with what we have here so i'm going to write it in front x raised to the e to the x so that was y whoops let's do that again ln x plus 1 over x and then times this e to the x so this is it this is the answer that is the derivative of x raised to the e to the x here's another example problem what about the derivative of sine x raised to the x try that so once again we're going to set that expression equal to y and then just like before we're going to take the natural log of both sides of the equation so this will allow us to take the exponent and move it to the front so we're going to have ln y is equal to x times ln sine x so now at this point we could take the derivative of both sides of the equation the derivative of ln y is going to be as always 1 over y times d y over dx here we need to use the product rule we have our first factor x and the second one ln sine x the derivative of the first part x is just one times the second part ln sine x and then plus the first part x times the derivative of ln sine x now we said that the derivative of the natural log of u it's going to be u prime over u well we can see that u is sine x so u prime is cosine x the derivative of sine so u prime over u becomes cosine divided by sine which is equal to cotangent so that is the derivative of the natural log of sine x it's simply cotangent x now our next step is to multiply both sides by y so we're going to get d y over dx is equal to y times the natural log of sine x plus x cotangent x and then we need to replace y with our original expression so the final answer is going to be d y d x is equal to sine x raised to the x times the natural log of sine x plus x cotangent x and that is the final answer so now you know how to use logarithmic differentiation to find the derivative of functions that contain a variable raised to another variable
