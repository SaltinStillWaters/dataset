Transcript for: Squeeze Theorem
now let's talk about the squeeze term the main idea behind a squeeze term is that let's say that f ofx is greater than or equal to H of X but less than or equal to G of X so f is between H and G now if the limit as X approaches some number let's say a of H of X is the same as the limit as X approaches a of G of X and let's say that value is L then the limit as X approaches a of the middle function f ofx must also be equal to l if the small function and the large function have a value of L then the one in the middle should have the same limit L and that's the main idea behind the squeeze ter but let's work on some examples to apply it so for example let's say that f ofx is in between 8 - x cub and 8 + x cub what is the limit as X approaches Z of the function FX what's the answer so how can we figure this out well let's apply the limit to every expression in its inequality if f ofx is greater than 8 - x cub and if it's less than or equal to 8 + xB then we can say that the limit as X approaches zero of 8 - x Cub is less than or equal to the Limit as X approaches Z of f ofx Which is less than or equal to the Limit as X approaches Z of 8 + x Cub now let's go ahead and use direct substitution on the expression on the left so as we apply the limit as X approaches Z this is going to be 8 - 0 3r and the limit as X approaches zero of f ofx is greater than that but is less than or equal to 8 plus 0 to the 3r so this is eight and on the right side we also have eight so therefore if the limit as X approaches Zer if f ofx is greater than or equal to 8 and at the same time less than than or equal to 8 we could say that the limit as X approaches zero of f ofx is 8 that's the only way where it could be true it can't be seven because even though seven is less than eight seven is not greater than eight and it can't be nine because even though n is greater than eight n is not less than eight the only way this equation can be true is if we have an eight in the middle then are all equal to each other now let's work on another example let's try this one what is the limit as X approaches 2 of the function f ofx and let's say that f ofx is between 5x + 2 and also is between x^2 + 8 so go ahead and try that problem so let's find the limit as X approaches 2 of 5x + 2 and at the same time let's find the limit as X approaches 2 of x^2 + 8 so let's focus focus on the left side first let's use direct substitution so this is going to be 5 * 2 + 2 and on the right side if we replace x with 2 this is going to be 2^ 2 + 8 5 * 2 is 10 10 + 2 that's 12 on the right side 2^ 2 that's 2 * 2 which is 4 4 + 8 is 12 so therefore the only way that this expression can be true is if everything is equal to 12 so we can make the statement that the limit as X approaches 2 of f ofx must be equal to 12 according to the sque ter try this one what is the limit as X approaches zero of X sin x what is the answer to that question well let's talk about the graph of sign this is the graph of sign at least the right side of the graph and it has an amplitude of one so based on that sin x is between -1 and one including those values now if we take that inequality and if we multiply everything by X we can then say that X sin x is in between X and positive X so therefore we need to evaluate the limits at these two points let's do it two different ways the limit as X approaches zero ofx that's the left side that's equal to zero the limit as X approaches zero of positive X which is the right side is also equal to zero so according to the squeeze term we can say that the limit as X approaches zero for the middle function X sinx must also be equal to zero so you could do it that way if you want or we can just go back to our original w doing things so we could take the limit of each portion of this inequality we can divide it simultaneously if you prefer to do it this way so on the left the limit as X approaches Z of negative X we know it's zero and on the right the limit as X approaches zero of x X is zero so according to the squeeze theem the only way that these three inequalities can be true or these three parts of the inequality can be true is if that they're all equal to zero so the one in the middle the limit as X approaches zero of X sinx has to be equal to zero to make the inequality true so that's the answer what is the limit as X approach is z of X Cub * cosine 1 / X go ahead and try this problem now just like s cosine will always vary between -1 and 1 it really doesn't matter what this function is on the inside the period could change but any n is going to oscillate between 1 and 1 now it may oscillate quicker in the beginning and may spread out towards the end but in the end the oscillations will remain between 1 and negative 1 and that's what we want to take from cosine 1X so now what we're going to do is multiply everything by X Cub so we can make the statement thatx cub is less than or equal to X Cub cosine 1 /x which that itself is less than or equal to positive X Cub so now that we have this inequality we can now take the limit of all three portions of this inequality as X approaches zero so we can say that the limit as X approaches Z ofx cub that's going to be less than or equal to the Limit as X approaches zero of X Cub cosine 1/x Which is less than or equal to the Limit as X approaches zero of positive X Cub let's go ahead and make some space so now let's substitute x with 0 so we have 0 Cub on the left side the middle part is not going to change so we could just rewrite it and on the right side positive 0 Cube so negative 0 cube is simply just zero so we could see what the answer is going to be now if the limit as X approaches zero if it's greater than or equal to zero and at the same time less than or equal to zero there's only one possible answer for it it's equal to zero and so that's the answer for uh this problem and now you know how to apply the squeeze theorem so hopefully these were enough examples to help you understand this material
