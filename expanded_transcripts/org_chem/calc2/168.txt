Transcript for: Area Between Two Curves
in this video we're going to talk about how to calculate the area between two curves so let's go over the basics let's say we have some function f of x and we want to find the area under the curve from a to b so we're looking for the area of the shaded region the area is simply the definite integral from a to b of f of x dx now let's say if we have another function from a to b and let's call this function g of x the area under this curve is going to be the integral from a to b but of g of x dx now what happens if we want to find the area between two curves so let's say if we have both f of x let me draw this better and g of x how can we find the area between these two curves all we need to do is take the difference between this area and this area and we'll get the area between f and g of x so that area is simply the integral of a to b f of x minus g of x dx so that's how you could find the area between the two curves you need to take the difference between the top function and subtract it by the bottom function and then take the definite integral of that difference and you'll get the area of that curve now let's say if we have another function we'll call this function f of y and let's say it varies from c to d along the y axis and we want to calculate the area from c to d between that curve and the y axis the area of that region is going to be the integral from c to d of f of y d y so that function is basically x is equal to some function of y now let's say if we want to find the area between two curves so let's say we have f of y and g of y going from c to d so instead of taking the top function and subtracting by the bottom function what we're going to do is we're going to take the integral from c to d of the function on the right which is f of y minus the function on the left which is g of y and so that's how we can get the area between two curves from c to d when using y values so remember when dealing with f of x it's y is equal to f of x when dealing with f of y its x is equal to f of y now let's go ahead and work on some practice problems calculate the area of the region bounded by the line y equals 8 minus 2x the x-axis and the y-axis well let's begin by drawing a picture so y equals 8 minus 2x let's get the x and y-intercepts since we're dealing with a linear equation when x is 0 this is going to be 8 minus 2 times 0 which is 8. and if we replace y with 0 and solve for x we can see that x is going to be 8 divided by 2 which is 4. so we have a y-intercept of 8 and the x-intercept of 4. so we want to find the area between this line the x-axis and the y-axis so one way we can do this is through the use of geometry we know that the area of a triangle is one-half base times height the base is four the height is eight half of two is i mean half of four is two times eight that's 16. so that's the area of the shaded region but let's use calculus to get this answer as well so we know the area between a curve and the x-axis is going to be the integral from a to b of f of x dx and as we know y is equal to f of x and y is eight minus two x so f of x can be replaced with eight minus two x and along the x axis we're gonna integrate it from 0 to 4. so we're going to have the integral of or from 0 to 4 f of x which is 8 minus 2x and then dx so the anti-derivative of 8 is 8x and the anti-derivative of 2x to the first power is 2x squared over 2. so we can cross out the 2. so it's just 8x minus x squared so now let's plug in four so it's going to be eight times four minus four squared and then we'll plug in zero so it's eight times zero minus zero squared eight times four is thirty two four squared is sixteen and everything on the right will be zero and thirty two minus sixteen is sixteen so we get the same answer and it's confirmed so that's how you can calculate the area of the region using this particular definite integral now we can also get the same answer in terms of y as opposed to in terms of x so we can integrate it from c to d using this formula so remember x is equal to f of y so what we need to do to get a function of y is we need to solve for x so we have y is equal to 8 minus 2x i'm going to move this to the left side where it's going to be positive 2x and i'm going to move y to the right side where it's going to be negative y and now let's divide everything by two so we get x is equal to four minus one half y so therefore we could say that f of y is equal to four minus one half y we're going to integrate it from c to d or 0 to 8. so the area is going to be the integral from 0 to 8 f of y which is 4 minus one half y and then d y so the anti-derivative of four is going to be 4y the antiderivative of y to the first power is y to the second power over two evaluated from zero to eight so this is four y minus one fourth times y squared so let's plug in eight we're gonna have four times eight minus one fourth times eight squared and then once we plug in zero into this expression the whole thing is going to be zero so four times eight is thirty-two and then 8 squared is 64. 64 times 1 4 is 16. so this 2 will give us the same answer of 16 square units for the area so regardless if we choose to find the area in terms of x or in terms of y we're going to get the same answer let's work on this problem calculate the area of the region bounded by the line y equals x and y equals x squared y equals x is basically a straight line that passes through the origin at an angle of 45 degrees so that's y equals x y equals x squared is basically a parabola that opens upward but starts at the origin so if we put those two graphs together we're going to get something that looks like this so here's the line y equals x and here is y equals x squared on the right side on the left side it just looks like that but we don't need to worry about it the area of the region bounded by these two curves is right here so that's the area that we need to calculate what we need to do is we need to determine the points of intersection we can see the first point is going to be at zero but we got to find the second point to do that we want to set these two equal to each other so we want to set x equal to x squared subtracting both sides by x we'll get that zero is equal to x squared minus x and then if we factor out the gcf if we factor out x we'll get this expression using the zero product property we can see that x is equal to zero and x is also equal to one so those are the points of intersection now the top function is our f of x function which is y equals x the bottom function is our g of x function which is x squared so now we can calculate the area between the two curves using this formula it's the definite integral from a to b of the top function f of x minus the bottom function g of x so this is going to be the integral from 0 to 1. f of x is x g of x is x squared the antiderivative of x is going to be x squared over 2 and for x squared using the power rule it's x to the third over three so let's plug in one this is going to be one squared over two minus one to the third over three and then if we plug in zero this whole thing will be zero so it's one half minus one over three let's multiply one half by three over three and one over three by two over two to get common denominators so this becomes three over six this becomes two over six and our final answer is one over six so this is the area between the two curves it's one over six square units number three calculate the area of the region bounded by the curves y equal x squared and x equal y squared so let's graph these two functions separately so this is y is equal to x squared it's a parabola that opens upward now x equals y squared it opens towards the right if you take the square root of both sides you'll get that y is equal to square root of x plus or minus the top part of this function is y is equal to positive root x the bottom part is y is equal to negative square root x now if we focus on quadrant one where the two curves meet this is y is equal to x squared and this is x is equal to y squared so now this here is the top function which is f of x which is basically that function x is equal to y squared but solving for y we know that it's the square root of x is equal to y and f of x is equal to y and remember f of y is equal to x so be careful don't get those confused so we can replace f of x with the stuff that equals y which is the square root of x the bottom function is y is equal to x squared and so that's our g of x function g of x is also equal to y just a different type of y so this is x squared and our goal is to calculate the area of the shaded region so first we need to find the points of intersection so let's set f of x equal to g of x so f of x in terms of x is the square root of x g of x is x squared if we square both sides we'll get that x is equal to x to the fourth now this is true when x is zero zero is equal to zero to the fourth and this is true when x is equal to one one is equal to one to the fourth power so those the points of intersection now that we have that we can calculate the area using this formula so the area is going to be the definite integral of a to b or zero to one of the top function which is the square root of x but we'll write that as x to the one-half minus the bottom function which is x squared so the antiderivative of x to the one half we need to add one to one half which is three over two and then instead of dividing by three over two we're going to multiply by the reciprocal two over three the anti-derivative of x squared is x cubed over three now let's plug in one so this is going to be two over three minus one over three and when we plug in zero we'll just get zero so the final answer is just one over three so that's the area between it's the area of the region bounded by these two curves so that's the final answer now let's move on to number four calculate the area of the region bounded by the curves x is equal to one minus y squared and x is equal to y squared minus one so first let's talk about how we can graph this we know that x is equal to y squared looks like this if that's x equal y squared what is x equal y squared minus one all we need to do is take this curve and subtract it by one along the x axis so it's going to move one unit to the left it's going to start at x equals negative one so that's the shape of this graph it shifted horizontally one unit to the left so now that we have the graph of that function let's focus on the graph of this function now x is equal to x equals positive y squared opens to the right what about x equal negative y squared what happens then so this is going to open to the left it's reflected about the y axis now what if we add a 1 to it when we subtracted by one the graph started at negative one if we add one it's going to start at positive one so x equals negative y squared plus one we're going to move one unit to the right so this is the same as x is equal to one minus y squared so what we need to do is combine these two graphs together so it's going to look something like this and this is going to be the area of the region bounded by those two curves so let's redraw that picture so here we have y squared minus one and here we have actually this was one minus y squared and this one is going to be y squared minus 1. so let me write that so this is x is equal to y squared minus 1 and this other one here is x is equal to one minus y squared so how can we determine the area of the region bounded by these two curves we need to find the points of intersection first so let's set these two expressions equal to each other and since we have x in terms of y the points of intersection will be y values so let's set one minus y squared equal to y squared minus one so let's add y squared to both sides and let's add one to both sides so those will cancel we'll get 2 is equal to 2y squared dividing both sides by 2 we get 1 is equal to y squared and then if we take the square root of both sides we get 1 is equal to plus or minus 1 which should be written this way so this is a y value of negative 1 and this is a y value of positive 1. so now that we have the y values of the points of intersection we can calculate the area between the two curves using this formula it's going to be the integral from c to d which are y values of the right function f of y minus the left function g of y so f of y is here f of y is one minus y squared we could see it here instead of the function on the right g of y is the function on the left this is g of y it's on the left side for the region that's bounded so g of y is y squared minus 1. so now we could use this formula it's going to be the integral from c to d c is negative 1 d is positive 1. and then f of y which is 1 minus y squared minus g of y which is y squared minus 1 d y so let's simplify this expression first this is one minus y squared minus y squared and then these two negative signs will become positive one so one plus one is two negative y squared minus y squared is negative two y squared the antiderivative of 2 is 2y and for 2y squared we have 2y to the third over 3 it from negative one to one so let's plug in one this is going to be two times one minus two times one to the third over three and then if we plug in negative 1 we'll get this so this becomes 2 minus 2 over 3 and then negative two plus two over three distributing the negative sign will have plus two minus two over three now let's combine like terms two plus two is four negative two over three minus two over three that's negative four over three so what we need to do now is we need to get common denominators so four over one i'm going to multiply that by three over three so this becomes twelve over three minus four over three which gives me a final answer of eight over three so this here is the area between the two curves now let's work on some more practice problems calculate the area of the region bounded by the line y equals x squared minus 4x and the x axis x squared we know opens like this x squared minus 4x is going to be similar but it's going to be shifted so what we need to do is to graph this we need to find the x-intercepts and the vertex so to find the x-intercepts let's replace y with zero let's solve for x so i'm going to factor out x using a zero product property we get an x intercept of 0 and a 4. so let's make a table so when x is 0 y is 0. when x is 4 y is also 0. now the vertex of a parabola is the midpoint of the x-intercepts so it's going to be at 2. another way you can in which you can get the vertex is by using this equation x is equal to negative b over 2a let's say if you have a quadratic equation ax squared plus bx plus c so a is the number in front of x squared which is one b is the number in front of x which is negative 4. so we have negative b over 2a so this is positive 4 over 2 which gives us an x value of 2. now we need to determine the y value to do that we can just plug it into this expression so y is equal to x times x minus four if we plug in two this is two times two minus four so we get two times negative two which is negative four so we have enough information whoops let's go back so we have enough information to graph this function now so we have an x intercept of zero and four and that negative four we have the vertex at an x value of 2. so the graph is a parabola that opens upward like this our goal is to calculate the area of the region bounded by that line well technically that should be a curve not a line so let's just replace that with the word curve and the x-axis so how can we find the area of that shaded region well we need to identify the top function and the bottom function the top function is the x-axis and that's basically the line y equals zero so we can say the top function is f of x is equal to zero the bottom function g of x is the curve x squared minus 4x and we're going to integrate this from 0 to four so let's use this formula it's going to be the integral from a to b of the top function f of x minus the bottom function g of x so this is going to be the definite integral from zero to four the top function is zero the bottom function is negative well it's minus x squared minus 4x so let's go ahead and distribute the negative sign so negative times negative 4x that's going to be positive 4x and then minus x squared the antiderivative of 4x is going to be 4x squared over 2. and for x squared is going to be x cubed over 3. so this becomes two x squared so we have two x squared minus x cubed over three evaluated from zero to four so let's plug in four when we plug in zero this whole thing is going to be zero four squared is sixteen times two that's thirty two four to the third is sixty four so we have sixty four three now we need to get common denominators let's multiply 32 over one by three over three 32 times 3 is 96 so we have 96 over 3 minus 64 over 3 and 96 minus 64 is 32. so the area of the shaded region is 32 over 3. that's the answer for this problem number six calculate the area of the region bounded by the equations y equal x squared minus 4x and y equals 6 minus 3x so this equation we're familiar with already we know the x-intercepts will be 0 and four and we know that the vertex will be at two negative four so this graph is going to open upward like this so that's a rough sketch now here we have a linear equation y equals 6 minus 3x so the y-intercept is 6 which should be somewhere here and to determine the x-intercept we can replace y with 0 and solve for x so adding 3x to both sides we have 3x is equal to 6 and 6 divided by 3 is 2. so this line is going to touch the x axis at 2. so that's what we have and eventually this curve is going to meet up with this line so our goal is to get the area of the shaded region what we need to determine is the points of intersection here and here so we need to calculate the area by taking the top function and subtracting it by the bottom function so we want the x values of the points of intersection so let's set these two functions equal to each other x squared minus 4x we're going to set that equal to 6 minus 3x so let's begin by let's add 3x to both sides and let's subtract both sides by 6. so on the left side we'll have x squared negative 4x plus 3x that's going to be negative x and then we have negative 6. so we could factor x squared minus x minus six two numbers that multiply to negative six but add to the middle coefficient negative one are negative three and plus two so we can write this as x minus three times x plus two solving for x we get that x is equal to positive 3 and if you set x plus 2 equal to 0 you'll get that x is equal to negative 2. so here's the first point of intersection this is at an x value of three and this is at an x value of negative two and the top function that's f of x which is it's this linear equation 6 minus 3x the bottom function g of x is the other one that's x squared minus 4x so now let's calculate the area using this formula so it's going to be the integral from a to b that is from negative two to three f of x which is six minus three x minus g of x which is x squared minus four x so we have 6 this is negative 3x minus negative 4x which is negative 3x plus 4x so that's simply plus x and then we have negative x squared now let's clear away a few things the anti-derivative of 6 is going to be 6x 4x is going to be x squared over two and for x squared it's going to be x to the third over three evaluate it from negative two to three now let's plug in three so we're gonna have six times three plus three squared over two minus three to the third power over three and now let's plug in negative two six times three is eighteen three squared is nine three to the third is 27 divided by three that's nine and then we have negative six times negative two is negative twelve negative two squared is four divided by two is positive two negative two to the third power is negative eight with the negative in front that becomes positive eight but divided by three so here we can combine eight i mean eighteen and negative nine eighteen minus nine is nine and here we have negative twelve plus two which is negative ten and then plus 8 over 3. distributing the negative sign we have 9 plus 9 over 2 and then we have plus 10 minus 8 over 3. so first let's combine nine and ten so that's just nineteen and then let's focus on combining those two fractions let's try to get a common denominator of six so nineteen over one i'm going to multiply that by six over six nine over two i'm going to multiply that by three over three and eight over three i'm gonna multiply that by two over two nineteen times six is a hundred and fourteen nine times three is twenty-seven eight times two is sixteen twenty seven minus sixteen is eleven and one fourteen plus eleven is one twenty five so this is the final answer this is the area of the shaded region it's 125 over 6. number seven so we want to find the area of the region bounded by these two equations we get a linear equation and a parabolic equation let's begin by graphing the parabolic equation so we have x equals y squared which we know it's going to open towards the right but it's going to start at negative 4 along the x-axis so it's going to look something like this now here we have a linear equation x is equal to 3y minus 2. so when y is 0 x will be negative 2. so that means that the x intercept is negative 2. now we have a positive coefficient in front of y it's positive 3y and not negative 3y so we know we're going to have a linear equation that's going to increase as x increases as y increases x is going to increase so it's going to go up so we want to find the area of the shaded region what we need to do is find the points of intersection first so let's set 3y minus 2 equal to 2y squared minus 4. so i'm going to take these numbers and move it to the other side so we're going to have 0 is equal to 2y squared this will be negative 3y on the right side and then this will be positive 2 on the right so negative 4 plus positive 2 that's going to be negative 2. so now how can we factor this trinomial where the leading coefficient is two to factor it we need to multiply the leading coefficient by the constant term two times negative two is negative four and then we need to find two numbers that multiply to negative four but add to the middle coefficient negative three this is going to be negative four and plus one so we're going to replace the middle term negative three y with negative four y plus one y and then we could factor by grouping so we're going to take out the gcf in the first two terms and that's 2y and we'll be left with y minus negative 2 and we're going to take out the gcf in the last two terms which is just going to be 1 and then times y minus 2. now these two are the same so we're going to factor out y minus 2 and we're left with 2y plus 1. so that's how we can factor this trinomial if we set y minus 2 equal to 0 we'll get y is equal to positive 2 and if we set 2 y plus 1 equal to 0 y is going to be negative 1 over 2. so now we have our points of intersection and these are y values negative 1 half and positive 2. so this is equal to c and this is equal to d since everything is in terms of y here so now we could use this formula to get the area it's going to be the integral from c to d of the function on the right which is f of y minus the function on the left which is g of y so relative to the shaded region the function on the right which is here that function is f of y which is the linear equation three y minus two the function on the left that's the curve function that's g of y which has to be the other one two y squared minus four so the area is going to be from c to d or from negative one half to two f of y which is three y minus two and then minus g of y which is two y squared minus four d y so we have three y minus two minus two y squared and then plus 4. so this becomes negative 2y squared plus 3y and then combining these two that's going to be plus 2. the antiderivative of negative two y squared will be negative two y to the third over three for three y it's 3y squared over 2 and for 2 it's 2y evaluated from negative one-half to 2. so now let's plug in two this is gonna be negative two times two to the third power over three plus three times two squared over two plus two times two and then let's plug in negative one-half so it's negative two times negative one-half to the third power over three plus three times negative one-half squared over two plus two times minus a half two to the third power is eight times negative two that's negative sixteen over three two squared is four divided by two is two times three that gives us six and then two times two is four negative one half to the third power is negative one over eight negative one over eight times negative two is positive one over four divided by three that becomes positive one over twelve negative one half squared is positive one fourth divided by two that's one over eight times three that's positive three over eight and then two times negative a half is negative one so we have negative 16 over three six plus four is ten distributing the negative sign we have negative one over twelve minus three over eight and then this is plus one so what we need to do is we need to get a common denominator of three twelve and eight the best number is 24. 24 is a multiple of 3 12 and 8. but first let's combine 10 and 1 which is 11. we're going to multiply this by 24 over 24 and then negative 16 over 3 we're going to multiply that by 8 over 8. negative 1 over 12 we'll multiply that by 2 over and negative three over eight we're gonna multiply that by three over three to get a common denominator of 24. so we have 11 times 24 which is 264 16 times 8 is 128 2 times 1 is 2 three times three is nine so two sixty four minus one twenty eight that's a hundred and thirty six and negative two minus nine is negative eleven 136 minus 11 is 125. so the answer is 125 over 24 square units so that is the area of the region bounded by the two curves or the two equations you
