Transcript for: Derivative of Logarithmic Functions
in this video we're going to focus on finding the derivative of a logarithmic function but let's start with natural log functions first so what is the derivative of ln x now there's a formula that you need to know the derivative of ln u is equal to u prime divided by u so in this example u is x and the derivative of x is one so therefore the derivative of natural log of x that's going to be one over x let's try another problem what is the derivative of ln x squared what do you think the answer is in this example u is x squared and derivative of u or u prime that's going to be 2x so we could simplify this x squared is basically x times x so we could cancel an x and so the final answer is 2 over x now what you could do also is you can move the 2 to the front before you find the derivative of the function so ln x squared is the same as 2 l and x and we know that the derivative of l and x is 1 over x so this is going to be 2 times 1 over x which will give us the same answer of 2x i meant to say 2 divided by x and not 2x go ahead and try this one find the derivative of ln x cubed so let's rewrite the expression first so this is 3 ln x so that's going to be 3 times the derivative of l and x and the derivative of l and x is one over x so this is just going to be three divided by x here's another example find the derivative of the natural log of x plus five so let's use the formula u is x plus five u prime the derivative of x plus five is one so the answer is going to be u prime over u or 1 divided by x plus 5. let's work on some more examples differentiate the natural log of x squared plus 4. so in this example u is x squared plus 4 and the derivative of x squared plus 4 is 2x so using the formula u prime divided by u it's going to be 2x divided by x squared plus 4. so it's basically the derivative of the function on the inside divided by the original function go ahead and try this problem differentiate the natural log of seven x plus five minus x cubed now let's differentiate the inside function the derivative of seven x is seven the derivative of a constant is zero and the derivative of negative x cubed is negative three x squared divided by the original stuff on the inside which is seven x plus five minus x cubed so that's going to be the answer for this example now let's try some harder problems go ahead and find the derivative of the natural log of sine x so in this example u is equal to sine x u prime the derivative of sine that's going to be cosine so it's going to be u prime over u so cosine divided by sine and what trig function represents cosine divided by sine cosine over sine is cotangent so the natural log of sine x is equivalent to cotangent x that is the derivative of the natural log of sine x now go ahead and differentiate the natural log of the seventh root of x try that problem now the best thing to do for this example is to rewrite it so let's rewrite the radical as a rational exponent so this is going to be x raised to the 1 over 7. and then we could take the exponent move it to the front so this is 1 over 7 times the derivative of the natural log of x so this is going to be one over seven times one over x so the final answer is one over seven x here's another problem that you can work on go ahead and find the derivative of the cube root of ln x once again i suggest rewriting the expression into a form that's easier to deal with so the cube root of ln x that's basically ln x raised to the one third now this time the one third applies not only to the x but the entire ln x expression so you can't just move it to the front what we need to do is apply the chain rule and let's say if you want to differentiate a composite function f of g of x you need to differentiate the outside part of the function keeping the inside the same and then multiply by the derivative of the inside so that's the basic idea behind the chain rule so to use that let's use the power rule so let's focus on the outside part of the function let's keep the natural log the inside part g of x the same so using the power rule this will go to the front so it's going to be 1 3 and then we need to subtract the exponent by 1 times the derivative of the inside which is g prime the derivative of l and x is one over x now one third minus one that's the same as one over three minus three over three and that's negative two over three so we have one third ln x to the negative two thirds times one over x now there's going to be a one in the numerator we have a 3 and an x in the bottom so i'm going to write that as 3x now l and x will have a negative exponent if it's placed in the numerator but if we place it in the denominator it's going to have a positive exponent and so we can rewrite the final answer as 1 over 3x times the cube root of ln x squared and so that's it now let's go over the derivative of regular logarithmic functions so what is the derivative of log base 3 of x now here's the formula the derivative of log base a of u is equal to u prime divided by u times ln a in the case of the natural log which has the base e this is going to be u prime over u l and e but l and e is one so it simply becomes u prime over u but if you have a base that's not e then you need to have l and a other than that everything else is the same so in this example u is equal to x so the derivative of x is one and a is the base that's three so the answer is going to be u prime divided by u which is x times ln a or ln three so it's 1 over x ln 3. here's another example that you can work on differentiate log base 4 of x squared now we can move the 2 in the front if we want to so this is going to be 2 times log base 4 of x so it's going to be u prime that's the derivative of x divided by u which is x times ln a and there's a 2 in front so times 2. so the final answer is going to be 2 x natural log of 4. try this one log base 7 of 5 minus 2x so u is 5 minus 2x u prime that's going to be negative 2 and a is 7. so the formula it's u prime over u lna so u prime is negative 2 and then u is 5 minus 2x times the natural log of the base so the natural log of seven and that's it for that example now what is the derivative of log base two three x minus x to the fourth so go ahead and try that so u is going to be 3x minus x to the fourth power u prime the derivative of 3x is 3 and the derivative of x to the fourth is four x cubed and a is the base that's two so using the formula u prime divided by u times ln a or ln2 so all you need to do is identify u u prime and a and you'll get the answer let's work on one more example with logs so go ahead and find the derivative of log base 5 of tangent x so u is tangent u prime the derivative of tangent is secant squared and a is five so using the formula u prime over u lna it's going to be secant squared divided by tangent x times the natural log of five and that's it now going back to natural logs there's one more example i want to cover what is the derivative of the natural log of ln x so we have a natural log inside a natural log how can we differentiate this function so let's focus on the main one keep in mind the derivative of ln u is u prime over u so notice that u in this example is ln x so if u is l and x what's u prime now you know that the derivative of l and x is one of x so the answer is going to be u prime which is one over x times u which is l and x so let's multiply the top and bottom by x one over x times x is one so it's one over x ln x and that's the answer you
