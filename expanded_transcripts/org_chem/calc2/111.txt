Transcript for: Related Rates - Angle of Elevation Problem
an airplane travels horizontally at a speed of 500 miles per hour at an altitude of three miles above the ground an observer sees the plane flying toward him at an angle of elevation of 60 degrees find a rate at which the angle of elevation is changing at this instant so let's begin with a picture so let's say this is the ground and here is the observer and here is the plane it's flying towards the observer and it's at an altitude of three miles above the ground so this is the angle of elevation theta and the plane is traveling forward at a speed of 500 miles per hour we need to determine the rate at which the angle of elevation is changing f is instant so that is d theta dt that's what we need to determine so let's call this y x and z now what else do we know so we have the value of y y is equal to 3 in miles we don't know the value of x but we do know the rate at which x is changing so is x increasing or decreasing notice that as the plane travels towards the person x is decreasing therefore dx dt is negative 500 miles per hour now there's one more piece of information that we know and that is that theta is 60 degrees so to conserve space let me get rid of some stuff so keep in mind we're looking for d theta dt now the only picture that we really need is basically a right triangle for this problem now from this picture how can we calculate x we don't have anything with z we don't know what z or dz dt is we have theta and we have y how can we calculate x so notice that tangent theta based on sohcahtoa is equal to the opposite side y divided by the adjacent side which is x x is adjacent or next to theta z is the hypotenuse so tangent of 60 degrees theta is 60 is equal to 3 divided by x now let's cross multiply so this is going to be 3 and that's equal to x times tan 60. tangent of 60 degrees is the square root of 3. you could type that in your calculator make sure it's in degree mode if you don't have access to a calculator you need to be familiar with the 30-60-90 triangle across the 30 is 1 across the 60 is root 3 across the 90 is 2. so tangent 60 will be opposite divided by the adjacent side so root 3 over 1 which is the square root of 3. so it's good to know the 30 60 90 reference triangle and the 45-45-90 reference triangle so now let's divide both sides by the square root of three so x is equal to three divided by the square root of three so if we rationalize it the square root of three times the square root of three is the square root of nine which is three and three divided by 3 is 1. so x is equal to the square root of 3. now that we have the value of x how can we calculate d theta dt looking at the information that we have we don't have anything dealing with z so it doesn't make sense to use z squared equals x squared plus y squared the only equation that relates x y and theta is the tangent equation that we had before so let's go back to that one tangent theta is equal to y over x now it's important to understand that x is a variable but y is a constant as the plane travels toward the observer it will remain at an altitude of 3. therefore y is not going to change the plane is flying horizontally so the altitude will always be 3 miles so y is constant so i'm going to rewrite this expression as the constant times the variable now before i take the derivative of this expression i still need to rewrite it one over x is the same as x to the minus 1. now in this form i'm going to differentiate both sides with respect to time the derivative of tangent is secant squared times theta or secant squared of theta and the derivative of the angle theta is going to be d theta dt now to differentiate this expression we need to use the constant multiple rule so the constant is y we can rewrite that times the derivative of x to the minus one so now we need to use the power rule it's going to be negative one x to the negative two and then times dx dt now secant is one divided by cosine so secant squared is one over cosine squared and here we have negative y i'm gonna move the x to the bottom so it's gonna go from x to negative two and change to x to the positive two and then times dx over dt so theta is 60 therefore this is going to be cosine of 60 degrees but let's not forget to square it times d theta over dt now we know that y is equal to 3 and x is the square root of 3. and then times deoxy t which is negative five hundred so now what is cosine of sixteen so let's go back to the thirty sixty ninety triangle so we said across the thirty was a 1 across the 60 is the square root of 3 across the 90 is 2. now don't forget about sohcahtoa so let's use the cob part in sokatoa so cosine of 60 degrees is going to be the adjacent side that's a divided by the hypotenuse adjacent to 60 is one and the hypotenuse is across the box that's two therefore cosine of 60 degrees is one half so this is going to be one divided by one half squared times d theta over dt and that's equal to negative three and the square root of three squared the square root and the the exponent will cancel or you could see it as three squared is nine and the square root of nine is three so that becomes three now going back to the left side one squared is one two squared is four so we have one over one fourth times d theta over dt negative three divided by three is negative one and negative one times negative five hundred is positive five hundred now what is one divided by one over four to simplify that complex fraction multiply the top and the bottom by four so four times one is four and then four times one fourth the fours will cancel and so you just get one on the bottom and so four divided by one is just four so we have four times d theta dt and that's equal to five hundred dividing both sides by four five hundred divided by four is one hundred and twenty five now what are the units for d theta dt theta is going to be in radians unless specified otherwise and time we could see that time is in hours so it's going to be radians per hour so that's the rate at which the angle is changing per hour let's say if you want it in seconds here's what you can do so start with what you're given 125 radians per hour and convert to minus first one hour is equal to 60 minutes and then convert to seconds so one minute is equal to 60 seconds do it in such a way that the unit hours will cancel and the unit minutes will cancel as well so we're left with radians per second if you ever need to change it so it's going to be 125 divided by 60 divided by 60 again so it's going to be a very small number if you want it in radians per second so it's .0347 radians per second if you want it in radians per minute just focus on this portion so it will be 125 over 60 and so you could say d theta dt is in it's equal to 2.08 3 radians per minute so you can report your answer in any one of these units but for the most part since the speed is in miles per hour you probably want the final answer to be in radians per hour you want the time to match which is usually the case you
