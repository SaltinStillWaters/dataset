Transcript for: Derivatives of Exponential Functions
in this video we're going to focus on finding the derivative of exponential functions so let's start with some examples that contain the base e what is let's do that again what is the derivative of e to the x here's the formula that you need to know the derivative of e to the u where u is some function is going to be the same thing e to the u but times the derivative of u so the derivative of e to the x is going to be e to the x times the derivative of x which is one so it's simply e three x so based on that example go ahead and find the derivative of these expressions e to the 5x plus 3 and e to the x squared go ahead and try these two examples so first we need to rewrite the expression that we have e to the five x plus three and then times the derivative of five x plus three which is five so the answer is five times e raised to the 5x plus 3. now for the next example it's going to be the same thing e raised to the x squared times the derivative of x squared which is 2x so the answer is going to be 2x e raised to the x squared let's work on a similar problem so let's find the derivative of e raised to the x cubed plus 8x so it's going to be the same thing e raised to the x cubed plus 8x times the derivative of the exponent the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of 8x is 8. and so that's the answer it's 3x squared plus 8 times e raised to the x cubed plus 8x now sometimes the base may not be e it might be something else so for instance what is the derivative of 3 raised to the x the derivative of a raised to u is going to be the same thing a to u times u prime times ln a now if we compare that to e to the u which was e to the u times u prime now it's supposed to be l and e but the natural log of e is one so that part is not needed so you need to use this formula for everything else other than e so a to u is the same thing the derivative of x is one and then times ln a or ln3 and so that is the answer try these three examples now using that formula it's going to be a to the u which is the same thing so a is 7 u is 2x minus 5 and then times u prime which is the derivative of two x minus five that's two times ln a or ln seven and so that's it for that example and then in this problem a is nine u is x cubed so it's a to the u times u prime the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and then times lna or ln9 and for the last one it's going to be a to u times the derivative of 2x minus x squared which is 2 minus 2x times the natural log of 5. so hopefully these examples gave you a good idea of how to differentiate exponential functions now let's work on a mixed review of problems go ahead and find the derivative of e raised to the sine x and differentiate 4 raised to the tangent x so it's going to be e to the u where u is sine x times u prime the derivative of sine is cosine so that's it for the first problem for the second it's going to be a to u where a is 4 u is tangent times u prime the derivative of tangent is secant squared times the natural log of a and a is 4. let's work on some harder problems that involve more steps so what is the derivative of x cubed e to the 4x now for this problem we need to use the product rule and the derivative of f times g is f prime g plus f g prime so f is the first part of the function that's x cubed and g is the second part e to the 4x so f prime the derivative of x cubed that's going to be 3x squared times g which is just e to the 4x plus f that's x cubed times g prime the derivative of e to the 4x is e to the 4x times the derivative of 4x which is 4. and so that's going to be the answer but it looks like we could simplify it we could factor out the gcf so we can take out e to the 4x and an x squared so it's going to be x squared e to the 4x and then we're going to have a 3 left over and over here we're going to have 4x let's try this problem find the derivative of e to the x plus e to the negative x divided by e to the x minus e to the negative x go ahead and try that so since we have a fraction we need to use the quotient rule and here's the formula the derivative of f over g is going to be g f prime minus f of g prime over g squared so we can see that f is the numerator so that's e to the x plus e to the negative x and g is the stuff in the denominator so that's e to the x minus e to the negative x so f prime is going to be the derivative of e to the x is just e to the x times the derivative of x which is one so the derivative of e to the x will be the same now for e to the negative x it's going to be e to the negative x times the derivative of negative x which is negative one now for g prime it's going to be e to the x minus e to the negative x times negative 1. now let's go ahead and apply this formula so g is going to be e to the x minus e to the negative x and then times f prime which is e to the x minus e to the negative x due to this negative sign and then minus f which is e to the x plus e to the negative x and then times g prime which is e to the x these two negative signs will cancel so that's going to be plus e to the negative x and then all of that is going to be divided by g squared which g is e to the x minus e to negative x so how can we simplify this expression so notice that these two expressions are the same so we can write them as e to the x minus e to the negative x squared and these two are the same so that's going to be e to the x plus e to the negative x squared and then it's divided by this thing here now what do you think we need to do at this point should we stop here or should we continue is there a way that we could simplify this expression do we have to foil it turns out that we could factor this expression notice that this is in the form of a squared minus b squared so a is e to the x minus e to the negative x and b is e to the x plus e to the negative x now first let me get rid of this stuff a squared minus b squared is a minus b times a plus b using the difference of squares method so this expression is going to be a which is e to the x minus e to negative x so this is a in red and b is highlighted in blue so a minus b so minus i'm going to distribute the negative sign to both those terms so it's going to be minus e to the x minus e to the negative x so that's a negative b and then it's going to be a plus b so a is still the same and then plus this time it's going to be positive so plus b e to the x plus e to the negative x and this is all divided by e to the x minus e to the negative x squared now notice that e to the x and negative e to the x they add up to zero so they cancel and negative e to the negative x and positive e to the negative x cancels as well so on the left side we have negative one plus negative one which is going to be negative two e to the negative x and then on the right side one plus one is two so that's going to be two e to the positive x negative two times two that's equal to negative four and what's e to the negative x times e to the x when you multiply by a common base you need to add the exponents so x squared times x cubed is 5. e to the negative x times e to the x that's gonna be e to the negative x plus x negative x plus x is zero and e to the zero is one so it's negative four times one which is simply negative four and then this is still divided by e c x minus e to the negative x squared and so that's the answer for this problem that's it for this video thanks for watching though you
