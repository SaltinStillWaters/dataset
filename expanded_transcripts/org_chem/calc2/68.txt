Transcript for: How To Find The Equation of The Tangent Line With Derivatives
in this lesson we're going to focus on how to find the equation of a tangent line given a point using derivatives so let's say if we have a function f of x and it's equal to 2x squared minus 5x plus three and we wish to find the equation of the tangent line when x is equal to two so what equation should we use we need to use the point slope form of a linear equation at least that's the preferred form i like to use you can also use the slope-intercept form if you prefer it that way now we need to find two things right now we already have x1 x1 is two we need to calculate y1 that is y when x is two and we need to determine the slope so to find the y coordinate we simply have to take x and plug it into this equation make sure you understand this f of a is equal to y where a is a specific value of x in this example a is equal to 2. now x can be anything x could be 5 7 12 a is that specific value of x so f of a is y and f prime of a is equal to m so in order to find m you have to find the first derivative and then replace x with 2. in order to calculate y you need to replace x with 2 in the original function f of x so let's determine y first so y is equal to f of two this is y one specifically and that's gonna be two times two squared minus five times two plus three two squared is four five times two is ten and two times four is eight eight minus ten is negative two negative two plus three is one so y one is one now the only thing we need to do is calculate the slope when x is equal to two so first we got to find the first derivative the derivative of x squared is 2x the derivative of x is 1 and the derivative of a constant like 3 is 0. so f prime of x is equal to four x minus five the slope is going to equal f prime of two so that's going to be four times two minus five four times two is eight eight minus five is three so the slope of the tangent line is equal to three when x is two now make sure you understand the difference between the derivative and the slope the derivative is a function in terms of x in this particular example the slope is a specific value of the derivative function at some x value so when x is 2 the slope is 3. however the slope can change with this function for example when x is one the slope will be negative one so the derivative is a function that gives you the slope at any x value now let's plug in what we have so that we can write the equation of the tangent line so it's y minus one which is equal to three times x minus two so this is the answer in point slope form but let's get it in slope intercept form so let's solve for y let's distribute the three first so it's going to be three x minus six and then let's add one to both sides negative six plus one is negative five so here we have the equation of the tangent line in slope intercept form let's work on another example so let's say that f of x is equal to eight x minus x squared write the equation of the tangent line at x equals seven so go ahead and work on this problem feel free to pause it and see if you got the concept so the first thing i'm going to do is calculate the y value so let's call this x one y1 is going to equal to f of 7 which is going to be 8 times 7 minus 7 squared 8 times 7 is 56 7 times 7 is 49 56 minus 49 is 7. so y1 is 7. so now that we have x and we have y all we need to find is m so let's go ahead and determine the first derivative of the function so f prime of x is going to equal the derivative of x is one the derivative of x squared is 2x so it's 8 minus 2x now let's determine the slope which is going to be the first derivative evaluated at an x value of 7. so it's f prime of seven so it's going to be eight minus two times seven two times seven is fourteen and eight minus fourteen is negative six so the slope is equal to negative six now let's use the point slope formula y one is seven m is negative six x one is seven so that's the equation of the tangent line in point slope form which you can leave it like that if you want to but let's get it in slope intercept form so i'm going to distribute the negative six so it's going to be negative 6x and then negative 6 times negative 7 that's positive 42. now we need to add 7 to both sides so it's going to be negative 6x plus 49. this is the equation of the tangent line in slope intercept form that's the final answer now let's work on one more example but this time the example is going to be associated with a trig function so let's say that f of x is 4 sine x minus three and we wish to write the equation of the tangent line when x is equal to pi over six go ahead and work on that example now first let's calculate y when x is pi over six so we need to evaluate the function at pi over six so this is going to be four sine pi over six minus three now what is sine pi over six equal to now pi is equal to 180 degrees so 180 divided by 6 is 30. so pi over 6 and radians is equivalent to 30 degrees sine 30 or sine pi over 6 is one half and you can use the unit circle or your calculator to figure that out four times a half is two two minus three is negative one so therefore y is negative one when x is pi over six now let's calculate the slope when x is pi over six so we need to find the first derivative so what is the derivative of four sine x minus three the derivative of sine is cosine and the derivative of negative three is zero so it's just four cosine x so now let's evaluate it when x is pi over six so this is going to be four times cosine pi over six now what is cosine pi over six equal to what's cosine of 30 degrees cosine pi over six is equal to the square root of three over two now hopefully you remember your 30 60 90 triangle this can help you with these things across the 30 is 1 across the 60 is the square root of 3 across the 90 is 2. so let's say if you want to evaluate sine 30 using sohcahtoa you know that sine is opposite over hypotenuse so opposite to 30 is one and the hypotenuse is across the box which is the longest side that's two so sine 30 or sine pi over six is one half cosine 30 based on sohcahtoa cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse adjacent to 30 is the square root of three and the hypotenuse is still two so that's a quick review that can help you to remember some basic trig functions whenever you need to evaluate it now let's finish this problem four divided by two is two so the slope is equal to two square root three now let's go to the point-slope formula of the linear equation y one is negative one m is two square root three and x one is pi over six now y minus negative one is the same as y plus one so you can leave it in this form if you want to in fact i think it's best to leave it in this form you don't want to multiply 2 root 3 by pi over 6 it's not going to look nice so i'm going to leave the answer in point slope form so that's the equation of the tangent line for this problem you
