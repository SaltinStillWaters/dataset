how can we evaluate this limit what is the limit as x approaches nine for the function one over square root x minus one over three divided by x minus nine feel free to try this problem if you want to now in this problem we have radicals and we have fractions what do you think is the first thing that we need to do in order to evaluate the limit well you could try direct substitution if you plug in 9 you're going to get 9 minus 9 on the bottom and on the top 1 over the square root of 9 minus 1 over 3. the square root of nine is three and so you're going to get zero over zero which that's really not going to help us so direct substitution is not going to work in this example now because we have a complex fraction that is fractions within a fraction what we want to do is we want to get rid of those fractions and we can do this by multiplying the top and the bottom of the large fraction by the common denominator of these two fractions and so we're going to multiply the numerator by 3 square root x and whatever you do to the top you must also do to the bottom so we're going to multiply the denominator by 3 square root x 3 square root x times 1 over square root x these two will cancel leaving behind three so we're gonna have the limit as x approaches nine we're gonna have a three on top now three square root x times 1 over 3 the 3's will cancel and so we're going to get negative square root x on the bottom we have x minus 9 times 3 square root x so we no longer have a complex fraction but we still have radicals in this problem how do we get rid of the radicals or the square root symbols what you want to do at this point is you want to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of this expression to find the conjugate it's going to be 3 plus square root x it's exactly what you see here but you need to change the negative sign into a positive sign so we're going to multiply the denominator by the same thing so now let's foil we're going to have 3 times 3 which is 9 and then 3 times the square root of x that's going to cancel with negative 3 square root x but i'm going to write it out and then negative square root x times square root x that's just going to be negative x on the bottom we have x minus nine times three square root x and then 3 plus square root x so these two will cancel and so we're just going to be left with 9 minus x on the numerator now what we're going to do is we're going to factor out a negative 1 from 9 minus x if we take out negative 1 the negative x will become positive x the positive nine will become negative nine so as you can see at this point we can cancel x minus nine and so what we now have is the limit as x approaches 9 of negative 1 over 3 square root x times 3 plus square root x so at this point we can now replace x with 9 because we're not going to get a 0 in the denominator of the fraction so this is going to be negative 1 over 3 square root nine times three plus the square root of nine the square root of nine is three and three times three is nine three plus three is six nine times six is fifty four so the answer for this problem is negative one over fifty four and if you want to you can check this answer negative 1 over 54 as a decimal that's equal to negative 0.0185 repeating now if we plug in 9.1 into the function if you type this into your calculator 1 over the square root of 9.1 minus one over three divided by nine point one minus nine this is going to give you negative point zero one eight three six five six and then if you plug in 9.01 which will be this right here this will give you negative 0.01 as you can see as x approaches 9 the function approaches this value negative 0.0185 now if you want to check it from the left side that is if you want to plug in 8.99 you should get negative 0.018534 so this just confirms that our answer is indeed correct so now you know how to evaluate limits that contain fractions and radicals so that's it for this video thanks again for watching
