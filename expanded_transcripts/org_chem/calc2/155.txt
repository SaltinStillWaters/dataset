Transcript for: Finding The Area Using The Limit Definition & Sigma Notation
in this video we're going to focus on finding the area using the limit definition so let's say if we have the function x cube and we want to find the area of the shaded region between the x-axis and the curve over the closed interval from zero to eight so let's draw a picture so x cube on the right side looks like this and so from 0 to 8 we want to find the area of the shader region how can we do so using the limit definition well you need to know the formula to calculate the area it's equal to the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum of all of the rectangles starting from 1 to n of f of x sub i times delta x delta x represents the width of the rectangle and f of x sub i is the height of the rectangle so as n becomes very large we're going to use an infinite number of rectangles to approximate the area under the curve and we're going to add the area of each rectangle we're going to sum it up and that's going to give us the area under curve which is equal to the definite integral of the function from a to b so what is x sub i and how can we find it so if you're using the right endpoints x sub i is equal to a plus a delta x times i if you're using the left endpoints x sub i is equal to a plus delta x times i minus 1. so let me illustrate the right endpoints because you can use either one to get the same answer but the right endpoints is a lot easier than the left ones so let's make a number line and let's go from zero to eight and for this particular illustration we're going to say that n is four but for the actual problem n goes to infinity so this applies only for this illustration so if n is 4 what is delta x delta x is b minus a divided by n so keep in mind a is the beginning of the interval b is the end so it's always from a to b now b is equal to eight a is zero and then n is four for this example so eight divided by four is two so the width of each sub interval is equal to two and so that's the value of delta x so now let's use the formula first let me get rid of some stuff so let's use this formula x sub i is equal to a plus delta x times i now for this example we said that n is 4 and so we're going to have x1 x2 x3 and x4 as you start from 1 and end at 4. so using the right endpoints we need to choose four of the five points listed on the number line and so we're going to use the four points on the right side two four six eight now when i is one the x value is two so we can say x sub one is two and x sub two is four let me use a different color to distinguish it from the stuff above so this is x sub one x sub two x sub three is six and x sub four is eight so if you want to calculate the value of x sub 1 using this formula for the right endpoints we start with a so keep in mind a is zero delta x we said it was eight over four which is two and i is whatever the subscript is so i is one and this is equal to two so x sub one is in d2 now if we want to calculate x sub 2 it's going to be 0 plus 2 times 2 which is 4. and if we wish to calculate x sub 4 0 plus 2 i is 4 so that's going to have a value of 8. so x sub i it tells us the value of x at some point along the number line so now let's go ahead and work on this problem so we said before that the area is the limit as n approaches infinity and we're going to sum up the area of each rectangle from 1 to n where n goes to infinity f of x sub i times delta x over the interval 0 to 8 where f of x is x cubed so let's calculate delta x let me do it on the right side so delta x is going to be b minus a so that's 8 minus 0 divided by n but in this case we don't have a specific end value because it goes to infinity so we're going to leave delta x as 8 over n the next thing we need to determine is x sub i using the right endpoints so it's a plus a delta x times i and we can see that a is equal to zero delta x is this thing over here it's eight over n times i and so this is x sub i so let's replace x sub i and delta x in that expression so the area is going to be the limit as n approaches infinity and then it's going to be f of 8 i over n times delta x which is 8 divided by n now let's evaluate the function when x is 8i over n so we need to replace x with that so we need to rewrite what we have that's the limit as n approaches infinity and don't forget the sigma notation and so this is going to be 8 i divided by n raised to the third power times eight over n now eight to the third power so that's eight times eight times eight that's five twelfth and then times another eight that's going to be 4096. this problem involves a lot of writing so we have 4096 and then we have i to the third power and then this is going to be n raised to the third power times another n so that's n to the fourth power now we need to apply the summation formula and there's another video i created entitled summation formulas and sigma notation calculus you could search it in youtube if you have trouble finding it just type in organic chemistry to it as well in the search box it should come up or you could find it in my new calculus video playlist but you need to know the summation formulas for a constant for i i squared and i cube so we're going to use the one for i cube but let's rearrange this expression so right now we have the limit as n approaches infinity 4096 over n to the fourth and then the summation formula for i to the third now don't apply the limit make sure you apply the summation formula first before you apply the limit the summation formula that corresponds to this that is i to the third going from i equal one to n it's n squared times n plus one squared divided by four so let's simplify first we could divide 4096 divided by four four thousand divided by four is a thousand and ninety-six divided by four is twenty-four so we're going to have a thousand twenty-four and then n squared divided by n to the fourth that's one over n squared so we're going to have an n squared on the bottom and on top we're left over with n plus one squared so at this point it's all math so i'm going to move the constant to the front because the limit will not affect it now i'm going to foil n plus 1 so n plus 1 times n plus one when you foil it it's going to be n squared plus two n plus one divided by n squared now i'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by one over n squared and so we're going to get this so it's going to be 1 plus two over n plus one over n squared divided by one now let's say if you have the limit as x approaches infinity for one over x one over infinity is zero or if you have this for one over x squared one over infinity squared is zero so anytime you have a fixed number divided by a very very large number you're going to get a small number and so this is going to be a thousand twenty four and now applying the limit expression two over n becomes zero so this is going to be one plus zero and one over n squared will also become zero divided by one so this is a thousand twenty four times one so the area is one thousand and twenty four this is the answer now let's confirm it by calculating the value of the definite integral of the function from a to b the area is equal to the definite integral of f of x dx from a to b so a is zero b is eight and the function is x cubed the anti-derivative of x cube is x to the fourth over four and then we're gonna evaluate it from zero to eight so this is gonna be eight to the fourth over four minus zero now eight to the fourth we know this it's four thousand ninety six and we know that four thousand ninety six divided by four is one 1024 so evaluating the definite integral is a lot faster but sometimes you may get a free response problem and you have to do so using the limit definition nevertheless you can confirm if you have the right answer by finding the value of the definite integral you
