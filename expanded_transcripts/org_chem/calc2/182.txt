Transcript for: Integration By Parts - Integral of e^x Sinx Form
what is the integral of e ra 3x * cosine 4X now you could find the answer by using the formula of integration by parts and here it is the integral of U DV is UV minus the integral of V du Now using this formula will'll get you the right answer but it's a process it takes time in fact there's a video that I've created that shows you how to find the integral of this exact problem using the integration by parts formula I'm actually going to post a link to that video in the description section below and this problem is the last problem in that video it starts around the 25 minute 20 second Mark now this is basically the long way of getting the answer in this particular video instead of using integration by parts I'm going to show you another formula that will get you the same answer directly and here it is the integral of e to the ax time cosine BX is equal to e raised to the ax / a 2 + + b ^ 2 * a cosine BX plus b sin BX and then plus the constant C so in this problem we need to identify a and b a is three B is 4 so I'm going to write that here so this is going to be e raised to the 3x over a^ 2 which is 3 squ and then plus b^2 which is 4^2 by the way for those of you who want more formulas like this in addition to other integration formulas I'm going to post a link to a formula sheet that you can download that has a lot of integration formulas that will help you to get to the answer a lot faster now going back to this problem we have a cosine BX a is 3 B is 4 so 3 cosine 4X plus b which is 4 and then sin BX or 4X and then finally plus the constant C so that right there is the answer but now if you're going to compare it to the answer that I have in my other integration by parts video it's going to look a little different and I'll explain why first let's simplify what we have here 3 2 is 9 4 2 is 16 9 + 16 is 25 now what I'm going to do next is I'm going to factor out of three if I fact R of three from what's inside here I'm going to divide each of these by three so when I factor out a 3 from 3 cosine 4X I'm just going to have cosine 4X but the three I'm going to put it in front of the e to the X so this is cosine 4X if I factor out of three from four I basically divide the 4 by 3 so this becomes 4/3 sin 4X now this is the exact answer that I have in my other video after using the integration by parts formula however it's a lot better to leave the answer in this form but I want you I want you to see how this answer will lead to the other answer that I have in my other video so you know that it's correct now for the sake of practice let's work on another example let's find the integral of e raed to 5x time sin to the 12x DX now the formula that you need for this one is this e raised to the ax * sin BX is equal the first part is the same e to the a x over a 2 + b 2 and then time a sin BX minus B cosine BX and then of course plus C so for this particular problem we can see that a is five and B is 12 so once we identify the values of the values of A and B we can quickly get the answer so e to the ax that's e to 5x / a^ 2 a 2 is 5^ 2 b^ 2 is 12 2 and then a sin BX a is 5 sin BX so that's sin 12x - B cosine sin BX so that's -12 cosine 12x and then plus C which I'm run out of space there so now let's simplify this answer 5 2 is 25 12 * 12 is 144 144 + 25 is 169 so we could leave the final answer like this as you could see using this formula helps you to get the answer a lot faster than using the integration by parts formula so that's how you can find the integral or the anti-derivative of any problem in this form either e to the x sinx or any variation of e to the x cosine X it will work for both so by the way if you want those formulas as well as a print out of some other integration formulas don't forget to check out uh the links in the description section below I'm also going to put some other links to other videos related to integration by parts uh such as the tab method I don't know if you heard about that one but that also helps with integration my parts problems where there's a lot of repeat steps I'm also going to be posting some other links as well that you might be covering in school at this particular time so feel free to take a look at that content and for those of you who want access to my calculates video playlist you could find it at my website video-test final exam on that website
