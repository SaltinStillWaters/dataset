Transcript for: Basic Integration Formulas - Calculus
in today's video I'm going to give you a list of basic integration formulas that will be helpful for you for those who are taking Calculus 1 and even uh the beginning portions of calculus 2 so here's the first one the integral of a DX is equal to ax + C now I'm going to show you how to use some of these formulas not all because there's a lot of integration formulas out there so a is a constant let's say if you want to integrate the constant 5 is simply going to be 5x + c e is a constant so e without the X this is just going to be e * x + C -7 is a constant so the integral of7 DX will be -7x + C so that's how you can use the first Formula now the next one which is associated with the power rule is this when you have a variable raised to the constant n the anti-derivative of X the N will be x n + 1 / n +1 + C so here's an example let's say if you want to find the anti-derivative of x^2 simply add 1 to two which is three and then divide by that result let's say if you want to find the anti-derivative of X Cub + 5 x 6 so for X Cub it's going to be add 1 to the exponent divide by that result so x 4 over 4 and then for x 6 is just X 7 over 7 and then plus C so that's how you can use this formula by the way for the first example that formula works as well if you see it this way five is the same as 5 * x 0 because anything raised to the zero power is one so when you add one and then divide by one you're going to end up with 5x now here's the next Formula to know the anti-derivative of a x + B raised to the N it's going to be 1/ a time ax plus b basically using the power rule on this raised to the n + 1 over n +1 + C so let's put this into practice let's say if I have 5x raised to the 7th power the 1 / a represents the derivative of what's inside the derivative of a x + B is is just a the derivative of 5x is 5 so a is going to be five then we're going to have the original expression 5x we're going to add 1 to 7 so n + 1 that's 8 and then we're going to divide by that result and then plus C so this is going to be 5x to the 8th power over 40 plus c all right here's another example let's say we have 3x + 7 rais to the 4th power so we can see that a the number in front of X is three so it's going to be 1 over 3 and then times the original expression 3x + 7 but we're going to add one to four so that's going to be five and then divide by that result so now we can write this as 3 * 5 1 15 3x + 7 rais to the 5th power by the way for those of you who want a print out of all these formulas check out the links in the description section below I'm going to post the formula sheet that's going to contain all these all of the formulas that you'll see here now whenever you want to integrate rational functions um of degree 1 one in the denominator like this you're going to get the natural log function the anti-derivative of 1 /x is Ln X keep in mind the derivative of Ln U is U Prime over U so the anti-derivative of this will give you Ln U so if you want to write that as a formula you could see it this way another similar version to the first one is this 1 over ax + B very similar to 1 /x this is 1 / a Ln ax + b so let's say if I have 1 over 3x for this one you really don't need to use the formula you can move out the three to the front and this is just 1/3 and this part is going to give you Ln X so it's 1/3 Ln X plus C now if you had a problem that looks like this let's say 1 over 4x + 5 then this formula will be very helpful a we can see is four so it's 1/4 in this case a was three in this problem and then it's going to be the natural log of what we started with on the denominator and then plus C so 1/4 Ln 4x + 5 plus C so that's how you could use uh this formula now let's move on to the integration of exponential functions so the integral of e to X DX is just e to X now the integral of e to the ax + B it's similar but with a few differences it's going to be 1 / a e to the ax + B + C so I'm going to give you a few examples the integral of e rais to the 3x is going to be a is 3 so it's 1/3 e to 3x + C the integral of e to the 5x + 2 a is 5 so it's going to be 1/5 e to the 5x + 2 and then plus C so that's how you could find the anti-derivative of exponential functions with the base e now sometimes you may have an exponential function that doesn't have the base e so let's use a instead so a raised to the BX + D we need to save C for the constant at the end so it's going to be 1 over B and then times a to the BX + D but it's it's going to be divided by LNA a so I'm going to rewrite it differently so it's what you started with before a raised to BX plus d now instead of 1 over B I'm just going to put B on the bottom but you also need to multiply by Ln a for the previous equation Ln e is 1 so that's why you don't see it there but Ln a is not one so you need to put it there so that's the formula to find the anti derivative for an exponential function when the base is not e so let's say we have 4 raised to 3x in this case b is three a is 4 so we're going to start with the original problem on top 4 ra to 3x / B which is 3 and then Ln a a is 4 and then plus C so now let's say we have 7 raised to the 2X x + 5 so we're going to have the original problem on top 7 raed to 2x + 5 divid b is 2 in this example a is 7 so it's 2 Ln 7 plus C so that's how you can find the anti-derivative of exponential functions now if you need to integrate a log expression you could use this formula the integral of log base D ax + B DX it's going to be ax + B over a Time log base D absolute value ax + B now this e is not is the constant 2.718 it's that special e number and then plus C now I created a video on this about how to use this formula so I won't put any examples in this particular video instead I'll post a link in the description section below where you can see how to use this formula and how to confirm your answer with from from correctly with integration by parts but feel free to take a look at that video if you want you can also find on YouTube if you type in integration of logs organic chemistry tutor in a search bar and that video should also come up as well but that's how you can integrate logs directly using that formula now the integral of sinx DX is cosine x + C the integral of sin a x + B DX is cosine ax + B / a + C so if we want to find the anti-derivative of sin 6x it's just going to be cosine 6X / a a is 6 and then plus C likewise if we want to find the integral of sin 9x + 4 it's going to be negative cosine of what's inside 9x + 4 / a a being 9 plus C so the anti-derivative of cosine X this is sinx + C the anti-derivative of cosine ax + B like s this is going to be S positive sign not negative sign ax plus b / A+ C now this transformation it works for the other trig functions like secant tangent cosecant and coent so if you remember the base formulas you could remember uh that variation the integral of cosecant Cent this is cose X+ C the integral of secant tangent is positive secant x plus c the integral of tangent is Ln SEC x + C now this is also equal to Ln cine x + C this a ne1 here if you move the1 to the exponent of cosine it becomes 1 / cosine which is secant x so that's why you can write this equation in both forms now very similar to tangent the integral of coent is going to be Ln sinx + C but you can also write it as Ln cose X+ C using the reciprocal function the integral of secant x is going to be Ln secant x plus tangent X by the way I have videos on YouTube where if you type in the integral of SEC x on a YouTube search bar there's a video that will explain how to go from here to there using certain integration techniques you can also find those videos on my website video- t.net where you can get access to all of my playlists like my algebra trig calculus chemistry physics playlists and when you search that playlist you should be able to find this video now the integral of cosecant X is Ln cosecant x minus cotangent X now when you're doing integration by parts you can use this formula this comes from you can derive this formula from the derivative of the product rule the integral of udv is UV minus the integral of VD I have a lot of videos that explain how to use this formula so I won't cover in this video now for the Triple integration by parts formula is this it's u v DW is equal to uvw minus the integral of V W du minus integral UW DV I also have a video explain how to use that formula too now there's a lot of other formulas to cover it'll be too much to cover it all in this video but there's the reduction formulas inverse trig there's related formulas to inverse trig as well and then you have the table of integrals which contain even more formulas there's also trig substitution as well I'm going to post all of that in the formula sheet so feel free to take a look at the formula sheet if you want those additional formulas as well but I'm going to stop it here and thanks for watching
