Transcript for: Differentials and Derivatives - Local Linearization
in this video we're going to focus on derivatives and differentials particularly as it relates to local linearization so what exactly is a differential when you see d y that stands for the differential of y dx is the differential of x now you need to be able to find it so for example let's say if we have the function y is equal to x to the fourth now if we differentiate both sides with respect to x we know that d y d x the first derivative of the function is equal to 4 x cubed now if you multiply both sides by d x you're going to get this differential d y so d y is equal to 4 x cubed dx so here's another example let's say if y is equal to ln x then d y dx the derivative of ln x that's 1 over x multiplying both sides by dx we'll get that d y is 1 over x times dx so if you need to find the differential d y this is how you can do it so let's go over some more examples so let's say that y is equal to x cubed minus five x plus ten and find the differential d y and then evaluate it using these values x is two and let's say dx is one over four so first we're going to find d y to do that we need to find the derivative of this expression the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of negative five x is negative five and for the constant tan at zero and then we need to multiply this expression by dx so that's how we could find the differential d y now to evaluate d y we need to plug in these values so x is three so this is going to be three times two squared minus five and dx is one fourth two squared is four four times three is twelve and twelve minus five is seven and seven times one fourth is seven over four or one point seven five so d y is equal to 1.75 when dx is 0.25 or 1 4. so that's how you can evaluate d y and this is how you can find it let's try another similar example for the sake of practice so let's say that y is equal to two x cubed minus four x squared plus 8x minus 1. let's say that x is 3 and dx is 0.1 find dy and go ahead and evaluate as well so the derivative of 2x cubed that's going to be 2 times 3x squared which is 6x squared and the derivative of x squared is 2x times 4 so that's going to be 8x and then plus 8. and then times dx so now that we have d y let's go ahead and evaluate it so x is three this is going to be six times three squared minus eight times three plus eight and dx is point one now 3 squared is 9 and 6 times 9 is 54. 8 times 3 is 24. 54 minus 24 is 30 and then plus 8 so that's 38 times 0.1 which is 3.8 so that's the value of d y it's equal to 3.8 now let's say that f of x is equal to x cubed and x is equal to 2 and delta x is 0.01 with this information calculate d y and delta y given the values of x and dx and keep in mind dx is equal to delta x in this situation so dx and delta x they're both .01 now it's important to understand that f of x is the same as y so you could say that y is equal to x cubed so just keep that in mind now let's start by calculating f of 2. f of 2 is going to be 2 to the third which is 8. and then let's calculate f of 2 plus 0.01 so that's x plus delta x so that's 2.01 that's going to be 2.01 raised to the third power and i need to calculate it for that so that's equal to 8.120601 now delta y is the change in y it's f of x plus delta x minus f of x in other words delta y is f of 2.01 minus f of 2. so it's basically the difference between these two values so it's eight point one two zero six zero one minus eight so we can say that delta y is point one two zero 6 0 1. so let's save this answer now let's calculate d y and we're going to compare it to delta y so y is x cubed and d y is going to be the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared times dx now let's replace x with 2 since that's what it equals and dx is point zero one two squared is four and three times four is twelve 12 times 0.01 is 0.12 so that's the value of d y as you can see 0.12 and 0.1206 they're very close to each other so d y is approximately the same as delta y they're very close if delta x is very small so for the sake of practice let's try another problem so let's say that f of x is equal to the square root of x when x is nine and let's say dx is let's use point zero two so go ahead and try that problem so first we need to calculate f of nine so that's the square root of nine that's three and then f of x plus delta x so this is also delta x by the way so that's going to be 9 plus 0.02 or 9.02 and so that turns out to be 3.003331484 so delta y which is f of 9.02 minus f of 9. so that's going to be the difference between these two numbers and so that's going to be point zero zero so now let's calculate d y and compare it to delta y so using this expression we can see that y is equal to the square root of x and rewriting it that's going to be x to the one half so d y is going to be one half x one half minus one is negative one half times dx and then if we rewrite it this is one over two times the square root of x now x is nine and dx is point zero two point zero two divided by two is point zero one and the square root of nine is three so it's point zero one divided by 3 and that's equal to 0.003333 repeating and so that's d y so comparing d y and delta y they're both about .00333 so they're very close to each other and so as you can see when delta x is small delta y and d y are approximately equal to each other you
