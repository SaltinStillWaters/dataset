Transcript for: Trigonometric Substitution
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the indefinite integral using trigonometric substitution now there's three forms that you need to be familiar with the first one is the square root of a squared minus x squared the second one you want to look for is a squared plus x squared inside a square root function and the last one the square root of x squared minus a squared now for the first one you need to substitute x with a sine theta where a is a constant and the reason for that is because 1 minus sine squared is cosine squared for the second one replace x with a tangent theta and the reason for that is 1 plus tan squared is secant squared and for the last one replace x with a secant theta because one secant squared minus one is tangent squared now these are the three forms that you need to look out for when using trigonometric substitution so let's work on an example problem let's say if we have the square root of four minus x squared divided by x squared how can we integrate this function so notice that we have the form square root a squared minus x squared so we can clearly see that a squared is 4 which means that a is equal to the square root of 4 or 2. therefore we need to replace x with a sine theta in this case x has to be 2 sine theta so dx is going to be the derivative of 2 sine theta so that's 2 cosine theta d theta and so now we're going to have the integral of 4 minus let's replace x with 2 sine theta so this is going to be 2 sine theta squared and then divided by x squared which is also 2 sine theta squared now let's replace dx with 2 cosine theta d theta we can get rid of this for now so now we got to do some math so let's perform some algebra techniques to simplify this expression 2 squared is 4 so 2 sine squared is going to be 4 sine squared theta and on the bottom we're also going to have 4 sine squared theta now what do you think we need to do at this point at this point we need to take out a 4 inside the square root so we can get 1 minus sine squared so we're going to have the square root of 4 times 1 minus sine squared theta now something else that we can do is that we can cancel two two over four reduces to one over two so there's gonna be a two left over on the bottom and we still have cosine theta d theta now we can take the square root of four the square root of four is two and then we can replace one minus sine squared with cosine squared so the cosine squared part is still inside the square root symbol so now at this point we can cancel two two divided by two is one and the square root of cosine squared is cosine theta so we have cosine and this is supposed to be sine squared cosine over sine squared times cosine theta d theta and cosine times cosine is cosine squared now what do you think we should do at this point the best thing i recommend doing at this point is to replace cosine squared with one minus sine squared because sine squared plus cosine squared is one now at this point we can split the fraction into two fractions so we could divide one by sine squared and we can divide sine squared by itself now you need to be familiar with the reciprocal identities intrigue one over sine is cosecant so one over sine squared is cosecant squared and sine squared divided by sine squared is one so this is what we now have now what is the antiderivative of cosecant squared the derivative of cotangent is a negative cosecant squared so the antiderivative of negative cosecant squared is cotangent so the antiderivative of positive cosecant squared is negative cotangent and the anti-derivative of negative one d theta is going to be negative theta and then plus c now this is the answer it's the integral but not with the appropriate variables because we started with an x variable and now we have to change theta back into an x variable so how can we do that now recall we said that x is equal to two sine theta so if we divide both sides by two sine theta is x over two so we can make a right triangle now you need to be familiar with the principles of sohcahtoa the soul part of sokatoa tells us that sine theta is equal to the opposite side divided by the adjacent side so let's place the angle theta here so opposite to theta is x that's on top divided by the hypotenuse so the hypotenuse is 2. now we've got to find the missing side so whenever you have a right triangle you can use the pythagorean theorem c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared c is the hypotenuse which is two we could say a is x and b is the missing side that we're looking for so two squared is 4 and if we subtract both sides by x squared we're going to have 4 minus x squared is equal to b squared so the missing side b is going to be 4 the square root of 4 minus x squared so we can put that here now if sine theta is x divided by 2 what is tangent theta based on sohcahtoa tangent is opposite over adjacent this is opposite this is adjacent so tangent will be x over the square root of four minus x squared cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent it's 1 over tangent so if tangent is x divided by the square root of 4 minus x squared cotangent is going to be the reciprocal of that fraction so it's going to be the square root of 4 minus x squared over x so now what about theta what can we replace theta with now recall that sine theta is x divided by 2. so if we take the arc sine of both sides what's going to happen what is the arc sine of sine theta well these two expressions will cancel and so we can say that theta is the arc sine of x over two so we have negative theta so it's going to be negative arc sine x divided by 2 and then plus c so this is the final answer so that's how you can find the indefinite integral using trig substitution now let's work on finding the integral of x cubed divided by the square root of x squared plus nine so we have the form x squared plus a squared or you can write it as a squared plus x squared five plus three and three plus five is the same so what should we replace x with if we see this particular form in this case we need to use the expression x is equal to a tangent theta so a squared is the same as a 9. if a squared is equal to 9 that means a is equal to 3 which means we should replace x with 3 tangent theta so let's go ahead and do that now let's calculate dx the derivative of tangent is secant squared so dx is going to be 3 secant squared theta d theta so on top we can replace x cubed with three tangent theta raised to the third power and then x squared is going to be three tangent theta squared plus nine and so dx is three secant squared theta d theta now three to the third power is 27 so on top we have 27 tangent cube and on the bottom 3 squared is 9 so we're going to have the square root of 9 tangent squared theta plus 9. and then we still have three secant squared theta d theta now in the denominator inside the square root let's take out a 9 so we're going to have the square root of 9 and then after we factor out the gcf we're going to be left over with tangent squared plus 1. now everything else i'm just going to leave it the way it is for now now if you recall one plus tangent squared is secant squared and the square root of nine is three so we now have this expression so now at this point we can cancel three and the square root of secant squared is secant so this is what we now have 27 tangent cube times secant squared theta d theta divided by secant so now at this point we could cancel a secant and so now we're left with the integral of 27 tangent cube secant theta so what can we do to integrate this expression what we have here is a trigonometric integral and instead of writing tangent cube i'm going to replace it with tangent theta times actually tangent squared theta times tangent theta let's write it like that now we need to perform another substitution particularly u substitution at this point so i'm going to make u equal to tangent theta and the reason why i want to do that is so that d u will be actually no that's not gonna work d u will be secant squared i need to change it up a bit let's replace tan squared with secant squared minus one because one plus tangent squared is secant squared now in this format we can replace u with secant theta so that d u the derivative of secant will be secant tangent so it's going to be secant tangent theta d theta so i can replace secant with u so let me get rid of this first and so now this is going to be 27 integral of u squared minus 1 and then tangent secant d theta is the same as d u so this becomes d u you can see that here these two expressions are exactly the same now the antiderivative of u squared that's going to be u to the third power divided by three and the antiderivative of one is simply u and keep in mind we said u is equal to secant so we now have is 27 times secant to the third power divided by three minus secant theta and let's not forget plus c so we could simplify that 27 divided by three is nine so we have nine secant to the third power and then if we distribute the 27 that's going to be minus 27 times secant theta plus c now the last thing we need to do is convert that expression replace theta with x somehow now the first substitution that we made was that x is equal to three tangent theta dividing both sides by three x over three is tangent so now we can make our right triangle so this is going to be theta and here's the right angle now based on sohcahtoa tangent is opposite over adjacent so opposite to theta is x and adjacent to it right next to its stream so now we got to find the missing side so using the pythagorean theorem c squared is a squared plus b squared we could say a is stream b is x so c squared is going to be 9 plus x squared and to solve for c we got to take the square root of both sides so the third side of the triangle is the square root of nine plus x squared so now we can evaluate secant theta using the triangle but let's evaluate cosine the reciprocal of secant now based on sohcahtoa cosine theta is adjacent over hypotenuse adjacent stream so it's going to be 3 over the square root of 9 plus x squared so secant theta which is 1 divided by cosine is the reciprocal of this fraction that's going to be the square root of 9 plus x squared over 3. so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to take out 9 secant theta i'm going to factor out that expression so it's 9 secant theta times secant squared minus 3 plus c now let's replace secant with the square root of 9 plus x squared over three so secant squared we're gonna have to square this expression and then that's gonna be minus three plus c so all we got to do is simplify what we now have so 9 divided by 3 is 3. so we have a 3 in front and then square root 9 plus x squared now once we square the square root of nine plus x squared that will simply be nine plus x squared on the bottom we have three squared so that's going to be nine and then minus three now let's get common denominators so negative three or negative three over one i'm going to multiply the top and bottom by three and so inside the bracket i'm going to have 9 plus x squared divided by 9. actually i need to multiply top and bottom by 9 and not 3. what was i thinking so it's going to be negative 3 times 9 which is negative 27 and then 1 times 9 that's going to be 9. i want to turn this into a single fraction so have nine plus x squared minus 27 divided by 9 plus c now 3 over 9 that reduces to 1 3. so i can get rid of the fraction inside the bracket so i have a 1 3 outside and then square root 9 plus x squared and then 9 minus 27 is negative 18. so i have x squared minus 18 plus c and so this is the final answer for this example you
