let's talk about firat theorem fats theorem states that if F ofx has a local maximum or minimum at C and if fime of C exists then frime of C is equal to zero so let's focus on the graph on the left at this point we have a local maximum so the first part checks out now let's look at the second part at Point C does frpr of C exists we know the function is continuous at Point C there's no jumps or breaks in the graph but is it differentiable if the graph has a smooth turn as opposed to a sharp turn it's going to be differentiable meaning you could take the the derivative of this function and get a value for it so the fact that it's differentiable at Point C that means that fime of C exists at this point now according to Fat's theorem if these conditions are met if F ofx has a local maximum at Point C and if it's differentiable that means if fim of C exists at that point then the conclusion is that the derivative at that point will be zero in other words the slope of the tangent line frpr of C will be equal to zero and the slope of any horizontal line will always be zero so we could see the validity of that statement now let's look at the graph on the right side so at Point C we have a local minimum so the first part checks out now the next part does frime of C exists at Point C what would you say we know it's continuous at Point C there's no jumps or points of discontinuity there but is it differentiable at Point C the answer is no it's not differentiable at Point C we don't have a smooth turn at this point we have a sharp turn here the slope is negative because the function is decreasing and it's becoming more negative then instantaneously the slope changes to a positive value so imagine let's put some numbers here let's say let's extend the graph a little so here we have a horizontal tangent the slope might be zero over here the slope might be 1 over here it's steeper so it might be -2 over here it would be positive2 because it's going up now this will be positive 1 this would be zero so to change from -2 to two without Crossing zero that's not possible and so you can see that this is almost forming a vertical tangent so because we have this sharp turn it's not differentiable at this point so since frime of C does not exist then for the graph on the right side frime of C does not equal zero if you try to find the derivative at this point it doesn't exist because it's not differential at Point C so the basic idea behind firat theorem is that if a function has a local Max or minimum like we have here and if it's differentiable or if frime of C exists at that point then the slope of the tangent line at those points will be equal to zero or in other words frime of C will be equal to zero so that's the basic idea behind for mat theem for those of you who are curious about it so that's going to be basically it for this video now for those of you who want more practice problems on derivatives applications of derivatives even limits or how to calculate the value of a definite integral or just basic integration overall feel free to check out the links in the description section below this video I'm going to be posting more content there for those of you who want extra problems on related topics so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance
