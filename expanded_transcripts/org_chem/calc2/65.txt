Transcript for: Derivative of Sine and Cosine Functions | Calculus
in this lesson we're going to focus on the derivatives of sine and cosine functions so here are some things you need to know the derivative of sine x is cosine x and the derivative of cosine x is negative sine x so with that information go ahead and try the following problems what is the derivative of 4 sine x and what is the derivative of 8 cosine x so using the constant multiple rule the derivative of 4 sine x is going to be 4 times the derivative of sine x and we know that the derivative of sine x is cosine x so the answer is simply 4 cosine x now for the second example this is going to be 8 times the derivative of cosine x and the derivative of cosine is negative sine so the final answer is going to be negative 8 sine x here's two more examples that you could try what's the derivative of three cosine x minus pi sine x and differentiate sine x divided by five go ahead and try those two problems so let's distribute this symbol the derivative of three cosine x minus pi sine x is equivalent to the derivative of three cosine x by itself and the derivative of pi sine x using the constant multiple rule and we have three times the derivative of cosine minus pi is a constant and then times the derivative of sine let me erase this the derivative of cosine is negative sine and the derivative of sine is positive cosine so the final answer is going to be negative 3 sine x minus pi cosine x now let's move on to the next example go ahead and find the derivative of sine x divided by five now the first thing i recommend doing is rewriting the expression so sine over five is basically one-fifth times sine x so now we can use the constant multiple rule so it's going to be the constant one-fifth times the derivative of sine x and the derivative of sine is cosine so it's one-fifth cosine x or you could simply say cosine x divided by 5. now let's say if f of x is sine x how can we prove that f prime of x is indeed cosine x how can we show that well we could use the limit definition of a derivative f prime of x is equal to the limit as h approaches zero f of x plus h minus f of x divided by h so if f of x is sine x what is f of x plus h all we need to do is replace x with x plus h so this is going to be sine x plus h so therefore f prime of x is equal to the limit as h approaches zero sine x plus h minus sine x divided by h now what do we need to do at this point how can we even simplify this expression so what recommendations do you have at this point now you need to be familiar with the sum and difference formulas for sine and cosine so for sine its sine alpha plus beta is equal to sine alpha cosine beta plus cosine alpha sine beta now if we look at the similarities between these two expressions we can replace alpha with x and beta with h so this is going to be x h and then this is x h so now we can say that f prime of x is equal to the limit as h approaches 0 and on top we have sine x cosine h plus cosine x sine h and then minus sine x divided by h now i'm going to change the order of the two terms basically i'm going to switch these two terms and you'll see why five plus three and three plus five is the same so if you're adding two terms you can reverse the order so i'm gonna have cosine x sine h and then plus sine x cosine h minus sine x now even though i have three terms in the numerator i'm going to separate it not into three fractions but into two fractions so i'm going to divide this by h and so i'm going to have the limit as h approaches 0 cosine x sine h divided by h now i'm going to take these two terms and divided by h so my next fraction is going to be plus and i'm going to reverse the order of these two terms negative sine x plus sine x times cosine h divided by h and i need to rewrite the limit expression so there should be a limit as h approaches 0 in that expression so i'm going to take this cosine and move it to the front because it's not affected by this limit expression only h's so i'm going to have cosine x and then times the limit as h approaches 0 sine h divided by h now for the second fraction i can factor out the gcf which is sine x so i'm going to take out negative sine x so i have the limit as h approaches zero negative sine x and is going to be negative sine x divided by itself is positive one and sine cosine divided by negative sign that's going to be negative cosine divided by h now i'm going to take this term move it to the front so i'm going to have minus sine x and then the limit as h approaches 0 1 minus cosine h divided by h perhaps you see where i'm going with this there's two special trigonometric limits that you need to be familiar with the limit as x approaches zero for sine x over x is equal to one that's one of the limits you need to know and if you're not sure about this try plug in a small number close to zero sine of 0.1 divided by 0.1 is 0.998 and as you get closer to 0 let's say 0.01 and it has to be in radian mode not degree mode this is going to be 0.99998 so it gets closer to 1. the second trigonometric limit you need to know is this one the limit as x approaches 0 one minus cosine x over x is equal to zero so these are the two that you need to know in order to do this problem so let's go ahead and finish it so the limit as h approaches zero for sine h over h that's going to equal one and the limit as h approaches zero for one minus cosine over h that's going to be zero so zero times sine is zero so the final answer is cosine so therefore the derivative of sine is equal to cosine you
