Transcript for: Finding The Area Bounded By Three Curves Using Definite Integrals - Calculus
in this video we're going to talk about how to set up an integral that will help us to find the area that's bounded by three curves or three graphs so we're given the equation of the three graphs but we don't know the points of intersection so the first thing we need to do is we need to draw a rough sketch of these graphs so y equals x^2 we know it's a graph that opens up like this now because there's a 1/4 in front of the X2 because it's less than one the graph is going to open in a much wider fashion so instead of being narrow it's going to be wider now the graph y = < TK of X looks like this but it's been shifted two units up so it's going to start from positive two and then it will gradually go in that direction now this graph the one in the middle we have x to the first power so we're dealing with a straight line and we have a negative in front of that X term so that's going to be line that's going in this direction when X is Zer we can see Y is 2 so notice that this graph is in slope intercept form we can see m is a half and the Y intercept or B is 2 so this graph is going to start here and it's going to go down in this direction so right now we could see that this is the area that's bounded by all three curves so there's three points of interest that we need to find out here's one point of intersection here's the second point of intersection and here's the third one now the first point of intersection we know the x value is zero we need to find the other two and what we're going to do is we're going to break this into two regions so the left side we'll call it area one and the right side area two but first let's find the points of intersection so at this point of intersection we have the line - 12 x + 2 that is y is equal to that and we have the curve underneath it 14 x^2 so in order to find the point of intersection we're going to have to set these two equations equal to each other because they will have the same y value at the point of intersection so we're going to have - 12x + 2 is = 14 x^2 so the first thing I'm going to do is get rid of all the fractions I'm going to multiply everything by 4 so -2 * 4 is -2 2 * 4 is 8 1/4 * 4 is 1 so we get this now I'm going to move everything from the left side to the right side so this becomes x^2 + 2x - 8 now it looks like we can Factor this trinomial so two numbers that multiply to 8 but add to the middle coefficient 2 that's going to be pos4 and -2 so this is going to factor out to being x - 2 x + 4 -2 * 4 is8 -2 + 4 gives us pos2 so using a zero product property and setting each factor equal to Z if we set x - 2 = to 0 we'll get X is equal to 2 if we set x + 4 equal to Z and solve for x we'll get that X is equal to -4 so at -4 these two graphs will intersect but we don't need that point this is the one that we need at x = 2 is where they're going to meet now remember this graph is not drawn a scale but as long as we can identify the points of intersection and where the Shaded region is going to be even if we don't have the most accurate graph we can still get the right answer now we need to find the next point of intersection and so we need to set this equation equal to this one so we're going to set these two equations equal to each other cuz this top curve represents this equation so we're going to have the < TK x + 2 is = 14 x^2 now what I'm going to do is I'm going to subtract both sides by two so instead of having positive two I'm going to have -2 on the right side now to get rid of the fractions I'm going to multiply everything by 4 so this is going to be 4 < TK X = x^2 - 8 now to get rid of the square root symbol I'm going to have to square both sides on the Left 4 S is 16 the square root of x^2 is just X on the right side I'm going to I need to foil this expression so here we're going to have x to the 4th this is going to be 8x^2 plus another 8x^2 which is -16 x^2 and then 8 * 8 is postive 64 this is going to be a little challenging to factor you could solve these equations with a graph and calculator or you can plug in numbers until it works so moving the term to the left side the 16x it will be -6x on the right side now let's see if we can Factor this polinomial so I'm going to factor out the GCF we're going to factor by grouping so let's take out the GCF or the greatest common factor in the first two terms which is going to be x^2 x 4 / x^2 that's that's x^2 and -16 x^2 / x^2 is -16 in the last two terms I'm going to factor out -16 so -6x / -16 is X POS 64 / -16 is -4 now x^2 - 16 we have the difference of two squares so to factor it it's going to be the square otk of x^2 which is X and the square otk of 16 is 4 one of them is going to be positive the other will be negative now notice that we have a common factor and that is x - 4 so we could factor out x - 4 once we take out x - 4 from this term we'll be left with what's left over and that is x^2 * x + 4 and once we take it out out of the second term we're left with -6 now we don't really have to worry about anything here all we need to do is set this Factor equal to zero then the entire thing will be equal to zero so when we set x - 4 equal to Z we'll get X is equal to 4 and that is going to be the point of intersection that we're looking for and we could verify if you plug in four into this equation 4^ 2 is 16 * 1/4 you get Y is equal to 4 and if you plug in four here theun of 4 is 2 plus another two you get Y is equal to 4 so we have the Y value at this point so that's the point for 4 so now that we have the points of intersection we can find the area by the way if you need to find the area between two curves let's say this is f and this is G and we want to find the area between points A and B the area for that region is going to be the definite integral from A to B of the top function f ofx minus the bottom function G of X so that's how we can calculate the area of the Shaded region using integrals so let's calculate area one for area one the top function is this equation s < TK x + 2 the bottom function is the line y = - 12x + 2 so for A1 is going to be the integral from A to B that is from 0 to 2 of the top function < tkx + 2 minus the bottom function which is - 12 x + 2 the parentheses here is important because this negative sign needs to be distributed and let's not forget the DX term now for area two we're going to integrate it from 2 to 4 the top function is the square < TK of x + 2 again the bottom part is going to be 1/4 x^2 so we're going to integrate this from 2 to 4 and this is going to beunk x + 2 minus 14 x^2 so the total area is the sum of A1 and A2 so it's the first integral from 0 to 2 squ < TK x + 2 - - 12 x x + 2 and then it's going to be plus the second integral from 2 to 4 of the < TK x + 2 -4 x^2 so that is the integral or the integral Expressions that we need in order to get the total area of the Shaded region
