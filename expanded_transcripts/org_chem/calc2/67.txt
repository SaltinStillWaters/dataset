what is the limit as h approaches 0 of the expression ln x plus h minus ln x divided by h how do you go about evaluating this limit well the only thing you could do is you need to recognize the formula that this expression is associated with that is the definition of the derivative f prime of x is equal to the limit as h approaches zero of f of x plus h minus f of x over h so in order to find the value of this expression we need to determine what f of x is we can clearly see that f of x is ln x and this entire expression is equal to f prime of x so what is the derivative of ln x the derivative of l and x is one over x so that's the answer to the original expression it's simply equal to one over x the derivative of l and x let's try another one let's say we have the limit as h approaches zero of sine x plus h minus sine x divided by h so once again what we need to do is determine f of x because this entire expression is equal to f prime of x f of x in this problem is going to equal sine x so all we need to do is find the derivative of sine so hopefully you remember your the derivatives of trigonometric functions the derivative of sine is cosine and so this entire expression is equal to cosine of x so that's how you can evaluate limits that appear in this form now what about this problem let's say we have the limit as x approaches pi over six and we have the expression tangent x minus tangent pi over six divided by x minus pi over 6 so go ahead and take a minute and try that example this one is a little bit different than the previous two examples now the first thing we need to do is find the formula that corresponds to this expression and here it is this is the alternative definition of the derivative f prime of a is equal to the limit as x approaches a of f of x minus f of a over x minus a so what we need to do is determine two things in these two expressions f of x and a so we can clearly see that f of x is tangent x and we could also see that a is pi over six so this entire expression is equal to f prime of a or f prime of pi over six now if f of x is equal to tangent x what is f prime of x what is the derivative of tangent x the derivative of tangent is secant squared now our goal is to find f prime of a that's what this entire expression is equal to or f prime of pi over six so if f prime of x is secant x what is f prime of pi over six if we can get that that's going to be the answer to this entire expression f prime of pi over six is going to be equal to secant squared pi over six now what is secant squared pi over six secant is one over cosine so secant squared is going to be one over cosine squared pi over six now what is cosine pi over six cosine pi over six or cosine of 30 degrees is equal to the square root of three over two now this is squared the square root of three squared is just three two squared is four so we have one over three over four which is four over three so this right here is the final answer to the problem that's equal to the value of this limit
