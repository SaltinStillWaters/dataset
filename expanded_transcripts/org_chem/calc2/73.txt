Transcript for: Instantaneous Rate of Change
now the next thing we're going to talk about is the difference between the average rate of change and the instantaneous rate of change so let's say if you're given a function f of x is equal to x cubed and the question asked what is the instantaneous rate of change at x equal one the instantaneous rate of change is simply f prime of one you just gotta find the first derivative and determine its value when x is one so first let's find f prime of x using a power rule it's simply three x squared so the instantaneous rate of change at x equals 1 is 3 times 1 squared which is 3. this value represents the slope of the tangent line now what exactly is that so let's say if we graph x cubed let's focus on the right side at x equals one which is probably around here if we draw a line that touches the curve at one point only that's the tangent line the slope of that line is equal to one if you recall slope is basically the rise over the run you can calculate the slope by dividing the change in y by the change in x so the slope of the tangent line at a point is the same as the instantaneous rate of change so for this example it's equal to three now what about the average rate of change what is the average rate of change between the points 0 2 that is when x is 0 and when x is 2 and also let's say between 1.9 and 2.1 notice what happens when you calculate it for these two different uh for these two different intervals let's start with the first one to find the average rate of change is simply f of b minus f of a over b minus a so let's just call this average so what is a and what is b a is zero b is two i do want to change this i want to make that 0.9 and 1.1 but let's focus on this example so we need to find f of two minus f of zero divided by two minus zero to find f of two we gotta plug it into this equation so that's uh two to the third power minus zero to the third power divided by two two to the third is eight zero to the third is just zero and eight divided by two is four so notice that the average rate of change is four which is close to the instantaneous rate of change the instantaneous rate of change at x equals one is three so they're not too far apart notice that the midpoint between a and b that is the midpoint between zero and two is one whenever that's the case you can use the average rate of change to estimate the instantaneous rate of change now 0 and 2 are not very very close to 1 however 0.9 and 1.1 are much closer to 1 than 0 and 2r and 1 is the midpoint of 0.9 and 1.1 as these two values approach this value the average rate of change approaches the instantaneous rate of change so let's calculate the average rate of change using these values and let's see what's going to happen so f of 1.1 minus f of 0.9 divided by 1.1 minus 0.9 so we're going to need a calculator for this 1.1 raised to the third power is about point three three one point nine raised to the third power is point seven two nine one point one minus point nine is point two one point three three one minus point 0.729 that's 0.602 and if we divide that by 0.2 this is equal to 3.01 so as you can see the average rate of change is very close to the instantaneous rate of change here's an example let's say that f of x is equal to x to the fourth power what i want you to do is to estimate the instantaneous rate of change at x equals two using the average rate of change so to use the average rate of change formula we'll need two x values so let's pick two x values that are very close to two let's use one point nine and two point one one point nine and two point one are close to two and two is the midpoint of 1.9 2.1 you want to make sure it's right in the middle so let's evaluate the average rate of change it's going to be f of b minus f of a divided by b minus a where a is 1.9 and b is 2.1 so this is equal to 2.1 raised to the fourth power minus 1.9 raised to the fourth power divided by 0.2 2.1 to the fourth power that's 19.4481 1.9 raised to the fourth power that's 13 13.0321 so let's go ahead and subtract those two numbers you should get 6.4 and if we divide that by 0.2 we get 32.08 so the instantaneous rate of change is approximately about now to find the exact instantaneous rate of change we need to find the first derivative the derivative of x to the fourth is 4 x cubed and now all we got to do is plug in 2. so that's going to be 4 times 2 to the third power 2 to the third power is 8 4 times 8 is 32 so the instantaneous rate of change is exactly 32 and this is an approximation now you might be wondering why do we need to approximate it if we already have the function if we can already find the exact value using the function sometimes you may not be given the function sometimes you might have a table of values and so you can't just find the derivative of a function when you don't have it if you have a table of values the only way you can get the only way you can approximate the instantaneous rate of change is by using the average rate of change formula so let's say if we have a table let's say this table represents the distance that an object travels given the time so at t equals zero the distance traveled is zero five seconds later the distance traveled is let's say 12 meters 10 seconds later the total distance traveled 24.3 15 seconds later let's say it's about 37.1 20 seconds later 49.8 25 seconds later 76.1 so t is in seconds and the unit for d is in meters estimate the instantaneous speed when t is equal to 15. so what is the speed of the object at t equals 15. so here's 15. we have the distance the speed is basically distance divided by time so to find the instantaneous speed we can estimate it using the average speed and to find the average speed it's going to be the distance at 20 minus the distance at 10 divided by 20 minus so you have to use the average rate of change the rate of change of distance is speed now we chose 10 and 20 because 15 is right in the middle of 10 and 20. you don't want to use 10 to 15 because that's going to give you the average speed at 12.5 and you don't want to use 15 and 20 because you're going to estimate the average speed at 17.5 i mean the instantaneous speed at 17.5 so if you want to get the estimate of the instantaneous speed at 15 use 10 and 20. because 15 is the midpoint of 10 and 20 and out of everything that we have listed 10 and 20 is closest to 15. we don't use 5 and 25 even though 15 is the midpoint of those values because they're too far away from 15. so you want to use two numbers that where 15 is the midpoint and at the same time they're close to 15. so now let's go ahead and get the answer so the distance at t equals 20 is 49.8 and the distance at t equals 10 is 24.3 20 minus 10 is 10. so now let's subtract the two values 49.8 minus 24.3 is about 25.5 and if we divide that by 10 this is about 2.55 and it's meters per second because distance was on top which is meters and the time was on the bottom which is seconds so you get the speed meters per second so the instantaneous uh speed is approximately about 2.55 that's the average speed but the instantaneous speed should be somewhere around 2.5 2.6 you
