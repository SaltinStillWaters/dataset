Transcript for: Graphing Logarithmic Functions
now let's talk about graphing logarithmic functions let's go over the four basic shapes so let's say if you have log x where x and y are both positive kind of like what we did in the last lesson in this case the graph is going to travel towards quadrant one logarithmic functions are basically the inverse of an exponential function exponential functions contain a horizontal asymptote logarithmic functions contain a vertical asymptote exponential functions they increase at an increase in rate logarithmic functions they increase at a decrease in rate so let's say if we were to put 2 to the x and log to the x on the same graph this is the basic curve of 2 to the x and the graph log base 2 dx looks like this i'm going to highlight it in blue these two functions are inverse functions an inverse function reflects across the line y equals zero with its counterpart so let's say this is f this is the inverse of f they reflect about the line y equals x now what is the graph of log of negative x this graph is going to reflect across the y axis so it's going to go towards quadrant two in quadrant two x is negative and y is positive now the next shape we need to be familiar with is this one let's say if we have negative log positive x if the negative is in front instead of reflecting over the y axis it's going to reflect over the x-axis so it's going to travel towards quadrature in quadrant 3 x is positive but y is negative and the last one where y and x are both negative this is going to occur in quadrant three so this reflects relative to the origin it reflects across the origin relative to the original function so those are the four basic logarithmic functions they need to know using transformations of course so now let's work on some examples let's graph log base two of x so the first thing you want to do is you want to set x equal to three things you want to set it equal to zero this is going to be the vertical asymptote next you want to set it equal to one and also whatever the base is the base is this number so you want to set it equal to two next make a table with the two points one and two log of one is always zero now log base two of two if these two numbers are the same it's going to be equal to one so now we can graph it so the vertical asymptote is x equals zero which is basically the y-axis and now we have the points 1 0 which is the x intercept and 2 1. so we're going to start from the y axis and follow those two points and that's how you graph now for exponential functions the domain was all real numbers for logarithmic functions the range is all real numbers notice that the lowest y value is negative infinity and the highest is infinity this function will continue to increase forever so the range is from negative infinity to infinity the range of exponential functions was restricted the range for i mean the domain for logarithmic functions is also restricted the lowest x value is zero and the highest is infinity so the domain is going to be from zero to infinity another way you can find the domain is take the inside and set it greater than zero x is greater than zero from zero to infinity not including zero because zero is their vertical asymptote here's another one that you could try log base three of x minus one plus two feel free to pause the video and go ahead and graph it so let's take the inside part x minus one and let's set it equal to three things zero 1 and whatever the base is equal to in this case the base is 3 and find the value of x for the first one this is going to give us the vertical asymptote so x equal 1 that's the vertical asymptote the next one will have two and then three plus one is four so the two points that we're going to plug in contain the x values two and four and x equals one just keep that in mind this is the vertical asymptote now let's find the y values what is y when x is two so log base three two minus one plus two two minus one is basically one log of one is always zero so this is zero plus two which is two now what is the y value when x is four so this is going to be four minus one four minus one is three log base 3 of 3 because the numbers are the same it's going to be 1 and 1 plus 2 is 3. so now we have everything that we need in order to graph it so let's go ahead and do that now so first let's plot the vertical asymptote which is at x equals one so next we have the point two comma two which is not there but here and then we have the point 4 comma 3 which is there so the graph starts from the vertical asymptote and then it increases towards those points and so that's how you can plot it now go ahead and identify the domain and the range for this graph the lowest y value is negative infinity and the highest is infinity so the range is always going to be all real numbers negative infinity to infinity now let's talk about the domain the lowest x value in this case is the vertical asymptote it's one the highest is positive infinity so it's going to be from one to infinity and so that's the domain for this function now let's try one more example three minus log base four five minus x so let's set five minus x equal to three things zero one and whatever the base is in this case the base is four so x is equal to five that's the vertical asymptote five minus four is one so x is four and five minus one is four so x is one the two x values that we're gonna need are one and four and the vertical asymptote is x equals five now let's fill in the table so let's replace x with one five minus one is four log base four of four because the numbers are the same is equal to one so this is going to be three minus one which is two now let's find the next point five minus four is one and log of one regardless of what the base is is always equal to zero three minus zero is three so all we need is two points and the asymptote once we have that we can go ahead and graph it so let's begin by plotting the vertical asymptote which is at x equals five now we have the point one comma two and also four comma three so the graph is going to start from the vertical asymptote and then it's going to follow these two points let's see if i can uh draw a better graph and i miss it again one more time so it's going to look something like that so notice that the graph is going towards quadrantry eventually it's going to get towards quadrant 3 but it's going to take a while before it gets there you can look at the signs in front of x and y to determine that so notice that the sign in front of x is negative which means that the graph is going to go towards the left and the sign in front of the log is negative which is associated with y if y is negative that means that it's going to go down so relative to this point it's traveling towards quadrant three so just by looking at the signs you can determine what direction it's going to go if you don't want to do that the points will tell you where to go always start from the vertical asymptote and follow the two points and you're gonna get it right as long as you start from the asymptote you can't graph it like this it's just this is not going to work the only way to graph it is to start from the asphalt and follow the two points
