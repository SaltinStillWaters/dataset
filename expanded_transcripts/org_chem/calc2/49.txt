consider this problem what is the limit as x approaches e of the expression ln x minus 1 over x minus e how can we evaluate this logarithmic limit well we can try direct substitution we can replace x with e so we're going to have l and e minus one divided by e minus e the natural log of e is one and so one minus one is zero e minus e is also zero so this is indeterminate this is not going to work now we could try using l'hopital's rule to see if we can get the answer since we have an indeterminate form and here's the gist of l'hopital's rule let's say if we want to evaluate the limit as x approaches a of f of x over g of x this is equal to the limit as x approaches a of f prime of x divided by g prime of x so if we were to take the derivative of the top and the bottom we would get the derivative of ln x is just one over x the derivative of negative one is zero the derivative of x is one the derivative of e is a constant that's zero so this becomes one over x well technically the limit as x approaches e of one over x so the final answer for this problem is 1 over e because at this point we could use direct substitution so that's how we can evaluate this particular limit now we can check our answer just to make sure that it is indeed the right answer so this entire answer is one over e let's get the decimal value of that one over e is equal to 0.3678794412 now e is a number as well e is equal to 2.718281828 and the pattern continues we're going to plug in an x value that is close to e as x continues to approach e if we get this number then we know our answer is correct so let's start with 2.7 if x is 2.7 what is the value of that expression so ln 2.7 minus 1 divided by 2.7 minus e if you plug this in you should get point three six nine one two two one zero four two so it's not too far away from this valley but let's pick uh a number that's even closer let's try 2.718 so if we plug in ln 2.718 minus 1 over 2.718 minus e so this becomes point three six seven eight nine eight five one three two so this is even closer to the actual answer and we can try one more let's try two point seven one eight two eight so i got point three six seven eight seven nine five six five four and that's close enough i mean we have the first six digits correct after decimal which i think is pretty good but that's how you can evaluate this particular limit the best thing to do the most efficient way is to use l'hopital's rule because we have an indeterminate form zero over zero so we have this indeterminate form or infinity over the infinity you could use l'hopital's rule to evaluate the limit so that's it for this video thanks for watching and don't forget to subscribe to this channel
