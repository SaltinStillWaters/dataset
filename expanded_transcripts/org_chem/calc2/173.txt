Transcript for: Average Value of a Function Over an Interval - Calculus
so let's say if we have a linear function f of x is equal to two x plus one over the interval one to five how can we find the average value of the function over the interval one to five well a straw graph so we have a y-intercept of one and a slope of two and so we're focused on the interval one to five now according to the mean value theorem the area under the curve which is basically the area that's shaded that's equal to the area of the rectangle at some value c now the average value is f c that's what we're looking for that's the average value of the function and it occurs when the area of the rectangle is equal to the area under the curve so the area under the curve is the definite integral from a to b the area of the rectangle i need to redraw it's going to be the width of the rectangle times the height so the height is basically f c the width is b minus a so it's the height times the width now to get the average value we need to isolate f c so we need to divide both sides by b minus a so the average value is 1 over b minus a of the integral a to b f of x dx now if we were to plug in 1 into this equation f of 1 is going to be 2 times 1 plus 1 so that's going to be three and f of five which is here that's gonna be two times five plus one which is eleven if we average f of a and f b three plus eleven is fourteen divided by 2 that's 7. now do you think the average value will it be less than 7 equal to 7 or greater than 7 how will it compare to the average y value at these x values it turns out for a linear function the average value of the function will be the average y value in the interval a to b now if it's not linear it can vary but for a linear function we should expect 7 as our answer because that's the average y value from a to b now the average x value if you average 1 and 5 you're going to get 3. so for a linear function c is going to equal 3. and that's what we need to calculate we need to calculate f c the average y value and c the x value where the area under the curve equals the area of the rectangle so let's see if c is equal to 3 and f c is equal to seven so let's start with the formula so the average value is going to be one over b minus a times the definite integral from a to b f of x dx so we know that a is one b is five so this is going to be one over five minus one integral from one to five f of x is two x plus one and then times d x five minus one is four the anti-derivative of two x that's gonna be two x squared over two and for one it's x evaluated from one to five now we could cancel two if we plug in five five squared is 25 plus five and then minus if we plug in one it's going to be one squared plus one 25 plus 5 is 30 and 1 plus 1 is 2. if we factor out 1 4 it's going to be 30 minus 2 which is 28 and one-fourth of 28 is seven so notice that the average value is indeed equal to the average y value in the interval so the average value of the function is seven now let's set the average value of the function equal to f of c so the average y value is seven f of c is going to be two c plus one subtracting one from both sides seven minus 1 is 6 and if we divide by 2 c is 3. so for a linear function c is the average of a and b and the average value of the function for a linga function is the average of f of a and f b and i run out of space let's try another problem so what if we don't have a linear function let's say if we have x squared from zero to four let's see how the average value of the function will compare to f of a and f of b the average of those two numbers so let's calculate f of a plus f of b divided by two so that's going to be f of 0 plus f of 4 over 2. so when x is 0 y is 0 when x is 4 4 squared is 16 16 divided by 2 is 8. the average y value i'm going to write like this is eight and the average c value or rather the average x value in the interval that is if we average a and b we see the midpoint is two so now let's calculate c and f of c in this problem so it's going to be one over b minus a so a is zero b is four so this is going to be four minus zero and then we have the integral from a to b f of x dx so the antiderivative of x squared is x cubed over three evaluated from zero to four so if we plug in four it's going to be four to the third over three and then minus zero to the third over three four to the third divided by four is four squared and four squared is sixteen and sixteen over three as a decimal is five point thirty three or 5.3 repeating so in this example notice that the average value of the function is less than the average y value now let's calculate the c value that corresponds to that average value so the average value let's set it equal to f c so f of c is x squared and the average value we said was 16 over 3. so let's take the square root of both sides so this is going to be 4 over the square root of 3 and that's equal to x now granted we get 2 answers plus or minus but the negative answer is not going to be in this interval so we'll stick with the positive answer now you can rationalize it if you want so if you multiply the top and the bottom by the square root of 3 this is going to be 4 square root 3 over 3. and so the decimal value for that is 2.309 so in this case this is the c value as well i should have wrote this as c squared instead of x squared f c is equal to c squared notice that c is greater than the average x value on the interval a to b and so if you don't have a linear function c is not going to be the midpoint of a and b and the average value of the function is not going to be the average y value if it's not a linear function but if it is a linear function then the average function value will be the average y value let's try one more example so let's say f of x is equal to the square root of x on the interval 4 to 16. go ahead and find the average value of the function and find a value of c that corresponds to it so let's start with the equation the average value is going to be 1 over b minus a times the area under the curve so b is 16 a is 4 and f of x is the square root of x which is x raised to the one half 16 minus 4 is 12 and the antiderivative of x to the one half one half plus one is three over two and then we need to multiply by two over three and then evaluate it from four to sixteen so let's move the constants to the front two over twelve can be reduced to one over six and one over six times one third that's going to be one over eighteen so we have one over eighteen and then x to the three halves evaluated from four to sixteen so this is going to be 16 to the three halves minus four to the three halves now what is 16 raised to the three halves this is 16 to the half raised to the third power 16 to the one half is basically the square root of 16 which is four and four to the third is 64. now for this one apply the two first the square root of four is two and then raise it to the third power two to the third is eight so four raised to the one point five is eight and then 64 minus 8 is 56 so we have 56 over 18. and we could divide both numbers by 2. half of 56 is 28 half of 18 is nine so the answer the average value of the function is 28 over nine now let's calculate the c value that gives us that average value so the average value of the function and the interval of 4 to 16 is that number f of c is the square root of c so we need to square both sides 28 squared is 784 9 squared is 81 and so this is equal to c now the midpoint of 4 and 16 4 plus 16 is 20 20 over 2 is 10. so the average x value is 10 and c as a decimal 784 divided by 81 that's 9.679 so these numbers are close but in this example c is less than the average x value now let's calculate the average y value and compare it to the average value of the function so f of a that's f of 4 plus f of b divided by 2. f of 4 the square root of 4 is 2 the square root of 16 is 4. two plus four is six six divided by two is three now twenty eight over nine twenty seven over nine is three twenty eight over nine that's about three point one repeating so in this case the average value of the function is greater than the average y value in this problem now let's analyze the three examples that we have so let's draw three graphs so the first one was a linear function let me graph it in white that goes up like this the second one was x squared and it looks like that for the most part and then the square root of x was our last example so this was 2x plus 1 x squared and the square root of x now for the first one it was between one and five the midpoint of which is three for the second one it was between zero and four the average x value for that is 2 and for the last one it was from 4 to 16 with an average x value of 10. now let's focus on the x values in this example c was equal to three so c was equal to the average x value for the second example c was greater than 2 it was 2.309 and so c was greater than the average x value and for the third example c was less than the average x value it was 9.679 now let's focus on the y values when x is one y is three and when x is five y is eleven and the average of those two is seven now the average function value was seven as well so we could say the average value of the function is equal to the average y value for that example now for the second example when x is 0 y is 0 when x is 4 y is 16. so the average between 0 and 16 is 8. but the average function value was less than 8. in fact it was about 5.3 repeating so the average function value was less than the average y value for that problem now for the last one the square root of 4 is 2 and the square root of 16 is four keep in mind this is not drawn to scale so the average of these two numbers is three however the function value was 3.1 so for this particular value or for this particular graph rather the average function value was greater than the average y value and let's understand why so for a linear function the average function value will equal the average y value but if it's not linear it's going to vary from 0 to 4 if we draw the secant line notice that the curve for the function is below the secant line therefore the average value of the function will be less than the average y value this one it's on a secant line and that's why the average function value is the same as the average y value for the last example if we draw the secant line between 4 and 16 notice that the curve is above the secant line so the average function value is greater than the average y value you
