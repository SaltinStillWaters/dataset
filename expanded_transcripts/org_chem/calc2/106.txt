number one a 17-foot ladder is leaning against a building the foot of the ladder is eight feet from the base of the building and it's sliding away from the building at three feet per second how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall of the building well let's find out so let's start with the picture so let's say that's the building this is the ground and let's say this is the ladder now let's call this x y and let's say the length of the ladder is z now let's write down what we know so we have a 17 foot ladder therefore z is 17. the foot of the ladder is 8 feet from the base so that's the value of x and we don't know the value of y now we know that the ladder is sliding away from the building that is it's sliding in this direction at 3 feet per second so every second x is going to change by three feet so that's dx dt that's the rate at which x is changing so let's write that here so dx dt is three feet per second now we don't have the value for dydt but in part a that's what we're looking for how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall so as the ladder slides to the right it's also sliding down the wall and so y is changing as well notice that y is decreasing while x is increasing because x is increasing dx dt is going to be positive and because y is decreasing we should expect a negative answer for d y d t so let's go ahead and calculate d y d t so we need an equation that relates x y and z so notice that we have a right triangle and according to the pythagorean theorem c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared now c is the hypotenuse so c matches with z and we can say a is x b is y so z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared now before we could differentiate both sides with respect to time we need to calculate the value of y so z is 17 x is eight what is y 17 squared that's 289 8 times 8 is 64. 289 minus 64 is 225 and now we need to take the square root of both sides the square root of 225 is 15. so now that we have the value of y we should differentiate this equation with respect to time so the derivative of z squared is what is it 2z times dz dt now notice that z is not a variable but a constant z cannot change so therefore dz dt is zero so anytime you find the derivative of a constant it's going to be zero so this is going to be zero it's equal to two x times dx dt and the derivative of y squared will be two y times d y dt so we could divide everything by two zero divided by two is zero so we can get rid of this x is eight dx dt is three y is 15 and we need to calculate dy dt now 8 times 3 is 24 so let's move that to this side on the left side is going to be negative 24 and that's equal to 15 times d y dt so if we divide both sides by 15 we can see that d y dt is negative 24 over 15. but we can reduce that so let me just reduce it somewhere on the left side 24 is eight times three fifteen is five times three so we could cancel with three so therefore d y dt is negative eight over five and that's it for part a now let's move on to part b how fast is the area formed by the ladder changing at this instant so what is the area of a right triangle the area of a right triangle is one half base times height in this problem we can see that the base is x and the height is y now we have dx dt and dy dt so in this form we can go ahead and differentiate this equation with respect to time the derivative of a is going to be d a dt which is what we're looking for and then we need to use the product rule so let's say if we have f times g it's going to be the derivative of the first part times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second so let's say the first part f we're going to say it's one half x and the second part g is y so f prime the derivative of one half times x is going to be one half times the derivative of x according to the constant multiple rule the derivative of x is one but times dx dt and then we need to multiply by the second part which is g and g is y and then plus the first part which is not going to change so that's one half x times the derivative of the second part which is g prime the derivative of y is one times d y dt now all we need to do is plug in the information that we have so this is going to be one half times dx dt which is 3 and then d y dt i mean not d y dt but y that's 15 and then plus one half times x which is eight and d y dt is negative eight over five and i forgot to write the units for dydt so let's talk about that so what's the units for y x and y have the units feet and then the unit for time is going to be seconds so dy dt is feet per second now let's go back to this problem so we have 3 times 15 which is 45 and half of that that's going to be 45 over 2. half of eight is four and four times negative eight that's going to be negative 32 so this is negative 32 over five so we need to combine these two fractions and so we have to get common denominators the common denominator between 2 and 5 is going to be 10 so we need to multiply the fraction on the right by 2 over 2 and the one on the left by 5 over 5. so what's 45 times 5 40 times 5 is 200 5 times 5 is 25 so this is going to be 225 over 10. 32 times 2 is 64. and if we subtract 225 by 64 that will give us 161. so da over dt is going to be 161 over 10 and the units is going to be square feet because we're dealing with area per second so this is the answer for part b now let's move on to part c find the rate at which the angle between the ladder and the ground is changing at this instant so where's the angle between the ladder and the ground so here is the ladder here's the ground therefore the angle between that is right here which we'll call theta now we need to relate theta to x y or z and we can use any of the three trig functions sine cosine or tangent however one of them i would not recommend using since it involves a lot of unnecessary work now let's review sohcahtoa hopefully you remember the principles taught and trig so let's start with so this tells us that sine theta is equal to the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse opposite to theta is y and the hypotenuse which is across the box that's z that's the longest side so sine theta is y divided by z now k tells us that cosine theta is equal to the adjacent side adjacent to theta is right next to it that's x divided by the hypotenuse z and toa tangent theta is equal to the opposite side y divided by the adjacent side x now keep this in mind x and y are variables because they're changing z is a constant now for sine you have a variable and a constant you could simply use the power rule to differentiate that and the same is true for cosine you have a variable and a constant for tangent you have two variables and so you need to use the quotient rule if you're going to use tangent theta and let's avoid the quotient rule so let's not use tangent theta i'm going to use sine theta so sine theta is equal to the opposite side of theta divided by the hypotenuse so i'm going to rewrite y over z as 1 over z times y so you can see what we have is a constant times the variable now let's differentiate both sides with respect to time so the derivative of sine theta is cosine theta and then according to the chain rule we need to differentiate the inside function theta the derivative of theta is one times d theta over dt now let's use the constant multiple rule so the derivative of a constant times y is going to be the constant times the derivative of y which is one times d y dt now what is cosine theta if you recall we said that cosine theta is equal to the adjacent side which is x over the hypotenuse c and we have x x is 8 and z is seventeen so therefore cosine theta is eight over seventeen our goal is to calculate the rate at which the angle is changing so we need to calculate d theta dt z we have that it's 17 and d y dt is negative eight over five so now let's multiply both sides by 17 over eight if we do so notice that the eights on the left cancel and on the right will cancel and at the same time the 17s will cancel on both sides so just by doing that simple move we have the answer so the only thing that's left over is d theta dt and as we can see it's equal to negative one over five and that's it so that's the answer for part c d theta dt is negative one over five and let's talk about the units the unit for d theta d t so the angle is in radians and the time is in seconds and that concludes this lesson so that's it for this video thanks for watching you
