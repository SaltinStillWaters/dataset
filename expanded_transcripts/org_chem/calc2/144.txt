Transcript for: Marginal Cost, Marginal Revenue, and Marginal Profit
the cost and demand functions are shown below what is the average selling price at a production level of 500 units so this is the demand function also known as the price function and it tells us the selling price at a certain production level so don't confuse this with the profit function this is the price function so the price at 500 is going to be 50 minus point zero one times five hundred now point zero one times five hundred that's five so this is fifty minus five which means this is going to be 45 so if the company is selling 500 units the average price that they're charging for is going to be 45 dollars per unit now let's move on to part b what is the revenue total cost and profit at a production level of 500 units let's start with the revenue the revenue function or the sales function is going to be x times p of x so it's the production level times the selling price and so that's going to be as an equation that's going to be x times p of x which is 50 minus 0.01 x so it's 50x minus 0.01 x squared so now let's calculate r of 500 so that's going to be 50 times 500 minus 0.01 times 500 squared so that's going to be twenty two thousand five hundred now let me help you to understand what this number represents so we know that the price the average price at 500 units is 45 dollars per unit and we're selling 500 units so it's going to be 500 units times a selling price of 45 dollars per unit and so we can see that the word unit will cancel and it's just 500 times 45 and that gives you a total revenue of 22 500. so that's how much money the company is receiving for selling 500 units of this particular product and so that's the revenue now what about the total cost and the profit of the company well we already have the total cost function and here it is so we just gotta plug in five hundred so let's see what this is going to give us so the cost is seven thousand now let's determine the profit so to distinguish the profit from basically the price function i'm going to put this little bar on top now the profit function is the difference between the revenue function and the cost function so p of x is going to be r of x where r of x was 50x minus 0.01 x squared keep in mind r of x is just the price times x and then minus the cost function which is 2500 plus 4x plus .01 x squared so let's begin by distributing this particular negative sign so it's going to be 50x minus 0.01 x squared minus 2500 minus 4x minus 0.01 x squared now let's combine like terms so we have 50x minus 4x so that's going to be 46x and then we have negative 0.01 minus 0.01 so that's going to be negative 0.02 x squared and then minus 2500. now let's calculate the profit level at a production level 500 so it's going to be 46 times 500 minus 0.02 times 500 squared minus twenty five hundred so the profit is fifteen thousand five hundred so we have the total cost at a production level of 500 at seven thousand dollars and the profit of the company at a production level of 500 is 15 500. and we saw that the revenue at that same production level was 22 500. and that makes sense because if you subtract the revenue by the cost two thousand five hundred minus seven thousand you should get a profit of fifteen thousand five hundred because the profit is the difference between a revenue and a cost now let's move on to part c find a production level that will maximize the profit so how can we do that how can we determine the production level that will maximize the profit well we know that p of x the profit function is the difference between the revenue and the cost function so if we were to find the first derivative of that equation we'll get p prime of x is equal to r prime minus c prime so p prime is the marginal profit that's the derivative of the profit function this is the marginal revenue and this is the marginal cost to maximize a certain function or variable if you want to find a maximum value of a function you need to set the first derivative equal to zero so we want to determine the maximum profit or the production level that would lead to the maximum profit and the maximum profit will occur when the marginal profit is equal to zero which means that r prime minus c prime will be equal to zero so let's focus on that so if i add c prime to both sides of that equation then r prime is equal to c prime whenever the profit is a maximum and so that's how we can find a production level that will maximize the profit we need to set the marginal revenue equal to the marginal cost now we said that the revenue function was 50x minus 0.01 x squared now let's find the marginal revenue the derivative of 50x is 50. the derivative of x squared is 2x times 0.01 so that's 0.02x and then for the marginal cost that's going to be the derivative of this expression the derivative of the constant 2500 is zero the derivative of four x is four and the derivative of point zero one x squared is going to be point zero one times two x or point zero two x so now what we need to do is set the marginal revenue equal to the marginal cost another way in which you can get the same answer is if you set the marginal profit equal to zero because that's where this equation came from so that's another way to get the same answer but let's set these two equal to each other so 50 minus 0.02 x is equal to 4 plus 0.02 x so let's subtract both sides by four and at the same time let's add point zero two x to both sides so 50 minus 4 is 46. .02 plus 0.02 is 0.04 now let's divide both sides by 0.04 so 46 divided by 0.04 is 11.50 so this is the production level that will maximize the profit so if the company wants to make the most money that it can and needs to sell 1150 units to receive the most profit that they can possibly make now let's calculate the maximum profit so we said that the profit function was 46 x minus 0.02 x squared minus 2500 and so if we plug in 500 i mean that 500 by 1150 it's going to be 46 times fifty minus point zero two times eleven fifty squared minus twenty five hundred and so this will give you twenty three thousand nine hundred fifty so that is the maximum profit that the company can make if they choose to sell 1150 units now by the way the other way to get the answer as you mentioned before is to set the marginal profit equal to zero so the marginal profit is going to be the derivative of this function so that's going to be 46 minus 0.02 times 2x or 0.04 x and this will be 0. so if we set this equal to 0 and solve for x you're going to get the same answer it's going to be 46 divided by 0.04 which we know to be 1150 so there's two ways in which you could find the profit or the production level that will maximize the profit so you can find the marginal profit and set it equal to zero and solve for x or you could set the marginal revenue equal to the marginal cost function and then solve for x both methods will lead to the same answer now let's verify that this is indeed the maximum profit so let's organize the information that we have into a table so we're going to have x and p of x so we already know the profit at a production level of 500 and the maximum profit occurs at eleven fifty so let's calculate the profit at a thousand thirteen hundred and fifteen hundred so we have two numbers below this number and two numbers above it so at five hundred units we know that the profit is fifteen thousand five hundred let me use the dollar simple and we know that at eleven fifty the profit was the maximum profit was twenty three thousand nine fifty go ahead and calculate the profit at a production level of a thousand thirteen hundred and fifteen hundred using this equation so forty-six times a thousand minus point zero two times one thousand squared minus twenty five hundred that's going to be twenty three thousand five hundred so we can see that it's less than twenty three thousand nine fifty so now let's try thirteen hundred forty six times thirteen hundred minus point zero two times thirteen hundred squared minus twenty five hundred so that's going to be twenty three thousand five hundred as well and so that's less than twenty three thousand nine fifty and let's try fifteen hundred so forty six times fifteen hundred minus point zero two times fifteen hundred squared minus twenty five hundred that's going to be twenty one thousand five hundred so we can clearly see that the maximum profit does occur at this production level because this value is the highest it's the maximum value that's listed of all the numbers in the second column so the production level that leads to the maximum profit is 11.50 and the maximum profit itself is 23 950 now let's move on to part e what is the marginal profit at a production level of 500 units so we said the marginal profit we wrote it down already it's the derivative of this function which turned out to be 46 minus .04 x now let's calculate it at a production level of 500 units so that's 46 times 0.04 times 500. by the way the marginal profit at 1150 because that's the maximum will be equal to zero anytime you wish to find the maximum value of a function the first derivative must be equal to zero so just keep that in mind so 46 times .04 times 500 that's 26. so the marginal profit at a production level of 500 is 26 dollars per unit so what does this number mean the marginal profit tells us the change in profit if we sell an additional unit so the profit at a production level of 500 is 15 500. so what is the profit at a production level of 501 so let's plug in 501 into this equation so it's going to be 46 times 501 minus 0.02 times 501 squared minus 2500 this will give you fifteen thousand five hundred twenty five point ninety eight now notice the difference between these two numbers if you subtract fifteen thousand five twenty five point nine eight by fifteen thousand five hundred the difference is twenty five dollars and ninety eight cents which for the most part rounds to twenty six dollars per unit and so the marginal profit at 500 units will tell us approximately the increase in profit going from 500 to 501 so if we sell one extra unit it gives us a good approximation of how much the profit will change so going from 500 to 501 it tells us that the profit will increase by approximately 26 and so that's the meaning behind the marginal profit then the same is true for the marginal revenue and the marginal cost the marginal revenue tells you the change in revenue if you decide to sell one more unit and the marginal cost tells you the change in the total cost if you decide to sell one additional unit and so hopefully that gives you a good idea behind the meaning behind the marginal profit margin of revenue and marginal costs so that's it for
