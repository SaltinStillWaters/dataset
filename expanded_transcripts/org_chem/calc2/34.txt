Transcript for: Evaluating Limits With Fractions and Square Roots
now what about the limit as x approaches 4 of 1 over square root x minus 1 over 2 divided by x minus 4. so this time we have a rational function we have fractions and we have a square root so typically when we have a square root we would multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate and when we have fractions we need to multiply the top and the bottom by a common denominator in this example we need to do both you can do it in any order but personally i like to get rid of the fractions first so i'm going to multiply by the common denominator of these two fractions so that's root x times two or simply 2 root x so if we multiply this fraction by 2 root x we can see that root x will cancel and so we're going to have the limit as x approaches 4 of 2 on top and then if we multiply these two fractions i mean the fraction 1 over 2 with 2 root x the twos will cancel leaving behind root x and on the bottom we're just gonna write it as x minus four times two root x so now at this point we need to multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate of the numerator so instead of 2 minus root x is going to be 2 plus root x so on the top we're going to foil 2 times 2 that's going to be equal to 4. let's not forget to rewrite the limit expression and then 2 times root x that's positive 2 root x and multiplying those two this is going to give us negative 2 root x and root x times your x is simply x both negative in front now we're not going to change anything on the bottom we're simply just going to rewrite it exactly the way it was the two middle terms 2 root x and negative two with x these cancel they add up to zero now let's write what we have left over on the top we have a 4 minus x on the bottom nothing changed so notice that 4 minus x and x minus 4 are very similar so just by looking at it you know at this point that we need to take out a negative one if we do so negative x will become positive x positive four will change to negative 4. once we get rid of the x minus 4 on the bottom then we could use direct substitution so this disappears that turns into one so now we have the limit as x approaches four of negative one divided by two root x times two plus the square root of x so this is going to be negative one divided by two square root four times two plus square root four now the square root of four is equal to two so inside the parentheses we have two plus two two times two that's going to be four and two plus two is also four four times four is sixteen so the final answer is negative one divided by sixteen let's try another problem let's look for the limit as x approaches six of one divided by the square root of x plus three minus one over three divided by x minus six so let's try that go ahead and take a minute and work on this example so just like before we have a fraction with a square root so i'm going to begin by multiplying the top and the bottom by the common denominator of these two fractions so that's going to be 3 and the square root of x plus 3. so initially these two will cancel and that's going to leave behind the limit as x approaches six we're going to have a three on top and then these will cancel leaving behind the square root of x plus three and on the bottom it's just going to be x minus 6 times 3 root x plus 3. next let's multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate which is three plus the square root of x plus three so on the top we need to foil three times three that's going to be nine and then if we multiply those two it's going to be positive three square root x plus three now let's multiply these two terms that's going to be negative three square root x plus three and then the square root of x plus three times itself it's simply x plus three with a negative sign in front on the bottom we have three root x plus three times x minus six times three plus the square root of x plus three now we can cancel these two those are going to add up to zero so we have the limit as x approaches six now let's distribute the negative sign to x plus three so we have nine minus x minus three divided by three root x plus three times x minus six times three plus the square root of x plus three now in the numerator let's go ahead and combine like terms nine minus three is equal to six so what we have is six minus x divided by everything else so what do you think we need to do in the next step notice that six minus x is very similar to x minus six which means you know what to do we need to take out a negative one so that negative x will become positive x and positive six will change into negative six so now at this point we can cancel x minus six x minus six divided by itself is equal to one and that one times negative one is negative one so now we're left over with the limit as x approaches six with a negative one on top divided by 3 square root x plus 3 times 3 plus the square root of x plus 3. now we can use substitution so this is equal to negative one divided by three times the square root of six plus three times three plus the square root of six plus three now six plus three is equal to nine and we know what the square root of nine is equal to that's equal to three so we got three times three and then three plus three three times three is nine three plus three is six nine times six is equal to 54. so that is our final answer negative 1 divided by 54. now let's confirm our answer of negative 1 divided by 54. let's get the decimal value of that number if you type it in your calculator it's about negative point zero one eight five and then it repeats one eight five and so forth now original problem was this the limit as x approaches six of one over the square root of x plus three minus 1 over 3 divided by x minus 6. so what we're going to do is we're going to plug in a number that's very close to 6. let's try 6.1 to begin with so go ahead and type this in your calculator you may wish to use parentheses so i got negative point zero one eight 6 so forth so you can see it's close but now let's try something closer like 6.01 let's see if it gets closer to our answer so i got negative point zero one eight five zero three as you can see this answer is very close to the actual answer which means that this is correct as x gets closer and closer to 6 it's going to approach this number so you can always use direct substitution to confirm your answer as long as you plug in a number that's very very close to this number
