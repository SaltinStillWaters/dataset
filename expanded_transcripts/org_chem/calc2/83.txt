Transcript for: Chain Rule For Finding Derivatives
let's move on to the chain rule we're going to cover a lot of examples the first Formula you need to be familiar with is the derivative of the composite function f of g ofx a composite function is one where you have one function inside of another notice that g is inside of f which makes it a composite function so the first thing you need to do is differentiate the outside portion of the function that is f and you need to keep the inside the same and then multiply it by the derivative of the inside that's the main idea behind the chain rule if you follow this process you're going to get the answer right so let's say for example if we have a function U raised to the N where U is another function in terms of X using the chain Rule and the power rule combined it's going to be n * U you have to keep that the same raised to the N minus one times the derivative of what's on the inside that's the general power rule formula with the chain rule combine so never forget to multiply by the derivative of the inside function so let's use an example let's say if we want to find the derivative of 5x + 3 raised to the 4th power so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to move the constant I mean the exponent to the front so it's going to be four and then keep the inside stuff the same * 5x + 3 subtract the exponent by 1 4 - 1 is 3 and then multiply by the derivative of the inside the inside function is four it's 5x + 3 the derivative of 5x + 3 is just 5 and so that's the answer we can multiply four and 5 that's going to give us 20 so it's 20 * 5x + 3 ra the thir power so that's the final answer fully simplified now let's work on some more examples find the derivative of x^2 - 3x raised to the 5th power so first let's bring down to five so it's going to be five and then keep the inside function the same and then subtract the exponent by 1 so this is four and then multiply by the derivative of the inside the derivative of x^2 - 3x is 2x - 3 and so that's the answer once you get used to the process it's not that bad here's another example that you can try find the derivative of s of 6X the derivative of the outside part of the function s is cosine and you got to keep the inside function the same then you multiply by the derivative of the inside function the derivative of 6X is 6 so the answer is simply 6 cosine 6X now what is the derivative of cosine x^2 so first differentiate the outside part of the function cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sign now the inside part of the function has to remain the same that is the angle of cosine so it's going to be x^2 and then differentiate the inside function x^2 which is 2x so basically you're working away from the outside towards the inside the final answer is -2X sin X2 find the derivative of tangent X CU so first let's differentiate tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squ and the inside function has to remain the same next differentiate the inside function X Cub so that's 3x^2 and it's always multiplication so it's going to be 3x^2 secant 2 x Cub as you can see it's not that bad here's another problem what is the derivative of secant 4X the derivative of secant 4X is going to be secant tangent that's the derivative of secant now the inside function has to remain the same for secant and tangent next we need to differentiate 4X so it's just going to be time4 and so that's the solution what is the derivative of Ln X raised to the 7th power try that problem so this is going to be S keep the inside part the same and then subtract the exponent by one so 7 - 1 is 6 now we got to multiply by the derivative of the inside function the derivative of Ln X is simply 1 /x so the final answer is 7 Ln X raised to 6 power / X What is the dtive of theun of XB - 7 take a minute and work on that example the first thing I would do is rewrite it so this is the same as X Cub - 7 raised to the 12 and so that's going to be equal to2 we got to bring the exponent to the front keep the inside function the same and then subtract the exponent by one 1 12 - 1 which is 12 - 2 2 that's a half and then we got to multiply by the derivative of the inside the derivative of x Cub - 7 is simply 3x^2 so we could bring this back to the bottom since it has a negative exponent so it's 3x^2 / we have a two on the bottom 2 XB - 7 and now the exponent is going to change from negative half to positive half and now we could put it back in its radical form so it's 3x^2 / 2 < TK XB - 7 and so that's the final answer for this problem find the derivative of 1 / x^2 + 8 raised to the 3 power so first let's rewrite the expression let's bring the variables to the top so this is is x^2 + 8 raed Theus 3 and now we can use the chain rule combined with the power rule let's move the3 to the front and let's keep the inside function let's rewrite it exactly the way we see it and then let's subtract this by 1 -3 - 1 is4 and now let's multiply by the derivative of the inside function which is 2x so now let's take this term move it back to the bottom so we have -3 * 2x which is -6x on top and on the bottom it's x^2 + 8 raised to the 4th power and so that's all we need to do for this problem so for some examples you need to rewrite it before you find the derivative now what if we have a trig function inside another trig function find the Der of this uh function so first we need to differentiate the outside function s the derivative of s is cosine now what's inside of cosine since cosine came from s everything inside of s is going to be the stuff inside of cosine so that's tangent X 4th now let's move on to tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squ and the stuff that's inside of tangent is going to be the stuff that's inside of secant squ so that's x 4 and then we got to move on further towards the inside the derivative of x 4th is 4X cub and so that's the answer how about this example find the derivative of s raised to the 5th power tangent cosine X cub the first thing I would do is rewrite the expression so this is s tangent cosine XB all rais the 5th power so first let's deal with the exponents let's use the power rule so we got to bring the five to the front and keep everything inside the same so always start with the outside portion of the function which is going to be the exponents in this case and then subtract the exponent by one so it's going to be four now let's work our way towards the inside so we got a differentiate sign the derivative of s is cosine and the stuff inside of s is tan cosine X Cub so we got to put that here now let's move on to tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squ and the stuff inside of tan is cosine X cub so hopefully you're seeing a pattern with the way we're finding the derivative of everything so now that we're done with Tangent let's move on to cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sign and the angle of cosine is X Cub so that's going to be the same here and then let's move on to X Cub the derivative of x Cub is 3x2 so that's the answer and then you can combine terms you can multiply five and three to get 15 what is the derivative of cosine raised to the 7th power of s of secant x^2 so try that problem so first let's rewrite it as cosine of s of secant x^2 and let's put the seven and it's exponent position so let's use the power rule let's bring the seven to the front and let's keep everything on the inside the same and then subtract the exponent by one so this is going to be six now let's find the derivative of cosine let's work our way towards the inside the derivative of cosine is negative sign and the stuff inside of that is s secant X2 so now we got to find the Der ative of s the derivative of s is cosine and the stuff inside of s is secant x^2 so now we got to find the derivative of secant so that's secant tangent so it's going to be secant x^2 tangent x^2 and the derivative of x^2 is 2x so whenever you have multiple composite functions just work your way from the outside towards the inside and everything is multiplied by each other and then when you're done simply collect terms so we have a seven a 2X and a negative so you can move that to the front and write it as -4x if you want to here's the next problem find the derivative of x Cub * 4x + 5 raised to the 4th power so what we have here is a product rule we could say that this is f and this is G and for G we have to use the quotient rule I mean not the quotient rule but the chain rule so using the product rule we need to differentiate the first part F the derivative of the first part is 3x^2 and we need to keep the second part the same so we just have to rewrite G plus now we need to keep the first part the same now for the second part we need to use the chain room so let's bring the four to the front let's keep the inside stuff the same and subtract the four by one then multiply by the derivative of the inside function which is 4x + 5 the derivative of that is four so now let's simplify so the first part we don't really need to change anything we can just leave it like this now for the second part we can multiply four and four that's 16 so this is 16 x Cub * 4x + 5 raised to the thir power you can leave your answer like this or if you want to you can take out the GCF we can take out an x s and we could take out three 4x+ 5S or basically 4x + 5 to the third power so this is gone we took three of these one is left over and we have a a three left so this is going to be a 3 * 4x + 5 and this is gone we took out all three of these well there's an X left over and it's 16 so plus 16 x because we took out an X squ now what we can do is basically simplify what we have here so this is x^2 4x + 5 to the 3 power and let's distribute the three so 3 * 4X is 12x 3 * 5 is 15 + 16x now let's add 12x and 16x so the final answer is x^2 * 4x + 5 to the 3 power and then 28x + 15 so that's the solution let's try one more example let's find the derivative of 2x - 3 / 4 + 5x X raised to the 4th power so this is a chain Rule and quotient rule problem so first we need to bring the exponent down and keep the stuff on the inside the same and then subtract the exponent by one next we need to multiply by derivative of the inside so that's when we have to use a quotient rule so f is 2x - 3 and G is 4 + 5x frime is 2 G Prime is 4 and the formula for the quotient rule is it's g f Prime minus FG Prime over G ^2 so G is 4 + 5x F Prime is 2 and F is 2x - 3 G Prime is 4 / g^ 2 which is 4 + 5x^2 so as you can see this is a long problem so let's simplify what we have on the right side if we distribute the two it's going to be 8 + 10 x and if we distribute the four it's going to be 8X and then * -3 * 4 that's pos2 / 4 + 5x^2 and then this part is going to be the same so let's simplify the numerator so first we can add 8 and 12 so that's going to be 20 and then 10 x - 8X that's positive 2x / 4 + 5x^2 now this thing we could distribute the three to the numerator and the denominator so we can write it like this if you want 2x - 3 Cub / 4 + 5x^2 the reason why I did that is because I can now combine these two terms this supposed to be Cube not squared so now what we have is 4 * 2x - 3 the 3 power and I'm going to take out a two here so if I take out a two it's going to be a x + 10 over 4 + 5x raised to the fifth power 3 + 2 is 5 so the final answer is eight 4 * 2 is 8 * x + 10 * 2x - 3 to the 3 power / 4 + 5x to the 5th power and so this is the final answer
