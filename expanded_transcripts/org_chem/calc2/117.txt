Transcript for: Evaluating Inverse Hyperbolic Functions
how would you evaluate this expression the inverse of the hyperbolic cosine of one what is that equal to now when dealing with inverse functions X and Y are switched so what we have is the Y value and what we're looking for is the x value in other words hyperbolic cosine of what number is one that's what we're looking for so how do we figure this out well there are different ways in which we can do this recall the hyperbolic cosine function is e to the X Plus e to the negative X over 2. so we could replace this with one that's equal to y and we could solve for x now looking at this equation you could find the answer intuitively you know that anything to the zero power is one and one plus one over two will give you one therefore this must be e to the zero because that will give us one which means X is zero so the answer for this problem is going to be zero thinking about it in an intuitive way but fortunately there are formulas that we could use to evaluate the inverse hyperbolic functions so here's the formula for the inverse hyperbolic cosine function it's equal to the natural log of x plus the square root of x squared minus one and you need to be familiar with the domain the domain is from 1 to Infinity so you want to make sure that this is in the domain which is this before using that function so now let's use it let's evaluate the hyperbolic the inverse hyperbolic cosine function of zero so all we got to do is replace X actually this should be a one not a zero all we have to do is replace x with one one squared minus 1 is 0. the square root of zero is zero plus one we get one the natural log of one is zero so that's how we can confirm our answer simply using that formula now let's look at another example go ahead and evaluate the inverse hyperbolic sine of one now there's a formula that we want to use and here it is the inverse hyperbolic sine of x is equal to the natural log of X plus the square root of x squared plus one so it's very similar to the inverse hyperbolic cosine function the only difference is instead of a minus sign we have a plus sign so now let's substitute x with one so this is going to be Ln one plus the square root of one squared plus one so this simplifies to the natural log of one plus the square root of 2. so that is the exact answer but if we want to get the decimal equivalent of that we can plug it in to a calculator and that's going to be about point eight eight one three seven and we could confirm this using the exponential function of hyperbolic sine so we know hyperbolic sinus e to the x minus e to the negative X over 2. this is the Y value this is the x value so if we were to take this value plug it into X for this equation we should get y and that's how we can confirm if we have the right answer so let's go ahead and do that let's evaluate this at this point so this is going to be e raised to the point eight eight one three seven minus E to the negative point a eight one three seven all divided by 2. go ahead and plug that in you may want to put this in parentheses and don't forget this negative sign right here I got .999995 which is approximately one so that's how you know that you have the right answer you can check it with this formula now here's some other formulas that you want to add to your list so you have the first two but you want to add these four other equations to your list of formulas if you have this on a test by the way uh going back to the inverse hyperbolic function hyperbolic sine function the domain is all numbers X can be anything now for the inverse of the hyperbolic tangent function the formula is one half natural log 1 plus X over 1 minus X and the domain is restricted on the open interval from negative one to one so it doesn't include negative one and one but it could be anywhere between those two values now for the inverse hyperbolic cotangent function it's very similar to the previous one it's one half natural log now it's going to be X Plus 1 which is the same as 1 plus X on the bottom it's x minus one instead of one minus X now the domain for this is going to be negative Infinity to negative 1 Union 1 to Infinity next up we have the inverse hyperbolic secant function and that's going to be the natural log of 1. plus the square root of 1 minus x squared divided by X the domain for that is going to be 0 to 1. so we have a bracket at one one is included but not zero if we put a zero it's going to be undefined in that fraction next we have the inverse hyperbolic cosecant function it's going to be Ln is actually very similar to this but instead of one fraction it's broken down into two fractions according to my textbook it's 1 over X Plus the square root of one plus x squared over the absolute value of x and the domain is negative Infinity to zero Union zero to Infinity so the domain is all real numbers except zero so those are the inverse hyperbolic functions that you want to be familiar with and their corresponding formulas
