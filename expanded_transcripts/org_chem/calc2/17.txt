let's say that f of x is equal to two x plus five and g of x let's say g of x is x squared minus four perform the indicated operations so what is f plus g what's the sum of the two functions all you gotta do is add them 2x plus five plus x squared minus four and combine like terms so all we can combine is five and negative four which adds up to one so it's x squared plus two x plus one and so that's the sum of f and g now what about f minus g f is two x plus five and then it's gonna be minus x squared minus four so this is going to be negative x squared plus two x and then we have five minus negative four five minus negative four is like five plus four which is nine so that's equal to f minus g now what about f times g this is just going to be two x plus 5 times x squared minus 4. and we can go ahead and foil it 2x times x squared that's 2x cubed and then 2x times negative 4 that's negative 8x and then we have 5 times x squared that's 5x squared and then 5 times negative 4 it's negative 20. so in standard form it's 2x cubed plus 5x squared minus 8x minus 20. now what is the domain of the three functions that we found let's start with f plus g what is the domain for that whenever you have a polynomial be it a binomial trinomial or many terms where you don't have any fractions no radicals or logarithmic functions the domain will be all real numbers there's no restrictions on the value of x in this expression x can be anything so for these three functions f plus g f minus g and f times g we don't have any fractions or radicals so the domain is all real numbers it's negative infinity to infinity now what about f divided by g what's the domain for this f divided by g is simply two x plus five divided by x squared minus 4. now that we have a fraction the domain is restricted is not all real numbers to find the domain you want to find the x values that do not exist the values that x cannot be to do that set the denominator equal to zero x squared minus four cannot be zero if it is we're going to get a vertical asymptote which means it's undefined at that point now we can factor x squared minus four it's x plus two times x minus two so therefore x cannot equal negative two and it can't equal two these are the vertical asymptotes but they're also infinite discontinuities there's no we can't plug in negative two for x the function will be undefined anytime you have a zero on the bottom it's undefined so how can we write the domain using interval notation if x cannot equal negative two or two it's going to be from negative infinity to negative two union negative two to two union two to infinity so here's another example let's say if we have the function one over x minus three x minus three the denominator cannot be zero so x cannot be three therefore the domain is everything except three that's how you write it let's say if we have this x cannot equal 4 and it can't equal negative 3. just change the sign if you set x minus four to zero x you'll get four facts now to write the domain it's gonna be negative infinity to negative three negative three comes before four union negative three is a four union 4 to infinity so that's the domain for this function so let's say that f of x is equal to 4x plus 5. and g of x let's say it's equal to 8 minus x squared what is f of 2 plus g of three to find f of two we need to replace x with two in the equation four x plus five so that's four times two plus five and that is a terrible looking two to find g of 3 we need to plug it into that equation so it's plus 8 minus 3 squared and then let's add 4 times 2 is 8 and 3 squared is nine eight plus five is thirteen eight minus nine is negative one thirteen minus one is twelve so that's the value of f of two plus g of three you just find the two values and you add them let's try another example so what is f of negative 2 multiplied by g of two so let's do it separately let's find f of negative two first using this formula so it's gonna be four times negative two plus five which is negative eight plus five and so that's negative three now let's calculate g of two using this equation so that's eight minus two squared two squared is four eight minus four is four so now that we have these two values let's replace f of negative two which is negative three and let's replace g of two with four so negative three times four is negative twelve so that's the value of f of negative two times g of negative two i mean times g of positive two so all you gotta do is simply find the values and then multiply them
