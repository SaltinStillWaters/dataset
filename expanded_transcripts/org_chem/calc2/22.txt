Transcript for: Natural Logarithms
in this lesson we're going to focus on simplifying natural logs with e so let's start with the basics what is the natural log of one log of one is always zero a log can have any base it could be base 4 it can be base 10 it could be anything however when it has the base e a log becomes a natural log so natural logs only have base e and e is a number it's like 2.718 something but that's e so now what is the natural log of e because the base is the same as e ln base e of e is one so the natural log of e is always equal to one make sure you know that by the way now what is the natural log of e raised to the seventh we could take the seven and move it to the front so this is seven lne and we know that lne is one so this is equal to seven now what about e raised to the ln 8 what is that equal to do you recall what 5 log base 5 of 9 is equal to since these are the same the answer is simply not the natural log has the base e and so these are the same and the answer is simply 8. now what about e raised to the natural log of x cubed so once again the base is e and so these will cancel and this is simply equal to x cubed let's try one more example e raised to the seven l and y what is that equal to we can't just say it's y because of the seven however what we can do is take the seven and move it here so this is equivalent to e ln y to the seventh and the base is e so we can get rid of these two and the final answer is simply y to the seventh you
