Transcript for: Rolle's Theorem
in this video we're gonna focus on a roll stir and we're gonna go over some example problems associated with it so what is rolle's theorem what's the main idea behind it there are three conditions that must be met so let's say if we have a function f of X this function has to be continuous on the closed interval a B and it has to be differentiable on the open interval a B and also f of a must equal F of B if these three conditions are met then we have this particular conclusion there's gonna be some number C such that F prime of C is zero so basically there's gonna be a horizontal tangent at some point C between a and B so let's draw a picture that illustrates this so let's say if we have a graph that looks like this so is the function continuous on the closed interval what would you say yes it is there's no holes no vertical asymptotes no jumps in that curve now is the function differentiable on the open interval a B yes it is notice that we have a nice smooth curve there's no sharp terms no jumps nothing like that now there's F of a equal F of B what would you say it's the third condition met now notice that F of a and F of B they have the same Y value so therefore they're equal to each other if these three conditions are met then there's gonna be a horizontal tangent somewhere between a and B and we can see where it is it's at at this point so that's Point C and that Point C we can see that the slope of the horizontal tangent is zero so thus f prime of C is equal to zero and that's the main idea behind Rolle's Theorem so let me give you another example another graphical example so the question is can roll steering be applied for this particular function let's say this is a and this is B so is it continuous on the closed interval a B yes it is is it the French herbal on the open interval a B no it's not notice that let's assume that this is Point C here from A to C notice that the curve is going up so the slope is positive and then instantly it's going down the slope is negative so anytime you have a sharp curve where the slope changes instantaneously at this point that means that it's not differentiable at that point you cannot evaluate the first derivative at that point so therefore it's not the French pole on the open interval so Rolle's Theorem will not apply as you can see between a and B there's no point C where we have a horizontal tangent it appears as if we have a vertical tangent at the cusp but no horizontal tangent even though f of a is equal to f of B in this example because the second condition is not met rolster cannot be applied in that example now let's say that f of X is equal to x squared minus 5x plus 3 go ahead and determine if Rolle's Theorem can be applied on the interval 0 to 5 so we have this basically polynomial function it's specifically a quadratic function and all types of polynomial functions are continuous everywhere so we know that it's going to be continuous on the closed interval a B and polynomial functions are differentiable there's no vertical asymptotes or cusps or anything like that now the only thing we need to determine is f of ayyyy equal to f of B so a is 0 and B is 5 so let's calculate F of 0 so it's gonna be 0 squared minus 5 times 0 plus 3 and so this is gonna give you 3 and then F of 5 is gonna be 5 squared minus 5 times 5 plus 3 5 squared is 25 5 times 5 is 25 25 minus 25 is 0 plus 3 that will give us 3 again so notice that F of a equals F of B and we have a continuous function on a closed interval a B and it's differentiable everywhere so Rolle's Theorem can be applied now to find C we need to find the first derivative set it equal to zero so basically we're finding the critical numbers of the function so let's determine the first derivative F prime the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of negative 5 X is negative 5 so let's set it equal to zero if we add 5 to both sides we can see that 2x is equal to 5 divided both sides by 2 we get X is 5 over 2 so C is 5 over 2 and 5 divided by 2 is 2.5 and that's within the interval 0 to 5 so this is the value of C that satisfies the rows theorem now let's consider another example so let's say that f of X is equal to sine X on the interval 0 to 2pi so go ahead and find all number C in this interval that satisfies rolster so let's draw our graph sine varies between 1 and negative 1 it's a sinusoidal function it's periodic and so it repeats itself so that's from 0 to 2pi and another cycle will take us to 4 pi and it's just going to keep on going so therefore we have a continuous function there's no breaks in the graph no jumps it's differentiable everywhere there's only smooth curves there's no sharp turns and so all we need to determine is f of a equal to f of b let's see if that's true so a is 0 B is 2pi so f of 0 that's going to be sine of 0 and sine of 0 is 0 f of 2 pi that's sine of 2pi which is also equal to 0 so therefore F of a equals F of B so Rose theorem can be applied and we could see it's gonna be applied here and here keep in mind this point is 2pi so there's two answers between 0 and 2pi if you can guess what they are what will you say well notice that this point is PI so here this has to be 1/2 of pi and this is going to be 3 times 1/2 of Pi or 3 PI over 2 now let's confirm to see if those answers are correct PI over 2 and 3 PI over 2 so let's find the first derivative the first derivative of sine X is cosine X and we need to set it equal to 0 now cosine PI over 2 is equal to 0 and cosine 3 PI over 2 is equal to 0 and PI over 2 and 3 privates you are in Davone and so we can see that scene can be PI over 2 or 3 PI over 2 so you can look at the graph and determine the answers visually or you can find it from the first derivative so Rolle's Theorem can be applied for sine X now what about this example let's say if f of X is equal to X raised to the 2/3 + 1 on the interval negative 4 - 4 can we apply Rolle's Theorem so this particular function on that interval well let's find out X to the 2/3 is a graph that looks like this now I spend shifted up one unit so it's not gonna start at the origin but it's gonna start at one so this is just a generic shape of the graph just by looking at it we know that roll stem will not be applied to it because we have a cusp notice that we have a sharp turn at x equals zero which is in this interval so therefore we can say that it's not differentiable on the open interval a B so therefore we cannot apply rolls Dern and based on a shape of the graph you could see that we really don't have a horizontal tangent between negative 4 to 4 it looks like this part is horizontal but it's not it's always increasing towards the right and towards the left as you go from left to right on the left side is really decreasing so there's really no horizontal asymptote for that particular graph let's work on this example let's say that f of X is equal to x times the square root of 4 minus x over the interval 0 to 4 so can we apply rolster so is the function continuous and is it differentiable if we were to graph it this function would look something like this and this is just a rough sketch so this function is continuous between 0 & 4 and it's differentiable there's no sharp turns this is really a smooth curve so it satisfies the first two conditions of rolster and let's see if f of a is equal to f of B so f of 0 is going to be 0 times the square root of 4 minus 0 0 times anything is 0 and f of 4 it's gonna be 4 times square root of 4 minus 4 which is 0 and so this whole thing is 0 therefore we can see that F of a and F of B they are both equal to each other there are the x-intercepts of the function so Rolle's Theorem can be applied and if we go back to the graph that I drew earlier you can see that there's gonna be a horizontal tangent between 0 & 4 and so Rolle's Theorem definitely can be applied for this particular example so let's find the first derivative so we need to use the product rule and just to review let's say if we have F times G and we wish to differentiate it it's the derivative of the first part times a second plus the first part times the derivative of the second now it's wise to rewrite f as x times four minus X to the one-half so the derivative of the first part which is X that's going to be 1 times the second so we're not going to change that plus the first times the derivative of the second so we need to use the chain rule for this expression so move the exponent to the front keep the inside function the same subtract the exponent by one 1/2 minus one is negative 1/2 and then differentiate the inside function the derivative of 4 minus X is negative 1 now we need to factor out the greatest common factor which is 4 minus X to the negative 1/2 so let's go ahead and take that out when you factor the GCF you need to divide it if you want to find out what comes on the inside so if we take this term divided by this we need to subtract the exponents so it's going to be 1/2 the top 1 minus the bottom one which is negative 1/2 so the two negative signs become positive 1/2 plus 1/2 as a whole so this becomes 4 minus X raised to the first power and then we take this out so if you divide this expression by this one the 4 minus X to the negative 1/2 will cancel so we're left with negative 1/2 X to get rid of the negative exponent I'm gonna take this whole turn and move it to the denominator of the fraction so the bottom is gonna be 4 minus X to the 1/2 and in the numerator it's 4 and then we have minus X minus 1/2 X so negative 1 minus 1/2 that's negative 1 point 5 which is the same as a negative 3 over 2 negative 1 you can write that as negative 2 over 2 and so negative 2 minus 1 is negative 3 so this is going to be negative 3 over 2 X now to get rid of the fraction I'm gonna multiply the top and the bottom by 2 so I'm gonna have 8 minus 3 X divided by 2 and then I'm gonna convert this back into a square root so the square root of 4 minus X so that's the first derivative of this function now let's set the first derivative equal to zero and let's calculate the value of X so what I'm going to do is multiply both sides by two times the square root of 4 minus X so this times 0 that's going to remain 0 and then if I take this fraction multiply it by this the denominator will cancel so on the left side I'm just gonna have 8 minus 3x and so let's add 3x to both sides so if we move this to the other side it's gonna become positive and then divide by 3 so X is 8 divided by 3 now what is 8 over 3 as a decimal this is the same as 6 over 3 plus 2 over 3 6 divided by 3 is to 1 over 3 is 0.33 3 3 so 2/3 is like point 6 repeating so we can run that same coin 67 so X is approximately two point 67 and that's well within this interval between 0 & 4 so this is the exact answer for C and this is just an approximation so we can see that Rolle's Theorem indeed apply to this particular function now let's move on to our next example so what about if we have an absolute value function let's say the absolute value of X minus 1 on the interval negative 1 2 3 can we apply rolle's theorem to this particular function well let's draw a graph the absolute value of x the parent function looks like this so this graph is shifted one unit to right so at x equal 1 is gonna have this shape so notice that it's not differentiable at x equals 1 because there's a sharp turn so and 1 is between a and B a is negative 1 be a stream so because 1 is within this interval and it's not differentiable on the open interval a and B we cannot apply rolster them to this particular absolute value function and even if we could there is no horizontal tangent so F prime of C will not equal zero because there's no horizontal section in this particular graph
