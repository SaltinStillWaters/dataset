Transcript for: How To Find The Equation of a Tangent Line Using Derivatives - Calculus 1
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the equation of a tangent line like this problem that you see on a board but let's go over some basic information so what is a tangent line let's say if we have a curve the tangent line is a line that touches the curve at exactly one point so that will be the tangent line in order to find the equation of the tangent line there's two things that we need we need the point at which the tangent line touches the curve and so we need the x and the y coordinate of that point which we have that in this problem and the second thing that we need is the slope of the tangent line so how can we find the slope of the tangent line we could find it by taking the first derivative of the function and evaluating it at the x coordinate of the point that touches the curve and the tangent line so those are the two things that we need we need the slope and we need the x y coordinate of the point where the tangent line touches the curve now once we have those two things we can now use this formula that is the point-slope formula in order to write the equation of the tangent line so let's go ahead and begin so we already have our point and so we can see that x1 is 1 y1 is 12. all we need to do is calculate the slope of the tangent line so we're going to do that by finding the first derivative f prime of x and just to review the derivative of x to the n let's say if you have a variable raised to a constant basically the power rule it's n x to the n minus one so the derivative of x raised to the fourth power is going to be we can see that n is four so it's four x to the 4 minus 1 or 4 x cubed and so that's the derivative of the first term x to the fourth power now let's use that same process for everything else so what is the derivative of x cubed don't worry about the five but what's the derivative of x cubed using this process the derivative of x cubed is going to be three x to the three minus one which is three x squared now we need to multiply by five according to the constant multiple rule so this is what we now have now the derivative of x squared is 2x to the first power and the derivative of a constant is always zero so we'll have to worry about that now five times three is fifteen and nine times two is eighteen so this is the first derivative of the function now we can calculate the slope of the tangent line and the way we're going to do it is we're going to take our x value which is one and plug it into this expression so the slope of the tangent line will be f prime of one and so that's going to be four times one raised to the third power plus fifteen times one squared plus eighteen times one so that turns out to be four plus fifteen plus eighteen fifteen plus eighteen that's thirty three plus four that's thirty seven so the slope of the tangent line is 37 so now that we have the slope and we have the x and the y coordinates of the point where the tangent line touches the curve we can now use this formula so y1 is 12 m is 37 and x1 is one so this is the answer but in something known as point slope form now some teachers they might be okay with you writing your answer like this others they may want you to write it in slope intercept form so that is in y equals mx plus b form and so to get it in slope intercept form what you need to do is isolate the y variable in the equation so we're going to do is distribute the 37 first so this is going to be 37x minus 37 and then in the next step we're going to add 12 to both sides and so this is going to be y is equal to 37 x and then negative 37 plus 12 that's negative 25 and so this right here is the equation of the tangent line in slope intercept form so now you know how to find it now let's work on number two write the equation of the tangent line to the graph of f of x which equals x cubed times ln x at x equals one so feel free to pause the video if you want to try this problem so remember in order to write the equation of the tangent line we need the slope of the tangent line and we need the x and the y coordinates of the point where the tangent line touches the curve right now we only have the x coordinate but we do not have the y coordinate so let's write down what we know we know that x1 is one we need to find y1 and the slope of the tangent line this should not be a one here that should be a question mark so how can we calculate y1 what do we need to do we need to use the original function f x y is basically equal to the function evaluated at x1 so what we need to do is we need to plug in x equals 1 into that function so y1 is going to be f of one which is one to the third times the natural log of one now the the natural log of one is always zero so in this case y one is zero so that's the first thing we need to do the second thing is that we need to find the derivative so we need to determine f prime of x so what is the derivative of x cubed times the natural log of x what would you say we need to use the product rule the derivative of f times g is going to be the derivative of the first part f or f prime times the second part where it's unchanged so that's g plus the first part times the derivative of the second part so we can say that f is the first part of that function so f is x cubed which means that f prime is going to be the derivative of that which is 3x squared the second part g that's going to be the natural log of x and so g prime the derivative of ln x is one over x now for those of you who may need to review some derivative techniques such as differentiating natural log functions or things like the product rule quotient rule chain rule and other stuff like that check out the links in the description section below and i'm going to post some other videos that might be useful to you so let's get back to this one so using this formula we have f prime which is 3x squared times g so g is just ln x and then plus f which is x cubed and then times g prime which is 1 over x and so that's how you could use the product rule to find the derivative of a function now we need to calculate the slope of the tangent line and we're going to evaluate f prime of x at our x coordinate which our x coordinate is one so this is going to be three times one squared times the natural log of one plus now x cubed divided by x that's x squared so we're gonna have one squared now as we said before the natural log of one is zero so this completely disappears and then plus one squared which is one thus the slope of the tangent line is equal to one now once we have the x and y coordinate of the point and the slope we can now use the point slope formula to write the equation of the tangent line so y one is zero the slope m is one and x one is also one so we could basically ignore this zero and thus our equation simplifies to y is equal to x minus one and this is it so now you know how to find the equation of a tangent line so that's basically it for this video if you
