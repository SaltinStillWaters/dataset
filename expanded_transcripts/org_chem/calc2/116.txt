Transcript for: Verifying Hyperbolic Trig Identities
in this lesson we're going to focus on verifying hyperbolic identities so here we have hyperbolic cosine plus hyperbolic sine equal to e to the x how can we prove that by the way before working on these problems I recommend watching a video entitled hyperbolic trig identities where I give you a list of formulas that you want to be familiar with using those formulas you can solve problems like this one so if you haven't seen that video and if you don't have a list of hyperbolic identities in front of you you may want to watch that video and write down those formulas so let's go ahead and begin in order to verify this identity we need to convert cosine and sine into their exponential form so hyperbolic cosine is equal to e to the X Plus e to the negative x divided by 2. hyperbolic sine is equal to e to the negative x minus e to the negative X over 2. now because we have common denominators we can combine it into a single fraction so e to the X Plus e to the negative X plus e to the x minus E to the negative X over 2. e to the negative X and negative e to the negative X we could cancel them one e to the X plus one e to the x that's going to be 2 e to the x 2 divided by 2 is 1 so we get e to the x is equal to e to the x so that's how we can verify in this particular hyperbolic identity now let's try another one that's very similar to that one hyperbolic cosine of x minus hyperbolic sine of x let's prove that this is equal to e to the negative X so we could use the same formulas like we did before cosine hyperbolic cosine is going to be e to the X Plus e to the negative X over 2. hyperbolic sine is going to be e to the x minus E to the negative X over 2. but this negative sign will have to be distributed so let's combine it into a single fraction since we have common denominators this is going to be ECX Plus e to the negative X and then negative e to the x and then these two negatives will cancel giving us positive e to the negative X e to the X and negative e to the X will cancel these two we can add them together and we're going to get 2 e to the negative X over 2. and then we could cancel the twos giving us e to the negative X so that's how we can verify that particular identity now let's try this one let's verify the double angle formula of hyperbolic sine so we know hyperbolic sine of 2x is 2 times hyperbolic sine of x times hyperbolic cosine of x how can we verify this particular identity we need to use the sum and difference formulas hyperbolic sine of X Plus y is equal to 2 sine actually not a 2. it's hyperbolic sine of x times hyperbolic cosine of x plus if we see a plus here this is going to be a plus and then it's this should be a y not an X and then Plus hyperbolic cosine of x times hyperbolic sine of Y using this formula we can prove it what we need to do in order to get 2x is we need to replace y with x plus X is 2X so this is going to be X Plus X so in this formula everywhere we see a y we're going to replace it with an X so we don't need to change sine of x cosine y that's going to become cosine X and hyperbolic sine of Y is going to be hyperbolic sine of x now notice that these two are the same sine times cosine is the same as cosine times sine so we could simply add the coefficients this has a 1 this has a one one plus one is two so we got 2 sine times cosine and on this side X Plus X is 2X so that's how we can prove the double angle formula it's by using the sum in difference formulas for the hyperbolic function identities let's try another similar one so hyperbolic cosine of 2x let's prove that it's equal to hyperbolic cosine squared plus hyperbolic sine squared so we need to know the sum and difference formula for hyperbolic cosine and here it is hyperbolic cosine of x plus y is hyperbolic cosine of x times hyperbolic cosine of Y and then Plus hyperbolic sine of x times hyperbolic sine of Y so in order to get 2x we need to replace X I mean we need to replace y with x so instead of hyperbolic cosine y we're going to write hyperbolic cosine X and instead of hyperbolic sine of Y we're going to write hyperbolic sine of x so that's what we did that's what we've done so far we've just replaced y with x now X Plus X we can make that 2X cosine times cosine is cosine squared and sine times sine is sine squared so that's how we can verify the double angle formula for hyperbolic cosine now let's try this one go ahead and verify that hyperbolic sine of negative X is equal to negative hyperbolic sine of x now we're going to use the sum and difference formulas for hyperbolic sine so I'm just going to write the formula first so hyperbolic sine of X Plus y is going to be hyperbolic sine of x times hyperbolic cosine of Y Plus hyperbolic cosine of x times hyperbolic sine of Y now in order to get Negative X what should X and Y be well we want X at the very end so we should keep X as X Y we want to make that negative 2x because x minus 2x will give us Negative X so all we're going to do is replace y with negative 2x wherever we see it so this is going to be hyperbolic sine of negative 2X so x minus 2x is negative X we're going to keep hyperbolic sine of x now what can we do with this hyperbolic cosine of negative 2X now recall the even identity of hyperbolic cosine hyperbolic cosine of negative X is the same as hyperbolic cosine of x so hyperbolic cosine of negative 2x should be the same as hyperbolic cosine of 2x hyperbolic sine of negative 2X now we know this identity to be true but we're trying to prove it but we can still apply it this is going to be negative hyperbolic sine of 2x now hyperbolic cosine of 2x we could use the double angle formula for that and that is cosine squared plus sine squared so cosine squared of x plus sine squared of x and here we have negative cosine of x and then we can use the double angle formula for sine that's going to be 2 sine cosine so now let's see what we can do here let's distribute sine so we're going to have sine of x times cosine squared and then here this is just going to be sine cubed and for this one we have negative 2 sine times cosine squared now these two expressions we can combine them so this is 1 minus 2 and it's going to become negative 1. so right now we have sine cubed and then minus sine cosine squared what I'm going to do is I'm going to factor out a sign so I'm going to be left with sine squared and then minus cosine squared now what is sine squared minus cosine squared what can we do with that if you recall for trig functions cosine squared plus sine squared is 1. for hyperbolic functions cosine squared minus sine squared is 1. so what I'm going to do first is I'm going to factor out a negative 1. negative cosine becomes positive cosine and I'm going to write that first positive sine squared will become negative sine squared and this is one of those identities that you need to be familiar with this one equals one so we have a negative 1 in front or at least I'm going to move it to the front and this part equals one so thus we have hyperbolic sine of negative X there should be an H here is equal to negative hyperbolic sine of x so at least that's one way we can prove it now let's move on to our next example problem cosine squared of x minus hyperbolic sine squared of X is equal to 1. go ahead and verify that identity now what we need to do is convert cosine and sine into their exponential form cosine is e to the X Plus e to the negative X divided by 2. but it's squared sine is e to the x minus E to the negative X divided by 2. so what we need to do is we need to foil so I'm going to rewrite it first we have e to the X Plus e to the negative X it's squared so we're going to multiply by itself and then 2 squared that's 2 times 2 that's simply 4. here we'll have something similar over 2 squared which is 4. e to the x times e to the X that's going to be e to the 2X and then multiplying those two together e to the x times e to the negative X X plus negative X is is zero so we got e to the zero now these two will also give us e to the zero and negative X plus negative X that's negative two x now because we have the same denominator we can combine it into a single fraction now here we have e to the x times e to the X that's e to the two x but we have a negative in front so I'm going to distribute that negative sign these two ECX and e to the negative X the exponents X plus negative X adds up to zero so we get e to the negative X we have a negative sign here plus the negative sign in front so it's going to be positive e to the zero as for these two the exponent will be zero so that's another e to the zero this is negative that's negative so it's going to be positive e to the zero and then these two here Negative X plus negative X that's going to give us an exponent of e negative 2X these two negative signs make it positive plus the third negative sign makes it negative overall so now e to the 2X will cancel with negative e to the 2X positive e to the negative 2x will cancel with negative e to the negative 2X and we have four e to the zeros anything raised to zero power is one and four divided by four is one so that's how we can verify this particular hyperbolic trig identity now let's try another one 1 minus hyperbolic tan squared is equal to hyperbolic secant squared let's verify that now hyperbolic tangent is hyperbolic sine over hyperbolic cosine but in this case it's going to be squared secant is the reciprocal of cosine so secant squared is one over cosine squared actually let's keep this as secant now I want cosine squared on the bottom and we have two terms we need to make it a single term so let's multiply one by cosine squared over cosine squared this will give us common denominators so now that we have common denominators we can combine the two fractions into a single fraction so we're going to have cosine squared minus sine squared all over cosine squared now from the last example we saw that cosine squared minus sine squared that is equal to 1. so now we have one over cosine squared is equal to secant squared and one over cosine is secant so we have secant squared is equal to secant squared so that's it for this verification now let's try another problem go ahead and verify this identity one plus hyperbolic tangent divided by 1 minus hyperbolic tangent is equal to e to the 2X now one I'm going to multiply by cosine over cosine but particularly hyperbolic cosine so one can be replaced with hyperbolic cosine over hyperbolic cosine tangent is sine over cosine so we're going to have hyperbolic sine over hyperbolic cosine now what do you think we need to do next after this notice that each of these four fractions have the same denominator so we're going to multiply every term by cosine so each denominator will be canceled actually let's keep that so we're going to have hyperbolic cosine plus hyperbolic sine divided by hyperbolic cosine minus hyperbolic sine now if you've seen my video on hyperbolic trig identities it's important to know that e to the x is cosine plus sine so we can replace this with e to the x you can also replace cosine with e to the X Plus e to the negative X over 2. you could do it that way as well just in case you didn't know that this was equal to e to the x we'll do it using the more commonly used functions so I'm going to replace cosine with e to the X Plus e to the negative X over 2. and then sine with e to the x minus E to the negative X over 2. so multiplying the top and bottom by 2 the twos all the twos will be canceled so that's what we have in the numerator and in the denominator we have e to the X Plus e to the negative X here we need to distribute the negative so it's negative e to the x these two negatives will cancel giving us positive e to the negative X e to the negative X will cancel here and e to the X will cancel so e to the X Plus e to the X that's going to be 2 e to the x and then e to the negative X Plus e to the negative X that's 2 2 e to the negative X 2 divided by 2 can be canceled to one so we're left with e to the X over e to the negative X and when you divide by a common base you need to subtract the exponents so we'll subtracting positive X by negative X which becomes the two negative signs will make it positive so X Plus X we get e to the 2X
