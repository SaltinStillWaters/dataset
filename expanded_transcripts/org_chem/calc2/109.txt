Transcript for: Related Rates - The Shadow Problem
in this lesson we're going to focus on the shadow problem in related rates so we have a six foot man and he walks at a rate of three feet per second away from a street light and his street light is 21 feet tall now let's draw a picture so let's say that's the ground and here is the street light now let's say this is the person now let's draw a line from the street light to the person and so this is going to be the shadow that's formed behind the person from the light now we said the street light is 21 feet tall and the man he's six feet tall and let's say the distance between the man and the light is x and s will represent the length of the shadow and l will be the sum of x and s at what rate is the length of his shadow changing when he is eight feet from the light and then part b at what rate is the tip of the shadow moving when he is ten feet from the light so part a is asking for ds dt that's the rate at which the length of the shadow is changing so that's how fast s is changing part b at what rate is the tip of the shadow moving when the tip of the shadow moves in this case that's going to be equal to the rate at which l is changing so part b is really looking for the ali team so make sure you understand that so the sdt tells you the rate at which the length of the shadow is changing but the ldt tells you the rate at which the tip of the shadow is moving so how can we calculate ds dt let's start with that one first what do we need to do in order to find it now for this problem you need to draw similar triangles so let's draw the first triangle that's the large one where this is 21 and this is x plus s so that's for this triangle right here now let's draw the second triangle the smaller one where this is six and this is s now we need to set up a proportion between these two triangles and if you're unsure how to do it here's something that can help you to do it correctly note that these two triangles have the same angle theta if you draw the large triangle it has the angle theta and the small triangle has the same angle theta and both triangles are right triangles now according to sokatoa hopefully you know your trick tangent theta of the first triangle that is this one it's equal to the opposite side which is 21 divided by x plus s now tangent theta of the second triangle it's also equal to opposite over adjacent so therefore we could set 21 over x plus 6 i mean x plus s and set that equal to 6 over s so we have this so far whenever you have two fractions separated by an equal sign you can cross multiply so if we cross multiply we're going to have 21s is equal to 6 times x plus s now let's distribute 6. so this is going to be 6x plus 6s next we can subtract both sides by 6s so 21 minus 6 is 15. so we have 15s is equal to 6x now once you get to this part of the equation we can perform implicit differentiation let's find the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to time so the derivative of 15s is going to be 15 times the derivative of s which is one times d c t based on the constant multiple rule and the derivative of six x is going to be six times one times dx dt so now at this point we need to plug in what we have our goal is to calculate ds dt but we need the xct so what is dxd tina's problem so notice that the man he's walking at a rate of three feet per second away from the lamp so he's going in this direction now that tells us the rate at which x is changing every second x is increasing by 3 feet so because x is increasing and not decreasing if he was walking towards the lamp x would be decreasing but in this problem he's moving away from the street light so x is going up therefore dx dt is positive three feet per second if he was moving toward the streetlight x will be decreasing and dx dt would be negative three feet per second so now that we have dxet we could plug it into this equation so we have 15 ds dt that's equal to 6 times 3. now let's divide both sides by 15. so ds dt is six times three and 15 is five time stream so we could cancel a three and now this gives us the final answer for part a dsct is going to be six over five feet per second so that's the rate at which the length of the shadow is changing every second it changes by six over five feet or 1.2 feet now let's move on to part b at what rate is the tip of his shadow moving when he is 10 feet from the light so this time we need to calculate dl dt how can we do that first let's get rid of some stuff now let's start with this equation which we had earlier 21 divided by x plus s is equal to 6 over s using similar triangles now instead of using x plus s we're going to replace that with l because notice that x plus s is equal to l so therefore we have this expression 21 over l is 6 divided by s now let's cross multiply so we have 21s is equal to 6 times l and now in this form let's differentiate both sides with respect to time so the derivative of 21s is going to be 21 times ds dt and the derivative of 6l is going to be 6 times dl dt now we have dsct already so we can plug it in to this expression so what we have now is 21 times 6 over 5 and that's equal to 6 times dl dt so at this point we no longer need this picture so we can get rid of it now i'm going to work on this side here let's multiply both sides of this equation by one over six if we do so the sixes will cancel on both sides so on the left side all we have left over is twenty one over five and on the right side we have dl over dt and so this is the final answer it's 21 over 5 feet per second and if you want to convert that into a decimal you can break up twenty one into twenty plus one twenty divided by five is four so it's four and one fifth one over 5 is 0.2 so dl dt is 4.2 feet per second so that's the rate at which the tip of the shadow is moving when he is 10 feet from the light now these two values we really don't need so those numbers are irrelevant in this problem and that's it for this video so now you know how to solve this shadow problem thanks for watching you
