Transcript for: Graphing Rational Functions Using Transformations With Vertical and Horizontal Asymptotes
in this video we're going to focus on graphing rational functions using transformations so let's start with this function 1 over x the curve exists in quadrants 1 and three so this is quadrant one and here we have quadrant two this is quadrant three and this is quadrant four now what are the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of this graph the vertical asymptote is basically the y-axis the vertical asymptote is x is equal to zero you could find it by setting the denominator equal to zero so that's the vertical asymptote the horizontal asymptote is the x-axis and is equal to the equation is y is equal to zero now what about the graph negative one over x how is it different from the graph on the left the only difference is it reflects over the origin so to speak well technically you can see it as a reflection over the y axis this side switches to this side which we can see it here and this side switches over here you can also describe it as a reflection over the x-axis because if you take this side and move it here it looks like this portion the vertical asymptote and the horizontal asymptote are the same for these two graphs so what's the domain and the range for the graph on the left the domain includes all possible x values the only thing that you need to remove from the domain in this example is the vertical asymptote which is x equals 0. if you plug in zero the function is undefined that's why the curve does not exist there so the domain includes every x value except zero so it's from negative infinity to zero union 0 to infinity now for the range you need to remove the horizontal asymptote so the range is going to be the same as the domain so as we've seen in the last example 1 over x and negative 1 over x were symmetric about the origin which means they're odd functions now what about this graph 1 over x squared and also negative 1 over x squared what do you think the general shape for these two graphs will look like so these two graphs still have a vertical asymptote at x equals 0 and also a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero but they're going to be even functions they're symmetric about the y axis which is the vertical asymptote so the first one is going to exist above the x axis because 1 over x squared is always positive if you were to replace x with negative 5 and then square it that would be positive 25 so it's always going to be positive or above the x-axis negative one over x squared it's going to reflect over the x-axis but as you can see it's still symmetric about the y-axis which means that these two functions are even functions the domain for both graphs will be the same it's negative infinity to zero union zero to infinity so the way you find a domain is you start from the left side negative infinity and the graph continues all the way to the right side however it doesn't touch zero as you can see there's the red line never intersects the x value of zero it never touches the y axis so you have to remove zero from the domain now the range of these two functions are not the same what is the range for the first one so when dealing with the range you have to look at the y values the lowest y value is zero the highest is infinity so the range is going to be zero to infinity and it does not include zero so you need to use parentheses instead of brackets now what about the range for the graph on the right notice that the lowest y value is negative infinity and the highest is zero so it's going to be negative infinity to zero that's the range and zero is not included what about this graph one over x plus two how can we graph it this graph is going to look similar to one over x but it's going to shift two units to left if you set the denominator equal to zero you'll see that x is equal to negative two that is the vertical asymptote so let's plot that first and we know that one over x exists in quadrants one and four so relative to the vertical asymptote is going to exist in the upper right section and the lower left section so that's going to be the graph of one over x plus two using transformations now if you want to get an accurate sketch you can plug in points but my focus is not that in this lesson i just want to focus on the general shape so now that we have the general shape what's the domain and what's the range so the lowest x value is negative infinity the highest is infinity and we have to take out the vertical asymptote negative two because if the vertical asymptote is negative two that means in the function x cannot equal negative two it will be undefined because you'll get a zero in the denominator so the domain is going to be from negative infinity to negative two union negative two to infinity and the horizontal asymptote is still y equals zero it hasn't changed which means that y varies from negative infinity to positive infinity but it doesn't include the horizontal asymptote the curve doesn't touch it so the range is negative infinity to zero union zero to infinity so keep this in mind always remove the horizontal asymptote from the range and remove the vertical asymptote from the domain let's try this one negative one over x minus three so what kind of transformations do you see in this graph there's two of interest x minus three means that the graph the vertical asymptote is going to shift three units to the right if you set the denominator equal to zero you'll see that the vertical asymptote is x is equal to three that's the first transformation which is basically a horizontal shift right three units now we have a negative in front of the function so that means that it's going to you could say reflect over the x-axis if you want to so one over x will typically exist in the upper right and upper left section but it's going to flip this part instead of being at the top is not going to be at the bottom so it's going to exist here and here and that's just a rough sketch it's not an accurate sketch i'm implanting points just a simple rough sketch so now what are the domain and range of this function we know the range is going to be the same the horizontal asymptote is y is equal to zero and y can vary from negative infinity to infinity but it doesn't include zero so the range hasn't changed in this example but the domain has because the vertical asymptote has changed the lowest x value is negative infinity the highest is positive infinity and we need to take out three which is the vertical asymptote so the domain is going to be from negative infinity to three you view it from left to right and then union this side the right side is from three to infinity not including three consider this one one over x plus two how can we graph it what type of transformations exist in this graph so the plus two means that it's going to shift up two units now we know that for one over x the horizontal asymptote is y is equal to zero so if we add two to it it's going to be zero plus two so therefore the horizontal asymptote is y is equal to two it's basically this number here that you see so whatever that constant is out in front that's going to be the horizontal asymptote the vertical asymptote is based on this number or that variable if you set the bottom equal to zero well x will be equal to zero so that's the the va or the vertical asymptote so let's plot the asymptotes so the horizontal asymptote is that y is equal to two and the vertical asymptote is the y-axis which x is equal to 0. now it's positive 1 over x so like 1 over x it's going to exist in the upper right corner and the lower left corner now what's the domain and what's the range for this function so starting with the domain the lowest x value is negative infinity it's going to stop at the vertical asymptote which is x is equal to 0 and the highest x value is infinity so the domain is going to be from negative infinity to 0 union 0 to infinity now what about the range the lowest y value that we see is negative infinity and then it's going to stop at 2 which is the horizontal asymptote and the highest y value is positive infinity so the range is going to be from negative infinity to 2 union 2 to infinity so always remove the horizontal asymptote from the remain i mean excuse me from the range now let's move on to our next example let's try one over x squared minus three so how can we graph this function so we could see that the horizontal asymptote is based on the constant negative three so it's y is equal to negative three and if we set the denominator equal to zero we'll get the vertical asymptote which is simply x is equal to zero so that's everything that we have so far so let's plot the vertical asymptote which is just the y-axis and let's plot the horizontal asymptote which is at y equals negative three so here's the horizontal asymptote and this is positive one over x squared one over x squared is going to be symmetric about the vertical asymptote which is in this case the y axis it's an even function and because it's positive it's going to be above the horizontal asymptotes so it's going to look like this it's the same as 1 over x squared but it's been shifted down 3 units so what's the domain and range of the function so analyzing the domain the graph starts from the left negative infinity it stops at the vertical asymptote and it continues all the way to the right to positive infinity so it's negative infinity to zero union zero to infinity as for the range notice that the lowest y value is negative three and the highest is positive infinity so the range is from negative 3 to infinity and that's it for this example try this problem 3 minus one over x plus two so using everything you know go ahead and draw a rough sketch identify the horizontal and the vertical asymptote and also write the domain and range using interval notation so let's start with the horizontal asymptote so we could see that we have a constant three in front so it's going to be y is equal to positive three and for the vertical asymptote if we set x plus two equal to zero x will be equal to negative two so therefore the graph shifts two units to the left and up three units so this is the vertical asymptote at x equals negative two and then we have the horizontal asymptote at y equals string so here's the question for you will the graphs this graph exist in the upper right corner and the lower left corner or will it exist in the upper left corner and the lower right corner what would you say so is it similar to 1 over x or negative 1 over x notice the negative in front so it's going to reflect over the horizontal asymptote so relative to 1 of x so it's going to exist in the upper left corner and the lower right corner now with this information what is the domain and the range of the function so starting with the domain the lowest x value is negative infinity the vertical asymptote is negative two and the highest is infinity so the domain is going to be from negative infinity to negative two union negative two to infinity as for the range you can see that the lowest y value is negative infinity the horizontal asymptote is positive three and the highest y value is positive infinity so the range is going to be negative infinity to three union three to infinity let's try this one y is equal to 3 divided by 1 over x minus 2 square so what is the horizontal asymptote and what is the vertical asymptote so the horizontal asymptote is based on that number so it's going to be positive 3 again and the vertical asymptote if we set x minus 2 equal to 0 then we can see that x will be equal to positive two and this is similar to the graph one over x squared so it's going to be symmetric about the vertical asymptote so the graph shifts two units to the right and up three units the first thing you should do is always plot the asymptotes so you can draw a good rough sketch now we said that because the squared is going to be symmetric about the vertical asymptotes so it can be like this above the horizontal asymptote or it can look like this now because of the negative sign it's going to reflect over the horizontal asymptote so it's going to be below it so it's going to exist in the lower left and the lower right region so now what are the domain and range of this function how can we figure this out so let's start with the domain all we need to do is take out the hor i mean the vertical asymptote which is 2. so it's going to be negative infinity to 2 union 2 to infinity now what about the range the lowest y value is negative infinity and the highest is the horizontal asymptote in this case which is three so the range is going to be negative infinity to three so now you know how to graph rational functions using transformations
