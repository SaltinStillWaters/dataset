Transcript for: Riemann Sums - Left Endpoints and Right Endpoints
now let's say if we have the graph of y = x^2 now let's focus on the right side of the graph how can we calculate the area under the curve from let's say 0 to a so how can we determine the area of the Shader region now one simple way in which we could do so is by using rectangles so let's use rectangles let's actually use four rectangles to approximate the area and there's two ways you can do so you could use a lower sum in this case which will be the left end points or an upper sum which would represent the right end points for an increase in function so if we're going to use four rectangles n is equal to four and so we're going to break this up into four sub intervals Now using the left end points the first rectangle is going to be at zero so it doesn't have any height the second rectangle when X is two is going to touch the curve and then the next one when X is four is going to touch the curve and looks like that and and then when X is 6 and you can see this is going to be an under approximation it's less than the actual area under the curve now to calculate the area of each rectangle we need to multiply the width of each rectangle by the height so we can see that the width is the same but the height will vary and we need to do it for every rectangle in this picture so we could come up with a process that will help us to do so so the area under the curve is equal to it's going to be the width of each rectangle that's uh Delta X which we could see that Delta X is 2 times the height the height is basically the Y values or the function values at some particular sample point the Sigma notation tells us that we need to find the sum starting from 1 to n where n is 4 so basically we have to find the sum of the area of each rectangle so Delta X represents the width of the rectangle and F ofx represents the height of the rectangle so the width times the height will give us the area Delta X is equal to B minus a / n now a is basically the first point that we see here on the left side so a is zero B represents the last point so B is eight so we want to find the area from0 to a that is from A to B so Delta X is going to be b - a 8 - 0 and we have four rectangles or four sub intervals so n is four 8 / 4 is 2 and we can clearly see that Delta X is two units long now if we wish to calculate the area of each rectangle so when x is0 0 S is0 the height is zero when X is 2 the height is going to be 2^ squ so that's 4 when X is 4 the height is going to be 4 S or 16 and then when X is 6 the height is going to be 6 squ 36 so width time height the width for each rectangle is two 2 * 4 that will give us an area of eight for the second rectangle for the third one 2 * 16 is 32 and for the last one 2 * 36 is 72 now 8 + 32 is 40 40 + 72 is 112 so we should get an area of 112 but let's come up with a process that can help us to do so efficiently without actually drawing a picture so the area using the left end point is going to be Delta x times the sum of all the Y values so we only have four sub intervals so we need to add four y values so this is going to be the first one x sub one plus the second one x sub 2 plus The Third One X sub3 and the fourth One X sub4 so what are these X values how can we find these X values well let's create a number line from A to B so from zero to 8 and there's four sub intervals which means there going to be five points so this is the first sub interval this is the second third and fourth now we need to use four of the Five Points since we're using the left end points let's start with the left side so the Four Points we're going to use is zero 2 4 and six so then the area using the left end points is going to be Delta X which is 2times f of0 plus F of 2 plus F of 4 plus F of 6 now F of 0 that's going to be 0 squar so that's 0 f of 2 is 2^ 2 which is 4 and F of 4 is 4 2 that's 16 and F of 6 is 62 which is 36 don't forget the function is y = x^2 so f ofx is X2 now 4 + 16 is 20 20 + 36 is 56 and 2 * 56 is 112 So This is the approximation of the area using the left end point now keep in mind this is an underapproximation since we have all of this empty space unus so the real answer is going to be greater than 112 now let's approximate the area using the right end points so first let's draw a picture and so we're going from0 to 8 let's make four intervals now when drawn the left end points we started with the left point and went to the right so at the left end point we made sure that that point touched the curve and then we drew a line to the right so at four you draw a line from four to the curve and then to draw the rectangle go to the right so at six draw a line from six to the curve and then go to the right so that's how you can show the rectangles using the left end points now for the right end points what you want to do is start with the right end point touch the curve and then go to the left so for six you want to start where six touches the curve and then go to the left so at four you start where four touches the curve and then go to the left so you can see that this is going to be an over approximation so the answer that we get using the right end point is going to exceed the actual area under the curve so this is known as an over approximation or an upper sum using the left end points we got an under approximation or a lower sum now for the right end points we're going to choose four of the Five Points so we're going to choose the four points on the right so that's 2 4 6 and 8 we're not going to choose the point on the left which is zero and that's going to give us the over approximation so the area using the right end points is going to be Delta X time the sum of all the heights of the rectangles so that's going to be F of 2 plus F of 4 plus F of 6 Plus F of 8 so Delta X is 2 2 2 is 4 4 2 is 16 6 2 is 36 8^2 is 64 now from the last example we know that 4 + 16 + 36 is 56 56 + 64 is 120 and 2 * 120 is 240 so this is the area that we get using the right end points when n is four now let's go ahead and average the left and the right end points the area for those values so the area for the left end points we said was 112 and for the right it's 240 so let's add them up and divide by two 112 ID 2 is 56 240 ID 2 is 120 56 + 120 is 176 so when you average the left and the right end points you're going to get an answer that's closer to the real answer now to to get the real answer we need to calculate the definite integral the area under the curve from 0 to 8 for f ofx where F ofx is X squ is going to be the integration from A to B F ofx DX in this case it's going to be from 0 to 8 X2 DX and that's going to give us the exact answer for the area under the Curve so we just got to evaluate the definite integral the anti-derivative of x^2 is X Cub over 3 evaluated from 0 to 8 so this is going to be 8 3 over 3 minus 0 3r over 3 8 * 8 is 64 and 64 * 8 is 512 so it's 512 ID 3 which is approximately 17067 so as you can see the average and the actual answer are very close the left end point which is 112 it's much less than the actual answer and the right end point 240 is much higher than the actual answer but if you average them you can get a good approximation for the area under the curve now what's going to happen if we increase the number of rectangles from four to8 what's going to happen to the accuracy of our answer if you increase the value of n the area using the left end points and the right end points the REM and sums it's going to be more accurate it's going to be closer to 170. 67 as n increases as n approaches Infinity then the r sums approximation will become equal to the actual area so let's go ahead and get the answer so let's calculate the area using the left end points so let's make a number line so from A to B that's from 0 to 8 we need eight sub intervals so we can see that the width of each rectangle is going to be one so to calculate Delta X it's going to be b - a/ n so B is the last point in the number line that's eight a is the first one and N is 8 so 8id by 8 is one now which points should we use to calculate the area using the left end points there's a total of nine points we need to use eight so we're going to use eight points starting from the left so that's going to be from zero all the way to seven we're not going to use the last end point on the right so the area is going to be Delta x times the sum of f ofx going from in this case I guess we could say 1 to 8 but x sub one is really this number that's the first x value this is x sub 2 so x sub 8 is really 7 so just keep that in mind this is x sub 9 which we're not going to use so Delta X is one and then it's going to be the first one x sub one has a value of zero x sub 2 has a value of 1 and then x sub 8 is equal to 7 so it's going to be 0 2 + 1 2 + 2 2 which is 4 + 3 2 which is 9 4 S is 16 5 S is 25 6 s is 36 7 squ is 49 now let's go ahead and add up these values so 1 + 9 that's 10 and 4 + 16 that's 20 and then 25 + 36 20 + 30 is 50 5 + 6 is 61 and then if we add 10 and 20 that's going to be 30 60 and 40 is 100 and 9 + 1 is 10 so that's 110 so we're going to get 140 so the area using the left end points when n is 8 is 140 keep in mind when n was 4 it was 112 So 140 is closest to the true answer of 170. 67 than 112 so we could see that the left end points the area using left end points is approaching the true answer of 17.6 as it increases now let's use the right end points so first let's create a number line so from 0 to 8 we're going to use the points on the right so we're not going to use the first point on the left so we need to use eight of the nine points that we see here so to calculate the area using the right end points it's going to be Delta X which is 1 times the first one which is f of one plus the second Point F of two all the way to the last Point F of 8 so F of 1 1 2 F of 2 is 2 2 that's four and then 9 16 25 36 49 and 8 squ which is 64 so we already know that from 1 to 49 that's going to be 140 if we add up these seven values because we did that already that's going to be 40 and then plus 64 so that's 204 now let's organize the information in a table so this is going to be the area using the left end points and the area using the right end points and this is going to be the average of the area for the left and the right end points and this is going to be the actual answer so when n was four the area using the left end points was 112 and for the right end points it was 240 and when we average those two numbers it was 176 and the actual answer is 170. 67 now when n is 8 the area using the left end points is 140 using the right is 204 and then if we average those two numbers 140 divid 2 is 70 204 divid 2 is 102 so this adds to 172 so as n increases notice that the area using the left end points it's increasing towards 170 and the area using the right end points it's decreasing towards 17067 it went from 240 to 204 and notice the average comparing n = 4 and N = 8 the average is approaching 170. 67 it went from 176 to 172 so as n increases the accuracy of the approximation increases so hopefully this video gave you a good introduction into remont sums and how to approximate the area under the curve using the left end points and the right end points for
