Transcript for: Evaluating Limits By Factoring
let's try this problem what is the limit as x approaches zero of the function five x divided by x squared plus two x now we can't use direct substitution here because if we plug in zero we're gonna have zero divided by zero which is indeterminate so we're not going to do that instead we can evaluate this limit analytically by factoring there's nothing to factor on the top that is on the numerator of the fraction so we're not going to change it but in the denominator we can take out the gcf the greatest common factor so if we take out an x x squared divided by x is x and 2x divided by x is positive two now notice that we can cancel an x variable and so we'll be left with the limit as x approaches 0 of 5 divided by x plus 2. now we can use direct substitution once you replace x with 0 there's no need to rewrite this limit expression now some teachers are picky about this so you have to rewrite it until you replace x with this number so the final answer is 5 divided by 2 that's the limit of this expression now what about this one what is the limit as x approaches 2 of x squared plus 3x minus 10 divided by x minus 2. so we can't plug in a 2. if we do we're going to get a 0 in the denominator and it's going to be undefined so we got a factor how can we factor this trinomial to do so find two numbers that multiply to 10 but add to 3. numbers that multiply to ten are five and two now we can make it negative five and positive two or positive five and negative two now we wanna make it positive five and negative two because those two numbers add up to positive 3. so therefore x squared plus 3x minus 10 can be factored as x plus 5 times x minus 2. and we need to rewrite the limit expression so notice that we can cancel the factor x minus two and so we're left with the limit as x approaches two of x plus five so now we can use direct substitution we're not going to get a 0 in the denominator anymore so it's going to be 2 plus 5 which is 7. so that's the limit here's another problem that you could try what is the limit as x approaches three of x squared minus nine divided by x minus three so what do you think what is the answer to this problem well we need to factor x squared minus nine and we can use the difference of perfect squares formula so for example if you have a squared minus b squared it's going to be a plus b times a minus b so for example let's say if we have x squared minus 25 the square root of x squared is x the square root of 25 is 5 and one is going to be positive and the other is going to be negative that's how you can factor it so for the example that we have the square root of x squared as we said before is x and the square root of nine is three and so it's going to be x plus three and x minus three so we can cancel with the three on the bottom and now we're left over with the limit as x approaches 3 of x plus 3. and now let's use direct substitution so it's going to be 3 plus 3 which is equal to 6. and so that's how we can evaluate this particular limit what is the limit as x approaches 2 of x cubed minus 8 divided by x minus 2. what would you do in that case so what we need to do is factor the difference of perfect cubes and the formula that we need to use is this one a q minus b cubed is a minus b times a squared plus a b plus b squared so in this case a cube is x cubed b to the third is eight so a is the cube root of x cubed which is x and the b is the cube root of eight which is two a squared that's x times x which is x squared a b that's x times two or two x and b squared is two squared which is four so therefore we have the expression the limit as x approaches two x minus two times x squared plus two x plus four divided by x minus two all right let's get rid of this stuff on the bottom and now we can cancel the x minus two factor so we have the limit as x approaches 2 of this remaining expression and now let's use direct substitution so this is equal to 2 squared plus two times two plus four two squared is four two times two is four and four plus four plus four three times is the same as four times three which is twelve and so that's the limit as x approaches 2 of this expression so you need to be familiar with the different factoring techniques that you've learned in a typical algebra course now let's try this one what is the limit as x approaches 4 of 4 minus x divided by x squared minus 16. so take a minute and pause the video see if you can get this one right so what do you think we need to do here so looking at x squared minus 16 we can see that we have a difference of perfect squares situation so to factor it it's going to be x plus 4 times x minus four but four minus x and x minus four they don't really cancel at the present moment however what we can do is factor out a negative one if we take out a negative one in the front and then reverse the order of four minus x notice that if you take a negative from negative x you're gonna get positive x if you take a negative from positive four it changes to negative four so by factoring out a negative one we now can cancel x minus four and so what we have left over is the limit as x approaches four of negative one divided by x plus four and so this is going to be negative one over four plus four and four plus four is eight so the answer is negative one divided by eight now what is the limit as x approaches 4 of the expression x squared minus x minus 12 divided by x squared plus x minus 20. so we just need to factor completely let's go ahead and factor this expression so what two numbers multiply to negative 12 but add to the middle coefficient negative one so we know four times three is twelve but we need to make the four negative because negative four plus positive three is negative one so this is going to be x minus four times x plus now what two numbers multiply it to negative 20 but add to one well we know 5 times 4 is 20 but we need to make it positive 5 and negative 4 because that's going to add up to 1. so it's x plus 5 times x minus 4. so we can cancel x minus 4 and so we're left with the limit as x approaches 4 of x plus 3 divided by x plus 5. so if we plug in four it's going to be four plus three over four plus five now four plus three we know it's seven four plus five is nine and so that's the answer seven divided by nine what is the limit as x approaches negative one of the expression two x squared minus x minus three over x plus one so what can we do here what would you do so first we can't plug in negative one because on the bottom it's going to give us zero and so that's undefined but we need to factor this trinomial but notice that the leading coefficient is not one so the way in which we factor it is going to be different so first let's multiply two times negative three two times negative three is negative six what two numbers multiply to negative six but add to the middle coefficient of negative one this is going to be negative three and two so to factor it we're gonna replace the middle term negative x with positive 2x minus 3x next let's factor by grouping in the first two terms take out the gcf which is 2x and so you'll be left with x plus and the last two terms take out the greatest common factor which is negative three and so you're gonna get x plus one next factor out x plus one so we're gonna write it once if we take out x plus 1 from the first term we'll be left with 2x if we take it out from the second term we're going to have negative 3 left over so therefore we could say this is equal to the limit as x approaches negative 1 x plus 1 times two x minus three divided by x plus one so now we can cancel x plus one and so we're left with the limit as x approaches negative one of two x minus three so now let's use direct substitution so this is gonna be two times negative one minus three which is negative two minus three and that's equal to negative five so that's the final answer
