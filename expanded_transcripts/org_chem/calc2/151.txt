Transcript for: Properties of Definite Integrals - Basic Overview
in this video we're going to review some basic properties of integrals so let's say if we have this particular function let's say the anti-derivative or the integral of f ofx DX from 1 to 3 let's say that it's equal to five so knowing that what is the value of this particular expression so notice we have a two in front this would be the same as if we have a two between the integral symbol and F ofx it's just going to be 2 * 5 which is 10 that was pretty straightforward now what about this example let's say if the numbers were reversed instead of 1 to three it's 3: one what is the answer for this one now this this expression is equivalent to 13 F ofx DX so therefore it's 5 now what about this example what is the anti-derivative of f ofx DX from 3 to 3 this is equivalent to F of 3 minus F of three which are the same so they're going to cancel this is going to be zero whenever these two are the same the answer is always zero now what about let's say if we have a different problem let's say the integral of f ofx DX from 2 to 3 is equal to 4 and the integral of f ofx DX from 3 to 5 is equal to S if that's the case what is the integral from 2 to 5 how can we figure this value now let's analyze it graphically let's say f ofx is some function and let's say this is two three and five this particular value represents the area of the Shaded region between two and three so this region has an area of four now this integral represents the area of the Shaded region between 3 and 5 which has the value of seven now this integral represents the area of the Shaded region between two and five so it's the sum of four and seven which is 11 let's go back to that problem now it's important for you to understand that the integration from 2 to 3 plus the integral of the function from 3 to 5 is equal to the integral from 2 to 5 another way that can help you to understand it is to realize what these values represent the integration from 2 to 3 is basically the same as F of 3 minus F of 2 it's the net change of the integral function the integral of f ofx DX from 3 to 5 is the same as F of 5 minus F of3 so notice that these two they cancel one is positive and the other is negative and this expression is equal to F of 5 minus F of 2 these two values are positive and these two values are negative as you can see the left side is the same as the right side now given these two values evaluate this expression the integral from 5 to 3 F ofx DX minus the integral 3: 2 F ofx DX now if 3: 5 represents 7 5 to 3 will be -7 and if 2: 3 gives us a value of 4 3 to 2 is going to be4 so this is the same as -7 + 4 4 which is equal to -3 let's say that the integral of G ofx DX is equal to8 and the integral of GX from 3 to 9 is equal to 5 what is the value of the integration of G of x from 6 to 9 so first write an expression that relates all of these three integrals to each other you need to realize that the total is from 3 to 9 3: 6 plus the interval from 6 to 9 must add up to 3 to 9 realizing that we can write an equation the integration from 3 to 6 plus the area from 6 to 9 must equal the area from 3 to 9 that represents the total area in the interval 3 to 9 so from 3 to 6 the value is8 we're looking for this value let's call it x 3 to 9 is five so we're solving for x to do that we need to add eight to both sides so the Miss side is 5 + 8 or which is 133 so that's the answer to the problem let's try a few more examples let's say that the anti-derivative from 1 to 4 F ofx DX is 9 and from let's say 7 to 9 F ofx DX is equal to -6 go ahead head and evaluate this expression -3 * the integration from 7 to 4 F ofx DX so using the information given to you on the top go ahead and find a value of this expression so first let's write a relationship or an equation the area of the function from 1 to 4 plus the area of the function from 4 to 7 has to equal the area of the function from 1 to 7 so this we know to be true so from 1 to 4 the value is9 we need to find this one so let's call it X and from 1 to 7 it's -6 so to solve for x we need to add 9 to both sides so X is equal to -6 + 9 which is POS 3 so now we know that the integration from 4 to 7 for f ofx DX is equal to POS 3 and it makes sense -9 + 3 adds up to the total of -6 so therefore the integration from 7 to 4 must be -3 and if we multiply it by -3 then this is going to equal POS 9 So This Is The Answer let's say that the integral from 5 to 2 F ofx DX is equal to 8 and also the integral from1 to 5 F ofx DX is = to 12 so given this information find the value of this expression 5 * the integral from 2 to1 F ofx DX so let's make an interval the lowest x value that we see is NE 1 and the highest is five and the middle value is two so the first value going from left to right must be from -1 to 2 so the integral from 1 to 2 F ofx DX plus the second part the integral from 2 to 5 F ofx DX must equal the total from -1 to 5 F ofx DX so we have the total this particular value is 12 now we don't have 2 to 5 we have 5 to two if from 5 to two is 8 then 2 to 5 must be8 so we need to find this particular value so we need to add eight to both sides 12 + 8 is 20 so X is 20 so the integral from -1 to 2 F ofx DX is equal to 20 so with that information we can now find the value of this expression so from 1 to 2 it's 20 so from 2 to 1 it must be -20 * 5 this is going to be -00 so that's the answer
