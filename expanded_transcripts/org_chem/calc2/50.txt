Transcript for: Limits of Natural Logarithmic Functions - Calculus
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the limit of natural log functions so let's start with the first example what is the limit as X approaches 0 from the right of Ln X now if we were to plug in 0 into that function you would get an undefined answer I learned zero doesn't exists and if we draw a graph we could see why so Ln X has a vertical asymptote that the y-axis at x equals zero it has an x-intercept that one and it looks like this so that's a rough sketch of the graph y equals Ln X so as we follow the curve as we approach X from the right side notice that it goes down towards negative Infinity so that's the limit as X approaches zero is on the right side now from the left side notice that the function is not defined on the left side the domain for the lnx function is from 0 to Infinity it doesn't exist on the left side so we could put DNE doesn't exist so the limit as X approaches 0 from either side because these two are different well this limit doesn't exist either in order for this limit to exist the left side limit and the right side limit they must be the same now what about this problem what is the limit as X approaches zero of Ln X but instead of this x we're going to have the absolute value of x so feel free to try that problem now it really helps to draw the graph now we know that L and X it looks like this this is a rough sketch of L and X now that we have the absolute value of x can be positive or negative so we're going to get the reflection of that graph across the y-axis however X can't be zero because Ln 0 does not exist so the domain for this function is from negative Infinity to zero Union zero to Infinity so Ln 0 doesn't exist but what about the limit as X approaches zero in order to find this answer we need to check the one-sided limits so let's start with the right side as we approach Zero from the right so as we follow this curve and approach an x value of zero notice that it goes down towards negative Infinity now if we check the left-sided limit we're going to get a similar answer so as we follow this graph and approach and approach Zero from the left side it too goes to negative Infinity so because these two are the same the limit as X approaches 0 4 the for the natural log of the absolute value of x that's going to be negative Infinity this limit does exist even though Ln 0 does not exist now what about this one the limit as X approaches zero from the left of the natural log of cosine X feel free to pause the video if you want to try this example by the way for those of you who want more examples on limits feel free to check out the problems in the description section of the video I'm going to be posting more links to other topics on limits so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance so what is the limit as X approaches 0 from the less of the natural log of cosine X so what we have here is a composite function a function within another function in order to evaluate this limit we need to evaluate the limit as X approaches zero from the left of the function within now for this function cosine X we can use direct substitution because if you were to draw the graph of cosine it looks like this so as we approach Zero from the right or from the left the Y value is 1. so the limit as X approaches zero for cosine X is simply one and the natural log of one is equal to zero use indirect substitution so that's all we got to do for this problem thank you but now let's say we want to find the limit as X approaches 0 from the right for this time it's going to be the natural log of the sine function go ahead and try that so this is going to be Ln and the limit as X approaches 0 from the right of sine now for this one we need to be careful I'm going to draw the graph of sine y equals sine X looks like this now as the x value approaches zero notice that y approaches 0 as well so the limit as X approaches 0 from the right of sine X is zero however Ln 0 does not exist so direct substitution will not help us when solving this composite function but nevertheless we could still get an answer for this problem so we need to understand that as X approaches zero from the right y approaches zero but this is important it's in which side this y approach Zero from the left or from the right what would you say now really think about that because this is going to determine the answer of the overall problem if we follow the Curve notice that the Y values they go from a positive value to zero so at this point Y might be one here might be 0.5 and now it's zero so Y is approaching Zero from the right or from above and we Define sine X to be y so as X approaches zero from the right y equals sine X that y value approaches zero from the right as well so what we're going to have now is Ln as y approaches zero from the right and I'm going to replace sine X with y now we know the answer to this because earlier in this video we said that the limit I need to rewrite this I did not write this correctly so this is supposed to be the limit as y approaches 0 from the right of Ln y now earlier in this video we said that the limit as X approaches zero from the right of Ln X that was negative Infinity and the same is true for the limit as y approaches 0 from the right of l and y that 2 will be negative Infinity so this is the final answer now if we had this as y approaches 0 from the left for Ln y that would be doesn't exist it would give us this answer so it's important for us to identify whether Y is approaching Zero from the right or from the left when dealing with the limit of composite functions like this by the way I do have another video on YouTube that covers limits of composite functions for those of you who want more specific examples like this and I'm going to be posting that in the description section below so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance now let's try this problem what is the limit as X approaches 3 from the right of the natural log of x squared minus 9. go ahead and try that problem now if we were to use direct substitution we'll get 3 squared minus 9. 3 squared is nine nine minus nine is zero that Ln 0 doesn't exist however that may not give us the right answer so we need to use some other techniques here the first thing we can do is we can Factor this expression so we have the difference of two squares so a squared minus B squared is going to be a plus b times a minus B so x squared minus nine when you factor it it's going to be X plus 3 times x minus 3 and all of this is within the natural log function now a certain property of logs allows us to expand it so Ln a times B is equivalent to Ln a Plus lnb so we can rewrite this expression like this we can split up problem into two separate logs so we're going to have the limit as X approaches 3 from the right of Ln X plus three and the limit as X approaches 3 from the right of Ln x minus 3. now for the one on the left we could use direct substitution so this becomes Ln 3 plus 3 which is ln6 now I mean that was the one on the left now the one on the right for this one we should graph this one because we have a vertical asymptote now we know the graph of L and X Ln X looks like this with the y-axis being the vertical asymptote which is x equals zero now this one is equivalent to Ln X but it's been shifted three units to the right so because we have the expression x minus 3 if you set that equal to zero you get a new vertical asymptote at x equals positive three so the graph y equals Ln x minus 3 is going to look like this it shifted three units to the right so now with this graph we could evaluate the limit as X approaches 3 from the right side then three is the vertical asymptote so as we approach 3 from the right we can see it's going to negative Infinity so ln6 plus negative Infinity that's going to be negative Infinity so this is the final answer so that's how you can evaluate the limit of natural log functions if you can graph it I recommend doing that because you can just literally see what the answer is going to be if not you can employ the techniques that we've used in this video so that's it for this video thanks again for watching thank you
