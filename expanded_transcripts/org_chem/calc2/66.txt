Transcript for: Alternate Form of The Limit Definition of the Derivative - Calculus
let's talk about the alternative form of the derivative now let's say we have some function f ofx and let's define it to be equal to X Cub now we know what the first derivative of that function is using the power rule the derivative of x Cub is going to be 3x^2 now let's say if we plug in some point let's say say 4 this is going to be 3 * 4^ 2 which is 3 * 16 that's 48 so this is the derivative of f ofx as a function and this number when we evaluate the derivative at a point we get the slope of the tangent line now we can find the derivative of the function using limits so frime of X is equal to the Limit as H approaches zero of FX + hus FX / H so this is the limit definition of the derivative and using this formula it will give us frime of X is equal to 3x^2 now the alternative form of the definition of the derivative is this equation frime of a is equal to the Limit as X approaches a of f ofx - F of a over x - A now this form of the derivative it will give you a number as opposed to a function that depends on X so using this you can get the slope of the tangent line which is 48 when X is 4 so make sure you understand understand the difference between these two formulas so this formula will give you the derivative as a function and this formula will evaluate that derivative at some point where xal a let's use both of these two formulas so you could see how it works so let's start with this one so frime of X is going to be the limit as H approaches zero and then we have f of x + H so in this formula we're going to replace x with X+ H so X Cub will become x + H Cub now minus F ofx so f ofx is simply X cub and then div divid H so now how can we evaluate this limit notice that we have a difference of two cubes when you see that we could use this formula a 3r minus B 3r is going to be a minus B * a 2 + a b + b^ 2 so in that example a is going to be x + h B will be X so a minus B that's going to be x + H that's a and then minus b - x so that part is just the a minus B part now we need this part so a 2 that's going to be x + h^ 2 then a * B so we're multiplying these two that's going to be X * x + H or you can write it in reverse it'll be the same and then plus b^2 B is X so b^2 is x s and this is going to be divided by H now of course I need to rewrite this expression so this is as the limit as H approaches zero now X and negative X will cancel so what we have left over is the limit as H approaches zero we have an H left over so it's h and then time x + h^ 2 + x * x + H * x^2 we don't need to foil or distribute what we have here I'm just going to leave it that way now notice that we can cancel H as soon as the H from the bottom is gone we can now use direct substitution so I'm going to replace the remaining H with with 0o so this is going to be x + 0 2 + x * x + 0 + x^2 x + 0 2 is just X2 and then x * X that's X2 is again if you add x^2 three times you're going to get 3 x^2 and so we could see that these two answers they match so this formula gives you the derivative as a function now let's use the second one so let's calculate frime of a so a is going to be the number inside of fime which is four so we're looking for for fim of 4 this is going to be the limit as X approaches 4 of F ofx F ofx is X Cub minus F of a so F of a is the same as F of four so we're plugging four into that function so F of 4 is going to be 4 to the 3 power and then over x - A or x - 4 now once again we're going to use the difference of perfect cubes formula so we're going to factor as a minus B * a 2 + a b + b 2 so a is X B is 4 this is going to be the limit as X approaches 4 and then x - 4 * a 2 that's going to be x^2 and then a * B that's 4 * x + b^ 2 B is going to be 4^ 2 and then over x -4 now notice that we could cancel x - 4 now once we do that we're left with this expression now once we get rid of the x- 4 on the bottom we can now use direct substitution so replace an X with 4 we're going to have 4^ 2 + 4 * 4 + 4^ 2 4^ 2 or 4 * 4 that's going to be 16 when you add 16 3 times is the same as 16 * 3 which is 48 so as you could see the alternate form of the derivative basically evaluates the derivative for us at some point or X is equal to a so I want to make sure you understand the difference between the two formulas and how to use them so that's basically it for this video
