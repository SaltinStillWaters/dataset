Transcript for: Limits and Absolute Value
what is the limit as X approaches 3 of the absolute value of x minus 3 for this problem we can simply use direct substitution there's nothing stopping us from doing so so this is simply the absolute value of 3us 3 which is the absolute value of zero and that is zero now what about this one what is the limit as X approaches Z of the absolute value of x / X in this case we can't use direct substitution 0 over Z what is that going to be it could be eight it can be one it can be zero it could be undefined so we we can't just plug it in now what we need to do is determine the limit from the left side and the right side in order to figure this out so let's start with the left side now what we can do is plug in a number so left of zero we can plug in .1 the absolute value of .1 /1 what is that the absolute value of1 is positive1 if we divide pos1 by1 this is equal to1 and so that's the left side limit the limit as X approaches zero from the left of the absolute value of x/x is Nega 1 now what about the right side well let's try plugging in positive .1 the absolute value of positive1 will remain pos1 1 / .1 is pos1 so that's the right side limit now because the left side and the right side are not the same therefore this limit does not exist so that is the answer that's how you can evaluate these types of limits you got to check the left side and the right side something else that can help you is to realize that the absolute value of x is really you could break it up into a piece function it's equal tox and postive X it's when X is less than Z and it's positive X when X is greater than zero so therefore when you have the absolute value of x overx this is equal to postive X overx which is 1 when X is less than Z and it's equal tox / X which is -1 when X is greater than Z so therefore you can turn this into a peie wise function you could say this is Nega 1 when X is less than zero and positive 1 when X is greater than zero so to graph it it looks like this on the left side the graph is at ne1 and on the right side equals to POS 1 and that is why the limit as X approaches Z from the left was equal to negative 1 that's why we got that answer as you approach negative as you approach Zero from the left side the Y value is Nega 1 and the limit as X approaches zero from the right side was positive one because as you approach Zero from the right side you can see that the Y value is going to be positive one so if you graph it it can help you to figure this out so just remember any time you have the absolute value of a function you can break it up into the positive version of the function or the negative version let's work on another example what is the limit as X approaches 5 from the right of the absolute value of x - 5 / x - 5 so this time we're just trying to figure out the one side limit not the left side or not as X approaches five from either side we only want the answer as X approaches five from the right so go ahead and try that now keep in mind the absolute value of x - 5 we can write it as positive x - 5 or Nega x - 5 when X is greater than 5 this one holds true and this one applies when X is less than 5 so therefore the absolute value of x - 5 can be equal to one of two things if we make it positive x - 5 then this is going to be positive 1 and if we make ITX - 5 these two will cancel and you're going to get negative 1 so when you see a problem like this the answer is either is one of two answers it's either one or negative one and if you ever get confused a simple way is just to plug in a number so five to the right we need to plug in something that's bigger than five let's try 5.1 5.1 - 5 is positive1 the absolute value of positive .1 is 0.1 and 0.1 / 0.1 is 1 so this is the right side limit as X approaches five from the right side this is going to equal positive 1 what is the limit as X approaches 4 from the left of the absolute value of x x - 4 over x - 4 so in this case let's plug in a number that's less than four like 3.9 3.9 minus 4 that's .1 and the absolute value of negative .1 is positive1 so therefore this is going to equal ne1 now what about the limit as X approaches three from either side so to do this we need to evaluate the left side and the right side as X approaches three from the left we need to plug in 2.9 so this is going to be the absolute value of 2.9 minus 3 / 2.9 minus 3 so then this is going to be .1 /1 which turns into positive1 /1 and that's equal to1 from the left side the limit as X approaches three from the right side based on all the examples that you've seen so far you know what the answer is going to be this is going to be postive .1 over .1 which is POS 1 so because the left and right side limits do not match this limit does not exist what about the limit as X approaches -2 from the left of the absolute value of x + 2 / X+ 2 try that problem so what number should we plug in if X approaches -2 from the left let's make a number line here's -2 here's -3 and here's 1 on the number line so from the left side notice that we need to pick a number between -3 and -2 but close to -2 so we can use -2.1 so we're going to have the absolute value of -2.1 + 2 / -2.1 + 2 so that's going to be 2.1 + 2 is .1 the absolute value of .1 is pos1 positive1 /1 is negative 1 so that's the answer now if you want to do it another way you can do it this way as well so you can write a peie wise function and make the statement that the absolute value of X+ 2 can be any one of these two expressions it's x + 2 when X is greater than -2 to find this number set the inside that is the x + 2 equal to Z and solve for x and that's where you get -2 from now when X is less than -2 you're going to have the negative version of the function since we're approaching 2 from the left side we need to use this part of the function because on the left side x is less than -2 so therefore we could say this is x + 2 / x + 2 and these two will cancel giving us negative 1 you can do it that way if you want to here's another example what is the limit as X approaches 3 from the right of the absolute value of 3 - x / x - 3 so what can we do in that case well if we turn it into a peie wise function at least this part we could see that if we set 3 - x equal to Z x will equal 3 so at 3 the function changes so there's two versions we can have Nega 3 - x and positive 3 - x now when X is let's say two that is when X is less than 3 3 - x is positive which is okay we need to use a negative sign to make it positive because an absolute value function will make a negative value positive when X is greater than 3 like 4 3 - x is 3 - 4 is Nega 1 so we need to put the negative in front of it to make it positive so when X is larger than 3 we're going to get that expression so 3 to the right is bigger than three so therefore we need to use this so this is going to be negative 3 - x X - 3 if we distribute the negative sign and reverse the two numbers negative * X becomes positive X and then we're going to have -3 these two cancel so the answer should be one now let's confirm it using direct substitution so three to the right let's plug in 3.1 so this is going to be 3.1 rather 3 minus 3.1 and on the bottom 3.1 - 3 3 - 3.1 is .1 and 3.1 - 3 is uh pos1 the absolute value of .1 is positive1 pos1 / positive. one is one so that's the answer here's another problem that you could try evaluate the limit as X approaches one from either side of the expression x^2 - one / the absolute value of x - one go ahead and try that take a minute pause the video and work on it so first let's start with the absolute value of x - one now we can write it as positive x -1 or negative x -1 and if we set X - 1 equal to Z we could see that it's going to change at one so when X is greater than one we're going to get a positive value if we plug it into this let's say if we plug in two 2 - 1 is positive now when X is less than one let's say if we plug in a zero this will be negative which we don't want we want a positive answer if we plug in 0 here 0 - 1 is 1 * the ne 1 outside that's going to make it positive so we want X to be less than one for the negative version now let's evaluate the limit as X approaches one from the right side to begin with if we do so we can use this portion because on the right side x is greater than one so the absolute value of x -1 will just be positive x -1 and we could Factor the numerator that's x + 1 * x -1 so therefore these will cancel and then what we'll have is the limit as X approaches one from the right of x + 1 so we can use direct substitution 1 + 1 is 2 so on the right side the limit is equal to positive2 so keep that answer in mind now let's evaluate the limit from the right side using direct substitution so let's use 1.01 because it has to be bigger than one but very close to one let's confirm the answer that we have which was positive2 1.01 2us 1 that's going to be a about positive2 01 and 1.01 - 1 that's just positive 01 if we divide these two numbers this is going to be 2.01 which is very close to positive2 so that means that the answer that we had before was correct if we plug in a number that's even closer to one like 1.001 the answer should be very close to pos2 now let's evaluate the limit as X approaches one from the left side so the numerator can be factored the same way x + 1 xus one and the denominator this time we're going to use Negative X - one because one from the left is less than one so this is going to be negative x - one and we can get rid of the stuff on the bottom at this point we're not going to use it anymore so let's cancel these two and so we have the limit as X approaches 1 from the left x + 1 / 1 so if we plug in one now it's going to be 1 + 1 over1 so 2 /1 this is -2 now let's confirm it using direct substitution using the original expression so one from the left that's like 99 so 9^ 2 -1 / the absolute value of 99 -1 99 2 minus one is about 0199 099 minus 1 is01 but with the absolute value it changes to positive 01 and if we divide those two numbers this will equal 1.99 which rounds to -2 so on the right side it was pos2 but as X approaches 1 from the left side it's -2 therefore this limit does not exist
