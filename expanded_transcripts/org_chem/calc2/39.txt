Transcript for: Infinite Limits and Vertical Asymptotes
now let's talk about infinite limits what is the limit as x approaches zero of the function one over x what's the answer to that well first what we need to do is check the limit at the left side and the right side so let's start the left side what is one divided by negative point one one divided by negative point one is negative ten but now let's plug in a number that's even close to zero from the left side so it's going to be negative again let's try negative point zero one one divided by negative point zero one is negative a hundred and if we divide it by negative point zero zero one that becomes negative 1000 notice that the number gets larger and larger but with a negative sign so therefore we could say that this approaches negative infinity now what about the right sided limit what is the limit as x approaches zero from the right one over positive point one is ten one over point zero one is a hundred and one divided by point zero zero one is positive one thousand as you can see the number gets larger and larger so this is going to approach positive infinity now generally speaking whenever you have a small number basically zero from the right side whenever you have a small number in the denominator it makes the value of the fraction large so this is equivalent to positive infinity now keep in mind if it's exactly zero it's undefined so it really doesn't exist but if it's close to zero that means it's going to be very large so whenever you have one and zero from the left it's going to be negative infinity so just some things to keep in mind so now let's finish this question since these two limits do not match the left side and the right side therefore the limit as x approaches zero from either side does not exist now let's try another problem what is the limit as x approaches zero from either side of 1 divided by x squared so let's evaluate it as x approaches 0 from the left side so if we plug in 0 from the left we're still going to get a small number but it's going to be positive so you could treat it as 0 from the right and this is going to become positive infinity so for example let's say if we plug in negative point zero one negative point zero one squared is actually positive 0.0001 and 1 divided by that number is positive 10 000. you could type it in your calculator just to confirm it so that's why we got positive infinity now what about the limit as x approaches zero from the right so if we plug in zero from the right once we square it it's still going to be a positive number so it's still going to be small it's going to be very close to 0 but it's going to be positive and this is going to be positive infinity therefore the limit i mean excuse me the limit as x approaches 0 from the right from either side rather is going to be positive infinity the number is going to get larger and larger and larger so that's the answer as x approaches 0 from either side now let's move on to another example what is the limit as x approaches 2 from the left of 1 over x minus 2. go ahead and try that problem now let's use direct substitution let's plug in a number that's less than two less than two would be like one point nine one point nine minus two is negative point one and this is going to be negative 10. now if we try 1.99 on the bottom we're going to get negative 0.01 and that's going to be negative 100. so we can see that we're going to get a negative zero or zero from the left on the bottom so this is going to approach negative infinity and this is the answer for this one-sided limit what is the limit as x approaches three from the right of five divided by x minus three let's go ahead and evaluate this one so three from the right we can plug in 3.1 3.1 minus 3 is 0.1 5 divided by 0.1 is 50. so notice that we have a very large positive value so therefore the limit as x approaches 3 from the right of 5 divided by x minus 3 this is going to be positive infinity anytime you get a 0 on the bottom it's either going to be plus or minus infinity in this case since we have a 0 from the right it's positive infinity now what about the limit as x approaches negative 4 from the left of 15 divided by x plus four try that so let's plug in a number that's close to negative four from the left so here's negative four to the left of it is negative 5. so we want to plug in a number like negative 4.1 negative 4.1 plus 4 that's negative 0.1 and 150 divided by negative 0.1 is negative 150. so we get a very large negative value so we could say that this limit approaches negative infinity what about the limit as x approaches 2 from the right let's say this is x minus 2 with a negative 8 on top what's the answer so negative 8 divided by two from the right minus two this is going to give us a zero from the right so having zero from the right that's gonna be like negative or positive infinity so it's like negative eight times positive infinity which in the end will be negative infinity but let's actually plug in a number to confirm it so 2 to the right let's plug in a number that's bigger than 2 so 2.1 could be a good example 2.1 minus 2 is positive 0.1 negative 8 divided by positive 0.1 is negative 80. so we have a very large negative number which means the limit approaches negative infinity now what about this one what is the limit as x approaches one from either side of one divided by x minus one so let's evaluate it from the left side first so as x approaches 1 from the left what is it going to be well we can approximate it by plugging a number that's less than one let's try 0.9 0.9 minus 1 that's negative 0.1 so this is negative 10. so we know that this is going to be equal to a large negative number so we can say that the limit as x approaches 1 from the left is going to be negative infinity now let's check the right side as x approaches 1 from the right so we can approximate it using 1.1 so this is going to be positive 0.1 1 divided by positive 0.1 is positive 10. so therefore this limit is going to approach positive infinity now these two limits do not match so this limit does not exist here's another one that you can try the limit as x approaches 2 from the right of x cubed divided by x minus 2 raised to the second power try that so we can plug in 2 on top on the bottom we need to plug in 2.1 we have to plug in a number that's close to 2 but to the right of 2. 2.1 minus 2 that's going to be like 0.1 0.1 squared that's 0.01 so what we need to take from this is we're going to get a very large positive number so therefore this is going to approach positive infinity let's say if you plug in 2.01 instead 2.01 to the 3rd power that's about 8.12 and if you divide it by 2.01 minus 2 squared this is going to be a very large positive number so in the end we can see that this is going to approach positive infinity now what about the limit as x approaches 3 from either side of this function well if we plug in 3 this is we're going to have a 0 in the bottom so we know it's either going to be positive infinity or negative infinity so we just got to check the sign so let's start with the right side on the right side we need to plug in a number that's bigger than three three point one minus three is a positive number and point one squared is point zero one one divided by point zero one is a hundred times eight that's going to be positive eight hundred so on the right side it approaches positive infinity on the left side if we plug in a number that's let's say less than three like two point nine two point nine minus one i mean two point nine minus three is a negative 0.1 but when you square a negative 0.1 you're going to get positive 0.01 so you're going to get the same value positive 800. so therefore these two limits they match so the limit as x approaches 3 from either side approaches positive infinity due to the square everything is going to be positive what is the limit as x approaches negative 3 from the left given this expression x plus 3 divided by x squared plus x minus 6. in this example the first thing we need to do is factor what two numbers multiply to negative six but add to the middle coefficient of one this is going to be positive three and negative two so x squared plus x minus six is equivalent to x plus 3 and x minus 2. now if we plug in negative 3 now negative 3 plus 3 will give us a 0 on the bottom but because it cancels we can use direct substitution in this problem so all we got to do is replace x with negative three so it's gonna be negative three minus two which is negative five so the answer is one divided by negative five here's another one what is the limit as x approaches five from either side of x squared divided by x squared plus 25 go ahead and work on this problem now if we plug in five we won't get a zero on the bottom so in this example we can use direct substitution five squared or five times five is twenty five twenty five plus twenty five is fifty and twenty five divided by fifty is one half so this is the answer now what is the limit as x approaches 0 from the left of the expression 2 minus 1 divided by x so go ahead and try that so let's start with this term what's the limit as x approaches 0 from the left of positive 1 over x we know that 0 from the left this is going to be negative infinity so if we have negative 1 over x this will change to positive infinity so this becomes 2 plus positive infinity which in the end will be positive infinity and let's try plugging in a small number let's try plugging in negative point zero one one divided by negative 0.01 that's going to be negative 100 so 2 minus negative 100 that's going to be 102. so we have a very large positive number which tells us that this limit is going to approach positive infinity now what about the limit as x approaches zero from the right of the natural log function l and x what is the answer it helps to know the graph of l and x ln one is zero by the way it has the vertical asymptote at zero so it looks like this so as you approach zero which is the y axis from the right notice that it goes down to negative infinity and if you have a calculator you can confirm it let's say if you plug in ln 0.1 this is equal to negative 2.3 now let's plug in ln point zero zero zero one so it has to be from the right side so it has to be positive this is going to equal negative nine point two so notice that we get a larger negative let's plug in a very very small number one times ten to negative fifty so that's like point zero zero zero zero zero almost fifty times and then a one is negative 115. so slowly becomes more negative as we can see so that's why it approaches negative infinity now what about the limit as x approaches zero from the left of ln x notice that there's nothing on the left side so therefore this limit does not exist if you were to type in ln negative 0.1 in your calculator you're going to get a math error that means that it doesn't exist you can't have a negative number inside a natural log so therefore the limit as x approaches 0 from either side of ln x also does not exist because the left side does not exist but the right side it approaches negative infinity now what is the limit as x approaches zero of tangent x let's go over some trigonometric functions now for this we can use direct substitution tangent of zero is 0. now let's say if we change it what if x approached pi over 2 and we still have the tangent function what's the answer now tangent pi over 2 is undefined so we can't just use direct substitution so therefore we need to check the left and the right side so let's start with the right side of tangent so let's approach pi over 2 from the right pi over 2 is basically equivalent to 90 degrees so if you want to plug in a number that's close to 90 from the right side we need to try 90.1 now feel free to put your calculator in degree mode tangent 90.1 is about negative 573 if you round it to nearest whole number tan 90.01 is negative seven hundred and thirty so therefore we can see that it's approaching negative infinity it's becoming more negative as we get closer to 90. and it makes sense because 90.1 is located in quadrant two and tangent is negative in quadrant two the limit as x approaches pi over 2 from the left now let's say if we plug in 89.9 tangent 89.9 is positive 573. so we can see that this is going to approach positive infinity so these two limits they they don't match they're different so therefore the limit as x approaches pi over 2 of tangent x does not exist so anytime you see tangent just keep in mind that you can replace it with sine divided by cosine and notice that if you plug in pi over two sine pi over two is equal to one and cosine pi over two is zero anytime you get a zero on the bottom it's undefined so that's a clue that you need to check the left side and the right side of limits as well so that limit does not exist now what about this one what is the limit as x approaches 0 from the right of cosecant x now keep in mind cosecant is one over sine and sine of zero is zero one over zero is undefined but since we're approaching zero chances are our answer is going to be positive or negative infinity so let's find out which one now we'll plug in a number that's greater than zero since it's to the right of zero sine of point one is going to be approximately 0.1 if this is in radian mode sine of 0.1 is about 0.0998 which let's round that to 0.1 and 1 over 0.1 is 10. now if we plug in sine of point zero zero one this answer is going to be approximately about a hundred so therefore the numbers are getting bigger and bigger as we approach zero so we can make the conclusion that the limit as x approaches zero from the right of cosecant is positive infinity now what about the limit as x approaches pi over two of secant x let's try that so secant is one over cosine and if we plug in pi over two cosine pi over two is zero so it's undefined so as we approach pi over two if we analyze the left and right side limits it's either going to be positive infinity or negative infinity so let's start with the right side so cosine of 90.1 is that a positive value or negative value 90.1 is in quadrant two and cosine is negative so therefore we can make the conclusion that this is going to be negative infinity if you plug in one make sure your calculator is in radian mode or rather degree mode if you plug in one divided by cosine 90.1 you're going to get negative 573. now on the left side of pi over two that's 89.9 the angle is in quadrant one cosine is positive in quadrant one so we could say this is going to approach positive infinity so since these do not match we could say that the limit as x approaches pi over 2 from either side does not exist now here's the last question related to this section what is the limit as x approaches positive 4 from the right of 1 divided by the square root of x minus 2. so if we plug in 4 the square root of 4 is 2 2 minus 2 is 0 1 over 0 is undefined but since it approaches 4 and it doesn't equal 4 it's either going to be positive or negative infinity so let's substitute x with 4.1 the square root of 4.1 is going to be a number that's just above 2. so let's make a number let's say 2.1 let's say if we don't have access to a calculator it's probably going to be less than 2.1 1 divided by 0.1 is 10. so this is a relatively large positive number the actual value of the square root of 4.1 is 2.02 5. and this is actually 40. so this is definitely a bad estimate but this will lead us to the same final answer and that is since we're getting a large positive number we could say that the limit approaches positive infinity and that is the answer to the question so a lot of these problems you can use direct substitution to get the answer just make sure you plug in a number that's close to the value that x is approaching and it's always going to work if you do it that way now let's talk about how to find the vertical asymptote of a function so let's say if we have the function one over x plus two what is the vertical asymptote to find it set the denominator equal to zero so the vertical asymptote is going to be x is equal to negative two so let's try some more examples what is the vertical asymptote in this case so if we set x minus three equal to zero the vertical asymptote is x equals three here's another example let's say if the function is x minus five divided by x minus five over x plus three and if we have another one let's say seven x plus one over x minus two x plus one what are the vertical asymptotes so looking at the factor in the bottom x plus one we just need to change the sign so the vertical asymptote is going to be x equals negative one and for the factor x minus two the vertical asymptotes can be x equals plus two simply reverse the sign now for the next one for the factor x plus 3 is going to be x is equal to negative 3. x minus 5 will not lead to a vertical asymptote because it can be cancelled so x equals 5 is a whole everything else are vertical asymptotes what about this one 1 divided by x squared minus four what are the vertical asymptotes found in this rational function so what we need to do is factor using the difference of perfect squares technique the square root of x squared is x and the square root of four is two and so it's going to be x plus two and x minus two so we can see that the vertical asymptotes are x equals negative two and x equals positive two so sometimes you need to factor in order to find it here's another example in which you need to factor so how can we factor x squared minus x minus two what two numbers multiply to negative two but add up to negative one this is going to be negative two and one so to factor it it's simply x minus two and x plus one so therefore the vertical asymptotes are x is equal to positive 2 and negative 1. now for the sake of practice let's try one more example try this one so take a minute pause the video and work on it so we need to factor everything completely in the numerator we could take out an x which will leave behind x minus two in a denominator we can factor using the difference of perfect squares the square root of x to the fourth is x squared and the square root of 16 is four now we can't factor x squared plus four without using imaginary numbers but we can factor x squared minus four because we did it in the last example and we know it's x plus two times x minus two so this factor leads to a whole so we have a hole at x equals positive two this one leads to the vertical asymptote which is x equals negative two now let's talk about the other factor that was in the denominator and that is x squared plus four notice that there's no vertical asymptotes or holes associated with this if we set it equal to zero we need to subtract both sides by four and so x squared is going to equal negative 4 and if we take the square root of both sides we're not going to get a real number keep in mind the square root of negative 1 is i so this is going to be plus or minus the square root of 4 is 2 times the square root of negative 1 which is i so you get positive 2i and negative 2i these are not real numbers they're imaginary numbers so they don't represent any holes or vertical asymptotes so that's why we could ignore x squared plus 4.
