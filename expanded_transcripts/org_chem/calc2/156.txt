Transcript for: Evaluating Definite Integrals Using Geometry
in this video we're gonna focus on evaluating definite integrals using geometry so what is the value of this definite integral now the first thing we need to do is graph the function so y is equal to 8 basically that's a horizontal line at 8 and we're interested in the interval from 1 to 4 so let's shade the region bounded by the line y equals 8 and the lines x equals 1 and x equals 4 the value of the definite integral is the area of the shaded region so make sure you know this the area is equal to the definite integral of f of X from A to B so basically we need to find the area of this rectangle so it has a width of 4 minus 3 which is I mean 4 minus 1 which is 3 and then the height is 8 so the area of a rectangle I have times the width so that's going to be 3 times 8 or 8 times 3 which is 24 now let's go ahead and confirm this answer by evaluating this definite integral so the antiderivative of 8 is 8 X evaluated from 1 to 4 so it's gonna be 8 times 4 minus 8 times 1 8 times 4 is 32 8 times 1 is 8 32 minus 8 is 24 so as you can see we get the same answer now let's try another example go ahead and use geometry to evaluate this definite integral so let's begin by graphing 2x from 0 to 2 so basically it's a straight line with a slope of 2 so let's say this is 0 and this is 4 now when X is 4 y which is equal to 2x that's going to have a y-value of 8 so we need to determine the area of the shaded region so basically we need to determine the area of a right triangle so we have a base of 4 and the height of 8 the area of a right triangle is 1/2 base times height so the base is 4 pi is 8 half of 4 is 2 2 times 8 is 16 so the area of the shaded region is 16 square units now let's go ahead and evaluate the definite integral let's see if we're going to get the same answer so the antiderivative of x is x squared divided by 2 let's evaluate it from 0 to 4 so 2 divided by 2 is 1 so that cancels and then if we plug in the upper limit first is going to be 4 squared and then for the lower limit minus 0 squared 4 squared is 16 16 minus 0 is 16 and so as you can see the answer is indeed the same now let's move on to number three use geometry to evaluate this integral and then confirm your answer by evaluating the definite integral so we can see that in this example y is equal to 3x plus 2 so let's begin by graphing 3x plus 2 so this is in slope-intercept form Y is equal to MX plus B and B the y-intercept is 2 so the graph is going to start at you and it's gonna have a slope of 3 so it's gonna go up at an increasing rate however we want the Y values when X is 1 and 5 so at 1 it's gonna be 3 times 1 plus 2 so the value is gonna be 5 at 0 is 2 now at 5 it's going to be 3 times 5 plus 2 which is 17 which is going to be very high but let's say and that point corresponds to 17 we just need the important points the graph doesn't have to be perfect so we need to find the area of the shaded region so how can we do that when you see a composite shape like this you need to break it down into its fundamental shapes so we can break it down into a rectangle and a triangle now what we need to do is determine the dimensions of each figure so for the rectangle 5 minus 1 is 4 so it has a whiff of 4 now we can see that it's 5 unit I this is 0-2 the rectangle it's 4 by 5 4 times 5 is 20 that's the area of the rectangle now for the triangle it has a base of 4 the same as the rectangle but the height is the difference between 17 and 5 which is 12 so 4 times 12 is 48 but half of that is 24 because of the triangle is 1/2 base times height so adding these two values 20 plus 24 this is going to equal to 44 now let's confirm it once to make sure we did everything correctly so the antiderivative of 3 X plus 2 is going to be 3 x squared divided by 2 plus 2 X evaluated from 1 to 5 so let's plug in 5 first so it's 3 times 5 squared over 2 plus 2 times 5 and then minus if we plug in 1 we'll get that five squared is 25 25 times 3 is 75 and 2 times 5 is 10 and then minus 3 over 2 and this is 2 times 1 which is 2 but there's a negative sign in front of it 75 minus 3 is 72 so we have 72 divided by 2 10 minus 2 is 8 and 72 divided by 2 is 36 36 Plus 8 is 44 so that means that we did this problem correctly let's move on to our next example let's use an absolute value function 3 minus the absolute value of x go ahead and try that so first we need to plot the function so the absolute value of X looks like this it's a v-shape and it opens upward now the absolute value for negative x it opens downward and this has been shifted up three units so we're gonna start at three and then it's gonna look like this now we want to find the value of the integral from negative two to two so we only want in this region so how can we find the area of the shaded region so what we need to do is break it up into two parts a rectangle and a triangle so what are the dimensions of the rectangle and a triangle so 2 minus negative 2 that's 4 so the base of the rectangle and the triangle is 4 now what about the height of the rectangle so what is the Y value at this point when X is 2 3 minus 2 is 1 so the Y value is 1 if you plug in negative 2 it's gonna be the same so the height of the rectangle is 1 and the height of the triangle is gonna be 3 minus 1 which is 2 so now we can calculate the area of this composite figure so 1 times 4 is 4 and for the triangle it's going to be 1/2 base times height the base of the triangle is 4 and the height is 2 half of 4 is 2 2 times 2 is 4 so we're gonna add 4 plus 4 and that gives us a total area of 8 now let's see if we can get the answer so how can we evaluate the definite integral when it has an absolute value function now going back to the graph you need to write two separate functions in order to evaluate it now the absolute value of X can equal two things it can equal positive x or it can equal negative x if you solve it on the inside because the absolute value of a negative number like let's say negative 5 is 5 and the absolute value of 5 is 5 so let's say if the absolute value of x is 8 that means that X can equal 8 or negative 8 they will both give you an output of 8 so there's two parts to this the graph the left side and the right side one side is going to be 3 minus positive x which is just 3 minus X and the other side is gonna be 3 minus negative X which is 3 plus X so you need to replace this expression with X and negative x now 3 plus X that has a positive slope so that's going to be the left side because as you go from left to right this graph is going in the upward direction so that's the graph of 3 plus X and the right side and notice it has a negative slope is going down so that's going to be the graph of 3 minus X so we need to split the integral into 2 parts for the left side and the right side now we need to go from negative 2 to 2 so from negative 2 to 0 the left side we're going to integrate 3 plus X and then from 0 2 to the right side we're going to integrate 3 minus X let me get rid of this now the antiderivative of 3 is 3x and the antiderivative of X is x squared divided by 2 evaluated from negative 2 to 0 and so we're gonna have 3x again but this time negative x squared over 2 evaluated from 0 to 2 so first let's plug in 0 3 times 0 plus 0 squared over 2 all of that is going to be 0 and then let's plug in negative 2 on the right side let's plug in 2 so we have 3 times 2 minus 2 squared over 2 and then minus if we plug in 0 everything is going to be 0 so three times negative two is negative six plus there's a negative sign in front so that's positive 6 negative 2 squared is 4 times 2 that's 2 and then with this negative sign that's going to be negative 2 and then we have 3 times 2 which is 6 and then negative 2 squared over 2 that's going to be minus 2 so 6 plus 6 is 12 4 negative 2 minus 2 is 4 12 minus 4 is 8 and so as you can see we get the same answer let's try one last problem go ahead and find the value of this definite integral now perhaps you've noticed that we can't integrate this using conventional techniques at least we can't use the techniques that we've learned so far so we need to use geometry to get the answer that's the only way now you need to be familiar with the standard equation of a circle x squared plus y squared is equal to R squared and let's solve for y so let's subtract both sides by x squared so Y squared is R squared minus x squared and if we take the square root of both sides we'll get this equation but whenever you take the square root you can have a positive answer or a negative answer now when dealing with a circle there's two parts to a circle the top half and the bottom half this equation at the beginning corresponds to the entire circle the bottom part it's below the x-axis so that's going to be negative R squared minus x squared the top part is going to be positive square root R squared minus x squared now looking at this function there's no negative sign in front of it and what do we have a plus or minus sign it's simply positive so what we have is a semicircle from negative 4 to 4 so we've got to find the area of the shaded region so we've got to find the area of half a circle as opposed to a full circle the area of a circle is PI R squared so for semicircle is going to be 1/2 PI R squared now we need to know what the radius of the circle is notice that 16 is equal to R squared so R is gonna be 4 and also you can see it here this is 4 which means this must be 4 as well so the area is going to be 1/2 pi times 4 squared 4 squared is 16 half of 16 is 8 so the area is 8 pi and so that's how you can evaluate this particular definite integral you need to realize that this function represents the shape of a semicircle not the whole circle but just the upper half and so knowing that you can use geometry to get the answer
