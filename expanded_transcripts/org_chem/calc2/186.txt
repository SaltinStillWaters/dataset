Transcript for: Reduction Formulas For Integration
how can we find the indefinite integral of sine squared of x dx using the reduction formula for sine now here's the formula that you need to use the integral of sine raised to the n of x dx it's negative one over n cosine x sine to the n minus one power of x plus n minus 1 over n times the integral of sine raised to the n minus 2 power of x dx so in this problem we can see that n is equal to two so using the formula it's going to be negative one over n or negative one over two cosine x sine n minus one or two minus one which is one so we could simply say sine x plus n minus one over n so that's two minus one over two which is one over two integral sine n minus two so two minus two is zero anything raised to the zero power is one so this becomes one dx now the integral of one dx is simply x so we get this answer this is going to be one half x plus c now you can leave your answer like this or you can adjust it if you wish to adjust that you need to be familiar with the double angle formula for sine sine two x is two sine x cosine x so if we divide by two one half sine x i mean one half sine two x is sine x times cosine x so what we're gonna do is we're gonna replace sine x cosine x with a half sine two x so this is gonna be negative one-half times one-half sine 2x plus half of x plus c and so i'm going to write the final answer like this so it's going to be one half x and then a half times a half is one fourth but there's a negative sign in front of it so it's negative one fourth sine two x plus c so this is the anti-derivative of sine squared x you can write your answer like that or you could write it like this if you want to let's try another example what is the antiderivative of cosine cubed of x dx using the reduction formula for cosine so let's start with the formula cosine raised to the n of x dx is equal to 1 over n cosine to the n minus 1 of x times sine x plus n minus 1 over n integral cosine n minus 2 of x dx so in this problem n is equal to 3. so this is going to equal one over n or one over three cosine n minus one three minus one is two and then times sine x and then we have n minus one over n so three minus one over three that's going to be two over three integral cosine and minus two three minus two is one and so we have one third now i'm going to replace cosine squared with 1 minus sine squared i'll do that later but for now we have cosine squared times sine x and the integral of cosine is sine so if you want to you can leave your answer like this but what i'm going to do is i'm going to adjust it i'm going to replace cosine squared with 1 minus sine squared and then i'm going to distribute 1 3 sine x to 1 minus sine squared so it's going to be 1 3 times 1 times sine x so that's simply 1 3 sine x and then it's one-third times negative sine squared times sine x which is negative one-third sine to the third power of x and then we have everything else so now let's combine like terms we can combine these two and one over three plus two over three is three over three and three divided by three is one so the final answer is going to be sine x minus one third sine cubed x plus c and so this is the indefinite integral of cosine cube x dx so you can leave your answer like this or you can write it in this form if you want to now let's try one more problem let's integrate sine to the fourth x dx using the reduction formula for sine so first let's rewrite the formula this is what we had at the beginning it was negative 1 over n cosine and then times sine n minus 1 plus n minus 1 over n integral sine n minus 2 x dx so we can clearly see that n is 4 in this problem so it's going to be negative 1 over n or negative 1 over 4 cosine x and then sine n minus 1 or 4 minus 1 which is three and then n minus one that's four minus one again that's three over n which is four integral sine n minus two so four minus two is two so right now we have negative one over four cosine x sine cube x plus three over four and earlier in this video we said that the integral of sine squared was one half x minus one fourth sine two x and of course plus c so let's distribute the three-fourths to everything inside here so it's negative one-fourth cosine x sine cubed and then three over four times one over two that's gonna be three over eight and then three-fourths times one-fourth that's three over sixteen sine two x plus c so this is the answer if you want to leave it in that form now i'm going to adjust the answer i'm going to simplify it using the double angle formula for sine so recall that we said that sine x cosine x is one half sine two x so i'm going to rewrite sine cube as sine x times sine squared and everything else i'm just gonna keep it the same for now now let's replace sine cosine with one half sine x so i have negative one fourth times one half sine two x and then i'm going to replace sine squared with something i'm going to use the double angle formula for cosine or you could say the power reducing formula for sine squared so you need to know that sine squared is equal to one half and then it's one minus cosine two x so that's the power reducing formula for sine squared and then everything else will be the same so now i have a 4 times a 2 times a 2. four times two is eight times two is sixteen so this is negative one over sixteen and then sine two x times one minus cosine two x and then everything else now i need to distribute negative 1 over 16 sine 2x to 1 minus cosine 2x so when we multiply it by 1 it's just going to be negative 1 over 16 sine 2x and then if we multiply it by negative cosine x is going to be positive 1 over 16 sine 2x cosine 2x now let's combine like terms negative 1 over 16 minus 3 over 16 that's going to be negative 4 over 16 sine 2x now earlier we said that sine x cosine x is one half sine two x so therefore sine two x cosine two x must be one half sine four x so if we double x to two x then two x has to be double to four x so let's replace sine two x cosine 2x with half of sine 4x now let's put this in order so we have 3 over 8 x and then 4 over 16 we can reduce that to negative 1 over 4 sine 2x and then 1 over 16 times 1 over 2 that's 1 over 32 sine 4x and then plus c so this is another way in which you could represent the answer so this is the integral of sine to the fourth x you
