Transcript for: dy/dx, d/dx, and dy/dt - Derivative Notations in Calculus
in this video i kind of want to discuss the difference between dydx and also d over dx because when dealing with derivatives typically you'll see these two things and you might be wondering what to do when you see them well let's say that y is equal to x cubed plus 4x what does it mean when you see dydx in a problem like this and sometimes you'll see this d of dx and then x cubed plus 4x squared so what's the difference well here's the way i like to think about it dydx kind of tell me what it is d over dx tells me what to do d over ds expresses a command it's basically saying hey find the derivative of whatever is inside of here with respect to x d y over dx tells you hey this is the derivative of some function in this case y the derivative of y with respect to x is 3x squared plus 8x and in this case this expression tells us to differentiate this expression which will be the same thing 3x squared plus 8x so hopefully that kind of help you to see the difference between the two so d over dx tells you what to do it tells you to differentiate the function inside the brackets with respect to x d y d x simply makes a statement it tells you that the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to whatever you see here now let's see if we can put this together d y over dx is equivalent to saying take the derivative of y with respect to x and we could replace y with this expression y is x cubed plus 4x squared using the power rule this is going to give us 3x squared plus 8x which as we can see that's equal to dy over dx so hopefully that connected everything together when you see these two things now if we want to find the derivative of x cubed with respect to x we know it's 3x squared but what if we want to find the derivative of let's say y cubed with respect to x what's the answer well using the power rule it's going to be 3y squared but notice that these variables do not match so we're going to have something else it's going to be 3y squared times dy over dx typically you'll see problems like this when dealing with something called implicit differentiation now what if we want to differentiate let's say x to the fifth power with respect to some variable s this would be 5x to the fourth times dx ds so that's the derivative of x with respect to s now sometimes when dealing with related rates problems you'll see d over dt so you're differentiating with respect to time so you could differentiate with respect to many things you could differentiate with respect to x with respect to some other variable s or with respect to t so let's say if we want to differentiate x to the fourth power plus y cubed with respect to time it's going to be 4x cubed plus 3y squared actually let's take that back it's 4x cubed times dx dt and then plus 3y squared times dydt so dx dt is the derivative of x with respect to time d y dt is the derivative of y with respect to time so i don't know if you've covered related rates yet but you'll see that a lot when dealing with that topic okay time for a pop quiz let's see if you been paying attention let's say that r is a function of x and t and that r is equal to x cubed plus t to the fifth power go ahead and find d r over d y feel free to pause the video if you want to try this problem so what we're doing is we're going to take the derivative of r with respect to y so that's what we're going to do in order to find this thing and so we're going to replace r with what it equals so right now think about what this is telling us to do this is saying differentiate this expression with respect to y the derivative of x cubed with respect to y is 3x squared times d dx over d y and the derivative of t to the fifth power with respect to y is five t to the fourth power times dt over d y so that's our answer so that's we could say that d r over d y is equal to three x squared d x over d y plus five t to the fourth times d dt over d y so this tells us what to do this tells us what the answer is so hopefully you can see the difference between these two expressions and that's basically it for this video i'm out hopefully you found it to be helpful thanks again for watching
