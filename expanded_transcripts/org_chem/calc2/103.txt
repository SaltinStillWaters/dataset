in this video we're going to go over related rate problems dealing with circles spheres the inflated balloon and the melting snowball problem so let's start with this one the radius of a circle is increasing at five centimeters per minute how fast is the circumference of the circle changing when the radius is ten so let's write down what we know so r the radius is equal to ten centimeters and the rate at which the radius of the circle is changing that's going to be dr dt that's positive 5 centimeters per minute it's positive because the radius is increasing our goal in part a is to find the rate at which the circumference is changing so looking for dc dt now the first thing we need to do is come up with an equation that has r dr dt dc dt so what equation can you come up with the circumference of a circle is c is equal to 2 pi r now we need to get dc dt so let's differentiate this equation with respect to time the derivative of c is one but times d c d t two pi is a constant so we could just rewrite that based on the constant multiple rule the derivative of r is 1 but times d r dt so we have everything that we need we really don't need r in this example dr dt is 5 and so dc dt is going to be 2 pi times 5 so it's going to be 10 pi centimeters per minute that's the rate at which the circumference is changing and because it's positive the circumference of the circle is increasing now let's move on to part b how fast is the area of the circle changing when the radius is eight centimeters so r is now eight it's no longer ten so let's get rid of this number but dr dt is still five centimeters per minute and our goal is to calculate d80t the rate at which the area of the circle is changing so the equation that connects a and r is the area of a circle the area of a circle is pi r squared so now let's differentiate this equation with respect to time the derivative of a is one but times d a dt pi is a constant so let's rewrite that the derivative of r squared is two r but times d r dt so we have two pi times the radius which is currently eight centimeters and then dr dt that's five centimeters per minute so now let's calculate d80t two times five is 10 and 10 times 8 is 80 times pi so this is going to be 80 pi now for the units we have centimeters times centimeters so that's square centimeters and we have minutes on the bottom so dt is going to be square centimeters per minute so this is the answer area is always in square units and dt is always going to have some unit of time seconds minutes hours whatever you see here number two air is pumped into a spherical balloon at a rate of 450 cubic centimeters per minute how fast is the radius of the balloon changing when r is 10 so once again let's make a list of what we know so the radius is 10 centimeters and the rate at which air is being pumped into the balloon we have 450 cubic centimeters per minute now what do you think that represents now centimeters is basically a unit of length it could be radius it could be height square centimeters would be a unit of area but cubic meters represents a volume so this quantity is the rate at which the volume of the balloon is changing so that's dv dt and because air is being pumped into the balloon the balloon is expanding so the volume is increasing so it has to be positive 450 and not negative 450. how fast is the radius of the balloon changing so we need to calculate dr dt so what equation will connect the radius with the volume now we're dealing with a spherical balloon or a sphere and the volume of a sphere is four thirds pi r cubed now let's take the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to time the derivative of v is one but times dv dt four thirds pi is a constant so let's rewrite that the derivative of r cubed is three r squared and then times d r dt so on the right side we can cancel a three so we don't have to worry about that and we're looking to calculate dv dt actually no we have dv dt i take that back we need to calculate the rdt dv dt is 450 and that's equal to 4 pi times r squared and r squared is r is 10 so if we square that that's going to be a hundred so on the right we have 10 squared which is a hundred times four pi so that's 400 pi so 450 is equal to 400 pi times dr dt so let's divide both sides by 400 pi so now we need to simplify this expression we can cancel a zero 450 over 400 is the same as 45 over 40. now 45 is basically 9 times 5 and 40 is eight times five so we can cancel a five therefore the final answer is going to be nine over eight pi so let me just rewrite that here because i am running out of space dr dt is equal to positive 9 over 8 pi centimeters per minute that's the answer number three the surface area of a spherical melting snowball is decreasing at a rate of two square centimeters per minute find a rate at which the diameter is changing when the radius of the snowball is five centimeters so we have r the radius is five and we have the rate at which the surface area is changing so that's going to be dsa dt and it's decreasing at 2 square centimeters per minute so that's going to be negative 2cm squared per minute our goal is to find the rate at which the diameter is changing so we need to find dd dt where capital d will use that to represent the diameter the diameter is always going to be twice the radius so if r is 5 the diameter has to be 10 centimeters somehow we need to relate the surface area of the sphere to the diameter how can we do so the surface area of a sphere is equal to 4 pi r squared and we know that d is equal to 2r so solving for r dividing both sides by 2 we can say that d divided by 2 is equal to r so now let's replace r with d over 2. so this is going to be d squared over four now we can cancel the four so we're left with the surface area is pi times d squared so now we could differentiate this equation with respect to time so we're going to have on the left dsa dt and that's equal to pi now the derivative of d squared is 2d times d dt so we have dsa dt that's negative 2 and we have the value of d which is 10 centimeters and so let's calculate the rate at which the diameter is changing so first let's get rid of some stuff now if we divide both sides by 2 these will be canceled so what we now have is negative 1 is equal to 10 pi times d dt so dividing both sides by 10 pi we're going to get our final answer so the rate at which the diameter is changing is negative 1 over 10 pi with the units centimeters per minute and that's it for this problem so that's it for this whole video hopefully it gave you a good idea of how to solve basic related rates problems you
