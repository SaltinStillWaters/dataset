consider this problem how can we estimate 2.99 raised to the fourth power now we know the answer is close to three to the fourth power three to the fourth is 81. but what's 2.99 raised to the fourth power we know it's less than 81 but how can we get a good approximation of the answer without a calculator well let's talk about it first we need to know what function is associated with this expression so f of x would equal what function all you need to do is replace 2.99 with x and you get this function x to the fourth power and then you want to pick a value for x where it's very close to 2.99 so therefore we're going to say 3. and what you need to do is write the tangent line equation at x equals three and then use that equation to approximate this value so we're going to use the point slope formula y minus y one is equal to m times x minus x one we already have x one x one is three we need to calculate y one which is going to be f of three which is three to the fourth and so that's eighty one so y one is going to be eighty one now we need to calculate the slope which we could find using the first derivative so f prime of x using the power rule that's going to be 4 x to the third power so f prime of 3 is four times three to the third power so three to the third as 27 and 27 times four well twenty times four is eighty four times seven is twenty eight 80 plus 28 is 108 so this is equal to the slope when x is string so now we have x1 y1 and the slope m so let's plug it into this equation so it's going to be y minus y 1 which is equal to m times x minus x1 now the next thing that we need to do is add 81 to both sides so we need to take this number move it to the other side so it's going to be 81 plus 108 times x minus 3. we really don't need to distribute the 108 so i'm going to leave it in this form so this is the tangent line equation at x equals 3. now what we're going to do is plug in this value replace x with 2.99 and that is going to give us the approximation of this expression so replacing x with 2.99 we have 2.99 minus 3 which is negative 0.01 now 108 times negative 0.01 you just got to move the decimal 2 units to the left that's going to be 1.08 but negative so what's 81 minus 1.08 so this is going to be 81 minus one minus point zero eight eighty one minus one is eighty and a hundred minus point zero eight is ninety two so eighty minus point zero eight is going to be seventy nine point two because you have to take away one from 80. and so this is going to be the approximation so we're saying that 2.99 to the fourth power is approximately equal to 79.92 now let's get the exact answer using the calculator let's see how close we are so the exact answer is 79.9253 so that's pretty close let's try this one estimate the square root of 9.1 so first we need to identify the function the function is going to be the square root of x and now let's find the first derivative so this is x raised to the one-half and that's going to be one-half x to the negative one-half which we can rewrite as one over 2 square root x now x we could say is 9 because 9 is close to 9.1 so now let's evaluate f of nine f of nine is going to be the square root of nine which is three so if x one is nine y one is three now we need to calculate the slope which is going to be f prime of three i mean f prime of nine i'll take that back so that's 1 over 2 square root 9. and the square root of 9 is 3 2 times 3 is 6 so it's 1 over 6. so the slope when x is nine is one over six so once you have these three things x one y one and a slope you can now write the tangent line equation so it's going to be y minus y1 is equal to m times x minus x1 so y1 is 3 m is 1 over 6. x one is nine and then let's add three to both sides so it's three plus one over six times x minus nine so now in this form we can estimate the square root of 9.1 so it's going to be 3 plus 1 over 6 times 9.1 minus 9. nine point one minus nine is point one now what is one divided by six if you're not sure about this you can use long division to convert the fraction into a decimal so let's do that so the numerator has to go on the inside six goes into one zero times so we need a decimal point let's add another zero six goes into ten one time one times six is six so six times point one is point six one minus six is four and then add another zero six goes into forty six times six times six is thirty six this gives us another four and six goes into forty six times and then you can see that it's just going to repeat so it's basically one over six is point one six repeating so we have three plus point one six repeating times point one now whenever you multiply something by 0.1 you need to move the decimal one unit to left so this is going to be 3 plus 0.016 repeating and so the estimation is going to be 3.016 repeating so the square root of 9.1 is approximately 3.016 repeating now let's get the exact answer using a calculator and this is going to be 3.016662 which these two numbers are very close so the tangent line approximation is very useful for estimating things like the square root of 9.1 or the other one 2.99 raised to the fourth power now what's your turn estimate the natural log of 1.1 without a calculator so the function is ln x and the first derivative of l and x is going to be one over x now x one is going to be a number close to one point one so the best answer to use is one because we know the natural log of one so f of one which is ln one the natural log of one is zero which means y one is zero now the first derivative when x is one that's one over one and so that is equal to the slope so m is one so now that we have x one y one and m we can now calculate well we could determine the tangent line function so it's y minus y one equals m times x minus x one so y one is zero m is one and x one is one so basically the tangent line approximation is x minus one so what we need to do is plug in 1.1 so it's going to be 1.1 minus 1 which is 0.1 so therefore we could say that the natural log of 1.1 is approximately 0.1 i'm going to put equal but approximately now let's find a real answer so go ahead and type in ln 1.1 and this is equal to 0.0953 so 0.095 and 0.1 they're pretty close they're not too far off i mean you might have a 5 difference but 0.095 can be rounded to 0.1 you
