Transcript for: Derivatives for Beginners - Basic Introduction
in this video we're going to talk about how to find derivatives so the first thing we're going to talk about is the derivative of a constant what you need to know is that the derivative of any constant is always zero so for example the derivative of seven is zero the derivative of a constant like negative four that's also zero pi is just a number there's no variable to it so the derivative of pi is zero the derivative of pi to the e that's also zero both pi and e they're just a number so if you don't have a variable if you just have a constant the derivative of any constant is always zero now the next thing we need to talk about is something known as the power rule let's say if we have a variable raised to a constant such as x raised to the nth power this is equal to n times x raised to the n minus one so let me give you some examples let's say we want to find the derivative of x to the second power in this case n is 2. this is going to be 2 x raised to the 2 minus 1 which is 2x to the first power in short you need to move the exponent to the front and then subtract this by one so let me give you some more examples let's say we want to find the derivative of x cubed so what we're going to do is move the 3 to the front so it's going to be three x and then we're gonna take away one from three three minus one is two so it's two x squared the derivative of x to the fourth that's to be 4 x cubed and the derivative of x to the fifth power that's 5 x to the fourth power so hopefully you see the pattern here but that's the power rule that's how you can use it so with that in mind what do you think the derivative of 4 x to the fifth power is equal to so this is the same as multiplying four by the derivative of x to the fifth power and we could use the power rule on that part the derivative of x to the fifth power is x to the fourth power and then we could simply multiply four and five and this is going to be 20 x to the fourth power so this is known as the constant multiple rule go ahead and try these two examples the derivative of 6 x to the 8th power and also the derivative of 5 x to the third power so let's start with the first one we're going to rewrite the constant 6 and then multiply by the derivative of x to the 8th power so moving the 8 to the front it's going to be 6 times 8 times x and then we're going to subtract 8 by 1 which is 7 so it's 6 times 8x to the seventh power and then we can multiply 6 by 8 that's going to be 48 times x to the seventh power so that's the answer for the first example for the second one it's going to be 5 times the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared and then 5 times 3 is 15. so the answer is 15 x squared now let's say we have some polynomial function f of x is equal to let's say 4x cubed plus seven x squared minus nine x plus five so what is the derivative of this function by the way the notation for the derivative of a function is f prime of x so if we take the derivative of f of x this is going to equal f prime of x for those of you who might be wondering so for this problem we just got to take it one step at a time first let's find the derivative of 4x cubed it's going to be 4 times the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared and then next we need to find the derivative of 7x squared so it's going to be 7 times the derivative of x squared which is 2x now what about the derivative of negative 9x what is that equal to well first we need to know what the derivative of x is equal to x is the same as x to the first power so using the power rule we can move the exponent to the front it's going to be 1 x and then if we subtract that number by one we get zero anything raised to the zero power is one so the derivative of x for instance is one the derivative of five x is going to be five times one or five the derivative of negative seven x is simply negative seven so the derivative of negative nine x is simply going to be negative nine and we know that the derivative of a constant that is a number without a variable it's always 0. so the answer for this example is going to be 4 times 3 which is 12 7 times 2 is 14. and so it's going to be 12x squared plus 14x minus 9. so that is the derivative of the original function now let's work on finding the derivative of a rational function what is the derivative of 1 over x squared how would you find the answer for this one well it turns out that you could use the power rule but you need to rewrite the expression first the first thing you need to do is move the x variable to the top as you do so the sign of the exponent changes from positive 2 to negative 2. so you can write it like this or you can simply just write it as x to the minus 2. it's the same so now using the power rule we can move the exponent to the front this is going to be negative two x and then we need to subtract the exponent by one negative two minus one is negative three so this is our answer but we can simplify it or rewrite it a bit what you want to do is get rid of the negative exponent so you want to move the x variable back to the bottom thus we're going to have a negative 2 on top and x raised to the positive 3 on the bottom this is the final answer in its simplified form so that's the derivative of 1 over x squared let's try another example what is the derivative of one over x cubed feel free to pause the video if you want to work on it step one we need to rewrite the expression let's move the x variable to the top so this is equal to the derivative of x to the negative three and now let's use the power rule let's move the exponent to the front and so it's gonna be negative three x and then let's subtract that number by one so negative 3 minus 1 is negative 4. finally let's move the x variable back to the bottom and so this is going to be negative 3 over x raised to the fifth power actually i need to make a slight correction that's negative 3 over x to the fourth power that should be a 4. so this is the answer to the problem now let's work on the next problem let's find the derivative of negative six over x to the fifth power go ahead and work on that so like before we're going to move the x variable to the top so the first step is to rewrite the problem so this is going to be negative six x to the negative fifth power over one now let's move the exponent to the front so we're gonna have negative 6 times negative 5 and then it's going to be x and then let's subtract negative 5 by 1. negative 5 minus 1 is negative 6. so what we're going to do next is we're going to move the x variable back to the bottom and we're going to multiply those two numbers negative 6 times negative 5 that's positive 30 and we have x to the 6 on the bottom so this is the derivative of negative 6 over x to the fifth power so now you know how to find the derivative of a rational function let's move on to finding the derivative of a radical function what is the derivative of the square root of x how can we find the answer to that well it's important to know that the exponent is 1 and the index number is 2. so like before we need to rewrite this problem we can rewrite the square root of x as x to the one-half now in this form we could use the power rule so we're going to move the exponent to the front this is going to be one half x and then we're going to subtract the exponent by one so one half minus one we could change one to two over two so it becomes one minus two which is negative one over the same denominator of two so one half minus one is negative a half so now at this point we can rewrite the expression so this is equivalent to saying x raised to the negative one half divided by two and now let's move the exponent i mean the the variable back to the bottom so it's going to be 1 over 2 x to the one half and now at this point we can replace x to the one-half with what we had at the beginning the square root of x so the final answer is 1 over 2 times the square root of x now let's work on this example let's find the derivative of the cube root of x to the fifth power go ahead and take a minute to work on it feel free to pause the video by the way if you want to try any of these examples so let's begin by rewriting the expression the cube root of x to the fifth power is the same as x raised to the five over three and now let's take the derivative by moving the exponent to the front so it's going to be five over three x and now we need to subtract that by one so five over three minus one well we need to get common denominators in order to subtract these two numbers so we're going to change one into three over three because three divided by three is one and now we can subtract the numerators of the two fractions five minus three is two and the denominator is going to stay the same so five over three minus three over three is two over three that's going to be our new exponent and so you can move this x to the top and write it as 5 x raised to the 2 3 divided by 3. notice that we have a positive exponent so we're not going to move the x variable to the bottom and get a negative exponent there's no need to do that in this problem the only thing that we do need to do is convert this expression from an exponential fraction into a radical expression so x raised to the two thirds can be rewritten as the cube root of x squared so make sure you understand this the b root of x to the a is equal to x raised to the a over b the number inside the radical goes on top of the fraction the index number goes on the bottom of the exponential fraction but for this problem this is the final answer now let's work on one more example of differentiating radical functions so let's say we have the eighth root of x to the fifth power go ahead and find the derivative of that so let's begin by rewriting the expression so the eighth root of x to the fifth is the same as x raised to the five over eight power so now we're gonna move the exponent to the front just like before this is going to be 5 over 8 x now let's subtract the exponent by 1. we're following the same steps so let's get common denominators let's replace negative 1 with negative 8 over eight five minus eight is minus three so this is going to be negative three over eight so we can rewrite this as five x to the negative three over eight over eight now this time we do have a negative exponent so we're going to move the x variable to the bottom of the fraction so it's 5 over 8 x raised to the 3 over 8. now the next thing we're going to do is convert the exponential fraction back into its radical form so x to the three eighths is the same as the eighth root of x cubed and we're going to leave the answer like this now if you want to you could rationalize the denominator but that's a whole other topic i'm going to leave the answer in this form now let's move on to finding the derivatives of trigonometric functions so for now hopefully you could take out a sheet of paper and a pen or pencil and jot down some notes the derivative of sine of the u variable where u is a function of x is going to be cosine of that u variable times the derivative of u or times u prime the derivative of cosine u is going to be negative sign of the u variable times u prime the derivative of tangent u is going to be positive secant squared u times u prime the derivative of cotangent u is going to be negative cosecant squared of u times u prime the derivative of secant is secant tangent times u prime so hopefully you see a pattern here and finally the derivative of cosecant is going to be negative cosecant cotangent times u prime so note that every time you differentiate a trig function that starts over c you're going to have a negative sign that's one thing you want to keep in mind the derivative of tangent and cotangent is similar to each other this is secant squared that's cosecant squared and the derivative of secant and cosecant are also similar to each other this is secant tangent this is cosecant cotangent so hopefully that will help you to remember these trigonometric derivatives now let's try some example problems let's start with this one what is the derivative of sine x well we know that the derivative of sine to the u is going to be cosine u times u prime in this example we can clearly see that u is equal to x if u is equal to x what's u prime well we know that the derivative of x is simply one so this is going to be cosine x times one or just simply cosine x here's another example what is the derivative of sine x to the third power try that one so let's rewrite the formula the derivative of sine to the u is going to be cosine of u times u prime so the derivative of sine x cubed well first we know that u is x cubed so u prime is going to be 3x squared and then if we just replace u with x cubed and u prime with 3x squared we're gonna get the answer so notice the process that we're taking here first we differentiate side it turns into cosine whatever is inside of the sine function that is the angle it remains the same in the answer so the angle of sine is x cubed the angle of cosine remains x cubed next we take the derivative of the inside part of the function x cubed and that gives us 3x squared so now let's move on to some other examples the derivative of cosine x squared try that one and also try the derivative of tangent raised to the x to the fifth power i mean tangent of x to the fifth power so first we're going to find the derivative of cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sine and we're going to keep the angle the same so the angle is x squared next we're going to find the derivative of x squared which is 2x so the final answer is negative 2x sine x squared now moving on to the next example the derivative of tangent is secant squared now the angle of tangent is x to the fifth so the angle of secant squared will be the same thing next we're going to find the derivative of x to the fifth power which is 5x to the fourth power so the final answer is 5x to the fourth power times secant squared x to the fifth power now what about the derivative of secant 4x what's the answer to that one the derivative of secant is secant tangent so it's going to be secant 4x tangent 4x the angle is going to remain the same after that we could find the derivative of 4x which is just 4. and i'm going to move the 4 to the front so the derivative of secant 4x is going to be 4 secant 4x tangent 4x now what about the derivative of let's say cotangent x cubed plus x raised to the fifth power the derivative of cotangent is negative cosecant squared so we're going to have negative cosecant squared and then whatever we have inside of the angle of cotangent that's going to be the same for the angle of cosecant squared which is x cubed plus x to the fifth power next we need to find the derivative of the inside angle the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of x to the fifth is 5x to the fourth and so i'm going to leave the answer like that but if you want to rewrite it you could rewrite it like this you could say negative 3x squared plus 5x to the fourth power times cosecant squared x cubed plus x to the fifth power so that's the answer for this example now let's move on to the derivatives of natural logs the derivative of ln u this is equal to u prime divided by u so let's say if we want to find the derivative of the natural log of x in this case u is equal to x u prime the derivative of x is going to be one so it's u prime over u or just one over x so that's the derivative of the natural log of x now let's try some more examples so what if we want to find the derivative of let's say the natural log of x cubed what's the answer well we can see that u is equal to x cubed u prime is three x squared so it's u prime over u that's three x squared over x cubed x squared is basically x times x x cube is x times x times x so we can cross out two x variables and this is going to give us three over x as a final answer that's one way in which you can get the answer here's another way a property of logs and natural logs allows you to move the exponent to the front this is without differentiation by the way so we can rewrite the expression as 3 times ln x now from the previous example we know that the derivative of ln x is 1 over x so the derivative of 3 ln x is 3 times 1 over x which is the same as 3 over x so that's another way in which you can find the derivative of that particular natural log function go ahead and try this one find the derivative of ln x to the fourth minus x to the fifth so we can see that u is x to the fourth minus x to the fifth u prime is the derivative of that it's four x cubed minus five x to the fourth so the answer is going to be the derivative of what we see inside the natural log function divided by whatever is inside of it and that's really an easier way to like think about it in order to find the answer so let's say if we want to find the derivative of the natural log of tangent x so first take the derivative of the inside part of ln the derivative of tangent is secant squared and then simply divided by whatever is inside of the natural log function which is tangent so the answer is secant squared over tangent but chances are we can reduce this expression secant is one over cosine so secant squared is going to be one over cosine squared tangent is sine over cosine so what we could do is multiply the top and the bottom by i'm going to multiply by cosine squared these two will cancel and i'm going to get one on top one of the cosines will cancel leaving one cosine here so i'm going to get sine times cosine which we can write that as one over sine times one over cosine one over sine is cosecant x and one over cosine is secant x so the final answer is cosecant x times secant x so now that we've talked about how to find the derivative of a natural log function let's talk about how we could find the derivative of a regular logarithmic function such as log base a of u this is going to be equal to u prime over u ln a now i'm going to compare that to the derivative of the natural log of u we said is u prime over u now notice that here we have a base a and it turns into lna the base of a natural log is e and what we should have here is l and e so these two are essentially the same thing instead of a we have e but the natural log of e we need to know is equal to one so because of that we really don't need this expression here but i want you to compare and see the similarities between the two equations so let's find the derivative of let's say log base 2 of x to the fifth power go ahead and try that u in this example is what we see here x to the fifth power and a is two u prime the derivative of x to the fifth power that's going to be five x to the fourth power so all we got to do is plug in the information into that formula and we're going to get the answer so it's u prime divided by u times the natural log of a or ln2 now we can simplify our answer x to the fifth power i can rewrite that as x to the fourth power times x because 1 plus 4 is 5. and so we can cancel x to the fourth power that's the final answer is going to be 5 over x ln 2. now remember you could move this 5 to the front and that's we see that here so that's the final simplified answer for in that problem let's try another problem with regular logs so let's say we have log base 4 of x cubed plus 4x squared let's try that one so u is going to be whatever we see inside of the log expression so it's x cubed plus 4x squared a is the base of the log expression a is 4 and u prime is just the derivative of what we see inside of here the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared the derivative of 4x squared is 4 times 2x or 8x and so plugging everything into that formula it's going to be u prime which is 3x squared plus 8x divided by u which is xq plus 4x squared and then times the natural log of a or ln 4. now you could leave your answer like this but understand that you could simplify this expression in the numerator we can factor out x and we'll be left with three x plus eight in the denominator we can take out an x squared which i'm gonna write as x times x if we take out x squared we're gonna be left with x plus 4 and then times ln 4. so now we can cross out an x variable so we can leave our answer as 3x plus 8 divided by x times x plus four times the natural log of four or you can just rewrite that part as x squared plus four x there's many ways in which you can write your final answer hopefully your teacher won't be too picky about exactly how she wants you to leave your final answer but that's it so that's how you could find the derivative of this logarithmic function now let's move on to our next topic and that is the derivative of exponential functions so let's say we have a constant raised to a variable before we had a variable raised to a constant which would use the power rule but now we have a constant raised to a variable and this is going to equal that constant raised to that variable times the derivative of that variable so let's put this information to practice let's say if we want to find the derivative of e to the x so it's going to be e to the x times the derivative of x which is 1. so the derivative of e to the x is simply e raised to the x power now what about the derivative of e to the 2x it's going to be the same thing e to the 2x times the derivative of 2x which is 2. so you can write it as 2e to the 2x now let's work on some other examples what is the derivative of e to the 5x it's going to be e to the 5x times 5 which is 5e to the 5x and then finally if we have the derivative of e to the x squared it's going to be the same thing e to the x squared times the derivative of x squared which is 2x and let's do one more let's say we want to find the derivative of e to the sine x this is going to be e raised to the sine x times the derivative of sine x which is cosine x so that's how you could differentiate an exponential function with a base e now what if the base is not e let's say it's some number other than e because e is a special number it's equal to 2.7182818 so and it just continues but what if we have let's say some other constant raise the u variable what's the derivative of that it's going to be the same thing a to the u times u prime but times lna if we contrast that with e to the u which is e to the u times u prime but technically times l and e but ln e is one so we don't need that part when dealing with e it's just e to u times u prime but if the constant is a number other than e then you need to add the l and a part to the answer so let's put this to practice let's say we want to find the derivative of 5 raised to the x power this is going to be the same thing 5 raised to the x times the derivative of x which is 1. times the natural log of five so based on that go ahead and try these examples find the derivative of four raised to the x squared and also the derivative of seven raised to the x to the fourth so this is going to be whatever we see here so we're just going to rewrite it that's 4 raised to the x squared and then times u prime u in this example is x squared so the derivative of x squared is 2x and then times the natural log of whatever the base is the base in this example is 4. for the next one is going to be exactly what we started with 7 raised to the x to the fourth times the derivative of the exponent the derivative of x to the fourth is four x cubed times the natural log of the base and the base is uh seven so that's the derivative of seven x to the fourth you simply need to just follow the equation as you can see this is the a to the u part u prime that's the derivative of the exponent and then lna we can see a is seven now the next topic of discussion is the product rule so let's say you have a function multiplied to another function u times v what is the derivative of u times v well first you need to differentiate the first part leave the second part the same plus leave the first part the same differentiate the second part so let's say we have the derivative of x cubed times sine x in this example you could say that u is x cubed and v is sine x so we're going to differentiate the first part that is x cubed the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and then we're going to leave the second part the same so we're just going to rewrite sine x plus now we're going to rewrite the first part x cubed and then take the derivative of the second part the derivative of sine x is cosine x so this is the answer now for those of you who want to simplify it you could factor out the gcf which is x squared if you decide to do that here's what you're going to get taking out x squared in the first term you'll be left with 3 sine x taking out x squared in the second term you'll be left with x cosine x so you could leave your answer in this format if you want to now let's try another example what is the derivative of x squared l and x so feel free to pause the video if you want to try that so this is u and this is v so let's begin by differentiating the first part x squared so we're going to get 2x and then we're going to rewrite the second part ln x we're not going to change that plus let's rewrite the first part x squared and then let's take the derivative of the second part the derivative of l and x is one over x so we're going to get 2x ln x and then x squared times 1 over x that's like x squared divided by x which is x now like before we can factor on x if we do so we're going to get 2 ln x plus 1. so that's the final answer if we wish to simplify it that far so now you know how to use the product rule when finding derivatives here's another example so let's say we have seven x plus four times x squared plus eight now we could use the product rule to find the derivative of this expression or we can foil and then use the power rule to find the derivative of the resultant polynomial function but let's use the product rule so first let's find the derivative of the first part seven x plus four the derivative of seven x is seven the derivative of four is zero so we just get seven next we're going to rewrite the second part and then we're going to rewrite the first part and then take the derivative of the second part the derivative of x squared is 2x the derivative of the constant 8 is 0. so this is the answer that we get now what i'm going to do is i'm going to distribute and combine like terms so this is going to be 7x squared plus 56 and this is going to be 14 x squared plus 8x so i can combine 7x squared and 14x squared so i'm going to get 21x squared plus 8x plus 56. and so this is the final answer now note the other way in which we can get the answer we could have initially distributed before we take the derivative 7x times x squared is 7x cubed and then this is 7x times 8 which is 56x this is 4x squared and this 4 times 8 is 32. now if we were to take the derivative of 7x cubed that's going to be 7 times 3x squared which is 21x squared the derivative of 4x squared is 8x and the derivative of 56x is 56. the derivative of the constant is 0. so we would still get the same answer in the end now let's talk about the quotient rule let's say if we have a function divided by another function or u over v to find the derivative of that expression we could use this formula it's going to be v u prime minus u v prime over v squared so let's say we want to find the derivative of three x minus five over seven x plus four now if you want to it helps to write down a few things so u is whatever is on the numerator of the fraction so we can say that u is three x minus five v is the stuff on the bottom or on the denominator of the fraction so that's seven x plus four u prime the derivative of three x minus five is just three v prime in this example is simply seven so now we just gotta plug in everything into that formula so it's v that's seven x plus four times u prime which is three and then minus u that's three x minus five times the v prime which is seven divided by v squared so that's seven x plus four squared now let's do some algebra so let's begin by distributing the three to seven x and 4. 7x times 3 is 21x 4 times 3 is 12. next let's distribute 7 to 3x and keep in mind it's a negative sign so that's going to be negative 21x and then 7 times negative 5 combined with that negative sign that's going to be positive 35. so immediately we could see that we could cancel the 21x and then we can combine 12 and 35 which will be 47. so the final answer is 47 divided by 7x plus 4 squared for this problem so that's how you can use the quotient rule whenever you have a division of two functions now let's talk about the chain rule we've covered some examples of it early in this video what is the derivative of sine x to the fifth power from what we talked about we would differentiate the outer part of the function the derivative of sine is cosine and then we would keep the inside the same and then we would differentiate the inside part of the function the derivative of x to the fifth power is 5x to the fourth power that process can help you to solve derivatives associated with the chain rule so when dealing with a chain rule you're dealing with composite functions so if you want to find the derivative of a function inside of another function like f of g of x it's equal to the derivative of the outside function so f prime and then the inside function stays the same that is g of x and then times the derivative of the inside function g prime of x so that's how you could find the derivative of a composite function when you have a function inside of another function so let's say we want to find the derivative of 4x cubed plus 7x raised to the fifth power in this case we need to start with the outer function that is the power rule so we're going to move the 5 to the front we're going to keep the inside function the same and then we're going to subtract the exponent by 1. next we're going to take the derivative of the inside function the derivative of 4x cube is 12x squared the derivative of 7x is 7. so that's the derivative of this function so you don't have to foil this five times you could just simply use the chain rule to get the answer now let's move on to our next example what is the derivative of tangent of sine x cubed go ahead and work on that example so first we're going to find the derivative of the outer function tangent and that's going to be secant squared now inside of tangent we have sine x cubed so we're going to have the same thing inside of secant squared so we're starting with the outer function and we're working our way in so now let's work our way in towards sine the derivative of sine is cosine and the angle of sine is x cubed so the angle of cosine will be x cubed and then we're going to work even further towards the inside part of the functions the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared now that's as far as we can go so this is the answer of this expression secant squared sine x cubed times cosine x cubed times 3x squared here's another example you could work on find the derivative of sine to the fourth power of cosine of tangent x squared now what i would recommend doing since we have an exponent here is rewriting the expression so basically what this means is that this whole thing is raised to the fourth power and it affects the way you're going to apply the chain rule because before you can differentiate the sine function you need to use the power rule on that exponent so let's move the 4 to the front so it's going to be 4 and then we're going to rewrite everything we see inside of the brackets highlighted in red now we're going to subtract the exponent by one and then we're going to differentiate the sine function so that's going to be cosine and then the angle of sine is everything we see here that's cosine of tangent x squared so now we're going to move inward towards cosine by the way it is the multiplication for all of these functions so it's times the derivative of cosine is negative sine and the angle of cosine is tangent x squared so we're going to rewrite that now let's work our way in towards tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squared and the angle is x squared finally we can find the derivative of x squared which is 2x and so this whole thing is our final answer now of course you can combine a few things you can combine the 4 and the 2x and the negative sign and you can put negative 8x in front but besides that there's nothing else you can do here so that's it for this problem now the next topic we need to talk about is implicit differentiation sometimes you'll have equations with two different variables like this one x and y and you want to find the derivative of y with respect to x so basically you want to determine the value of dydx how do you do that well what you do is you're going to differentiate both sides with respect to x now before we do that i want to talk about a few things when you differentiate x cubed with respect to x you're going to get 3x squared and technically you get times dx over dx which cancels to one but if you want to differentiate y cube with respect to x you're going to get three y squared but times d y d x note the difference here since these variables don't match up here these they do match up so this would be dx over dx which is pointless in writing so implicit when dealing with implicit differentiation problems every time you differentiate y with respect to x you need to add dydx now sometimes you'll be dealing with what is known as related rates instead of differentiating with respect to x you'll be differentiating with respect to t or time so if you differentiate x cubed with respect to time it's going to be 3x squared but times dx dt likewise if you differentiate y cube with respect to time it's going to be 3y squared times d y dt so just keep that in mind but when dealing with implicit differentiated i mean let me say that again when dealing with implicit differentiation we are differentiating with respect to x so the derivative of x to the fourth is simply going to be 4x cubed but the derivative of y to the fourth is going to be 4 y cubed but times d y over dx and this is what we need to solve for the derivative of 12 is zero so i'm going to take this term and move it to the other side so i'm going to have 4y cubed cube times dyd dydx and that's going to be equal to negative 4x cubed and then all we need to do is divide both sides by 4y cube and then the force will cancel and so we get d y over dx is equal to negative x cubed over y cubed so that's a quick and simple example of how to perform implicit differentiation for the sake of practice let's work on one more example let's say we have x cubed plus 4xy plus y squared is equal to 9. go ahead and calculate the value of d y over dx so we're going to differentiate this entire equation with respect to x the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared now notice that we have x and y so we need to use the product rule i'm going to say the first part the u part is 4x the v part is going to be y so the derivative of the first part 4x is just 4 times the second part which is just y plus the first part 4x times the derivative of the second part the derivative of y is going to be 1 times d y over dx because we're differentiating y with respect to x now the derivative of y squared is going to be 2y times d y over dx and the derivative of a constant is always zero so everything that does not have a dy over dx attached to it i'm going to move to the other side so i'm going to move these two terms across the equal sign so we're going to have 4x dy over dx plus 2y dy over dx and that's going to equal negative 3x squared minus 4y so because we have a common factor we can now factor out the dy over dx on the left side and that's going to leave us with 4x plus 2y which equals negative 3x minus 4y so now we can divide both sides by this 4x plus 2y so these two will cancel and thus we have our final answer d y over d x is equal to negative three x squared minus four y and we could factor out a two on the bottom but i'm not going to worry about that in this example so that's gonna be divided by four x plus two y so now you know how to find the derivative in or using implicit differentiation so far we talked about how we could find the derivative of a variable raised to a constant and that is by using the power rule x to the n the derivative of that is going to be n times x raised to the n minus 1. and we also talk about having or finding the derivative of a constant raised to a variable and that was a to the u times u prime times lna so we have a variable raised to a constant and a constant raised to a variable but what about finding the derivative of a variable raised to a variable how do we do that how do we find the derivative of x raised to the x well first let's make y equal to x raised to the x so if we could find the derivative of y then we know what the derivative of x to the x is that's step one step two is to take the natural log of both sides so ln y is equal to ln x raised to the x now a property of natural logs allows us to move the variable x to the front and so what we're going to have is ln y is equal to x ln x and now at this point we are going to differentiate both sides with respect to x so here's how you can express that in mathematical words now we know that the derivative of ln x is one over x so the derivative of l and y is going to be one over y now notice that we're differentiating y with respect to x so when you see that you need to add d y over dx this is basically implicit differentiation on the right side we need to use the product rule so we're going to differentiate the first part x which is 1 and leave the second part by itself and then we're going to leave the first part by itself and then differentiate the second part the derivative of ln x is one over x so what we have now is one over y times d y over dx and that's equal to ln x and then x times one over x you can cross out the x variables so it becomes plus one and now what we're going to do is we're going to multiply both sides by y so we can cross out the y variables here and so we're going to have d y d x is equal to y times you could say ln x plus one or you could say one plus l and x now recall at the beginning we set x raised to the x equal to y at this point we're going to substitute y with x raised to the x so the final answer is going to be x raised to the x times 1 plus ln x so that's how you could perform what is known as logarithmic differentiation that's how you could find the derivative of a variable raised to a variable so this is the answer so you could say that the derivative of x raised to the x in this example is x raised to the x times 1 plus ln x well that's basically it for this video we've covered a lot of topics and
