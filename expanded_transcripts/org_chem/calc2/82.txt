Transcript for: The Reciprocal Rule and The Quotient Rule - Derivative Calculus
in this lesson we're going to talk about the reciprocal rule so here's the basic idea behind the reciprocal rule the derivative of 1 over f of x and that's equal to negative times the derivative of f divided by the square of f of x now the reciprocal rule comes from the quotient rule in fact you can derive it from the quotient rule so here's the quotient rule U over V the derivative of that is equal to v u Prime minus u v Prime over V squared so if we want to differentiate one over f using the quotient rule we can see that U is going to be equal to one and F I mean V is equivalent to f so U Prime the derivative of one is zero and V Prime the derivative of f is going to be F Prime so v u Prime V is f u Prime is zero minus u v Prime U is one V Prime is f Prime divided by V squared V is f so V squared is f squared now zero times f is zero so that disappears and we're left with negative f Prime over F squared which is basically what we have here so that's how you can prove the reciprocal rule from the quotient rule so let's write a simplified version of it so here's the reciprocal rule 1 over F Prime is going to be F Prime negative f Prime over F squared so that's the simplified version of the reciprocal rule now let's work on an example problem so let's find the derivative of 1 over 5x squared so go ahead and differentiate that expression using the reciprocal rule feel free to pause the video if you want to so in this problem f is 5X squared F Prime the derivative of 5x squared that's going to be 5. times the derivative of x squared which is 2x so that simplifies to 10x so using the formula it's negative f Prime so negative 10x divided by F squared f is 5X squared and if we Square it this is going to be negative 10x 5 squared is 25 x squared squared that's going to be x to the fourth so we could simplify that so 10 is 5 times 2 25 is 5 times 5. x to the fourth is x times x cubed so we could cancel a 5. and we can cross out an X so this simplifies to negative two over five x cubed so that's going to be the answer for this problem now we can get that same answer using the power rule so the derivative of 1 over 5x squared well that's equivalent to the derivative of one-fifth x to the negative 2. if we take x squared and move it to the top now we could use the power rule the derivative of a variable raised to the constant x to the N is going to be n x to the N minus 1. so this is going to be 1 over 5. n is negative 2 so this is going to be times n times negative 2 and then X negative 2 minus 1 which is negative 3. so the negative 2 is going to go on top of the fraction the 5 is going to stay on the bottom so we have negative 2 over five now x to the negative 3 Once you put it to the bottom it's going to become x to the positive 3. and notice that we get the same answer Now using the power rule we could get the answer a lot faster but nevertheless the reciprocal rule works as well so it gives us the same answer now for the sake of practice let's work on a few more examples but using the reciprocal rule so go ahead and find the derivative of these expressions so let's say we have 1 over actually let's make this 4 over x squared plus 3x and for this one let's say five over lnx go ahead and try those two examples so this expression is equivalent to saying 4 times the derivative of 1 over x squared plus 3x now F in that problem is going to be x squared plus 3x which means F Prime is going to be the derivative of x squared is 2x the derivative of 3x is just 3. so it's negative f Prime so that's negative two X plus three divided by F squared so that's x squared plus 3x squared now there's really no need to simplify this expression I'm not going to foil it because it's going to become more complicated so I'm going to leave the answer just like this it looks nicely simplified the way it is already now for the next one I'm going to rewrite this as 5. oh wait before I finish that I need to include the 4 here almost forgot so I'm just going to put that 4 right there so that's the final answer with the four included now for the next one I'm going to move the constant 5 to the front so we're differentiating 1 over Ln X so f is Ln X F Prime the derivative of L and X is 1 over X when you differentiate outline U it's U Prime over U so Ln X would be the derivative of x which is 1 divided by X so it's 1 over X Now using the formula this is going to be 5 times negative f so that's negative 1 over X divided by F squared or Ln x squared now I'm going to multiply the top and bottom by X to simplify this so 1 over x and x will cancel therefore the final answer will be negative 5. over X Ln X squared so that's basically it for this video now you know how to use the reciprocal rule in order to differentiate functions that look like this where you have the variable in the bottom of the fraction so it's a lot easier than using the quotient rule but you could use the quotient rule for any of these problems but if you don't have a variable on the top it's easier to use the reciprocal rule by the way for those of you who want more examples on derivatives and other topics like that feel free to check out
