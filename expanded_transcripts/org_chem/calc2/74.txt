Transcript for: Average Velocity and Instantaneous Velocity
so in this video we're going to talk about average velocity instantaneous velocity position functions and all the little questions that go with that type of problem so let's start with this one a ball is thrown straight upward from a building so let's draw a picture this is like a calculus slash projectile motion type problem so we got this ball and it's going to go up and then it's going to go down now in reality it goes straight up and then straight down so just keep that in mind it really doesn't move to the right now we're given the position function that describes the height of this ball above ground level so s let's say at this point will be the difference between ground level and the point of interest it could be any point along this trajectory depending on what he is so the first question asks what is the height of the building how can we determine the height of the building so going back to this picture what is the time when the ball was thrown upward from the building that is where it started to leave that's the beginning the initial position so at that point t is equal to zero for this type of trajectory there's three points of interest the beginning the maximum height and just before it hits the ground at point a t is equal to zero we don't know what the time is at point b or point c but we can figure that out later so in order to determine the height of the building we need to evaluate s when t is zero so we just gotta substitute t with zero into that equation so it's gonna be negative 4.9 times zero squared plus nine point eight times zero plus two hundred this is all zero therefore the initial height of the building is 200 units now i didn't really describe what the position is but you can tell based on this number 4.9 if you see that it's going to be in meters per second the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 meters per second squared and this formula comes from this equation h is equal to the initial height or rather you've probably seen it like this in physics y final is equal to y initial plus v y initial t minus one one-half gt squared where g is 9.8 so half of 9.8 will give you 4.9 so since the acceleration is in meters per second squared the height is going to be in meters and the time is in seconds so the height of the building is 200 meters now let's move on to part b what is the initial velocity of the ball to find the initial velocity we need to find the derivative of the position function so the derivative of s of t the position function will give us the velocity function so the derivative of negative 4.9 t squared that's going to be negative 4.9 the derivative of t squared is 2t and the derivative of 98 t is just 98. so v of t is going to be negative 4.9 times 2 is negative 9.8 so it's negative 9.8 t plus 98. now to calculate the initial velocity we need to replace t with zero so it's going to be zero plus 98 so v zero is 98 that's the initial velocity in the y direction now let's move on to part c actually before we do that let's talk about the equations so in physics i mentioned that the height above the ground y final is equal to y initial plus v y initial t minus one half gt squared y initial represents the height of the building it's 200 v y initial is the vertical speed and as you can see it's 98 which is what we have that's the initial vertical speed in the y direction well technically is the initial vertical velocity and then if you see 4.9 that means g is 9.8 and so the units for g is meters per second squared which means this is going to be in meters and the time is in seconds now in calculus you might see a function that looks like this s of t is equal to negative 16 t squared plus v initial t plus that's an issue if this number is negative 4.9 in front of t squared then you know you're dealing with meters and seconds those are the units but if you see negative 16 then you're dealing with feet and seconds because g is about 32 feet per second squared but 9.8 meters per second squared so if you see a negative 16 that means t is in seconds and the height is in feet as opposed to meters now s initial corresponds to this number as you can see that's the height of the building and v initial which is the same as v y initial that's the velocity in the y direction the initial velocity it's always going to be this number in front of t which as you can see is 98 so i want you to see the relationship between these two equations with the height of the building and the initial velocity now let's move on to the next part what is the instantaneous velocity of the ball at t equals five so we have the velocity function and we said it was negative 9.8 t plus 98 so if we plug in a t value this will give us the instantaneous velocity at any time t so to find it at t equals five it's simply going to be negative nine point eight times five plus ninety eight negative 9.8 times 5 is negative 49 and negative 49 plus 98 is positive 49. now what does this number tell us what does it mean when the ball is going up the velocity in the y direction is positive but when it's going down it's negative so at t equals five the ball is somewhere between a and b that means the time it takes to get to point b is higher than five so keep that in mind so right now the ball could be maybe at this position but it's going up so it has a positive velocity but when it's going down it's going to have a negative velocity now let's move on to part d right now i'm going to rewrite this answer to use it as comparison later now what is the average velocity of the ball on the interval four to six to determine the average velocity we need to use the position function what we need to do is we need two points and we need to determine a slope between those two points a secant line touches the curve at two points and so the average velocity can be used to estimate the instantaneous velocity so make sure you understand this the average velocity represents the slope of the secant line the instantaneous velocity represents the slope of the tangent line and both the secant line and the tangent line represents it's a line on the position function not the velocity function so this white line represents the position function i'm going to choose two points at random let's use these two points so this would be a secant line now let's say if i want to estimate the slope of the tangent line here would be now notice that the instantaneous velocity was calculated when t is five and five is in between four and six so you can estimate the instantaneous velocity by calculating the average velocity at two points where this point is the midpoint of those two points just as five is the midpoint between four and six and keep in mind a tangent line only touches the curve at one point the secant line touches it at two points so let's say if we have a curve that looks like this and let's say we want to estimate the slope of the tangent line at that point so we can calculate the slope of the secant line but these two points we need one to be on the left one to go on the right such that this point is the midpoint of these two points as these two points move closer towards the midpoint the slope of the secant line will approach the slope of the tangent line so if we pick two points that are closer to it the slope of this secant line the green line is going to be a lot closer to the slope of this tangent line so let's calculate the average velocity on the interval four to six so the average velocity is going to be s of b minus s of a over b minus a where a is four b is six so it's going to be s of six minus s of four over six minus four and if you average four and six you get five so this is going to approximately be equal to v of five so we should expect an answer that's somewhat close to 49 so s of 6 let's plug it into this formula that's going to be i'm going to do it separately first because of lack of space so it's negative four point nine times six squared plus nine ninety eight rather i was gonna say nine point eight ninety eight times six plus two hundred so i got 611.6 and this is in meters and then s4 let's see what that's going to be so that's 513.6 so this is going to be six eleven point six minus five thirteen point six and six minus four is equal to two six eleven point six minus five thirteen six that's 98 and 98 divided by 2 is 49. it turns out that in this particular instance it was exactly 49. now if we try 4.9 and 5.1 it should be very close to that number as well this could be just a coincidence that it was 49. so there's no need to do this one but you could do it if you want to let's move on to part e how long will it take for the ball to hit the ground so how long will it take for it to reach position c now what is the height at position c the height is zero because it's at ground level so all we need to do is replace s of t with zero and solve for t so zero is equal to negative 4.9 t squared plus 98 t plus 200 if you want to you can multiply everything by negative 1. and so this would be 4.9 t squared minus 98 t minus 200 and then we could use the quadratic formula so it's going to be negative b in this case b is negative 98 so this is a b and c so it's negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4 a c divided by 2a 2 times 4.9 that's going to be 9.8 so this is going to be positive 98 and then we're going to have 98 squared minus 4.9 times 4 times negative 200 and that's going to be 13 524 the square root of thirteen thousand five hundred twenty four is 116.3 now t is not going to be negative because it was zero at a so we need a positive answer so it's going to be 98 plus 116.3 and then divided by 9.8 so it's going to take 21.87 or i'm gonna round into nine 21.9 seconds for the ball to reach the ground now part f how fast is the ball moving before it hits the ground so let's go back to the velocity function v of t is negative 9.8 t plus 98. so we're looking for v of 21.9 or 21.87 so it's negative nine point eight times twenty one point eight seven plus ninety eight so the answer is negative 116.3 meters per second but let's talk about it now the question in part f asks how fast is the ball moving before it hits the ground is it asking for speed or velocity how fast is the measure of speed we are measuring the magnitude not the direction of this quantity so the sign doesn't matter velocity can be positive or negative because direction is important but speed is always positive so how fast it's moving it's going to be positive 16.3 meters per second now if it asks for the velocity then we would use negative 116.3 meters per second but since we're looking for the speed we need to make that answer positive watch out for those questions now what about part g how long will it take for the ball to reach its highest point so at what time will it reach point b how can we figure that out at point b you need to realize that the velocity in the y direction is equal to zero so let's start with the velocity function and we're gonna set v of t equal to zero and let's calculate t so i'm going to move the 98 to the other side so negative 98 is equal to negative 9.8 t if we divide both sides by negative 9.8 then t is going to equal 10. so it takes 10 seconds for the ball to reach to position b now keep in mind this picture is not drawn to scale it looks like the right side is a lot bigger than the left side now part h determine the maximum height of the ball above the ground level now the maximum height occurs at position b that's the highest point so all we need to do is evaluate s when t is zero so it's going to be negative 4.9 times 10 squared plus 98 times 10 plus 200 so 10 squared is 100 times 4.9 that's 490. 98 times 10 is 980 and negative 490 plus 980 that's 490 plus 200 so the maximum height is 690 meters and that's it so now you know how to answer some questions related to position functions average velocity and instantaneous velocity thanks for watching you
