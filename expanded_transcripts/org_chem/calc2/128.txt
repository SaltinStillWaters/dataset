Transcript for: Finding Critical Numbers
in this video we're going to focus on finding the critical numbers of a function so what are critical numbers well let me give you a visual illustration so let's say if we have this function f and it looks like this let's call this point a b c d and e so notice that at point c we have a local maximum and we also have a horizontal tangent line so at f prime of c it's equal to zero c is a critical number and the same is true for d this time we have not a local maximum but a local minimum and at d the derivative is equal to zero that is the first derivative so d and c are both critical numbers now another point that's a critical number is at point e so notice that we have a cusp it's not differentiable at this function but f of e has a value e exists in the function but because it's not differentiable f prime of e does not exist nevertheless e is still a critical number now it's important to know that a function will not exist if there's a zero in the denominator so if you have some function let's say in a fraction format if you set the numerator equal to zero you're going to have this situation a horizontal tangent line and so you'll get a critical number but if you set the denominator equal to zero then it's not differentiable at that point but it's still a critical number so let's say if this is equal to f prime of x if we set the numerator equal to x x will equal negative four so that's going to be a critical number if we set the denominator equal to zero x will equal three so these two are both critical numbers keep that in mind now let's start with this problem let's say that f of x is equal to 4x squared plus 8x find the critical numbers of the function so what we need to do is find the first derivative set it equal to 0 and solve for x so what's the derivative of 4x squared using the constant multiple rules can be 4 times the derivative of x squared which is 2x and the derivative of 8x is going to be 8 times the derivative of x which is 1. so that's we have 4 times 2x which is 8x so 8x plus 8. so we need to set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x so let's factor out an eight if we do so we're going to get x plus one dividing both sides by eight zero is equal to x plus one so x is equal to negative one so this is the critical number of the function f prime of negative one is equal to zero now let's work on another example let's say if we have this function f of x is equal to 2 x cubed minus 15 x squared plus 36 x plus 10. if you want to try this problem feel free to pause the video so go ahead and find the first derivative set it equal to zero and solve for x the derivative of 2 x cubed is going to be 2 times the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of x is one and the derivative of a constant is zero so f prime of x is equal to six x squared fifteen times two is thirty and then plus thirty six now we're gonna replace f prime of x with zero and now let's solve for x so we need to factor this expression notice that every coefficient is divisible by six so let's take out the gcf which is 6. 6x squared divided by 6 is x squared negative 30x divided by 6 is negative 5x 36 divided by 6 is 6. so now we need to factor this trinomial what two numbers multiply to six but add to negative five two times three is six but negative two plus negative three adds up to negative five so it's going to be x minus two times x minus three so now we need to set each factor equal to zero and so we're going to get two answers two and positive three so we have two critical numbers in this particular example here's another one that you can try let's say that f of x is equal to four x raised to the one third minus eight x raised to the four thirds power now let's use the power rule to find the first derivative so the derivative of x to the one-third is going to be one-third x and then it's going to be one-third minus one now one is the same as three over three and one minus three is negative two so this is going to be one third x to the negative two thirds power and then minus eight times the derivative of x to the four thirds so using the power rule it's four thirds x raised to the four over three minus one which is four over three minus three over three and that becomes one over three now for this particular type of problem what you need to do right now is take out the gcf you need to factor it out so from both terms what is the greatest common factor well both terms contain a four and a three so we can take out four thirds how many x variables can we take out so let's say if we have x squared plus x to the fifth power if you have to factor this expression what would be the gcf of these two terms it's going to be the lowest of the two numbers so it's going to be x squared and you'll get 1 plus x cubed now the way you get these numbers is you need to divide you divide x squared by x squared that gives you 1. and for the second one if you take x to the fifth power divided by x squared that will give you x cubed well we'll need to apply the same principle here so which of these two exponents is lower in value negative two-thirds or one-third compare it on a number line the numbers on the left are lower than the numbers on the right so negative numbers are lower than positive numbers on a number line so we're going to take out x raised to the negative two thirds now if you take this term and divide it by that term what will it give you because they're exactly the same it's going to be one and if you take this term and divide it by that term what will you get the four thirds will cancel so it's going to leave behind negative eight and then if you divide x to the one third by x to the minus two thirds you need to subtract so it's going to be one over three minus negative two over three which is basically one over three plus two over 3 which is 3 over 3 and 3 divided by 3 is 1 so that's simply just x which works out nicely so now this x i'm going to bring it to the bottom so that we can convert the negative exponent into a positive one and so we now have four times one minus eight x divided by three x raised to the two thirds so that's the first derivative now recall that to find a critical number f prime of c has to equal to zero or f prime of c does not exist or is equal to one over zero so whenever you have a fraction to find a horizontal tangent line or the first critical number set the numerator equal to zero and for the critical numbers where it's not differentiable set the denominator equal to zero that's what we're going to do in this example anytime you have a fraction so if we set the numerator equal to zero we really don't need to worry about the four because if you divide both sides by four zero over four is zero so we just gotta set one minus eight x equal to zero so if we add eight x to both sides one is equal to 8x and then if we divide by 8 the first critical number is 1 over 8. now let's determine the next critical number so let's set the denominator equal to zero so if we divide both sides by three zero divided by three is still zero and so we can clearly see that x has to be zero if you raise both sides to the three over two zero raised to the three over two is zero and here the twos will cancel the threes will cancel so x is equal to zero so there's two critical numbers for this particular problem zero and one divided by eight here's another example let's say f of x is equal to the absolute value of five x plus eight identify the critical numbers in that function now this is just a generic shape for an absolute value function the absolute value of x looks like this and the critical number occurs right at the middle because the function is not differentiable at that point notice that for this particular function the slope changes from negative one to positive one instantly and so you don't know what the slope is at this point it's not differentiable so anytime you have an absolute value function or if the curve changes abruptly you have a critical number f prime of c does not exist at that point nevertheless it's still a critical number at that point and to find it all you need to do is set the inside equal to zero and so for this graph the critical number is x equals zero so what about the example that we have the absolute value of five x plus eight all we need to do is set five x plus eight equal to zero subtracting both sides by eight we have five x is equal to negative eight and then we need to divide by five so the critical number is negative eight over five so if you were to graph that particular function around negative one point six is where the y value will be equal to zero and so we have a graph that looks like this the slope is five so it should be rising quickly so notice that this point is the critical number at x equals negative eight over five here's another problem let's say that f of x is equal to x times the square root of 9 minus x go ahead and find the first derivative and set it equal to 0 and determine the critical numbers so in this example to differentiate it we need to use the product rule and just as a reminder the derivative of f times g is going to be the derivative of the first part f prime times the second g plus the first f times the derivative of the second g prime so in this case we can say that f is x and g is the square root of nine minus x but before we differentiate it we need to rewrite it as x times nine minus x raised to the one half so now let's begin so the derivative of the first part x is one times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second which is going to be if you use the power rule and the chain rule it's going to be one half keep the inside the same and then subtract the exponent by one one half minus one is negative one half and then differentiate the inside function the derivative of nine minus x is negative one so now like before we need to factor out the gcf the only thing that we could take out is nine minus x and negative one half is less than one half so the gcf is going to be nine minus x raised to the negative one half now one half minus negative one half if you divide those two terms that's going to be one half plus one half so the first one is going to be 9 minus x raised to the 1 or simply just 9 minus x and then if we divide this term by this one these two will cancel leaving behind negative one-half x to make the negative exponent positive i'm going to move this to the denominator so on top we have 9 minus x minus 1 half x and on the bottom nine minus x raised to the positive one half so what is negative x minus one half negative one minus one half negative one is the same as negative two over two and negative two minus one is negative three so it's negative three over two so right now we have nine minus three over two x divided by i'm to rewrite this back into its radical form the square root of 9 minus x now i want to get rid of this fraction so what i'm going to do is multiply the top and the bottom by 2. so f prime of x is equal to nine times two which is eighteen three over two times two is three so this is gonna be negative three x and on the bottom 2 times the square root of 9 minus x now at this point we need to set the numerator equal to 0 so 18 minus three x is equal to zero adding three x to both sides eighteen is equal to three x and if we divide by three the first critical number x is equal to six now for the second critical number we need to set the denominator equal to zero so if we divide both sides by two zero minus zero divided by two is zero and then if we that should not be a two that should be zero if we square both sides zero squared is zero and then we need to add x to both sides so we can see that x is equal to nine so the critical numbers are six and nine now let's work on one last problem let's say that f of x is equal to sine squared x plus cosine so we have a trigonometric function go ahead and find the first derivative set it equal to zero and find all the critical numbers now the first thing i'm going to do is rewrite this function because i'm going to have to use the chain rule on sine squared x i'm going to write it like this sine x squared so now let's determine the first derivative oh by the way the function is restricted from zero to two pi because sine and cosine are periodic functions and they go on forever so you may want to add that to the problem so if you want to try it feel free to pause the video and work on it now let's use the chain rule so i'm going to move the two to the front according to the power rule keep the inside function the same subtract the exponent by one two minus one is one and then take the derivative of the inside function the derivative of sine is cosine now we need to differentiate cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sine now let's set the first derivative equal to zero and we need to factor the gcf which is sine so if we take out sine x this term divided by that one the signs will cancel leaving behind two cosine x and if we take the negative sign divided by positive sign that will give us negative one now we need to set each factor equal to zero so on the right side we need to add one to both sides so we can see that two cosine x is equal to one and then if we divide both sides by two cosine x is one half now when is sine x equal to zero sine of zero is zero sine of pi is zero and sine of two pi is zero however x does not include zero or two pi so we need to get rid of those two answers so we only have one answer in the interval and that's pi so far now when is cosine positive one half cosine is positive in quadrants one and four cosine 30 is equal to the square root of three over two but cosine 60 is one half so therefore x is going to be 60 degrees which is the same as pi over 3. pi is 180 180 over 3 is 60. and in quadrant 4 it's going to be 5 pi over 3 which is 300 degrees that has a reference angle of 60 in quadrant 4 because 360 minus 300 is 60. so if you need to review your trigonometry you can look up my new trigonometry playlists you can find it in my channel and you can review this stuff if you need to so these are the answers pi over 3 pi and 5 pi over 3 all of which are in this interval so that's it for this video now you know how to find the critical numbers of a function so find the first derivative set it equal to zero and solve for x you
