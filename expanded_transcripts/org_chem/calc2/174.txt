Transcript for: Mean Value Theorem For Integrals
in this video we're going to go over the mean value theorem for integrals and let's say if we have some function which looks like this from a to b now there's some point c where the area under this region is equal to the area of the rectangle so i'm going to draw the rectangle in blue so the area of that rectangle is equal to the area under the curve from a to b and so if the function is continuous on the closed interval a b and if c is in that interval then according to the mean value theorem the definite integral of f of x dx from a to b is equal to f of c times b minus a so the definite integral represents the area under the curve in red so that's the definite integral so it's the area of the curve and f of c times b minus a b minus a represents the width of the rectangle and f c that's a y value that represents basically the height of the rectangle with times height that gives us the area of the rectangle so according to the mean value theorem at some point c the area of the rectangle is equal to the area under the curve and f c represents the average value now let's say that f of x is equal to x squared over the interval zero to four find the value of c guaranteed by the mean value theorem for integrals in this function so let's start with the formula so the area under the curve is equal to the area of the rectangle so f of c times v minus a now a in this example is zero and b is four so this is going to be the integral from zero to four and f of x is x squared f of c well if f of x is x squared what is f of c so if you plug in c into that equation f of c is going to be c squared and then we have b minus a so that's going to be 4 minus 0 now on the left let's find the antiderivative of x squared so using the power rule it's gonna be x cubed over three evaluated from four to zero on the right we simply have four c squared now let's focus on the left side if we plug in 4 it's going to be 4 to the third over 3 and then if we plug in 0 that's just going to be 0. now 4 to the third is 64. and so we have this let's multiply both sides by 1 4. 64 divided by 4 is 16. so 16 over 3 is equal to c squared now let's take the square root of both sides the square root of 16 is 4. so we have 4 over square root 3 and that's equal to c but this is going to be plus or minus now let's rationalize that value the final answer is going to be plus or minus 4 square root 3 over 3. now to get a decimal value of that this is plus or minus 2.309 now c has to be in the interval a to b zero to four positive two point three zero nine is in that interval but not negative 2.309 so the c that we're looking for is positive 4 square root 3 over 3. and so this is the answer let's try another problem let's say that f of x is equal to the square root of x on the interval from one to nine go ahead and calculate the value of c for this problem so let's start with the formula in this example a is 1 b is nine so we have the definite integral from one to nine f of x is the square root of x and f of c all you gotta do is replace x with c so that's gonna be the square root of c and then b minus a nine minus one now let's replace the square root of x with x and one half because we need to rewrite it in order to integrate it so using the power rule one half plus one is three over two and instead of dividing it by three over two it's the same as multiplying it by two over three let's evaluate it from one to nine and then nine minus one is eight so on the left we have 2 times 9 raised to the 3 over 2 over 3 minus 2 times 1 raised to the 3 over 2 over 3 and that's equal to 8 square root c now what is 9 raised to the 3 over 2 how can we evaluate that fractional exponent so anytime you have rational exponents it's helpful if you split it this is the same as nine raised to the one half raised to the three when you raise one exponent to another you need to multiply a half times three is three halves so nine to the half is basically the same as the square root of nine which is three and three to the third is twenty seven so therefore we have two-thirds of 27 and then minus two-thirds of one we can factor out two-thirds and make it easier or we could just multiply 2 and 27 2 times 27 is 54 and then minus 2 or 3. 54 minus 2 is 52 and so right now this is what we have now what we need to do is divide both sides by eight or multiply both sides by one over eight so we could cancel these eights on the right we can break down 52 into 13 times 4 and 8 is 4 times 2 and let's not forget the 3. so we could cancel a 4. and so we have 13 over 6 is equal to the square root of c so now we need to take the square of both sides 13 squared is 169 6 squared is 36 and that's equal to c now we need to make sure that it's in the interval a to b in this problem one to nine so let's get the decimal value of 169 over 36 so as a decimal that's about 4.694 so that's definitely in this interval so this is the answer now let's say that f of x is a linear function and let's say it's two x plus three on the interval from 2 to 10. now if you had to guess the value of c what would you say now what is the midpoint of 2 and 10 to find the midpoint we can average to two values 2 plus 10 is 12 and 12 divided by 2 is 6. do you think c will be less than 6 equal to 6 or greater than 6. now for linear functions the c value will be equal to the midpoint value now let's confirm it so let's start with our original formula and then let's plug in what we have so a is 2 b is 10 f of x is 2x plus 3. and so f of c is going to be two c plus three and then b minus a that's ten minus two now the antiderivative of x is x squared over two and for three it's three x evaluate it from two to ten now two i mean ten minus two is eight so now let's focus on the right side we could cancel a 2 and so we have x squared plus 3x if we plug in 10 that's going to be 10 squared plus 3 times 10 and then minus we need to plug in 2 2 squared plus three times two so all of that is equal to two c plus three times eight ten squared is a hundred and three times ten is thirty two squared is four three times two is six a hundred plus thirty is one thirty and four plus six is ten and one thirty minus ten is one twenty so now let's divide both sides by eight so what's 120 over eight think of 120 as 80 plus 40 and 80 divided by 8 is ten forty divided by eight is five so 120 divided by eight is fifteen and that's equal to two c plus three now let's subtract both sides by 3. so 15 minus 3 is 12 and that's equal to 2c and so if we divide by 2 we can see that c in this example is 6 and 6 is the midpoint of a b which is 2 to 10. and so for a linear function the c value where the area of the rectangle is equal to the area under the curve is simply the midpoint of a b now let's compare the three problems that we had so the first one was x squared which looked like this the second one was the square root of x which looks like that on the right side of the graph this is just the the right half of x squared and this is the graph for the square root of x and for the third one two x plus three it looks like that so for x squared the interval was from zero to four and for the square root of x we went from one to nine and then four this was two x plus three we went from two to ten now the midpoint of zero and four is two and for one to nine it's five and for two that's ten it's six now the c value for this one was to the right of two it was two point three zero nine now for the second graph it was to the left of midpoint and c was 4.694 and for the last one c was equal to the midpoint it was equal to 6. so the c value guaranteed by the mean value theorem it's going to be equal to the midpoint if you have a linear function where it's neither concave up or concave down on the left we have an increase in function that's concave up and in that case c is going to be greater than the midpoint but for a function that's increasing and concave down c as we can see is less than the midpoint but if it's linear and it's neither concave up or down c is equal to the midpoint you
