Transcript for: How to Find The Point Where The Graph has a  Horizontal Tangent Lines Using Derivatives
determine the point at which the graph has a horizontal tangent line so let's say if we're given a function x cubed minus six x squared plus fifteen how can we determine at which point this particular graph will have a horizontal tangent line well let's draw a rough sketch not of this function but just of some generic function so let's say if we have a function that looks like that a tangent line touches the curve only at one point now so this for example would be a tangent line it touches it only at one point a secant line touches the curve at two points now we want a horizontal tangent line and that occurs at a maximum or a minimum so these two would be a horizontal tangent line now what you need to know is that the slope of any horizontal line is zero so therefore to find a point at which the graph has a horizontal tangent line we need to find the first derivative and set it equal to zero because that's when the slope of the curve will be zero and then we need to solve for x so let's begin by finding the first derivative the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of the constant 15 is 0. so f prime of x is equal to 3x squared minus 12x now because we're dealing with the horizontal tangent line we need to set this equal to zero since the slope has to be zero and now we need to calculate the value of x so let's factor out the gcf which is 3x 3x squared divided by 3x is x and negative 12x divided by 3x is negative 4. so now let's set each factor equal to zero here if we divide by three we can see that x is equal to zero and if we add four to both sides x is equal to four so the two points are zero and four that's where the horizontal tangent lines will occur now sometimes you may need to write your answer as an ordered pair so let's calculate the y values that correspond to these two x values so let's evaluate f of zero this is going to be zero q minus six times zero squared plus fifteen and that's equal to 15. so the first ordered pair has a x value of 0 and a y value of 15. now for the second one let's replace x with 4. 4 to the third power that's 4 times 4 times 4 that's 64. 4 squared is 16 and if we add 64 and 15 that's going to be 79 6 times 16 is 96 and the difference between 79 and 96 that's 17 so this is going to be negative 17. so we have the point four comma negative seventeen so these are the locations of the horizontal tangent line or the point at which the graph has a horizontal tangent line now let's work on one more problem let's say if f of x is four x cubed minus seven x squared minus six x plus four so go ahead and find the points at which this function has a horizontal tangent line so if we follow the same procedure we need to find the first derivative and set it equal to zero the derivative of x cubed is three x squared and the derivative of x squared is two x the derivative of x is one and the derivative of a constant is always zero so f prime of x is equal to 12 x squared 7 times 2 is 14 and minus 6. so let's set this equal to 0. so how can we factor this particular trinomial in order to calculate x one of the first things we should do is take out the gcf which is two twelve x squared divided by two is six x squared negative fourteen x divided by 2 is negative 7x and negative 6 divided by 2 is negative 3. now what do you think we need to do at this point so let's focus on factoring 6x squared minus x minus three we could ignore the two for now if we want to we could divide both sides by two because zero divided by two is still zero so that will disappear and now we have this expression if you need to factor a trinomial where the leading coefficient is not 1 multiply the leading coefficient by the constant term 6 times negative 3 is negative 18. now we need to find two numbers that multiply to negative 18 but add to the middle coefficient negative seven so this is going to be negative nine and two negative nine plus two is negative seven but negative nine times two is negative eighteen now let's replace negative seven 7x with negative 9x and positive 2x and then we need to factor by grouping so in the first two terms take out the greatest common factor which is going to be 3x 6x squared divided by 3x is 2x negative 9x divided by 3x is negative 3. now for the last two terms there is no gcf to take out so we have to take out a 1 and we will be left with 2x minus 3. now we need to factor out the gcf again which is 2x minus 3. so if we take it out of this term we're left with 3x and if we take it out of that term we're left with positive one so now we have a completely factored expression so let's set each factor equal to zero so let's add 3 to both sides so we have 2x is equal to 3 and then let's divide by 2. so the first point is that three over two for the next one let's subtract both sides by one and then let's divide by three so the second point is at negative one one-third so those are the points where the horizontal tangent line touches the curve you could find the y-coordinates if you want to but i'm going to stop here so that's it for this video you
