water flows out of a storage tank at a rate defined by the function V Prime of t as shown above T is in minutes V Prime represents the volume flow rate of water in gallons per minute what is the rate at tal 12 minutes now to find a rate we could simply just plug it in we need to find V Prime of 12 so all we got to do is replace t with 12 so it's going to be 100 + 2.43 * 12us 05 * 12 2 so I'm going to do this one step at a time 2.43 * 12 is about 29.6 12 2 * 05 is 7.2 so if we add these values the rate at 12 minutes is going to be 121.9 6 lers per minute actually not liters but gallons per minute so that's all you have to do for part A now what about Part B how can we calculate the number of gallons of water that will flow out of the tank in the first 30 minutes how can we do that well there's something called the net change term the integration of frime of T which represents the rate of change of f with respect to time this is simply equal to F of B minus F of a so if we intergrate the volume flow rate or the rate of change of volume with respect to time if we integrate that function from 0 to 30 it's going to give us the number of gallons of water that's going to flow out of the tank in the first 30 minutes it's basically going to give us the net change of the gallons of water that's going to leave the sink so we need to integrate from 0 to 30 V Prime of T and this is going to be equal to V of 30 minus V of0 so V Prime of T is 100 plus 2.43 T minus 05 t^2 the anti-derivative of 100 is 100t and the anti-derivative of t to the first power is going to be t to the second power divid t by two excuse me and the anti-derivative of t^2 is T the 3 / 3 evaluated from 0 to 30 so let's plug in 30 first this is going to be 100 * 30 plus 2.43 / 2 that's about 1. 215 * 30 2 05 / 3 that's going to be 0.1 6 repeating time 30 to the 3 power and then minus now we need to plug in zero 100 * 0 is 0 0 2 * 2.43 that's zero so the whole thing is zero 100 time 30 is about 3,000 30 s * 1.25 that's a, 93.5 30 Cub times 016 repeating that's about 450 now let's add these three values so the final answer is 36435 now the unit that corresponds to this problem is gallons if V Prime of T is in gallons per minute V is going to be in gallons so that's how many gallons is going to flow into the tank or I mean out of the tank in the first 30 minutes here's another problem that we could try the daily electric power that is energy per unit time consumed by a typical household in a certain city let's say it can be modeled by this function P of where p is in power well p is the power in kilowatts and T is the time in hours and the time is restricted in a 24-hour period how much power in kilowatts is consumed at 11: a.m. if T is Zer at 12 a.m. or midnight now we already have the function that describes the power power is the rate of energy per unit of time power is defined as energy ID by time but we don't really need to use use this formula at this point we already have the function for power in kilowatt so all we need to do is plug in the appropriate T value if at midnight T is zero then at 11: a.m. T is equal to 11 so we got to find the value of P1 so it's going to be 13 +25 * 11 - 01 * 11^ 2 so now let's do the 25 * 11 is about 2.75 11 s is 121 * 01 that's 1.21 so by 11: a.m. this particular household is consuming up 14.54 Watts I mean kilowatts of power one kilowatt is about 1,000 watts and one watt represents one Jewel per second Jewels is the unit of energy but watts is the unit of power but now let's focus on Part B how much energy is consumed in a typical 24-hour period energy is power multiplied by time so let's say if you have a function for power energy is going to be the integration of P Prime of T DT now if you want to find a net change or how much energy is consumed you can use this formula it's p Prime of T DT evaluated from A to B and this is going to equal e of B minus E of a which will give us the amount of energy consumed and typical 24-hour period so let's go ahead and use that so A is z b is 24 and we're going to integrate this particular function the anti-derivative of 13 is 13t and the anti-derivative of 0.25t is25 t T ^2 / 2 and for the last one it's going to be 01 T 3r / 3 evaluated from 0 to 24 so let's begin by plugging in 24 now if we plug in zero the whole thing is going to be zero on the right side let's take this one step at a time so 13 * 24 is 312 24 2 is 576 * 25 / 2 so that's going to be positive 72 24 to the 3 power is 1382 4 * 01 and then divid by 3 that's going to be 46.8 so if we combine these three values the answer is 33792 now what are the units for this particular problem p is the power in kilowatts T is the time in hours so if you have a function where this is p and this is let's say this is in kilowatts and T is in hours the integration will basically give you the area under the curve to find the area you have to multiply the Y value by the x value so it's going to be kilowatt time hours or kilowatt hours so that's going to be the unit of the energy in this problem so this is the answer that's how much energy is consumed in this 24-hour period
