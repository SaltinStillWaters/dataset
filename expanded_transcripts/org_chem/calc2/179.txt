what is the indefinite integral of x cosine squared x times tangent x feel free to try this problem if you want to go ahead and pause the video take a minute to work on it now the first thing we need to do is simplify if possible cosine squared is basically cosine x times cosine x tangent is sine divided by cosine so at this point we can cancel a cosine expression and so we're going to have the integral of x sine x cosine x now it's important to understand that the double angle formula sine two x is equal to two sine x cosine x so therefore if we multiply both sides by a half we can get this expression one half sine 2x is going to equal sine x cosine x and so let's replace sine cosine with one half sine 2x so now we have this expression moving the one half to the front we have one half times the integral of x sine 2x so the original expression is equivalent to this expression now in order to find the integral of this expression we need to use a process known as integration by parts here's the formula for that the integral of u dv is gonna equal u times v minus the integral of v d u so what we're gonna do is we're gonna make x equal to the u variable and dv is going to be equal to sine 2x dx so i'm going to write that on the top right section of the screen so u is x which means du is equal to the derivative of x which is 1 times dx dv is sine 2x dx v is the antiderivative of dv so the anti-derivative of sine 2x is going to be negative cosine 2x divided by 2 because of the 2x part the derivative of 2x is 2. so now let's plug in everything into this formula so first we have one half times u v u is x v is this right here i'm going to rewrite that as negative one half x cosine two x that's u v minus the integral of v d u so v is negative one half cosine two x times d u which is dx so we have negative times negative one-half so that's going to be positive one-half which i'm going to move in front of the integral so this is positive one-half integral cosine 2x dx now what i'm going to do at this point is i'm going to distribute the one half to these two terms so this is going to equal negative 1 4 x cosine 2x and then plus 1 4 the integral of cosine 2x dx so now i need to find the anti-derivative of cosine 2x the antiderivative of cosine 2x is sine two x divided by two so this becomes negative one fourth x cosine two x plus one fourth times sine two x over two and then plus the constant c so the final answer for this problem is going to be negative 1 4 x cosine 2 x plus 1 over 8 sine 2x plus the constant of integration so this is the answer to the original problem so that's equal to the integral or the indefinite integral of x cosine squared x times tangent x so that's the final answer
