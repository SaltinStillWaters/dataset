Transcript for: How To Find The Equation of a Secant Line
consider this problem find the equation of the secant line that intersects the curve y equals x squared minus 4 at x equals negative 1 and at x equals 2. how can we find the equation of a secant line to find the equation of any line all you need is a point with an x y coordinate and the slope of the line let's draw a picture of what we have so the graph x squared is a parabola that opens in the upward direction but what we have is x squared minus four so this graph has been shifted down four units so here is a generic shape of the graph now what i'm going to do is find the x intercepts so if we set the function equal to 0 we can factor it using the difference of perfect squares technique the square root of x squared is x the square root of 4 is 2 and then one sine will be positive the other side will be negative now if we were to solve for each factor we're going to get x equals 2 and x is equal to negative two so these are the x-intercepts now we're interested in finding the equation of the secant line that intersects the curve when x is negative 1 and when x is 2. so when x is negative 1 the curve is there and when x is 2 that's the x-intercept so the secant line is a line that touches the curve at two points or rather it intersects the curve at two points my drawn is terrible let's do this one more time so that is the secant line that we're focused on we need to find the equation of that line in order to find the equation of any line we need to get the slope but before we can get the slope we need to find the two points of interest on this line so we know the coordinates for this point we can clearly see that x is two y is zero for the first one we know the x value we don't know the y value but we could find it by replacing x with negative one in that equation so y is going to be equal to negative one squared minus four negative one squared is positive one one minus four is negative three so we got the point negative one comma negative three so now that we have the two points on the secant line we can use those two points to calculate the slope of the secant line and we're going to use this familiar formula you've seen it before m is equal to y2 minus y1 divided by x2 minus x1 so let's call negative 1 x1 and y1 is going to be negative 3. 2 is going to be x2 0 is going to be y2 so y2 minus y1 that's 0 minus negative 3 and then x2 minus x1 that's going to be 2 minus negative one zero minus negative three that's the same as zero plus three two minus negative one is equivalent to two plus one so the slope is three divided by three which is one so that's how we could find the slope of a secant line now the next thing is to write the equation of the line so now that we have the slope we can use the point slope formula all we need is a point and a slope so let's use this point we're going to replace y one with negative three m is one and x one we're gonna replace that with negative one so this becomes y plus three and that's equal to one times x plus one which we can simply write that as x plus 1. now the last thing that we could do at this point is subtract both sides by 3. so we're going to have y is equal to x and then 1 minus 3 is negative 2. so we have y is equal to x minus two this is the equation of the secant line this is the final answer that's all we could do for this problem so now you know how to find it so that's basically it for this video for those of you who like it don't forget to subscribe to this channel and hit that notification bell thanks again for watching
