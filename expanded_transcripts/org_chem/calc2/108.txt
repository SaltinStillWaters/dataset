Transcript for: Related Rates - Airplane Problems
now let's focus on some airplane problems as it relates to related rates an airplane is flying horizontally with a speed of 400 miles per hour at an altitude of three miles above a radar station let's draw a picture so let's say this is the ground and we're going to say this is the radar station and let's say this is the airplane and so it's traveling horizontally let's say in this direction and we could turn this into a right triangle let's call this x y and z so the airplane is moving at 400 miles per hour horizontally so x is increasing by 400 miles every hour so we have dx ct our goal is to calculate how fast the distance between a plane and a radar station how fast that's changing when the plane is five miles away from the radar station so eventually the plane is going to be here at some point and y is equal to three because the plane is traveling at an altitude of three miles above the radar station but at some point it's going to be five miles away it's not gonna be five miles away at let's say point a at point a it's three miles away but somewhere at point b it's going to be five miles away and five is represented by the letter z that's going to be the direct distance between the plane at some point in a future and a radar station so z is equal to five y is equal to three we don't have the value of x nor do we know what d y dt is but our goal in this problem is to calculate dz dt since z is the distance between a plane and a radar station and we want to find out how fast z is changing with respect to time now what should we do in this problem how can we go about solving it now the first thing we need to realize is that y is not a variable it's a constant the plane will always be three miles above the radar station in the vertical direction the altitude will not change it's always going to be i'm not sure what just happened there but the plane will always be three miles above the ground so since y doesn't change d y dt is 0. now we need to calculate x and so we have a right triangle therefore z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared the same way as c squared is a squared plus b squared according to the pythagorean theorem now z is five and y is three five squared is twenty-five three squared or three times three that's nine twenty-five minus nine is sixteen and the square root of 16 is four so x is equal to four so now that we have x we can now calculate the z dt so using the same formula let's perform implicit differentiation but with respect to time the derivative of z squared is going to be 2z times dz dt and the derivative of x squared is going to be 2x dx dt now the derivative of y squared is going to be zero because y is a constant if you do two y d y d t d y d t is still zero so the whole thing is going to be zero now let's divide both sides by two so z is five x is four and d x e t is four hundred so let's divide both sides by five and this should give us the answer so 400 divided by five 40 divided by five is eight so 400 divided by five is eighty and eighty times four is three twenty and so this is the final answer it's 320 miles per hour so that's the rate at which the distance between the plane and the radar station is changing number two two airplanes are about to intersect at a single point the first plane is traveling west at 400 miles per hour and is currently 160 miles east from the convergence point the second plane is traveling south at 750 miles per hour and is currently 300 miles north from the convergence point at what rate is the distance between the two planes changing so let's draw a picture so let's say this is the convergent point and we have a plane traveling south and another plane traveling west so the first plane is currently let me draw a right triangle because these problems they always deal with right triangles let's call this plane number one and plane number two so the first plane we can see that is traveling west and it's moving at 400 miles per hour and it's currently 160 miles east of this convergence point let's call this x and this is y and z is going to be the distance between them the second plane is 300 miles north of the convergence point but it's traveling south at 750 miles per hour so in this problem we can see that x is 160 and y is 300 we don't currently have the value of z but we do know dx dt what's dx dt and dydt in this problem now dx dt is negative 400 and the reason why it's a negative is because as the plane travels towards the convergence point x is decreasing that side of the triangle is getting shorter and so because x is decreasing dx dt is negative now for d y dt y is also decreasing as the second plane travels south so d y dt is a negative it's going to be negative 750. the goal of this problem is to calculate dz dt that's what we want to do so we don't need this picture anymore and so we can get rid of it now let's calculate z before we calculate dz dt just like the last problem we know that z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared x in this example is 160 and y is 300. one sixty squared that's twenty five thousand six hundred and three hundred squared is ninety thousand so if we add these two numbers we're going to get 115 hundred and so that's equal to z squared so we have to take the square root of both sides the square root of one hundred fifteen six 600 is 340. so now that we have the value of z we can now focus on getting dz dt so what we're going to do is differentiate this equation with respect to time and so we're going to have 2 z dz dt and that's equal to 2x dx dt plus 2y dy dt now let's divide everything by two and now we can plug in the information that we have so z is 340 times dz dt x is positive 160 dx dt is negative 400 y is 300 and the y dt that's negative fifty one sixty times negative four hundred plus three hundred times negative seven fifty that's equal to negative two hundred eighty nine 000 and to get dz dt we need to divide both sides by 340. so dz dt is equal to negative 850 miles per hour so that's the final answer and there is another way in which you can get this answer as well so for this problem where x y and z are all variables none of them are constants this holds true it turns out that dz dt squared is equal to dx dt squared plus dy over dt squared so we know that dx dt is negative 400 when you square it becomes positive dy dt is negative 750 so 400 squared which is 160 000 plus 750 square that's 562 500 and then adding those two numbers that's going to be hundred twenty two thousand five hundred so that's equal to dz over dt squared so now let's take the square root of both sides if you take the square root of seven two two five zero zero the calculator will give you a fifty but keep in mind when you take the square root of a number you get two possible answers plus or minus a 50. but based on this problem because the two planes are converging towards a point the distance between them is decreasing because the planes are getting closer and so we know that dz dt has to be negative so this is the final answer this is just another way to get the same answer you
