Transcript for: Curve Sketching - Graphing Functions Using Derivatives | Calculus
in this video i'm going to go over some basic examples of curve sketching particularly for polynomial functions but there's four fundamental shapes that you need to be familiar with so this is the first one this is the second here's the third and this one is the fourth so let's talk about the second derivative this is a concave down shape and whenever you have a shape that's concave down the second derivative is negative so for the two shapes on top because they form a downward u-shape the second derivative is negative for the two shapes on the bottom they form a concave upward shape so the second derivative is positive now for the first derivative if the graph is going up the first derivative is positive if it goes down it's negative so here we have an increase in function it's positive this one is going down so the first derivative is going to be negative here we have another decreasing function is going down so it has a negative first derivative and this one's an increasing function it's going up so the first derivative is positive now the reason why you need to know this is that when you create a sign chart for the first and second derivative you can get an a good idea of how the graph is going to look like at least the curve and i'm going to give you two examples to illustrate that so let's plot this particular polynomial let's say that f of x is equal to x cubed plus six x squared plus nine x go ahead and graph it now the first thing i'm going to do is find the x-intercepts so i'm going to factor out the gcf which is x and i'll be left over with x squared plus 6x plus 9. so that's a perfect square trinomial two numbers that multiply to nine but add to six is three and three three times three is nine three plus three is six so it's x plus three times x plus three which we can write as x times x plus three squared so if we set the function equal to 0 we can see that the x intercepts are 0 and negative 3. so i'm going to put those points in a data table so we have the point zero zero and negative three zero now let's find the first derivative of the function it's going to be 3x squared plus 12x plus 9. now let's take out the gcf which is basically three so we're left with x squared plus four x plus three and then we could factor the trinomial two numbers that multiply to three but add to four are one and three so we can write it as x plus three times x plus one and if we set the first derivative equal to zero we can get the critical points negative three and negative one so we can plot this on a number line and it's good to put the critical points here we already have one of them so the other one we're going to put is negative one now let's create a sine chart so if we plug in a number that's greater than negative one let's say zero zero plus one is positive zero plus three is positive so the first derivative is positive in this region if we plug in negative two negative two plus three is positive negative two plus one is negative so the function is decreasing between negative three and one and if we plug in negative four negative four plus three is negative negative four plus one is negative two negatives make a positive now that's for the first derivative let's create a sign chart for the second derivative also notice that we have a maximum at negative three and a minimum at negative one so at negative three notice that to the left the function's increasing and then to the right is decreasing so that's the max for the negative one critical point it's decreasing then increasing so that's a minimum so i'm just going to mark that here so at negative one we have a minimum and at negative 3 we have a maximum now for the second derivative it's going to be 6x plus twelve so if we set it equal to zero and take out six we can see that a potential inflection point could be negative two so we need to create a sine chart at negative two so if i plug in 0 0 plus 2 is going to be positive and if i plug in something less than negative 2 like negative 3 negative 3 plus 2 will be negative so that tells us the concavity of the graph so what i need to do is combine the two sign charts so we're gonna have the points negative three negative two and negative one so on top i'm going to put the sign for the first derivative and on the bottom for the second so the first derivative is positive to the left of negative three and between negative three and negative one it's a negative and to the right of negative one it's going to be positive so we can get rid of this at this point and keep in mind that we have a max at negative 3 and a minimum at negative 1. now for the second derivative it's negative to the left of negative two and then it's positive to the right of negative two so now let's draw the shapes that we have for these four sections so what type of shape do we have if the first derivative is positive and if the second derivative is negative so let's start with the second derivative if it's negative it's concave down and the first half is the part that's increasing where the first derivative is positive so we need to draw this shape so it's going to look like this let me use different colors so i'm going to make this one red now for the second part the first and second derivative are both negative so it's concave down and we need the second part because the function is decreasing so we need this part now here the first derivative is negative but the second is positive when the second is positive is concave up but if the first is a negative it has to be decreasing so we need that portion and then for the last one it's concave up and the function is increasing so here's our concave up shape and this is the part where the function is increasing so let's combine these four fragments into one graph so it's going up and then the blue part it's going down and then the green part it goes down and then it turns and then the white part it goes up now this is in line with the maximum that we do see at negative three and the minimum that we see at negative one so now we know the general shape of our graph and it makes sense because x cubed the parent function looks like this it's decreasing on the left increasing on the right so all we need to do is combine this shape with this data table so let me get rid of this structure and let's draw a graph now we need to find the y values for those two points so when x is negative one it's going to be negative one to the third plus six times negative one squared plus nine times negative one so that's negative one plus six minus nine so negative one plus six is five five minus nine is negative four now let's do the same when x is negative two so negative two to the third power that's negative eight negative two squared is four times six that's 24 and nine times negative two is negative eighteen twenty four minus eighteen is six negative eight plus six is negative two so now let's graph it so the first point that we have is negative three zero that's the first x intercept and we have another x intercept at 0 0 and then we have a point negative 1 negative 4 and then negative 2 negative 2. now negative 3 0 that's a maximum so i'm going to draw the graph in red so we should have some type of structure that looks like that and at negative 1 we have a minimum and following this graph we know it's going to look something like this let me see if i can do that make it better maybe not but you get the picture so that's the general shape of the graph that we had let's work on one more example so let's say that y is three x to the fourth plus four x cubed go ahead and graph this function so first i'm gonna look for the x-intercepts so i'm going to factor out x cubed and i'm going to have three x plus four so if i set this equal to zero i can see that x is equal to zero and if you set three x plus four equal to zero x would be negative four over three so i'm going to put that into the data table so we have negative four thirds comma zero and zero zero so now let's move on to the first derivative and that's going to be 12x cubed plus 12x squared so if we take out the gcf which is 12x squared we're left with x plus one so the critical numbers are zero and negative one we have zero but negative one is a new one that we can add and let's go ahead and get the y value for that so that's gonna be three times negative one to the fourth power plus four times negative one to the third so that's gonna be three minus four which is negative one now let's plot the critical numbers on a number line so if we plug in let's say 1 1 plus 1 is positive 1 squared times 12 is positive if we try negative one half this is squared so that's gonna be positive negative half plus one is also positive if we try negative two this will always be positive because of the square negative two plus one is negative so this is going to be negative so notice that it's decreasing and increasing so we have a minimum at negative one now the sign doesn't change across zero so we don't have a minimum or maximum so i'm going to write this and we have a minimum at x equals negative one now let's find a second derivative so that's going to be 36 x squared plus 24x so let's set it equal to zero and let's take out 12x so we're going to have 3x plus 2. so the points of interest are this will give us 0 and this will give us negative two thirds which i need to write that in here i already have zero now if i plug in one 12 times 1 is positive 3 times 1 plus 2 is positive if i plug in negative a half 12 times negative 0.5 is negative 3 times negative half that's negative 1.5 plus 2 that's positive a negative and a positive will give me a negative result and if i plug in negative 1 3 times negative 1 plus 2 is negative 12 times negative 1 is negative two negatives make a positive so now i need to combine this into a single chart but before i do that let's find a y value when x is negative two thirds so that's three times negative two over three raised to the fourth power plus four times negative two over three raised to the third power so negative two to the fourth power sixteen three to the fourth is eighty-one and 3 divided by 81 that's going to be like 1 over 27. negative 2 to the third is negative 8 times 4 that's going to be negative 32 and then 3 to the third is 27. 16 minus 32 is negative 16. so this is going to be negative 16 over 27 which is a little bit lower than negative a half so now we can combine the two sign charts so the lowest point is negative one and then it's negative two thirds and then zero so we're going to put the first derivative on top and the second on the bottom so the first derivative is negative to the left of negative one and it's positive everywhere else so to the right of negative one is going to be positive now for the second derivative to the left of negative two thirds it's positive between negative two thirds and zero is going to be negative and then it's positive to the right of zero now go ahead and identify the fundamental shapes that correspond to the sine chart so when the second derivative is positive we know it's concave up and the first derivative is negative so that's going to be the decreasing part of that curve so it's going to be going like this and then for the second part it's still concave up but this is the increase in part of that curve and so we can see why it's a minimum at negative one you could see the minimum here now this one is concave down but it's increasing so we have the right side of it actually i drew the concave up graph this is supposed to be concave down and so this is the increasing portion of it which is this side so we have this particular shape and then this is concave up again which is like this and we have the increase in portion of the concave up curve and let me put that in white so combining these four fragments we're going to have a graph that looks like this so that's the shape of our graph so this is going to be negative one because we have a minimum at negative one the next point of interest is negative two thirds and then at zero we have a horizontal tangent and then that's it so now we just got to take that curve and put it in to an actual graph with the right points so just keep that shape in mind now let's make the graph so we don't need too many points so we're just going to get up to 2 on each side so the first point is that negative four-thirds which is about negative 1.33 comma zero so that's an x-intercept the other x-intercept is at the origin zero zero and then we have the point negative one negative one and then negative two-thirds which is like negative point sixty-seven and negative sixteen over twenty-seven which is somewhere below negative point five so we could say about here so those are the four points they're pretty close to each other now negative one is the minimum so we're going to have this type of shape well let's draw the four shapes that we had the first one was like this if i remember correctly and then the second one was like that and then the third one continued and then went that way and then the fourth one just it kept increasing and the first one if you just extend it it's going to increase as well and so that's it that is the graph that we should have and so we can see the minimum at negative one and that's all i got for this problem so hopefully this gave you a good idea of how you can use the first and second derivative to help you draw a rough sketch of a polynomial function now i have another video on curved sketching that has more examples it's an older video so you can check that out but it still covers the same principles that this video covers it's just a longer video with more examples if you still want to get more practice with this type of topic so thanks again for watching you
