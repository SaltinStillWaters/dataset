Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 3.3:  The First Derivative Test for Increasing and Decreasing
stuff that we actually can do that is interesting it really is but stuff that we can actually do some things with specifically we're going to get into some curve sketching which I know it doesn't sound really cool because you can kind of do it on a calculator but this will lead you to understand why curves are the way they are and why they're shaped the way they're shaped a calculator won't let you do that so we're going to start section 3.3 tell you something about the first derivative test some of you are alligned because you just realize we finished two sections right yeah and there third section and it's going to go very fast you don't have to throw your calculator down in Anger all right you have to do that recall something for me if we just did this like well on the video it seems like only 20 minutes ago but actually was on Wednesday um what does this mean first okay it's first derivative and it's positive greater and zero means you're both right what's it mean no oh no I burned your pment for that back to staple has nothing to do with concavity nothing to do with concavity at all first derivative has to do with the slope or that's the rate of change of your line so it would tell you increasing or decreasing that's what it would tell you so those of you said increase and decreasing you're right concavity no that's second derivative okay second derivative tells you how the slope is changing so you need a second derivative to do that uh no that says the slope is positive if slope is positive you're like this right what's your line doing going up or down increasing this says increasing understand refresh your remember on 3.1 if this is just like oh my the first part 3.1 what's that mean definitely decreasing slope is negative First negative slope is negative decreasing aha what's this mean Conant constant that would be a horizontal tangent that would be finding critical numbers constant or critical numbers or critical points if you prefer I think they switch to critical numbers because technically x equals a value isn't quite a point is it it's just a number now I'm going to tell you how to find relative extreme you think you already know because you know what critical numbers are but I'm going to give you a nice graphic it's you have all the information okay I'm not going to teach you anything really new you have it all up here you have on your on your notes what I'm going to tell you is how to do it properly I'm going to give you a graphic organizer so that's a little bit easier for you would you like that here and do this on your homework this is how I want should do it how to find a wh whoops that can't that cannot girlfriend watching this kidding she hates math so I'm in luck it's horrible how to find relative extrema here is what you're going to do you are going to do something called the first derivative test that's what this is is to do so first derivative test says first derivative test number one take the first derivative we're so original in mathematics take the first derivative that has to do with first derivative test number two set it equal to zero for your critical numbers number three you're going to make what I like to call the first derivative table here's what the first D derivative table looks like you draw a number line This is a number line it's just an it's a way to organize your graph okay cuz ultimately just to give you like an advanced organizer we're going to be graphing functions so this is the first part in graphing your functions it's just organizing it for you so this is going to be a graph what goes on the top of your your little graph here is your first derivative represented by your critical numbers so you put your critical number number one critical number number two and so on until you run out of critical numbers they have to be in order so critical number critical number critical number however many you get there might be zero there might be one there might be a dozen of them doubtfully a dozen so take the first three no problem set equal Z we've done that already we found critical points that was 3.1 make that table that's something new but it's not very hard to do then what we're going to do for our table step number four I'm just redrawing here listen you know that at this point and this point and however many I have your first derivative will be zero right and that's telling you you have a horizontal Tang so before that note that you're going to either be increasing or decreasing right after that you're going to be either increasing or decreasing after that you're going to be either you are either going to be increasing or decreasing here and increasing or decreasing here and increasing or decreasing here if you weren't then it would have shown up you follow me it would have been there it would have been a critical number would have been saying oh my slope's zero so if those are your only numbers you must be either increasing or decreasing so step number four we test a point in each of those intervals it's so much like a sign analysis test only you do it in the first derivative and that's going to tell you because a first gives you increasing or decreasing if you're positive here are you increasing or decreasing inre increas inre inreasing if you're negative here what are you increasing yeah so and if it changes you know you have a Max or a Min if it doesn't change you know you don't have a Max or a minim does that make sense to you that's our whole idea so for each interval you're going to plug in a number into fime of X I'll say it this way find the sign of each interval each interval by plugging a value into frime of X not F ofx that'll give you points we want slopes slopes why because this will tell you increasing or decreas and that's what we're looking for some of your zoning out you got to be with me on this stuff because this tells you increas and decreasing okay uh I let two examples because this pretty much self-explanatory I mean you've done all this stuff you've taken first Ros right now that was what this whole class was until this point you know how to set the equal to zero that's algebra you know how to plug numbers in that's algebra so that's it I'll show you a couple of them but really the idea is the same for all of it just be aware that what I told you about rational functions still stays the same to find critical numbers for your first derivative uh you the zero when you said equal zero just look at the numerator now what we are going to discover is that you also have to use those denominator numbers for for your tables we'll get there later on show you why that is the way it is uh but you know maybe I'll show you now I think I might have one of those examples uh but you also have to use those for your your first derivative and second derivative test because things can happen there for instance um if you have an ASM toote sometimes functions look like this right see how that changes from increasing to decreasing but that number is not going to show might not show up on a first derivative test so you'd have to put any places where you're undefined from your original function on that because you could change from increasing to decreasing there so we'll also be doing that so look for critical numbers uh maybe I'll make a little side note here also put any undefined values so basically ASM tootes put any Asm tootes okay we're going to do the first derivative test here so first thing uh what are we going to do for our first derivative test why don't you tell me do it I got to warn you I will warn you some of the ones in the homework there worst derivatives of course I don't have the time to do expansive just derivatives already done that in this class that was for the first chapters all right but the ideas are the same okay U if you need more help on those D you come and see me check out the previous videos can make sure you know how to take those uh what are we going to get for our derivative and what do you do with that and what do you do with that factor 3 Factor xus 1 add theide 3 take a root plus and minus I think we've seen this like three times in this class actually x = 1 and 1 you okay with the one and the negative 1 hey quick question are there any other points that would make this undefined any denominators that's what we're really looking for any denominators okay that would give us ASM tootes so if there's no denominators then those are the only two points I'm going to have in my first derivative test here's how you make it out you're going to put fime of X you're going to make this line slightly below frime of X it doesn't go right after go slightly below it and the reason is I'm going to give you another piece for down here so we're going to fill out the second piece in the next section on the top this works for your frime of X you're going to put your critical numbers there's only two of them so we make both numbers what are my two numbers they have to go in order would you agree that those of the two points where my slope is equal to zero everywhere else this is also continuous everywhere you're either going to be increasing or decreasing how we find that out we take a number here and we plug it in where am I going to plug in a number here to the function or to the first derivative in this case the first Der that's why I have a first derivative right there right that says I'm talking about increasing and decreasing why don't you do that pick a easy number pick like -2 plug it into your first derivative so if I were to do this off to the side I do like okay I'm plugging in fime of -2 this one I definitely would pick zero this one I'd probably pick frime of two and I would plug those things in and I don't care about the actual number I care whether it's a positive number or negative number that's what's telling me what to do here so plug in -2 if I plug in -2 I get I don't something big minus something small positive you got positive 9 right I don't care about N I care whether it's positive or negative that's the key plug in z i get 0us 3 what's that negative don't care about what what the value is just positive or negative how about two posi positive what's my function going to be doing in this interval increasing or decreasing increasing why would you say that slope this is a slope right you plugged in the point this is the only places where the slope could Poss change right that's it because you found the zeros so it's either it's going to be consistent for those intervals so this says my SL is positive that means my function is increasing my slope is negative that means my function is decreasing my slope is positive that means my function is increasing again hey are these relative extremo which one would you say this is a relative Max or think about what the function would have to do to get that what would the function have to do it have to climb and then fall what is that just this part just this part that's a Max climb Then Fall what's this one fall and climb you see what I'm talking about so we know that right now because of this this is going to give us we don't know what it is exactly because that's just the x value we have to plug in find the points that's going to give us a relative Max this one's going to give us a relative min would you tell me how I find those points how would I go from here to actually get in the because right now I just have the X right so I know my relative maximum is going to happen at-1 comma something right and my relative minimum is going to happen at one comma something how do I find something not my slope function not my first derivative because that would give you zero that's how we found them in the first place but my original function if I take these and plug them into my f ofx f of1 f of one what now no no that was a slope that's right so original function plug in ne1 here 1 + 3 + 1 what do you get three yeah three do the minimum 1 - 3 + 1 1 oh I did right so can you tell me what's the relative maximum what's the actual relative maximum three three where does it occur at the point -13 do you understand the difference what's the relative minimum it happens to occur at the point 1 1 are these absolute maximums and absolute minimums no I haven't even given you a close right and this is a polom that looks like this that's what this does it goes up down up there's no absolute Maxum in but there's a relative Max and there's a relative Min those things are important have the absolute when you have a set closed it's closed you you will definitely have that but that's the only times when we have an interval no we we could have uh x s d down up right so you really have to know the polinomial are dealing with uh we'll try one more of these next time but do you have the understanding of of what this kind of goes on how we feel okay with this so far all right okay so uh moving on we're still talking about first derivative test and what the first derivative test says is can you find critical numbers and determine whether or not they are relative Maxes and relative mins how to find critical numbers the same old thing we're going to take a first derivative we're going to set it equal to Z and we're going to solve it so take your first R of that thing right there and set it equal to zero for me would you do that for me real quick if you haven't done that already go for it what' you get 5X you all got 5x to 2/3 all right minus you said what now 10 good show hands tell me we got that good deal now that right there is our slope of course that's our first derivative when we set it equal to zero we'll find the places where the slope is zero or a horizontal tangent line those are defined as our critical numbers so we have this set equal to zero so far so good now how solve that factor out the 5x very good and you choose the smallest power not the largest one the negative 1/3 which you want to factor I think I showed this to you one time before right so we will factor out the 5x to the - 13 once you end up getting factoring means dividing dividing means you're subtracting exponents check it out you've got well 5x to 2/3 / 5 x 1/3 there's no more 5 x^ 2/3 - - 1/3 is X to the first Power did you get x to the first Power not 1/3 first Power yes no minus what happens if I factor out 5 x 1/3 there how much do I get cool that's the correct factorization if you want to check your work you distribute you see you had the right thing how many were able to find that one good very good now can you verify something for me real quick can you verify that we actually have a denominator on this problem why do we have a denominator on this problem uhuh so really what you have this is not on the numerator in fact what you have is 5 x - 2 over a cubot of X can you you see that now here's one thing I was talking about we're we're at the point right now where we can make our critical numbers we're going to find those things but there's one thing you got to realize whenever you have a denominator the value that makes your denominator equal zero also has to be on your critical number does that make sense to you it's got to be there even though that's a denominator and some of you might go oh well zero product property right because you have something time something equals z well yeah that's true but realize what this is this is actually one over the cube root of x you follow me on that that's why I'm giving it to you this way so that when you come up with your problems you get the right critical numbers so let's go ahead and make our first derivative test remember that's the table and on our table we're going to do critical numbers critical numbers occur where the function is equal to zero in our case x - 2 = 0 and where the denominator equals z now that that's going to be an undefined point for our slope but it might change increasing to decreasing something like that so we'll also have the cube root of x equals to zero ladies and gentlemen raise your hand Fu okay I'm getting those points so where the numerator equals z is where the function will equal zero where the denominator equals zero is going to be some undefined points per slope right that that could be the case so we we need to have that up here somewhere we have interesting things that happen there well let's go ahead and do that uh we're going to get x = 2 we're going to get x = 0 well some critical numbers now something may or may not happen here but it might how many regions do we have regions so we're going to check a point in each of a number each of those regions this one you'd probably pick a negative one this one you probably pick one this one you probably pick three so let's check those now my question is where do I check them do I check them in my original or in my first derivative original will give me points first derivative will give me slopes the slope should will tell me increasing or decreasing which is what I'm looking for you remember that this is supposed to give increasing and decreasing right so do I plug in in my original which gives me points or my first derivative which G me slopes first derivative that's why it's called the first derivative test so take some numbers here frime of1 frime of 1 frime of three and we're plugging it into well the first derivative because what I what I know is that if the slope is positive I'm increasing if the slope is negative I'm decreasing that's where we want to that's what we want to find out excuse me hey when you plug in negative one what do you get you get a positive number okay because we have a negative number over a negative number that's going to give you a positive number did you get that as well so I don't care what the value is as long as you know it's positive that's going to be a plus are you with me on the plus let's plug in one when you plug in one do you get a positive number negative number who who got negative you got negative anybody else get negative number are are you seeing I'm getting a lot of people who aren't saying anything are you getting where the the positive and negative are coming from Okay negative very good we' get Negative over positive that's a negative when you plug that in try that on your own plug in the one here you're going to get -1 * 5 that's 5 over POS 1 that's neg 5 that's a negative you still okay plug in three when you plug in three you're going to get a positive * a positive that's positive over a positive cubot of 3 is going to be positive right I don't really care what it is as long as it's positive or negative that's going to be a positive show hands how many people feel okay on the plus minus plus do you see why the zero was important there that's pretty important right it shows you a change even though this was on a denominator you had to have that so you got to have that is part of your critical numbers it can show a change between increasing and decreasing now what do all these things mean the plusus plus what does plus mean for Us increasing very good what does minus mean decreasing what does plus mean again increasing so our graph is going to be increasing I don't know how I don't know whether it's like this or whether it's like this that's concavity but I know it's going up then I know it's going to be going down then I know it's going to be going up again right now are these things relative Maxes or mens well that's a tricky question when we have a denominator because we don't know what's defined and what's undefined you follow me on that so we're going to have to take a better look at that later on WE we'll do the second derivative test right now I'll show you how to combine those things and then we'll start talking about curve sketching and what happens whether these things have ASM tootes or not does that make sense now I'm guessing that can you plug can you actually plug in zero you can right yeah zero that is actually that's a point that's a defined Point our slope's not defined but that is a Define point so if you pluged in zero you're going to get a relative what is that going to be when you're going up and going down it's relative Max what's this one going to be relative Min so that does actually work for us in this case but I'm going to show you how to figure that out in association with the second second derivative test let me get that do you feel okay with first derivative test what's the idea take the first derivative set it equal to zero find your critical numbers and then plug in some values for every interval that I'll tell you increasing and decreasing that's the whole plan you follow now let's take a look at the second derivative test
