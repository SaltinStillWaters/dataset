Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 2.3:   The Product and Quotient Rules for Derivatives of Functions
are you ready to try some more advanced things with derivatives see how we can really use this stuff you ready yeah answer usually yes CU we're going to do it anyway so may as well be happy about it uh 2.3 today you're going to learn some rules you're going to learn about the product rule and the quotient rule here's the scenario let's suppose that we start with two functions I'm going to give you some very basic functions FX = X2 G of x was x cubed here's what I want to know is it possible to take the derivative of one function times another function yes notice how this is f ofx and this is G of X right the question is this the question is is this equal to this I need more room I want you to really write that down and contemplate it is that true question is can I do it can I break up derivatives by multiplication can I break up derivatives by multiplication can I say oh the derivative of f ofx * G ofx is the same as the derivative of f ofx time the Dera of G ofx can I do that I don't know we we have no idea I mean I'm just asking you right now but I can tell you this if if we can find one example where it's not true then this whole scenario falls apart so what we're going to look at is let's look at this example and see if it's true for this now I'll tell you right away that you could get x to the 5th right there couldn't you so we know for sure that this is true this is the same as DDX of x to the 5th what's the derivative of x to the 5th ladies and gentlemen so we know for sure that this is supposed to end with 5x to 4th do you believe me yes no okay okay let's try this way let's let's try to do it the derivative of the first times the derivative of the second what's the derivative of X2 our first what's the derivative our of our second is it the same no we get 6 x cubed okay we got two different answers which one is right 5 x 4th or 6 x to 3r which one's right 5 you should know you should know right now which one is right which one is right this one this one which one's right is this for sure equal to x to the 5th every time every time do you know how to take the derivative of x to the 5th every time we know for sure that this way was right what I'm trying to say is do you end with the same thing I know for sure guys for sure this is the right way this it gives me a correct answer answer the correct answer is 5X 4th that's the correct answer is this the correct answer then no so does this way work so can I separate derivatives by multiplication no no is this true no no bueno uhuh no you can't do that one that's not true you can't separate derivatives by multiplication so what are we supposed to do when we get these functions that are multiplied together we either have to distribute them or we have to find a better way and that way is called the product rule which is the name of our our section here we're going to look right now at how we actually do the product Ru so product rule Ru says well if this doesn't work what is the correct way what do you do if you have one function times another function you're trying trying to find the derivative of those things well here's what you do this is our our rule if you want the proof of this come and see me I'll give it to you it's a little bit too long for our class uh I usually will prove the things but I'm not going to prove the quotient rule the product rule for you want see just come and see me okay so product rule says here's how we're going to go about taking the derivative of a product we're going to take the derivative of the first one the first function times the derivative of the second function I'm sorry the derivative of the first one times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function write that out in symbol so you see it you take the derivative of the first function times the second one you leave the second one alone you add to it the first function left alone times the derivative of the second you've still taken the derivative of each one but it's different than this you have that addition in there that product uh I like to think product plus p goes with P product plus so we're going to have that uh you're going to see in the quotient rule that we were have minus sign in between there so product plus associate the product with a plus by the way would it work for over here let's let's check real quick just to verify okay so DDX of x^2 * X Cub again we're supposed to end with 5x 4th right that's what we're supposed to end with if we do this here's what it says watch what the product rule says to do it says you take the derivative of your first function that would be X2 you find the derivative of your first function times the second function that's how to write that out says you find the derivative of your first function times your are you okay with the notation derivative your first function times your second function then you have a plus sign then you write your first function times the derivative of your second function in English it says derivative of the first * the second plus the first * the derivative of the second let's see if it works what's the derivative of X2 so this becomes 2x oh ladies and gentlemen do I need to take the derivative of x cubed in this case right here you follow the DDX that's why I like the DDX it says this is what you're taking the derivative of that's why we're going to write it like that in this class oh this says take the derivative of this one but don't take the derivative of this one you're only taking the derivative of whatever's inside your brackets there you see it that's why we use that says oh yeah okay derivative of x^2 that's 2x * X Cub plus do I take the derivative of this X2 how about this x Cub yes that's what it said DDX says take the derivative of that that's 3x^2 if we make this a little prettier we have 2 x 4 + 3x 4th that gives us height are we right yeah that works in that case that's not a proof that says it works for that example you have to be able to prove it works for every example Senor for that if you want to or we can just trust it works for everyone you can trust it yeah you can trust if you want I would I mean it does so save me some time but so in English the derivative of the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second if you want to write that down you can write that down if you like it at your leisure or just watch the video again and hear me say it like 40 times just press rewind okay derivative of the first * the second plus the first the derivative of the second how many feel okay with that so far now we're going to do one example on how to how to actually do this I'll show you why it can be useful a little bit later on how it really really does help us out a ton and why we need it for right now you're going to be wondering well why can't we just distribute all the time for right now we will be able to distribute all the time and get the same exact answer I'll prove it to you right now I'll show you however later on you won't be able to do that and so the project rule will become very very important for us later for right now it's going to seem like well wait hang on let me show you an example of this hey look at my function do I have a product do I have one function times another function sure absolutely I do I've got this function in parenthesis times this other function but do you see that I could distribute this do you see it if I foiled this all out I could do the derivative that way I could do it for sure I could do that and so you might be wondering why do we need this at all if I can always distribute the answer is well you can't you can't or you probably don't want to for instance what if I gave you now we're not there yet I'm I'm jumping ahead to give you a pre a precursor to what we're going to be doing later but here's why we need the product rule okay you with me on this we're not going to do it now I haven't showed you this yet but what if this was to the 4th okay do you want to distribute that four times and then distribute that one not really heck no no that's ridiculous okay that'd be crazy they'd take up more time than limits would do all right no we don't want to do that we want to find ways around that the product rule is the way around that do you understand that's the idea so it' be good practice to start using the product rule now instead of yes absolutely it's going to on your homework it's going to ask you to do both uh do this two ways I'm going to show you next time how to do this two ways I'll leave you with one don't pack up yet I'll leave you one one more thing but it says distribute this find the derivative then use the product rule it again distribute it and then you're going to find out that you have the same exact thing okay so you're verifying that this product rule does work and distribution does work you get the same exact thing that's what kind of this idea was about as well one last question so a lot of people always ask me so I'm answer right now in the last couple minutes well hey Leonard isn't this a product 3x s isn't that a product no well of course it is it's 3 * x^2 yes why don't we use the product rule for this if it's a product why don't we use the product rule wouldn't it come out different and the answer is we kind of do use the product rule uh but we cheat a little well we don't cheat we just don't show a part of it here's why if you considered this to be a product check this out you'd have the derivative this would be your first and that would be your second true you'd have the derivative of your first times your second plus your first times your derivative of your second all right very good what's the derivative of three 0 * x^2 that's going to happen every time because that's a constant so if you consider that to be a product rule the constant is always going to go to zero so we really don't show that step do we we just show oh look at hey the three's outside that's why we can pull the three outside of our derivative that's a constant we can do that it's product rule says here's positive plus 3 * the derivative that's 2x that's 6X that's why we can do that okay so to answer any questions you might have in your head why don't we have to use a product rle you really are you just you're not showing we're going to start with that problem next time so we're working on our problem I'm going to show you that with the product rule yes there are other ways to do it but ultimately we need the product rule because I think I showed you last time that we're going to have to have that if we have any sort of exponent here or here we're going to need it because you certainly don't want to distribute that out 30 times if that's your x one that would be crazy so how do we do this two ways well way number one is what if we don't even consider it to be a a product at the very end what if we distribute those parentheses and make it so we just have a basic polinomial in this case well if we do that we'll get 3x to 6 + 2 x 3r - 3x 4 - 2x are you okay with that so far check for any like terms do I have any like terms so maybe reorganize it just a little bit because that's the way we like to see our pols and then the question is can you take a derivative of that thing right there yeah that's actually pretty easy so if we do Dy DX what's the derivative of of this this polom can youall tell me real quick thank you all of you appreciate it let's all try this what's the derivative of 3x 6 okay minus what then uhhuh is that it okay so that's our derivative now the product rule should give us the same thing and again we're practicing the product rule in case I give you something like that where you can't just distribute it you'd have to distribute this one and then distribute that would be very annoying so we're going to verify with a couple of these examples that yeah you are going to get the same thing if you use the product rule do you remember what the product rule said to do derivative of the first one first one times the second one add the derivative of the second one plus the first one yeah that's very good so there I think the book has it in slightly different order but because of the commutativity of addition and multiplication it really doesn't matter as long as you take the derivative of one times the other plus the other one times the derivative of like a der of the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second or anyway you you kind of permute that that's that's fine take the derivative of one of them times the other then multiply times that one times the derivative of the other in other words for us we'd say the derivative of the first function times the second function so that's our our separation of the product there plus the first function times the derivative of the second so derivative of the first * the second plus the first times the derivative of the second that's how we like to say that it's like I would like to see that are you guys okay on how this is coming about again we can't just take the derivative of this and this and this and this that doesn't work anytime we have a product there we have to use a product rule or we have to distribute and do it term by term so far so good can y'all tell me what's the derivative of x^2 -1 what are we going to get out of that so this will be our 2x * 3x 4 + 2x plus do we take the derivative of this this piece right here folks no no okay so x^2 minus one derivative of this you take the derivative of that 12 12 x the 3 okay plus plus two cool notice how you follow the DDX that DDX tells you what you're taking the derivative of it says the DDX of this yeah but not that one not this one but yes this one so follow the DDX you'll say take the derivative of this little piece if you can do that for these rules it will really really help you out where you have you located getting down that far now is this the same as is that not not yet if we distribute it it should be though let's find out here we'll get our 6 x to 5 + 4x^2 plus we're going to have to foil that right okay don't worry we're not done like wait a second oh no oh no wait wait if we foil this distribute it we're going to get 12 x 5 + 2 x^2 - 12 XB - 2 well at least I see the -2 that's fine you guys okay with the distribution just some basic algebra here now if we do combine some like terms I see a 18 x to 5th cool I see a 12 x - 12 x 3r gotcha I see a 6x2 I have minus two got Aus two now say we wanted to find the second or third derivative can we just use that polom from that point oh sure yeah find the second one bam just look at these are the same derivative right it is the same this is just a different way to go about it of course you like I said before could you distribute that and do it this way absolutely for this one that might be the easier way to go about it it's it's a product rule with just one parenthesis but as soon as you have some exponents everything changes and you definitely don't want to do this if there's some exponents Associated so keep in mind we're building up to things okay we're not there yet we're building up to things I'm giving you kind of like the the groundwork for the stuff we're doing later so yeah you need to understand the product rule before we get to something that's called The Chain rule because then you're going to be using the product rule in associ in combination with that thing and in combination with the quotient rule in combination with these other ideas so you do have to understand it but I'm showing you right now that they they are the same uh it's just a different way to go about it do you guys understand the idea there also have you read through the book the proof of this the proof's in there it's actually not a hard proof there's just one little thing that they do uh they add on an expression that equals zero so they can Factor it and you can prove that the the product rule works really well uh sorry really easily with that so read through that if you haven't done that already that's in this section read through the proof of the product rule and the quotient rule it's not too hard to follow I promise it's not too bad read through that would you like to try a couple more let's do one more with the uh the product rule I'll give you an example of how some of the problems in your in your book are going to look that way you can kind of have a a bearing to go forward with that then we'll talk about the quotient Rule and that'll wrap up our day today so last example of just straightforward product rule it's not too bad all it is is you have to remember uh what the what this this does a der of the first times a second plus the first times a d of the second remember that uh be able to identify what products are and then you're good to go by the way did I show you last time why we don't have to use the product rule for something like this just that term even though it's being multiplied did I show you that okay cool because when they do the product rule with that the derivative the constant goes to zero and that piece falls out of the the expression okay let's do that 1 + X2 and then X2 firstly you need to be able to see that this is in fact a product do you see it's a product what we mean by a product is not just like this okay this wouldn't be considered a product rule explain the difference between something like this and something like this when I say product rule I don't mean what's different between here and here what is Con the constant okay even this this wouldn't be a product rule expon not exponents not just exponents grouped terms though these are group terms you have two different groups of terms with the square root okay different terms that involve what constants or variables okay product rule means we're multiplying variables okay Expressions that have variables in them so this do you need a product rule for that no no that's just a constant you could actually pull that outside of your whole derivative uh the derivative of this thing is going to be 1 * 3 that's what it's going to be okay dtive of X is 1 D of two is 0 1 * 3 would be 3 that would be the derivative right so you get that even if you distributed the three that'd be fine so we're not talking about products of constants times things we're talking about products of functions in terms of x times functions in terms of X are you with me on this which is why we don't have to use the product rule when we find the Der of that piece that's just a constant times something we're talking about functions of x times functions of X you need to see the difference are you okay on the difference in that you sure so do we have a a function in terms of x times a function in terms of X on that problem up there yeah in fact this is it right [Music] there let me erase that three we don't need that let's go ahead and let's try to set up the product rule now could you distribute it and do the work that way of course yeah of course you could you could distribute this would be squ < TK of X Plus x s X2 > X you would have to combine some some exponents there but then you could take a derivative not too bad maybe I'll show you that in just a minute if we do the product rule however why don't you guys figure out how to write out the product rule set up the DDX of the first expression times the second plus the first expression time DDX of the second I want to see that on your paper I want to see the work I don't want to see just the answer okay at this point you're learning this stuff so I want to see every step I want to see it written out just the way I've showed you so derivative of the first time the second plus the first time the derivative of the second after that the calculus is done then you just got to do some elge so first I want to see if you have it set up right let's see check your paper what should have is the derivative of the first times a second function in terms of X do you guys all have that okay then we have What A Plus or a minus between them it's always a plus plus product product Plus plus what comes next do I need parentheses around that I've told you how important parentheses are for this right parentheses being multiplied by something that's important stuff so have that times the derivative of the second expression so hands how many people made it that far great if you made it that far you understand the product rule it's a dtive the first time second plus the first * the Der of the second we have that down now we just have to follow the DDX the DDX is the calculus for us right that's the derivative at this point so if you just follow that little piece take a derivative piece by piece you the right answer so understanding product rule great then just do the DDX okay they're all going to be kind of basic derivatives that we've seen before it's just applying them together within the context of a quotient or rule or a product rule or we'll find out later a chain rule derivative of 1 + X2 what does this give you please great derivative of one is zero derivative of x^2 is 2x * the < TK of X Plus do I take the derivative of this no okay so 1 + x^2 I'll leave it in parentheses time oh derivative of theare root of x might want to change that huh so if we did I'll WR the extra step so you can see it we' do yeah X to the2 if we take that derivative that's 12 x to the2 did you get 12 x to2 cool deal all right very good now making it maybe just a little bit prettier 2x rootx you could combine those with fractional exponents if you wanted to what's on the denominator of this expression on the denominator of this expression on the denominator there's a two there's for sure a two because of that one2 you see the two what else root X because X to the1 that says denominator and then the 1/2 says it's a square root 1 + x^2 is on the numerator unless we want to get fancy and break that stuff up find common denominators we're just about done with that problem how many people feel okay with this one can we conver Square to fractions and sure we can do that as well uh you'd have to distribute from here you'd probably distribute that you'd have uh 12 x 1/2 here and you'd have uh plus 12 x to the 3 and then you would combine that with your other use fractions over there because you two yeah we could do that we could try that so this is 2x2 that's see 1 plus a half is 3 plus if we distribute you'll get 12 x to -2 plus 12 x 3 and we're getting that because of course when you multiply those exponents you add them you add those exponents together that's the three for you so I've just distributed and distributed 12 x to2 and then 12 the x s and the X to 1/2 gives you X to 3 are you all right with that then sure you could combine these as well you end up with like five 5 x 3 yeah 5es X to 3 plus 12 x to the2 if you want to leave it in terms of of x exponents that's probably what you would end up with is those exponents just like that and that's an acceptable way that's actually exactly what you'd get if you distributed this and then took the derivative if you just do it in your head if you want to think about it if you distribute this you're going to get rootx right square root of x the derivative of that is this right there you see it the derivative of this is this one you follow distribute this this is going to be X to 5 she the five halves out of that x to the 12+ 2 x to 12 plus x to the 5 Hales that's what that is distributed uh if you can't get that do it later on your own distribute that and figure out those exponents this derivative is that piece right there the piece of this derivative is 5 halv exra three Hales it's right there it's the same thing same exact thing you okay with this so far all right cool let me show you one more and this kind of this really illustrates the idea of the product rule and see if you can you can do it in general kind of a fun little problem almost like a little puzzle not a hard puzzle don't worry this one time my parents I love my parents to death but they gave me this one puzzle it was uh you've ever done a puzzle that doesn't have straight edges very difficult it was shaped like a butterfly right and instead of having like normal butterfly it was like a psyched GIC butterfly like what do you call it stuff the TIY what it tie-dye yeah it was a tie-dye butterfly with non- straight edges and a non- straight outline I spent at least 18 hours doing it and then ended up burning in the fire blaze it's so ridiculous so it's not a puzzle like that okay this is like one of those four piece jigsaw puzzles you get in like third grade okay no maybe kindergarten puzzles okay you got it fine a double sided puzzle it's not a double-sided puzzle that not fun either two different pictures on different picture on each side oh man that'd be ridiculous not one of those either no it's this puzzle you see before you could have gotten around this problem without without doing the prod rule you could have gotten around this problem this one well you you might still be able to to do that however it's going to be a little bit easier if you if you do the product rule with it the idea is what if you have this and I tell you only two things about it I say F of 2 is 3 frime of 2 is1 and I say find G Prime of 2 that's my goal okay well it's not not too bad what we're going to have to do though is figure out some pieces to fill in we want to find the first derivative of G and then fill in the two do you follow me on this so let's go ahead let's use the product r firstly do you see why we need the product rule here do you see it do you see why do you have a function in terms of x times a function in terms of X this is a function of X yes this is another function of X and they're being multiplied that's definitely the product rule so what I'd like you to do just follow the product rule with this go ahead and do that now follow the product rule I want you to find G Prime of X derivative of the first * the second plus the first * the derivative of the second just write it out derivative of the first time a second yes plus plus the first times a derivative of the second if you want to use DDX you can would you agree that that is in fact the product rule for this problem derivative of the first yep times the second okay plus first got it time second I don't care that the the function is not listed it's F ofx whatever that happens to be that's what would go here and that's what would go here just like in our other examples you you with me on there well let's do the derivative where we can give me the derivative of x^2 + 1 so this is 2x * FX true plus do you take the derivative of that x^2 + 1 still needs to be in parentheses ladies and gentlemen times what's the derivative of f ofx ah frime of x how you'd write that we don't have the actual function but you know that frime of X stands for the derivative of f ofx do you see that okay cool now this would you agree is G Prime of X that's a derivative of G that's what that is what we want to find out is G Prime of 2 what does g Prime of 2 tell you to do everywhere you see X plug in two Everywhere You See CX plug in two everywhere so for us that means tell me what I should have 2 * 2 great because X is two fantastic uh times F of what that's everywhere you see the x correct yeah okay F of two plus in the parentheses tell me what else I got times F Prime of what sure hey what happened to all the X's they became twos this x became two therefore every other X became a two raise your hand feel that so far so it's kind of just a little exercise so you get used to the product rule and then filling out the the numbers with the substitution let's go just a little bit further there's no more X's we can now make some substitutions I know that this is 2 * 2 so that is 4 * hey what is of two have I given you that information 4 * 3 plus this is all five five times what's frime of two cool is it possible sure yeah yeah they have to give you this though they have to tell you what that is I wouldn't be able to do this without that specific information so all together we're going to get cool yeah super fun see puzzle I told you enjoy it puzzling why I find that interesting but uh what did we just find g g Prime 2 yes that's the exactly what we did find what's it represent slope of this curve at that x value so what you just found this is actually a slope the slope would be seven of that curve whatever it is at xal 2 you see that kind of NE we're finding slope always keep that in mind what you're doing is you're finding slope and you're finding digit we still don't know what is nope no you might be able to figure it out or at least something represents it but no we don't know hey ladies and gentlemen are you okay with the product rule in general it's really not that hard of a rule if if you have this down that's it it lets you break up a problem without doing distribution so that you can do it piece by piece and that's the idea now we're going to look at the quotient rule quotient rule is just slightly more involved but it's not that hard either it's a it's again it's just a product it's it's very similar to product same idea you ready to see it yes the proof again is in your book it's not hard to follow go ahead and just look at that then you get home tonight okay so qution rule quotient rule asks this question says can you take a derivative of a quotient something in terms of X over something in terms of X that's what this this question is asking and and the idea is well can I just take the derivative of F and divide by the derivative of G do you think that's going to work no that that never works we can't separate derivatives by multiplication unless use the product rule we can't separate derivatives by division unless use the quotient rule are you with me on that you can't just take a derivative of the top and the bottom that's never going to work for you I give you a very simple example about how that's never going to work for you if you did that you'd get something over Z true yet we know that this would be the same thing as 1/3 x^2 - 1/3 true derivative would be very easy there 2/3 x and that's it so we can't just take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator that doesn't work for us we have to have some other way to do it by the way you probably wouldn't you could but you probably wouldn't want to use a quotient rule for this very simple example you'd probably break it up just like I did here and then you take a very easy derivative the quotient Rule and the product rule are really really meant for some more extensive ideas things where you you don't have other ways to do it that that's really the the benefit of these rules so I'll show you what the quotient rule says quoti rule says okay in order to take the derivative of a quotient we're going to take some derivatives of each piece but we're going to put them together in a unique way just like we do with the product rule it says you're going to take the bottom function times the derivative of the top function I'm going to use some logic that's not quite mathematical but it's going to make you make you remember something uh product meant plus right p with P product meant Plus what's the opposite of a product a quotient what's the opposite of a plus a minus so what are you going to use here A plus or minus minus okay it's not very mathematical but that's the way you remember it okay product with plus quotient I think quotient has a straight line so quotient has another straight line quotient minus that's how I remember it actually I remember it because I've done this so many times I can't forget it it's stuck in my head like Jingle Bells I have a song for that too um any the math song for Jingle Bells just watch my videos you'll see it quadratic formula song that's right so the low function times the derivative of the high function minus the what would I do high function times the derivative low function all over square or if you prefer if you prefer if you like the DDX format like I do this says the same thing that's the same thing for this to oh there is there is and you know what I think I liked it so I'm I'm going to steal it from Michael so he he he introduced actually I've heard it before but it's a good it said it say again low D high high D L Square the bottom way we go that's right very cool low D High minus high D low Square the bottom and away we go which you have to do this with it otherwise that's a Harry Potter version of this map yeah low D high D High minus Pi d l Square the bottom and Away you go yeah derivative of the bottom I'm sorry derivative of top times of bottom or the bottom times top minus the top times a derivative of the bottom all over the bottom Square that's really what you're doing low D High minus high D low Square to the bottom way you go sound good yes is the first uh first uh is the first one supposed to be the bottom or can it be the top first can yeah hang on can you do that you mean can you interchange these two no uh the from Left of Theus sign can you interchange these two yeah absolutely not because subtractions not commutative like addition is okay if you interchange those is 5 - 7 the same as 7 - 3 I'm sorry didn't work that's not even close to the same it's 5 - 7 the same thing as S no so if I just interchange like wait a second no that's close if I interchange these two things no they're still not the same you can't take the top times the Der of the bottom minus the bottom times the D of the top that's what you're asking you could interchange these the derivative of the top times the bottom multiplication is commutative that would be fine subtraction is not so this is order dependent okay you have to do it that's not true with product rule is it that one it doesn't really matter uh but this one very much so matters that's why I like the new Mark um low D High minus high D low Square the bottom what you go you got it should we practice it I think so thought were going to no pass that I'm not going to make you sing requirement of this course so you made us do in high school I did this is no longer high school we graduated singing MH M now let's look at an example these are slightly different than the product rule because some of these examples can't be done without the potion rule at all you'll see it by the way you're going to find that the taking of the derivatives really isn't all that hard I mean you know pretty much everything there is to know at this point about taking simple derivatives right move the expon to the front you take one away from it that's a derivative of basic functions now it's just using the rules to split these up into little pieces to make them easier so if you know the rules in the dtive hey you're you're good you're fine you're good to go it's like you square the bottom away you go anyway now this problem is a slightly different than if I would have given you this look at the boards notice the difference if I give you that there's something you can do with that separate yeah that's separable you can separate into three different fractions simplify those exponents then take the derivative of every single one that actually might be the way to go for this problem you with me that'd probably be easier than using all this stuff the quotient rule separate three fractions I think some of your homeworkers like that wasn't it separate it simplify the fractions into so combine exponents and then take a der of each little piece and that's fine however as soon as you do this can you do that anymore well you can you can separate three fractions but it's not simplifi like like you did before you can't say x Cub over 2x + 5 is one one term you can't do that anymore you can't separate this 2x plus the five can't do that you see what I'm talking about there now there might be a way if you multiply by the con no still even that it make it worse nothing good can come of this the only thing we can do is is understand that hey that is in fact a quotient right does it fall into the category of the quotient rule which means I have a function in terms of X over a function in terms of X do I I wouldn't want to do it for this that's not a function in terms of X that would just be two that in that case separate them man is so much easier don't use the quo work for stuff you can you can do other things with usually other things are easier so let's try to set up the quoti well why don't you do it you know what I'll do it with you the first I'll give you one in just a second to set it up cuz I want to show you how exactly I want it for dydx that would be the derivative of y with respect to X we're going to take low D High minus high D low all over the bottom squared and then a way or whatever this is um we're going to do that but I do want to see your work I'll give you a partial credit if I see that you know how to do the quotient rule okay which means I want to see every little step you're learning this right now and if I see wrong answers at the end I want to see where your mistakes happened so I want to see all this work understand I want to see it so we take the G of X in that case is the the bottom function the 2x + 5 the low the D the high low D High minus the high the what's our high again and then the D L sounds like c l guess what's The Voice show by the way get so yeah some student earlier said do you have ADD like I don't know look at that butterfly funny over the low Square the bottom Square so we have you don't need brackets here you parentheses if you want low D High minus Pi d l Square the bottom and you're done doesn't quite have the same how many people can follow that though Rich right notice how we we've changed this this quotient into something well these are very easy derivatives very easy you just have to follow the rule to make sure you get it to easy derivatives everything is pretty much going to be like that memorize the derivatives know how to do the derivatives memorize the rules and put them together that's it nothing too extraordinary you know just follow the rules that I give you and you'll be fine I know I make it sound very easy right now okay some of the rules yeah you have to really know how they interplay I'll show you that as we get going but if you understand the rules really well the class becomes kind of a piece of cake after that does the 2x+ 5 change does The X Cub - 3x^2 - 5 change follow the D DDX follow the derivative uh everybody what is the derivative of this please so far so good I don't want to see this garbage from you guys anymore you leave that I'm marking off points from you why you absolutely must have parentheses you're going to be Distributing that in just a second okay so you must have parenthesis there you leave me just this I'm going go no you don't understand what you're doing that's different than this so show me the parentheses where they're applicable does this change no there's no DDX associate with that so X Cub - 3x^2 - 5 okay does this change Y what is that now I don't need parentheses around the two okay that's just one one factor that's all right but the other things yeah you got to have those all over well we're going to have the 2x + 5 and we're going to have a square rarely will you distribute this rarely will you distribute this this one yes we'll distribute this and we'll combine them rarely will you distribute that and the reason is if you can simplify you will you'll try to simplify that thing and it's already factored for you very nicely okay you don't want to get the 4x^2 whatever not Plus 25 but you get 4x^2 + 20x + 25 that's what you get uh you don't really need to do that just leave it the way it is this works out for us very nicely especially when you start graphing these which hint hint you're going to graph those uh without a calculator it's fun like another puzzle double-sided butterfly with psychedelic colors it's that type of puzzle but it's still kind of fun so not a throw in the fireplace type of puzzle it's a fun puzzle uh we we'll talk about how to do that and this form fits a little bit better for us so we'll continue let's go ahead and distribute this can you tell me what you get when you distribute okay I actually heard none of you I'm just doing this in my head thanks a lot guys appreciate it that's okay I know you know how to distribute I'm going to do both these at the same time the negative and the two so - 2xb + 6 x^2 + 10 do you see where the + 6 x^2 and the + 10 are coming from okay good maybe little combine like terms here if we combine some like terms I'm seeing the X cubes that gives me that 4X cubed awesome well I got a whole bunch of x squ going on don't I by the way if I'm making a mistake you let me know I get see a 12 -2 POS 15 POS 6 that looks like it's going to be nine dou that one - 30X that's your derivative what did we just find what's this what's that stand for that's derivative what's the derivative stand for slope of that curve at what point whatever I want so if I asked you to find the slope at xals 1 could you do it sure you plug one into here to find the point 1 comma something true then you plug one into here to find the slope you'd have a slope and a point y - y1 = MX X1 you can find the slope of that that tangent line to that curve at that point so this is still a slope formula now what you would do in general you try to factor this and simplify it if you if you can you can still do that sometimes that will help you now when you have like an X cubed don't really worry about that that so much those are fairly difficult to factor in general if you can try it see what you can do could you take a second derivative of that yes you see you'd have to have another quotient rule however I haven't showed you how to deal with that exponent yet so when you did low D High minus high D low that d low would be the derivative of 2x + 5^ S right so you'd have to distribute that at this point or use a product rule within that at this point yes you can use rules within rules we're going to have a lot of that in this class for instance if you if I do a problem like this one I'm not going to do this for you I just want to give you a heads up if I ask you to find the derivative of that do you see how firstly there is a product rule function of x times a function of X that's product rule then when you go through that as you're doing that that's the first thing you see from the outside in you see a product rule right as you're going through the product rule it would be derivative of the first that'd be fine times the second still okay plus the first all right times the derivative of the second and as soon as you get to the derivative of the second how do you take the derivative of that thing it's a quotient rule you would have a quotient rule that is within the product rule see that so we're going to talk a lot about this how the rules will have an inter play which ones you do first and which ones you do second basically if you can follow the DDX follow the first rule then follow the DDX and wherever you have a quotient then you use quotient rule or a then use product rule we'll get there probably get there right now let's try one that's not very that much put Segway you that wasn't my segue it was a 2C segue come on that's good for me I have ad apparently I the opposite of ad I focus only on math and other things all right now we're going to do this the hard way we're going to do the hard because I want you to see it but there is an easier way to do this the easier way to do this would probably be to distribute this combine like terms and then use one quotient rule right but I want you to see I want you to see how the product rule will play in this because if I do one thing you can't do it anymore I gave you like a five well you definitely wouldn't be Distributing that anymore right so you better learn the other way because I'm certainly going to give you something like that you're going need be able to do it so we're going to learn how to associate the the product rule with the quotient Rule and use a rule within a rule right here now when you look at the first rule to use you got to see which one which one's overlying ENC compassing more of the problem the product rule or the quotient rule qu the quotient rule clearly is it says the product is actually within that quotient do you see it so the first rule we're going to use is quotient rule let's write out the quotient rule what is it again low low de high low what iss my low do I do anything to the low right now low then what D high so we're going to do D high oh nasty low de high and then what minus okay like the minus low DEH High minus the high okay uh real quick I want look at the board here real quick make sure that when you distribute this you still have a a bracket if you distribute St a bracket CU that negative will ultimately change those signs you see what I'm talking about that's important so you would't distribute the negative now you distribute all this and then do the negative lastly let you need a big old bracket around that thing high and then D who low all over what ladies and gentlemen you're saying gra will go from the high the derivative of the second yeah okay yeah that thing like that cuz you distribute all that and then the negative would go okay now can you just stop a side do your product rule for your oh we're going to we're going to do this right now so but I need you to understand that this certainly is the quotient rule for us are you okay with that as quotient Rule now you follow your DDX don't don't change anything much at all this isn't going to change x^2 + 2 s sure this isn't going to change except for that derivative 3x -1 x^2 + 4 and that would give you a * 2x are you okay on that DED yet this is the rough one do you see what this does to you so you'd say this is fine x^2 + 2 okie dokie got that then you follow your DDX and go I don't have to take the derivative of this I do have to take the derivative of this and as soon as you do that to see how that's like a problem within a problem that is a product rule product rule says Dera of the first * the second plus the first * the Der of the second you'd get that this one well we didn't change that at all this one we followed the DDX and just got the 2x so I'll do this very quickly so you just get the answer uh that I'm looking for the derivative of the first * the second plus the first times the D the second that would be your problem do you see how oh I did it really quickly you would show your work off the side and actually should do the product rule this is 3x2 + 4 plus x^2 I'm sorry sorry 2x the Der that is 2x 3x - 1 that's that little piece right there so that's the the product rule after that if you wanted to spend I I'd be impressed if you got down to this far okay that'd be fine um if you want to spend the time and distribute and distribute and then distribute and then distribute and distribute don't foret the negative and then combine all those like terms you use something pretty nasty looking but it's it would be a a polinomial in this case do you see the polinomial I'm not going to go that far it's going to it take me 10 minutes just to distribute everything do you understand the idea of the product rule working with the quos rule what you have to do if you okay with that all right very good
