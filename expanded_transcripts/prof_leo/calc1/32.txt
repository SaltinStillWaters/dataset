Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 5.3:  Volume of Solids By Cylindrical Shells Method
okay the theory part of how to do cylindrical shells I briefly went over this last time it's not on the videotape so don't look for it uh but I briefly went over this last time here's our idea can we take this region that's Bound by our two vertical lines at A and B and F ofx revolve it around the Y AIS and get the volume of that Sol that's created and I just finished saying this we can use the the disc or washer method but notice how if you consider this in terms of Y that would have to be two different functions in terms of Y top bottom and then top bottom that's what you'd have to revolve around so that necessitate two completely different integrals and our question is is there a way that we can do this with only one integral and that's where the cylindrical shells method idea comes in says yeah you know what maybe we do maybe we just consider this to be a function of X revolved around so we have basically this idea hopefully you can see the image I'm trying to draw it's not that easy to draw the Swift Out volume of this this figure being revolved around the Y AIS we get kind of this I think it I called it a Jello mold last time looks like a Jello mold to me it's got that like cavity in there maybe it's upside down pineapple cake even have those oh my gosh so good but anyway that's that's the idea and we said what if we could take and instead of thinking of this as washers cuz it wouldn't work that well for us because again if you thought of this as washers you'd have one two different functions in terms of Y which is the axis upon which you are revolving you got me on that if you're going around y with discs and washers they had to be in terms of Y not X so that says in terms of y That's one function and that's another one in terms of Y that would be two different volumes here that we're talking about it'd be like this perfect cylinder volume and then the top little piece volume that's what you would have to do as if you were to use washers did you get the idea now if we talk about cylindrical shells it says this imagine you have this cake thing right this it has a hole in the middle and it has some some cake around it's perfect perfect circular shape and you take a coffee can and you go and and you you pull it out what you're going to get is a cylinder right the top of it's going to be a little bit not perfectly straight it's not going to look exactly like this it's going to have a little lip to it does the lip actually matter for us imagine the idea of limits what are we going to end up doing to the size of that cylinder the thickness is is of that cylinder is going to go very very very very very very small so we're going to take out these these basically cylindrical chunks of cake coffee C coffee can take it out you get this chunk of cake you got it go a little bit bigger you got another chunk of cake slightly bigger like concentric circles you get the picture bigger and you keep on slicing this cake up up with these larger and larger coffee cans now eventually we're going to say the coffee can is increasing infinitesimally small so they're they're all just little circles that are that have some sort of height to them barely any width at all that's the idea of the limit right taking that width to zero and then find the volume of each of those cylinders so the question comes down can you find the volume of a cylinder I don't know let's think about it we want to P go for each region find the volume would you agree that the volume is going to be the area of the cross-section times the height we've already done that several times if I took a cross-section that's going to give you some sort of surface area the big circle minus the little circle the area of the big circle minus the little circle gives you the area of the cross-section Times by height and we're going to get the volume of that particular cylinder not your have you're in agreement good because I'm right you should you should know that so we know that this is going to be the area of cross-section times height we got to find the area of cross-section what is the figure what's the shape of our cross-section cular it is circle yeah in fact every Circle and it's a washer it is it's a big circle and then a little circle and we'll subtract big circle minus little circle well every Circle has a radius every Circle has a radius let's call this one or doesn't really matter what we call them let's call this one R1 and this one R2 sorry if you can't see that it says R2 so radius one Radius 2 radius one would be the the radius of the larger Circle radius two would be the radius of the smaller Circle how do you find area of crosssection circle area of the circle area of the circle not just radius one minus Radius 2 that's going give us a difference in radi we want to find the area of the first radius minus the area of the radius so area of the cross-section then should be Pi Radius 1^ 2 minus Pi radius 2^ 2 times oh times the height and Joe said what's the height function the function absolutely you're right the height is the function look at this can you see that the height at each little piece is going to be the function's height now we're going a little bit uh Beyond where we're at we're just talking about cylinder right now the cylinder let's kind of imagine that it is flat the height is going to be the function's height wherever that would be you follow me on that now when we get to this point we're going have to pick the arbitrary point in between that's what we're going to do over here the arbitrary point then we'll find the height at the arbitrary point which won't matter because our our distance between point go to zero saying the arbitrary point it's fine so times the height well the height is the function at X so what that means you know what let's leave can I do this later I don't I want to be very accurate about it I don't want to give you f ofx can I just leave it h for now I'll work around it I I'll get you f ofx over here I want to give you H that way I can pick an arbitrary point and be actually really accurate so would you three that this is the volume think about it area of big circle minus area of a little circle that gives you the section or the sectional area cross section area times the height that's going to give you a volume don't you you're all right I'm going to do some fancy math with you ready for some fancy math yeah sure okay fancy first first math not fancy math we're going to factor out the pi no problem here comes the fancy math R1 2- R2 2 is a difference of squares you see it mean you can Factor it as different squares which means I can do that difference of squar says that if you don't believe me distribute it take this times this you will get that true statement now comes a real fancy math nothing's really hard but I'm trying to get this in terms of things that you're going to understand in a second uh what I'm going to do would you agree that if I multiply this expression by two and2 I really haven't changed the value multiply by two and I multiply by 1/2 2 * 1/2 gives you one so I'm going to be multiplying by one in a very special way here what I'm going to do is say I'm going to make it two I use black so you see the change here two PI 12 then all that stuff you agree that's the same thing same expression same value at least I want you to think of what we actually have here if I reorganize this just a little bit what do I want to do I want to do that just reorganized I move this here move the H here and put a bracket around the 1/2 times the the radius one one of plus we're not adding we're multiplying which one which difference of square oh sorry yes thank you good call Shane yeah I made that mistake anything else did you caught are we good pretty sure we're right I've just categor I've just organized these ones put a bracket around it move this here but I want you to think of what this this means H is the height sure what is R1 minus R2 that's the second one R1 minus R2 what's it represent over here the thickness that's exactly right the difference in the radi very good which would give you the thickness of the shell you follow me on that this is going to be the thickness of the shell what's 12 R1 + R2 what happens when you add two things together and multiply by 12 you get the average this is the average of the radi so the average of the radi this is the thickness of your shell so basically what I've got for you here this is what we want to make in general in terms of f of x and x we have 2 pi times the average radi or average radius I'm sorry times the height times the thickness would you wish feel okay getting that far on that this row yes you guys okay with it any questions on on how we got that little manipulation but it really comes out to average radius sure height and then we have our thickness what we're going to try to do now is match up parts in terms of F ofx and these things Joe question um cindal shell both of them are both of the since they're like two different shells in each other does that mean that the same function would just have different radiuses same function okay same function yeah you mean f ofx right right yeah this this this top part is flat right now because I'm trying to get you this idea over here and over here it's technically not flat it does have a little bit of a function to it right now what we're going to allow it to do is come really close to the function doesn't matter what we're concerned about right now is how to find average radius how to find the height the height is going to be given by the function so that's kind of nice and the thickness are you ready to start on on this one sure it's good question good question here's what we're going to do we're going to make a shell within this cylindrical shell one little cut we're going to make a cylindrical cut basically at oh let's talk about where it's at if this is X subk it has stand for a random shell right just some random cut x sub K if this is X subk okay what we're doing here basically think about this we're going to take this is going to be kind of a weird concept but but think about finding the area how we took little Cuts right we took all these little sections like this you with me where each of the thicknesses were Delta X true if I take those cuts and I revolve them also around the Y AIS you see how I'm going to get the shells I'm going to get those coffee can things I'm going to get the shells out of it so this is xub K this one's got to be xub kus1 it just stands for the previous cut what we're going to do is within this solid shell we're going to make another cut arbitrary Point how do we call our arbitrary points what do we label XK dot look I'm I'm trying to make this so you understand from the area idea this was like x sub 1 x sub 2 xub 3 x sub k whatever it was and we took an arbitrary cut in here XK dot remember that if we take an arbitary cut in there we're going to make a cut at XK dot but that Cut's going to go all the way around our figure there don't so not now don't so not now now here's the key to doing this appropriately for us we have to choose XK dot to be the midpoint of that interval you'll see why in a second so make a cut at at XK dot which is going to be the midpoint of our section can you tell me something in relation to x k x subk and x sub K minus one what's a midpoint it's say it again average we're going to use that in a second would you agree that if I put x k dot right in the middle of our section it's the average of those two numbers no matter what they are you follow me on this okay so this is this is basically average average okay only two more things we have to do what is the thickness what's the thickness from here to here it it's XK minus what say that would give you XK minus one very good yeah that's that's right by definition hey what what's the thickness of any cut come on now people think back think back what's the thickness of your cut Delta X or Delta X remember Delta X we took a thickness of our cut always Delta X the thickness of our cut here is Delta X and we're revolving that Delta X around Delta X by definition is x subk - x sub K minus one that's what it is so this is Delta X thickness is Delta X now we can actually talk about height I left it here as H for height but I want to talk about the height is at XA dot notice how I can't look I couldn't really I want to be accurate I couldn't really give you f ofx here because I can't tell you I can't tell you what the function is the height of the function is of this whole thing but as soon as I pick an arbitrary Point as soon as I pick that exact point can you tell me the height of that exact point yes that's the difference so as soon as I pick XK dot how much is our height X very good yeah height is f of xp. sweet love it you know what we're almost done almost done let's look at what we wanted to find and you said you understood this right at least you said hopefully you didn't lie to me 2 pi constant we going to have it average radius that's this okay do we have something that represents the average radius up here yeah in fact if you think about what the radi are they are XK and XK minus one the average of which must be XK dot the midpoint of that interval we chose it to be the midpoint for a reason so that we could come down here and say 2 pi is going to be there average radius x k dot yep that is the average radius times height height we now know that as soon as we pick that that arbitrary point which Happ has to be in the middle of it okay I guess it's not so arbitrary anymore as soon as we pick the midpoint of it we can find the height at that little cutting the little cutting within uh the like cylinder of C of of coffee cake sounds like coffee can cake whatever the that little cylinder of cake we can go right in the middle of that we can find the height of the function at that point did you follow me on that so the height is is f of XK do and the thickness well the thickness by definition is just the thickness of our cut the thickness of our cut revolved around the whole thing revolved around the y- axis the thickness of this piece then has to be Delta X that's not our formula that's our formula for for one individual shell of X subk that's one of them how do I find all of them then youate no not yet not a limit yet this is one of them how do I find more of them I add them all up yes this is one shell this is an approximation for all the shells approximation for all the shells how do I find the exact the exact volume as what good yeah it says basically take that coffee can and make up an Infinity number of them where they go out just a teeny little little bit what happens when you take a limit of a sum what do you get out of that that's what it is so we have volume is an integral from where wherever our integral starts our interval starts A to B 2 pi what happens XK dots when I when I take limits what do they become random arit random arbitrary points become actually just a representation for all X's X so F of XK dot becomes not not x f of x and what do Delta xes become this is called the method of shells also please note it's perfectly appropriate to do this around the other axis going Direction y but you're going to Note One Thing please W this is where people make just big mistakes try to make it real clear it's kind of like the punch line for us we got a few minutes left this kind of like the punch line okay when we did shells and washers the axis upon which you revolve like the x- axis is the terms in which your function must be so in order to go around the x- axis you had to have in terms of X Y axis in terms of Y look what happens here it switches this is around the Y AIS it's got to be in terms of X okay around the x axis would be in terms of Y look it we're revolving this around the Y it's still in terms of X we never switched variables so please make sure your notes are correct this is for I'm not making a mistake here this is counter this is what this is correctly okay I'm not making mistake I'm doing this deliberately this is around the Y AIS this one is around the Y the x- axis true St true story true story now did you understand it yeah I'd like to set one up for you just one you'll find out that they're they're not too hard to set up I I I want to make sure you see it before you go because it's all been Theory today and it hasn't been anything substantial well it's been very substantial but not anything concrete I want to give you a concrete before you go can you guys hang on for a minute man that was a lot of work a lot of work for find the volume of the region inclosed by y = theun x x = 1 x = 4 which are vertical lines revolved around the Y AIS first question I have for you since we're revolving around the Y AIS with this method cylindrical shells method is this okay or not around the Y AIS okay or not in terms of X means your terms are xes solve for one okay maybe this way around the Y solve for y around the X solve 4X okay in terms of X in terms of Y different so is this appropriate for round the Y with this cylindrical shells method would it be appropriate for for uh discs or washers no no it's different it's like backwards so be very careful on that now we'll set this up here's what this says to do the volume is integral from where do we start xal 1 that's line going for down 1 to 4 they're clapping for me we good what goes in inside come on help me out real quick Pi 2 pi look at what happens look what this says it says x no matter what you're going to have an X there so you just tack on an X then it says f of x what's f of x and then so this is the integral from 1 to 4 we'll pull out the 2 pi let's do that we have x * < TK X DX how do you do that integral x * X DX what would you do exponents yeah exactly so 2 pi x * x 12 power DX 2 pi hopefully you can do this in your head we have a one and a 1/2 that's going to be three is the integral really hard set up just set up 1 4 we've got 2 pi the integral would be X to 5 over 5 from 1 to 4 simplify a little bit you're going to have 2 piun * 2 x 5 over 5 here's probably how I would do this I would take the four pi over 5 out of it and I just worry about the X to 5s from 1 to four notice I'm taking the 4 over 5 with the pi and I'm just woring about that piece now do this makes it easier 4 Pi 5 I'm going to have 4 to the 5 - 1 to 5 no no fraction that that makes it nice when you do this now four the 5es I know how to do this pretty quick in my head I take a square root of four and I take the fifth power that's 32 I take 1 to 5S anything to one to anything is one so this is 31 hopefully I did that correctly < TK of 4 is 2 2 5 is 32 so you're going to have 4 FS 4 fths pi times 30 what I say plus 31 * 4 124 your volume is 124 pi over 5 without having to do sh uh washers or disc shells well we're continuing talking about how to do some volumes now we of course we've covered some disc method and washer method we're just getting into the cylindrical shells method which is the idea of I think I mentioned the cake and the coffee can right cutting slices of cake out and find the volume of each cylinder and then we're adding up all those cylinders so it was different than shells and washers because I'm sorry discs and washers because with discs and washers whatever axis you're revolving around that that's what the the functions need to be in terms of so around the x- axxis in terms of X around the y axis in terms of Y the cylindrical shells me it kind of flips that it says if we're going around the Y AIS that's when you want in terms of x if you're going around the x- axis that's when you want in terms of why are you foll me on that it's it's it's backwards almost like it's backwards so that gets confusing for a lot of people so let me ask you this in this question if we're going to revolve some region around the Y AIS are these formulas good the way they are or do we need to change those functions what do you think if we're going around the Y AIS it should be in terms of you need to understand what in terms of X means is this in terms of X this one's good either way by the way if you notice that that's that's fine uh is this one in terms of X yes this is in terms of X get it in your head that in terms of X means the terms should be X terms there are or solved for y so around y for syrial shells solved for y or in terms of x those mean the same thing they have to mean the same thing to you so again I asked this question if we're going around the y- axis which we are here is this okay yeah good now we remember that our formula for the volume was what I give you 2 pix F ofx DX only here well we got two functions so we're going to do something very similar to finding the area between two curves remember finding the area between two curves how you took the top curve minus the bottom curve we can do the same thing here same exact thing we'll take the top volume minus the bottom volume basically the top function will sweep out a bigger volume the bottom function will sweep out a smaller volume if we subtract those two volumes what it will give us is basically the volume between the top function and the x-axis minus the bottom function and the x-axis and that will give us the remaining volume between our two functions so it will look very very similar to area between two curves for us though that means well firstly how do I find a and b and secondly how do I figure out which one is on top how would I find a and b in this case what do you think set to each other okay let's do that let's do X = x^2 we can solve it and what we find is that x = 0 or xal 1 you okay with the zero or one yeah you know folks you okay with it so we just found our bounds of integration that's kind of nice we already have that set up so we're going from 0 to 1 very good does the 2 pi ever change for us so we're going to get a 2 pi does The X ever change for us the X this x the X going to be there no matter what it's always going to be there unless it's a Y unless we're going around the x axis and then that's a a y variable you follow me so the x is going to be there what we care about finding is the F ofx in this case now be careful but set it up just like you would the area between two curves so we're going to find the function of the top the function of the bottom and subtract them and I'll talk about that in just a second can you find the function on the top oh I hope so how would you do it cool so we got from 0 to 1 plug in2 if I plug in 1/2 to X I get 1/2 if I plug in2 to X2 I get 1/4 that tells you X is on the top and X2 is on the bottom raise your hand feel okay with that so far cool so when we plug this stuff in we go all right well F ofx it's not just one function anymore it's the top one minus the bottom one when you think about that I hope it makes sense to you just just think for a second think if I distributed this and I broke those integrals up what would have is the volume underneath this minus the volume underneath this or in other words the volume of the top one revolved around the Y minus the volume of the bottom one revolved around the Y that gives us the remaining volume you got it same very similar idea to area between two curves now let's go ahead and work on how to do that integral what's the first thing you would do go for it oh yeah i' probably pull out 2 pi as well so from 0 to one what else are you going to do definitely distribute don't try a substitution if you can do it easier than that so most of these aren't substitutions most of them are pretty basic just a little manipulation x^2 - x Cub DX that means we're going to get 2 piun I'll do it as X Cub over 3 - x 4 over 4 and we're going from 0 to 1 so that gives you 2 pi if we plug in the one you're going to get 1/3 minus 1/4 I'm going to test the zero just to make sure I don't miss anything but we're going to get zero in this case but you want to have it in mind that way in case you had like a minus one up here x - 1 Cub you wouldn't miss that fraction so that is going to be a zero so basically we have 2 pi * if you do that fraction I believe you get oh what is that how much you said 112 so we're going to get how much six five over six now of course I'm going through this a little bit quickly because you know how to do the integrals you know how to plug the numbers in do you feel okay with our example guys ever here yeah are you awake today so we get the on Mondays on Mondays today last we of school Mondays I know it right I know it so notice that even though we went around the Y AIS we didn't change our variables we had in terms of X this means in terms of X so for the cylindrical shell method around y DX not Dy it's got to be in terms of X on that one let's go ahead and try one where we're going around the x- axis just so you can see it one time I'll talk about one more we'll set it up but we won't do it and that'll be the end of this particular lesson so we want to find the volume Bound by volume B by xal negative what note the negative x = y^2 + 6 Y and X = 0 around the x- axis in our case for cylindrical shells since we're practicing that right now cylindrical shells looks like this oh wait hang on we're not going around the y- axis anymore we're going around the x axis if we're going around the xaxis for cylindrical shells method our function should be in terms of what okay are they in terms of Y yes y's and y's yeah that's great in terms of y means solve for X So Cal for cylindrical shells around the X solve for x or in terms of Y so for cylindrical shells you go from C to d 2 pi am I going to have an X here right now what am I going to have okay so make sure you make that change we'll call it g of Y Dy what's x equal Z this way that's actually the y- axis what that means is that we have a vertical line the y- axis that's no problem we're going to be taking just taking this function in terms of Y and going this way with it now since those are our two functions the second function is kind of nice it's just a zero how can we find our C and our d here what would you do set equal to what yeah here we set the two functions equal to each other right that was that not a problem well here look it you can still do the same exact thing you have xal 0 and x = y^2 + 6 y so let's just set those things equal to each other from here oh how you going to solve it I would do the same thing factor a negative y out you're going to get yeah now by rights you should determine which function is on the top the yal on the right the yal 0 or the I'm sorry the xal 0 or the x = y^2 + 6 y so plug a number in there just to make sure because you notice if you did it backwards you're going to get a negative volume right if you do that can you ever have a negative volume so some of you on your homework who are giving me negative volumes you're doing it wrong you can't get a negative volume it's not going to happen so I'm going to take like a a one just plug in one if you plug in one here you still get zero if you plug in one here you're going to get five so that means this function is on the in this case on the right or on the on the top but for for y functions we get on the right so let's go ahead and try to set up our integral uh can you tell me where we start and where we stop if you want to see this again it'd go from 0 to six you'd plug in the number one if you plug in one that's still zero xal 0 if you plug in one here you get five so that's y^2 plus 6 y that's on the top I heard some of you say from 0 to 6 you're absolutely right what's going to come first again tell help me help me out with that yeah you know what don't forget the 2 pi some I was doing this problem quickly earlier I forgot the 2 pi I'm like wait a second pretty sure there's supposed to be a pi in there cuz we're circular so I forgot all about it don't forget the 2 pi that would make a big difference 2 pi and then what else good so this first part does not change what does change is the G of Y depending on what we have first and second uh what what are we going to put for our G of Y can you help me out with that good do I have to subtract off another function here no it would be zero I'm not going to show the zero but if you had a different function right now You' subtract off the second function in this case the zero would be on the bottom now I forgot something kind of crucial what am I forgetting here yeah that's that's huge okay well walk me through it again what are you going to do well we're pretty much good to go as far as intergral inter goes now nothing too tricky about these besides the setup and making sure you have them just rock solid and plugging the points in if we do that integral we're so far along right now I mean I don't even have to ask you for it I know you can do it you're going to get y 4 over 4 you're going to get 6 y Cub over 3 which eventually we're going to simplify that down to 2 y cubed and you're going to be going from 0 to six so that's our 2 pi if we plug those numbers in what you get just make sure you don't do this okay watch this negative that does not go with the exponent you know the difference right if I had negative Y in parentheses yes y 4 no what this means is 6 4 over 4 it means like this it doesn't mean with that negative included that would change your problem drastically wouldn't it instead of a positive you get or a negative you get a positive if you did incorrectly plus I'm going to change that to a two * 6 cub and I'm going to check for the zero still now I know Zer is going to give me zero and zero I'm just going to put it up there to make sure I don't forget it anywhere that way I don't lose track of anything that I might need any fractions now if you do 6 to the 4th power I believe you get 1,296 can someone double check that for me so you got 1,296 6 over 4 plus oh you know what I made a big mistake do you see it that should be a I don't know where I got the two from it but that should be a six I saw that two oh I did oh I did it right oh look at that I was a genius I did in my head my bad you know why because I was going to do 6 to 4th again and divide by three so 12 6id 3 would be easier for me so either way whatever 6 3r then * 2 what do you get out of that 4 now I know 1296 is divisible divisible by four it's like 300 something isn't it 324 so when you combine those thetive 324 and the positive 432 you get 108 so Al together if you get 2 pi * 108 216 Pi is our volume it's kind of a cool thing right finding volume of these these objects so so far we've done two examples in like couple minutes a piece we've done one where the regions bounded between two curves we take it around the y- AIS we note that it has to be in terms of X for cylindrical shells second one it's bounded by two curves but one of them is real simple curved one of them is just xal Z it's going around the X AIS it's got to be in terms of why how people feel okay with these two examples I want to show you one more we'll set it up I'll leave it to you to finish it up because it's just going to be a basic integral but I want to show you one more here um I think I mentioned to you before that you can do many of these with the discs and washer method you can but it makes them harder sometimes I want to show you that that's example so what I'd like to do is revolve the region bounded by this this and this around the Y AIS in order to get a a what exactly we're doing a lot of times it's nice to draw a picture so I'm going to give you a picture to see what this is this actually means okay so I'd like to tell you show you show you the difference between the shells method and the washers method you with me so let's get a nice picture going that's one by the way so we're making kind of exaggerated picture because you're going to see that the area we're dealing with isn't very big now if I do y x^2 + 1 note that that's a parabola just a parabola that is shifted up one unit so we have an x s shifted up one I'm not going to draw the other side because it's not going to be enclosing any uh area for us so I'm just going to deal with half of it then we're going to do Y = X + 1 here's + 1 here's X so I get that line that's + 1 x = 1 we talked about over here what's xal 1 vertical just like xal Z was vertical oh I need to make my Parabola fatter there we go fat Parabola we had anorexic Parabola earlier we don't want those that's bad that's be bad so this is x^2 + 1 this is x = 1 and this ISX + 1 if we're going around the Y AIS do you guys see the area we're sweeping out it's the area that's enclosed by those three different curves it's this right here now let me tell you something you can do this with washers or with shells we're g to consider it with washers first I'll show you why we have the shell method because washers would be a little ridiculous to do for washers but let's talk about washers because you really need to see it because on your test I'm not going to tell you what to do or maybe I will but you're going to need to know it so let's talk about washers if we were going this way around the Y AIS for washers would you notice that the washers would have to be in terms of Y if we're doing the washer method around the Y in terms of Y for washers around the Y solved for y for shells you hear the difference right so if if we went around the Y for washers you'd have to break it up the reason why is because you have three different functions going around the Y in terms of Y you'd have this one uh it'd be 1 - x^2 + 1 and then of course you would have the cylindrical uh the washers method so You' have the pi and this thing squared DX like that for wherever your bounds would be you'd also have to solve those oh you know what I even did that wrong why did I do it wrong explain to me if I'm going around the Y why I did that wrong still in terms of X so you'd have to solve these things for X first even to go around the Y so it'd be a tricky problem you'd have the one that'd be easy but then you to solve this curve in terms of Y then take this curve minus that one for this interval here then you'd have another integral you'd have one minus whatever this is in terms of Y and then you go from your balance of integration there so can you see the washer method here do you see why I need two integrals is really what I care about you see the two integrals if we're doing washer method this one minus this one plus this oneus this one would be the only way to do the washer method for this example or if you understand that one yeah now Shell's method says don't care about that anymore Shell's method says hey that just tells me the end of my balance because for Shell's method I want these in terms of X I want this to look like this with a top function look if I eras the purple in terms of X this one is always on top of that one do you see it oh that's nice so in terms of x if we're taking that around the Y using shells all I need to do is set up my integral from where does it start and where does it stop zero to one no problem what's going to go here well the same thing that always goes there for cindal shells we're going around the Y AIS we better have it in terms of X you with me so we have the X there inside my parentheses I'm not going to have one function right here I'm going to have two different functions you just got to be able to tell me which one's on top which one is on top and then minus like the minus what parentheses oh parentheses are those important what's going to be on the bottom little head not if you're okay with the setup for our W for our shells method we got our in terms of X cuz we're going around the Y that's how works for shells method we have the one on the top yeah great x^2 + 1 subtracting off one on the bottom you can really see from the picture here that if I was going around the volume swept out by this entire curve minus the volume swept out by that entire curve gives me the volume between those two functions between those guys you get that as well cool top minus bottom this is the same mcal shells if we do our integral we're going to have our 2 Pi still have an X in there but we definitely want to clean that up x^2 + 1 + x -1 DX X Cub + X2 DX that's 2 pi if we do our integral we're going to have x 4 4 X 3r over 3 we're going from 0 to 1 we'll leave that 2 pi hanging out there just multiply at the very end that's probably the best way you can do these we plug the one in you're going to get 1/4 + 13 I'm going to check the zero to make sure I don't have anything that that's fishy about this I want to make sure I get zeros out of them so 0 plus 0 okay I know I've got zero we got 2 pi let's see 1/4 + 1/3 should give you 7 12th and that will be 7 pi over 6 for our Volume 7 Pi 6 hey we just did three pretty hardcore examples of cylindrical shells method in about 15 minutes that's pretty good right can you guys do it I don't know that's up to you to really handle it did you understand it when I was doing it how many people did feel okay with it now notice it's going to be easier cuz I'm doing it right I mean I know the setup you can if you didn't have a picture of that if you didn't have the picture you'd have to find out where they intersected or at least draw the picture graph it on your graphing calculator but at least find out where it started and where it stopped and then find out which one's on top very similar to what we did over here then the setup the setup is the most important part you got to set it up correctly if you do really honestly is are the integrals hard know they're really easy the integral part of it plugging in numbers is just plugging in numbers but the setup is crucial for you you got to get the setup right do you guys have any questions on these two before I erase them when can't we use C cylindrical shell we we show this when we can't use washer method or when we shouldn't use it when you shouldn't um we can't why couldn't we just stick with shells and go through almost I haven't seen any problems with any examples we've done sometimes it's hard to solve for the functions like if I gave you something in terms of if I did this um around the x- axis you have to go and you have to solve that for X you have to have in terms of Y you have a square root up there so basically whatever whatever the given is use the unless there's something complicated to it use the appropriate form that makes it easier easiest to set it up do the easiest thing possible yeah you have now two ways right two methods three well two really dis and waser same thing and this I mean notice this and this was the same we subtracted functions but the same thing is dis washer uh this is like the this is like the washer version washer version of cylindrical shells this is like the disc version of cylindrical shells if if you will uh but they're the same so you have washers and you have cylindrical shells use the one that is easiest for you the one you have to do the least amount of work we're lazy people right you don't want to do hard way easy way easy way come on all right how many people feel okay about do you feel all right any last questions before we go on the last words you ready for the last section of calculus for us easy um easy easy is a relative term I'll say that the integrals will be just as easy it's just another formula you have to know really uh of course I will derive the formula for you
