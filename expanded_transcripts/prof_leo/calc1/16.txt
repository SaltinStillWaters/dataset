Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 2.7:  Implicit Differentiation
so today you're going to learn something called implicit differentiation you see so far what we've done is worked with is explicit forms of equations let me give an example this right here when you have y equals that function in terms of X or you have one y its salt or equals some function of x such as y equals 3x plus or is considered an or maybe the 3x squared plus four is an explicit form of a function explicit means lies over here your X is over here you can solve for y does that make sense for you this is explicit means Y is given explicitly tells you exactly what Y it is on the other hand is this an explicit function is why solve for itself and then X's on the other side no as a matter of fact you see Y's mixed in with X's this is called implicit form implicit means yes there's a y there and you're going to say that Y is a function of X but it's not written as y equals so Y is still function of X it's just bound up in the problem that's what implicit means so this is implicit that an interesting thing is a lot of time not a lot of time some of the times we can make an implicit function into an explicit let me show you how in this example first thing we want to solve this for y I would probably factor out the Y I get 1 plus x equals x are you with me on that and if I divide by 1 plus X I get egg y equals x over 1 plus X and that's now explicitly written so sometimes I can change from implicit to explicit so if the Y is alone on one side that means it's written explicitly so explicit why alone on one side how about this wanna see if you kind of get the idea would you say this is implicit or explicit listen explicit next course it would have y equals implicit would have y's and x's all mixed up what's this one definitely could you solve it for y okay let's try we solve for y we're going to get y squared equals four minus x squared and how would you get Y that so so Y would equal the square root of four minus x squared true or false think carefully three or four what's wrong very good because when you take a square root you have to put the plus and minus right so here's what this says well actually what is this do you recognize the square root of 4 minus x squared and the negative square root of 4 minus x squared what are those know what I mean what shape on the graph is that what's this that's a half circle this is a lower half circle do you see this this is our two our upper that's a circle by the way radius of two centered at zero zero so this is an upper half circle and a lower half circle what that means is that implicit functions can often define two different functions our sorry implicit equations can often define two different functions this is not a function by itself because when I plug in one number I get out two answers that says it's not a function it's an implicit equation it's actually two different two distinct functions an upper and a lower half circle do you see what I'm talking about so oftentimes that's what happens implicit equations can define one more than one function of X just like I did here this is implicit that's two different functions so so far we know what the explicit means I hope we know what implicit means I hope that means bound up within that why still a function of X sometimes we can solve for it and change it from implicit explicit and sometimes an implicit equation will make more than one function of X now I have to consider this example how about this would you say implicit or explicit what do you think super input was another level super implicit it's like super whoa huh you agree that is implicit right okay good you understand that could you solve it for y could you solve her for y in such a way that's why by itself equals a function completely an X with no other X's I mean sure you could divide by 9x but that's still a y let me refresh it or what explicit means explicit means there's one wide it's a lone on one side everything else is a Texas can you do that here yeah try it try it if you want can you do it easy I love Mexico she can do it easily here no no you can't because the way you might do is to subtract this over subtract this over right but you need have 3y cubed minus 9x y you'd factor out a Y but you still left with Y squared in there right there's really no good way to get rid of that at least not easily so can you easily get this into an implicit I saw right in explicit form can you do it as there's no this this cannot be written explicitly if there is a way it's not going to be easy if that sometimes there is no way you can't write it explicitly for some equations now to keep in mind what we're doing here we're not doing basic algebra we're doing calculus and calculus involves derivatives right yes okay no we've been doing nothing that's hold on derivatives so here's a deal if this is implicit and I can solve for explicit I could take the derivative of that in fact that would involve a quotient rule right and this one I could actually take the derivative of the top function or the bottom function and be just find I've involved a chain rule or the general power rule because that one-half this one though there's actually no way that we're going to be able to get that as y equals something in terms of X with me what that means is even if you got Y by itself there's still going to be otherwise and here they're going to mess you up we don't want that so we have to have another method to find derivatives instead of just having y equals a function and X there's got to be a different way and there is and it's called implicit differentiation that's what we're doing today so we're going to talk about how we take a derivative of this thing without having to solve it for y now that's kind of interesting question right can you take a derivative without having at y equals yeah you can we're going to look at that today so for example it's not the calculus isn't hard the algebra might be a little bit but the calculus is not hard implicit explicit everybody what is that explicit would be y equals something is that the case this is explicit this is implicit this is implicit this is implicit unless it says y equals then it's not explicit what does this one again it's definitely implicit now we could actually solve this one for y do you see that we'd subtract x cubed we take a cube root it would be just fine you can find the derivative that way but what I'm trying to show you today is how to do this without having to do that by just solving this derivative or solving for the derivative without having to solve for one because of examples like that which we're going to do that so we could solve for y take derivative or we could use implicit differentiation here's the whole deal though in order to do this you must treat Y as a function of X because if you could solve it for y y would equal something in terms of X right so you have to treat it and that's going to be important here in just a second you see why in a bit you must treat Y as a function of X must realize function X you know how you can add something to do such an equation subtract something both sides equation multiplying by take exponent take a root pretty much do almost anything you want to to both sides equation as long as you do to both sides you know that right did you know you also take a derivative at both sides of the equation did you you do now don't you do anything to equations you want to pretty much a long long with taking a derivative you can do that so I could actually take a derivative with respect to my variable what's my variable that I'm dealing with here my there's two variables so how do you how you tell which one we're talking about Y as a function of X right so you can have this with respect to X so we're still treating X as our variable Y is a function of that variable that you just don't know explicitly you don't know exactly what it is you get the idea so Y is good y equals something we don't know exactly what it is because we don't want to solve for it we don't really care that much like this one you don't care that much you're saying okay I know Y is a bunch in terms of X and that's what we're dealing with here so we're going to take a derivative of X cubed plus y cubed and that equals what do you think 5 or the derivative of 5 derivative of both sides so we treat Y as a function of X that we simply just don't know we don't know what Y actually equals and we don't really care here's our steps then I've shown you the first one the first one is you're going to take a derivative or differentiate both sides with respect to X just make sure your dutiful decides it's an equation after all you have to do that so drive both sides let's check the X I'll start you off with the easy side the easy side is the five side let's start the five side can you tell me what's the derivative of five which is a constant very good if you leave it at five you see that would really affect your problem that would be a problem zero now let's look at here can we take the derivative of these pieces they're added together which means I can take them term by term you with doing this I'm glad you're here today this is something you really need to see now the derivative of x cubed is pretty easy to do we're taking a derivative with respect to X you fall down that in fact if I wanted to since that separable by addition I could do I'm going to show this to you one time we typically won't do this but I show to you here you could write x cubed derivative X cubed plus the derivative DDX of Y cubed okay with that so far right yes ma'am what's the derivative of x cubed with respect to X how much is that makes for a very good plus now this is the weird one what's our variable that we're taking the derivative with respect to two okay we're taking with respect to it says right here fun is that put that it's a Y now here's the idea y is a function in terms of X right so basically this is interesting I hope you find this interesting so you're saying what you have here is actually a general power rule you actually have that do you see it it really is this it's really that it'd be the same thing check this out it'd be the same thing as doing this 3x squared minus 1 to the fourth is this a function of X yes it's being raised to some power right and how you do this is actually the chain rule the special version the corollary which is called the general power rule you with me on this you bring down the 4 watch carefully I'm gonna draw the analogy right here you bring down the form if you find that it found the derivative you'd have one out 2/3 you groove this but then you don't end there do you I made it that wasn't evil like yet wait I have good ones I thought so easy we bring it down because that's a general power we'll bring down the exponent fact one from it derivative of the inside your this right you did homework on that I hope if you didn't well here's what you were supposed to do that we go that's it and you would get whatever the derivatives of that and you'd go 6x for that derivative right now look at the comparison this is a function in terms of X that was a function in terms of X this is raised to some power that was racism power so the derivative says this it says sure you bring down that exponent and subtract one from it this is no different than what you've been doing this is actually this right here are you with me the problem is this in this case you had to multiply by the derivative of the inside here do you see what I'm talking about what's the derivative of what's the inside here the Y so we multiply by D DX of what are you clear on that do you see the chain rule at work do you see that you need to see this before you'll any further raise your hand feel okay I'm getting that part of it she was coming from now here's the weird thing D DX of Y that says that says this check it out this is the derivative of Y with respect to X does not the derivative of Y with respect X this says the derivative of Y with respect to X but then so does this the derivative of Y with respect to X doesn't that say the same thing here and what does this represent that represents your derivative you don't get it you know the whole thing is no this is your derivative you get this that's the derivative of your Y every time you take a derivative of Y we were going to get a dy/dx because every time you take a derivative of Y you actually have a chain rule every time you have a chain rule you take a derivative of the inside of it does that make sense to you so every time you're going to have a DDX of why why this is the derivative of Y with respect to X right this is the derivative of Y with respect to X that is your derivative actually if you think about like variables it's kind of weird but D DX times y over 1 dy over DX I don't know if that really works but they're smoother than that you can do Y DX that's what these two things mean they're equivalent statements equals zero vision if you look at getting down that far so here's the whole thing for you you take it derivative of both sides with respect to X since you're treating Y as a function of X every time you take a derivative of Y every time you must get a dy/dx that's really the only important note for today if everything else which is say so each time you take a derivative every time you derive why you should have dy DX on account of the chain rule each time you drive why you must get a dy/dx on account of chain rule now some people might be asking well mr. Leonard why don't we have a 1 for this why don't we have to use the chain rule here well think about it think just think for say if we did the same thing you would do chain rule and you would get d DX of X right if you did the same thing that's DX over DX how much is DX over DX 1 doesn't matter right that's all we don't have to do that so for our dy DX so that is different this is not the same variable is y this is a function in terms of X which means you need the dy/dx there and that's the whole crux of implicit differentiation now the only issue is this stands for a derivative this whole thing is all mixed up together can you solve for this this was the calculus the algebra is the rest of it get this by itself and then you have your first derivative ok subtract this what another is this so you keep the keep the Y's the 3 y squared well for right now because if you multiply it so I'd subtract now we divide so now that's gone if we do just a little bit of simplification we get dy/dx equals looks like negative x squared over Y squared me can you make it down that far that's our derivative notice how our derivatives also implicit our function was implicit that makes sense our derivative most of the times will be implicit as well now could you have done this and got the same exact answer the answer is yeah but check this out take yourself if you did this explicitly so if you solve this for Y which is that which is that if you take the derivative of this thing are you going to get exactly this no because this won't have wiesen in this will however you can make a substitution how much is y equal to that you can actually substitute in and that will be the derivative there isn't that kind of interesting and they kind of cool did you see what I'm talking about take over your head right now hope none less far notice how if I were to solve it for y y equals this right some that Y is here so this would be that you can do which is the derivative if you would to if you do the strip tremolo see if I'm right pretty sure I am let's see if I am right see if you can derive that cute and yeah it's cute it's a cube root hey do that get your to the negative three halves power first our negative 2/3 powder that's going to be right here for you you're going to have your X squeezy x squared in there right the 3 is going to be gone because you have a 3 X square negative 3 x squared you have over 1/3 you cross those down you'll have a negative there's your negative you have an x squared is your x squared you have this thing showing up again to a weird power it is the same derivative it's just this one is not explicitly written this one is with this function you could do this so you won't be able to do this with your with your derivative in most cases because you can't solve for y so that's the the beauty of implicit is that this is just as valid as that is just as valid so we do this step one I used to learn one step always step to solve for dy/dx so write a step two on your paper somewhere step two is solve for dy/dx so to solve this okay guess what that's it that's implicit differentiation if you had this idea down you have the list of differentiation down now is it going to get tougher of course yeah because we're going to incorporate things like changeable things like the product rule things like quotient rule what you can all do it makes it Alex were nasty the calculus is not more algebra is yes difficult in some cases would you like to try some examples to see this thought you would okay let's take a look at just few of them first one I'll start off with is this one I say find dy/dx so if we want to find dy/dx that means of course we're implicit right here there's no way we're solving for y oh my gosh could you imagine solve that for y not a chance so when I can solve that for y that'd be ridiculous good thing we have implicit differentiation right now so Blissett differentiation says all right why don't you go ahead and take the derivative of both sides I want to see your work on the stuff show me your DD X's just don't forget both sides don't forget them now let's look at the right hand side that's going to be the easier to two in this case what's DDX of 4x to the 5th how much is that and so don't forget the stuff you already know how to do don't let that leave you now this is where we get to be kind of careful right if we have DDX of 3y squared plus sign 1 you know how to take the derivative of this place you know how to take the derivative where you're dealing with what idiom of X's or Y's hear what those are functions of X which means that when you take a derivative you will get a dy/dx are you clear on that every time you touch a piece of your function that has a y in it with a derivative you get a du by DX every time because of the chain rule I'm gonna stop showing you this right here this whole chain rule idea we're just going to do things like this check it out 3y squits a derivative of 3y squared 6 wide great 6y what did you take a derivative what did you then do a dy/dx the reason is again you would have a chain rule chain rule would say bring down the exponent multiply it take one away from it that's the 6y with then x d DX of Y right that's what we have over here d DX of Y but that is your dy/dx and that's where that's coming from he'll be ok with 6 y dy DX if knows you guys have questions on that right now this part is coming from the same ideas this right here it's the chain rule you bring it down you subtract derivative of the inside and that's what we're doing derivative of the inside in this case is d DX of Y that is dy DX that's that piece you need that piece otherwise you won't be able to solve for your derivative you're with me gonna have that so we need that Plus as we have a plus here what's the derivative of sine because I okay so we have cosine of Y dy D dy DX you took a derivative of something involved Y that means two languages again if you want to see this this would be the chain rule you go cosine of Y leave that leave the inside alone DDX of the inside but that's just a wash that's dy/dx why we're getting that thing that's where that's coming from do you see where it's coming from that's a good question let's solve for this and I'll ask you that I actually have a couple examples later on that will illustrate what you do for that so we're getting there right now I just want to get to handled on on the drill record of stuff okay whoo oh oh man what do you got to do now yeah you got to solve it so when you solve for a variable when you solve for variable you get all your variables to one side right then you try to combine like terms and you try to factor until you can just one of them and divide that's how you basically solve for a variable or a variable here is dy/dx so get all your dy/dx is to one side bass girls with your calculus is done you're done you've done the calculus correctly now it's algebra so you see your dy/dx here your dy/dx here that means you're going to factor so you're going to be good at factoring if you factor that out you get a 6y plus cosine y equals 20x - 2 4 so far so good let's get rid of this nasty piece of junk what are we going to do with that just to buy it this is being multiplied correct so if we divide both sides by that so divide here divide here we're dividing by this expression we get dy/dx equals 20x to the fourth cool over this same expression 6y cosine one is it really too hard not really not too bad they don't get harder when we start doing some other rules in there which are about to start right now and you see that but in general they how this is going to be very similar very similar stuff you've done as long as you remember what what's the important piece of information here yet ever dy/dx that's the important piece information practical application do we have if we're trying to find like the perfect music with for a circle why why would you want to find the top half turn of the bumper circle and the box well if you mean those things exist in your life right so if we somehow need to find a tangent line of those you can do it so we can actually find tangent lines to these weird curves which aren't even functions not functions we can still find rumors of that it's going to come back at you later in calculus to for when you have more than those variables right so you're going to have use for this later on as well translate that's your fiction is it pretty something where you have a multi variables and you're holding one constant you trying to solve you can you can actually do partial derivatives things like that I don't know if that's I think that's the same thing isn't explicit if you use that in that context and I'm sure but I do know that this is useful for finding those derivatives and the slopes of just in fact if you really think about it funny a trivet you want you've been doing this whole time if I give you an explicit derivative or X or some function y equals rigged square any of you sometimes if you take the derivative of both sides which is actually what you've been doing check it out you have DDX of y equals d of 3x squared minus 4 now this sense is a function in terms of X or 6x this that's a function in terms of X in it derivative gives you dy DX you've actually doing the whole time you've been doing implicit it's just been nicely solved for you the whole entire time that's kind of neat right so is their applications for implicit differentiation yes because you've been doing this entire time implicit just comes about because sometimes you can't solve for what and that's why we have it still be the same thing still a derivative just you cannot solve that for one good question are you ready to move on are there any other questions on this before we do our ufi yet and then kind of cool all right I think it's cool no no that's later I'll get that for ya no no that's this chapter coming up don't worry see look simple look simple example why do I have a pulse huh implicit explicit what was this definitely implicit because the Y's not my self can you take an implicit derivative of this what is y a function of X what happens when you take a derivative of X which is a function of x times y which is a function of X you see the product rule kind of bug so what we can't do and you just go oh X is one y is dy/dx da have done because then dy/dx would equal 1 right and that's that's not the case in fact if you ever solve this what you're going to get is negative 1 over x squared that's what that is because if you divide by actually one of our extruder that it's next to negative 1 power bring that down subtract one from it you get negative 1 over x squared you see that on top that's got to be the same derivative so here when you have the product rule yeah you got to use it that's a function of x times a function of X so sure we're going to take a derivative of both sides and you let your your DDX kind of do the work for you just follow that down DDX of one what what's D DX of 1 0 so don't forget about that you always take the derivative of both sides D DX of X times y and that's a function of x times a function of X and that implies the product rule so we go okay let's do derivative of the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second once you help me out with this folks you tell me what's the derivative of X with respect to X good and what else do I have why do I need a dy/dx here did I take the derivative of Y then no you don't need it plus I know this X doesn't change what's the derivative of Y with respect to X yeah that's kind of nice right can you solve for dy/dx are you ok I'm getting it for okay solve for dy/dx what do we do subtract I so X dy/dx equals negative 1 goodbye my ex because that's being multiplied right now if you divide by X you get dy/dx equals negative Y over X now I made you the guarantee that this is going to be 1 over negative 1 over x squared and this is not negative 1 over x squared this is negative y over x squared why is that well because I solve this derivative by using implicit if I had made this exquisite which you could do easily that's 1 X true white is 1 over X if I plug in one of Rex well I get negative 1 over x over x over 1 flip it reciprocate you're going to get negative 1 over x squared which is the same exact derivative that's the same thing now this is one of the rare cases where you could make your implicit function into explicit and do the same way I'm just giving you this as a kind of a for instance that when you see this you need the product rule like can you see the product rule here okay so do you need to do this no no no you know this is a valid answer when you're doing implicit this is just fine this is what I'm looking for as a matter of fact so don't forget what the plug for you've got to see the product rule well I don't know if this is fun or not it's fun for me I love this stuff but do you understand it is really the main thing it's what I care about whether you find the fun honestly I don't care I would hope you do but I care that you get it do you get it after the practice yeah oh be a boy yeah yeah I don't expect you to get this out on the first go I mean if you do great and you're able to do all of them sure but yeah there's going to be some tough ones in there you are going to have to Frank I also need to show you this on can you could you could you take the derivative of that hey why don't you practice that right now go ahead by the derivative find dy/dx do you need a product rule for this problem thankfully I know okay so that becomes 6x that becomes to live did you get the dy/dx if you lose the divide e^x you get lost on the problem right because then you don't have a derivative solve for and you're like what am I supposed to do now is make any sense at all so you have to have those dy/dx is that stands for your derivative did you make it that for everybody helping show again something way that for good okay now we solved for solving Ford says well actually it probably nice if I added this to both sides and divided by 2y but I'm guessing most of you subtracted 6x and divided by negative 2y you still get the same answer but if divided by negative because that doesn't matter negative 6x if we divide by negative 2y you're going to get positive did you get positive 3x over why yes everybody great now unfortunately this is not the question I'm asking you for that's the question I'm asking for okay a second derivative now can you take a second derivative this thing of course you can but in order to take a second derivative yes you have to solve for the first derivative so well to do it correctly you have to solve for the first derivative so we solved for first derivative the second derivative just says hey check this out this kind of neat why don't you just take a derivative of both sides so go ahead and and do that can we take a derivative both sides watch how how they accomplish it if we derive both sides we get D DX dy/dx equals D DX 3x or what can we start with the easy side first first easy side first I took a derivative of the derivative gives you a second derivative and you're going to see the notation coming to play do you see this like it how many deeds you have to D so d squared Y remember where that comes from okay cool over the limit doesn't work is this D don't get d squared x squared really should if you wanted to do that it should be like that we just never show that this becomes d x squared and that's where you get the notation for a second derivative are you seeing where that notation is kind of coming from it's cool I guess if you're me it's cool I don't get out much what are you going to have to do for this use a push rule go ahead set up the quotient where you know the quotient rule now go ahead and do it just everywhere it's easy it's an easy derivative just everywhere you see a derivative of Y you have to put 2 uy DX don't forget that and then you're fine I'll make it sound so what you'll see when I'm doing it I said then you're fine Oh before then yeah use the quotient rule set that up everywhere where you take a drinkable Y in the you dy/dx what'd I tell you do low D high minus high D low ok so low D high minus high D low again not to be confused with CeeLo blue CeeLo is gathered glasses on the voice very cool show my bedroom all over bottom squared I guess I could use parentheses there as well did you set up the quotient rule correctly so that stuff's not going to change I've taught you I told you there's only three rules I've touched all three rules now is justify them so do I put it do I take the derivative that Y so this is going to be Y times do I need dy/dx for this one for this one no because I'm not taking different one that's going to be three minus three x times what's this going to come to my white and there it is perfect y squared that gives you if we clean this up just a little bit 3y minus 3x now wait a second this is weird because I have a derivative and I have a group that's strange do I want to solve for that no no the reason why you don't want to solve for that look at the board have you already sold for how much is that equal to okay just plug it in so you're going to find dy DX's but if you take the second derivative you will have already solve for dy/dx that's cool now chances are for you guys you might not always get it like this all right if you if the back of the book looks different than this what they probably did because you have complex fractions they got rid of that why if you want to get rid of easily here instead find a common denominator just multiply everything by y and that to get rid of it so multiply Y multiply both by Y you're going to get 3y squared minus 9x squared over Y key you see we're talking about that should be the same thing as many common would you markusrohner the testicles you know I'm not sure off to think on that I would like it as simple as possible now it's sometimes your any some nasty things and would take you more time than than that so either I won't give you stuff it's going to be really nasty now you sit like this that you can simplify pretty easily or I would say just okay now I'm going to come back and answer your question here the question is what in the world does this stuff mean what are we doing here are we still finding derivatives and what is it derivative me well you have those words backwards metal yeah kind of so do you mean the slope of a point no not really some of our curve at a point yes so if I say here's Y squared minus X plus 1 equal 0 definitely an implicit equation can you find the slopes of that curve at two different points find slopes at 2 negative 1 & 2 1 notice something interesting that happens to this because I have something that's not actually a function it's implicit unplug it in the same x-value I'm actually getting out 2 y values you see that also notice that I am implicit which means I have to give you both x and y for you to accomplish this problem because your derivative is going to be in terms of both x and y you see it so that's how you use this now let's go ahead and end this problem real quick this is a pretty easy derivative if I derive both sides I'm going to get DDX to the left side equals DDX on the right side start with each side what's the derivative of 0 please good derivative of Y squared perfect - how much 1 plus come with a good derivative here is 2y dy/dx through here is 1 derivative here nothing can you solve that if you add 1 you're going to get 2y dy/dx equals 1 if you divided by 2y you get dy/dx equals 1 over 2y what did you just solve for what is this thing what is it that's M yeah that's it that's look that's what that is so this is a slope function now it says find the slope at 2 negative 1 & 2 1 is there a place to plug in the X not even a place to plug it in I don't even care about that plug in whatever values you can if they had both X's and Y's you plug in both X's and Y's bez only X's plug in X is that's wise well you're wise so what we're trying to find is a slope add to negative 1 four to negative one I would have 1 over 2 times negative 1 4 to 1 and 1 over 2 times 1 this one gives me negative 1/2 this gives me positive 1/2 interestingly here's what they've done we found the slope of that thing at the two points so two different slopes because we're going to have two different outputs for that same input interesting question how many people are so we talked about so far today ok I'm going to start you off next time with quite a brain buster after that we're done there's really one more problem that we have to do so I want to show you a couple things about that now what's R on the next time alright so today like I said we're going to continue talking about implicit differentiation that's what we're doing we're still finding a derivative but we're realizing that we can take this implicitly so if we can't solve our function for y like that which this is actually equation not a function but if we can't solve it for y that's called implicit so this is definitely an implicit equation where you don't find the derivative which still means slope of that thing so here's the question the question is not just this but can you with this equation finds the tangent line at a certain point find the equation of the tangent line at the point two one by the way with something like this could I just say at X equals 3 or X equals 2 could I have done that here now really if you can't solve for y because even if I plug in the the two you'd have a bear of a time find out what the Y would be does that make sense so really with these implicit ones they're going to give you the full point we're going to say that the derivative as well so let's go ahead let's find the equation of tangent line at that point what do you need to do to find the equation of a tangent line good because for any line you need two things one of the two things you need to find the equation of the line slope and a point we have a point we now just need a slope a slope is a derivative so we're going to go through this I want your help with it but I'm going to do it on the board for the sake of time just so you see one more time the implicit stuff I've already taught you how to do all that so right now it's really just practice for you and when one thing you're going to see if it's very important as far as our signs goes so with the implicit differentiation says you take a derivative DDX of both sides and we treat Y as a function of X what that means is Y is a function in terms of X that we just don't happen to know so if we're taking this with respect to the variable X and Y is a function of X we're going to get a dy/dx every time we touch a Y with the derivative does that make sense to you so we're going to be getting that so in our case well here's all the works shown for you we're going to take a derivative of both sides even though that's a zero I'm still going to show the derivative just for the sake of well-being correct and so you don't forget that even if it's constant or something you should have take a derivative that so we're taking a derivative of both sides of course a derivative of zero is still zero so we're good on that now let's look real careful at these pieces over here is this F our derivative take the four to the fourth what's the derivative of 4x to the fourth ok so let's do that so we got that that derivative how about this one is this one different for us that's a project why is it a product rule sure so this is a function in terms of X right there that is an X now we said Y is a function of X as well so every time you get that you do need product rule or if you have a fraction you would need the quotient rule so you have to have that so in our case right here we do have a plus so we write a plus now there's a couple things you can do with that 8 you can treat it as 8x squared that's one term or you can pull the 8 since that's a constant you can pull that out front that really wouldn't matter now you're probably going to be distributing that anyway so leave it in there with the 8x squared that's fine but you could you could pull it out DC I'm talking about that's possible so here I'll just treat it as 8x squared that seems to work ok for me so derivative the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second by the way note that even when I'm taking a derivative of Y I still have a DDX do you guys see that I still have the DX you can't go switching variables so if you have if you start with the DDX it's got to be that all the way through all right so that's there no matter what still okay so far so we've just done the product rule you know what I'm going to do since this piece was right here just for you say something why do this and next one just for the sake of being have a cut and continued continuity in the way I'm going to do things here I'm gonna put a big bracket around that that's saying this came from that one term and that's a great thing to do the reason why it's a great thing to do you're going to see this in the next piece if you do if you do this here it really doesn't matter because that positive isn't going to change any signs you see I'm saying however what's going to happen if I don't do that with this one I'm going to really blow my problem up okay that's going to explode my problem because the sign is going to be incorrect you're going to see that right here let's look at the next term I have a minus sign so I'll write of minus 25 x squared Y that's still a product rule product rule says maybe take the 25 with the x squared d DX of x squared that's a trivet of the first sorry derivative of the first times a second plus the first times the derivative of the second and once you see something now when this said take the derivative of this piece it means I'm going to subtract the derivative of that piece the derivative of this piece isn't just this thing is it it's the whole thing so if you don't have a big bracket right here that signs it correct right if you do have a big bracket right there that's saying that what's going to happen is this negative is going to change those signs in there and that would be the correct way to do it how people see that okay that's an important thing that's actually why we did this example just just so you can see that otherwise you're going to be off by a sign somewhere and then that's a good place for plus plus let's do this piece what's that piece okay I'll give you a 16 y cube we do we need to do Y DX on that every time you touch a Y with the derivative you have to have a dy/dx on account of what rule is that it did that general power rule or in general the chain rule that's right the chain rule says that equals zero now that's a long problem did you think you'd ever get problem that long that's ridiculous and it's like a whole paper right there are you okay on what we've done so far so we've done real easy one no problem pluggable product rule dy/dx because we're touching away with a derivative and if we have zero yes no now we start following the DDX this is why I made you write the DDX on your problems because it will tell you what to do next it says this piece is done you're just going to have the 16 X cubed plus now this piece in here this just says do this DDX so every one 8x squared what's the derivative of that and then it's y squared notice there's no dy/dx because I don't need one here this is just the derivative of X plus I'm getting rid of my bracket because I know none of those signs are going to change everything was positive that's okay so this plus doesn't change that's where those brackets are disappearing too then plus I have ax squared tell me the derivative of Y squared please when I'm taking a derivative with respect to X what is that good - Y but not just to Y right if I do two if I just do to why you know what happens if I do this and I forget a dy/dx what's going to happen is you're going to be adding and subtracting this term over instead of dividing by that term because you factored out a dy/dx do you see that the difference there that's going to really make that ending fraction which we're probably going to get look really weird so it's really important to get that dy/dx because that gives you another term that you're going to factor dy/dx out of - okay let's see about here the derivative of this this guy and then I have a Y now when I've already gotten rid of this bracket are you guys who can do it a couple pieces at once we get rid of this bracket what's gonna happen to that so this isn't math magic right I'm not Harry Potter gone no more pleasure to swap off a halt no and what's happening is I'm getting rid of bracket by distributing to these pieces notice the bracket ends here that - won't affect this + but it will affect this + so 50 XY plus our sorry - 25 x squared + the derivative of Y everybody very good then I'll have a + 16 Y cubed dy/dx equals zero give a little quick head not if you're okay on this so far yeah okay oh my gosh Wow what now well done yeah I see what you were no not even close well okay if it's done give me the slug then because we want the equation tangent line this is our goal right this is not our goal get all the right hands from one side brilliant yeah if we get all our dy/dx terms on one side then we can factor that if you get everything else on the other side that's great because ultimately we'll be able to divide follow so let's get all of our dy/dx is low we'll leave those on the same side and then we're going to add or subtract our terms depend on their sign to eat them over so we will be subtracting our 16x cubed our sixteen XY squared will leave this one alone so we want to leave this guy right here will be getting rid of this one we want to leave this one with the sign and leave that one by the way are you okay that I'm going to make this 16 x squared Y you're out with that too so notice that this is 16 x squared y dydx make a little bit nicer looking so 16 x squared y dydx that's that one so I got that minus 25 x squared dy DX I got that one plus 16 y cubed dy DX I got that one equals well we have to add this and subtract these two so you can write this in whatever you want it really doesn't matter we're going to have these three terms on the other side the signs will look different because we're adding or subtracting them so if I add this over I get 50 X Y if I subtract these two I'm going to get minus 16 X cubed minus 16 XY squared are you still okay so far okay great dy DX's are all on one side everything else is on the other side what now let's factor so if i factor dy DX notice how when we did this every term as it should as a dy/dx in on the left hand side well factor that out means divide everything else I'm a big bracket and now we have dy/dx times this enormous factor how do you get rid of an enormous factor being multiplied by some dividing you can divide by this entire expression right here that entire factor is going to go under this expression on the right hand side not mess that up so dy/dx is this thing all over that thing okay quick show of hands how many people were able to follow that pill okay with it by the way did I do it right okay okay because I haven't had to do anything all day so this is my first actual teaching class on my brain silver rusty so hopefully I did all that fight or maybe I'm extra good today because I had to waste my time on those stuff oh you're getting extra your lesson today I like that book okay so we have this by the way you should try to simplify this if you can factor and simplify now you're seeing an X here but you can factor out but there is not an X comment all through those terms so it really wouldn't help you in this case also you look for any constants to factor out you really don't have you have a two here but not a two there so there's nothing really much that we can do do you see when talking about what did we just find slope the equation for the slope the formula for slope now we said find the equation of the tangent line at that point do you have X's and Y's they give you X and one look at this this is the slow honey that's so it says plug in the numbers and find the slope and I have no idea what it's going to be so okay do this correctly things me nasty though looks horrible I give up this way for you I get to 100 over 66 upgrade I don't know what I got yet I got briefed I don't have a calculator shame on you did you without a calculator awesome awesome no really nice is that weird you're like I expect negative 1257 over like a third well if you put all this and you think this is a hard question it's really not this is the easy part this is a hard part let's find the slope because once you I mean if you talk about slope a slope has to be a number right a slope s of line has to be a constant number so plugging in Bank a constant number now this is very easy Y minus y1 equals M X minus x1 you get Y minus 1 equals 3x minus 6 and the 1 is your answer Jaffee this doesn't come about it all right oh by the way don't plug this in the end not the right way to go use that tip under slope does it make sense to you so this is about the hardest derivative I've ever really seen for implicit unless I threw a quotient rule that you have within that some of them are harder but this is good if you can do that you're fine okay do you do that and one that involves a quotient rule you're fine I think I did give you one of those earlier in our lessons so refresh your memory on that should be the second derivative of something I think we did that showed you how to plug in that dy/dx set this ends our implicit different differentiation are you okay with the idea of implicit differentiation uh no loopy murder I mean civil I told you before the Senate very very hard he's on his own so am I gonna give you a problem that takes you 45 minutes doing a test maybe they won't do that to you unless I just give you a test that has one problem on this I feel a great advise and say this is your final congratulations haha is it that you drink my coffee but I probably would wouldn't you probably won't do that but you want to roll it out either probably greater than 50% chance that I won't do that anyway ji-sung idea of implicit differentiation now what's kind of cool is that we can use this idea of implicit differentiation to take a derivative of whatever we want with respect to whatever variable we want and that's a weird idea but here's how we can use it I'm going to introduce the idea of something called a related rate these are all word problems I know some of you have a just it's the bane of your existence or word problems if you think through I'll give you some steps on how to do these and they shouldn't I can't of course I can't give you an example of every type of word properties lots of word problems but what I will do is give you a technique on how to do these when they write problems are you ready for it so if I'm at 2.8
