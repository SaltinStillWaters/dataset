Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 5.1:  Finding Area Between Two Curves
anyhow uh well 5.1 here's the study of how to apply some integrals to real life stuff real life functions in 5.1 what we're going to discuss is how to find the area between two curves it's not difficult it it really isn't uh I'll show you that actually we've been doing this the whole time it's just we had a very special second curve and I'll show you that right now so 5.1 we're talking about the area between two curves here's the idea let's say that for some given invol you have one function that's above another function so here's our typical what I always like to draw for my f ofx and here's some other function G ofx would you agree that according to this graph f ofx is always above G ofx for a given interval and let's define that interval from A to B like we normally do so from A to B F ofx is completely on top of G ofx now what we want to talk about is the area between f ofx and g of X that's what we're trying to find you see we already know how to find the area under F ofx right and we know how to find the area under G ofx we're talking about the area between them how would you go about doing it give me some ideas what would you do go ahead the area ofra the that might seem logical right because we have this whole area that's great that's the area under F ofx true and this area which is G of X well shoot If I subtract them aren't I going to get aren't I going to get is that even the way you say that aren't I gonna get sounds right to me I don't care am I not going to get the area between those two curves I hope so yeah it says take this area subtract that area it's Bas basically like finding the the uh difference between two numbers right you take the large one subtract out the small one in this case we take the upper function that is definitely going to have more area since it's always above G of X subtract the area under G of X that's going to have less area we're going to get a positive area that will be the area between two curves let me make this statement for you if you're finding the area between two curves it will always be positive if you have a negative area you've done something wrong okay your area will be positive so we're finding an actual definite integral between two curves you understand that the difference between what we're doing before this is no longer net signed area because of the way we're going to set it up we're always going to have the top function above the bottom function we're always going to have more area and getting rid of less area so we're going to have something that's definitely positive it'll still work think about it subtract the function on top would have a negative area this would have more negative area you're subtracting more negative area that would become positive area did you get the idea it's kind of cool no matter how no matter what it's going to be a positive area so the idea was I liked how it was said take the area under F ofx and subtract the area under G ofx that's what we're going to do no problem now can we do it with integrals what's the area under F ofx represented as how do you represent the area under f ofx as as an integral how would you do it here okay we say it again at louder integral from where to where sure hopefully you can see that that's the area under F ofx from A to B right at least is what I told you it was and that's how we've been working with this thing this whole time so we have the area under F ofx great minus the area under G of X what's the area under G of x g wait you're telling me it's the same A to B oh that's cool so would you say that that's the area under F ofx minus the area under G of X and that's going to give us the area between those two curves that's exactly what it's going to give you now why is this so nice I made a statement just a second ago you mean it's from the same A to B the interval you could break it apart but also what do you know about two integrals that are from A to B and A to B what can you do with those things you could you could do that that's one way to do it sometimes it's very much beneficial to combine them notice that those were not one-way Street uh properties they went both ways not only could you because you split up an integral by subtraction and addition you can also put them together by addition and subtraction provided they have the same bounds of integration which this has to have if you're going to find the area between them so you can do it this way do an do an integral and find both of them however sometimes not all the time but sometimes it's nice to put them together because you have like like terms you have common things you can put them together and and do that so other way you can see it just like that that's the area between two curves just make one big note here please make this note in order for this to work properly in order for this exact thing to work prop properly what do you know about f ofx and g ofx the bounds are the same that has to happen very good secondly though say what n negative it is non- negative it will be positive very good in order for it to be non- negative though what do you know about F ofx compared to G of X is what I'm trying to get to what now sure F ofx must be greater than or which means on top of f ofx has to be the higher function in order for this to work does that make sense so you have to have your higher function first otherwise you're going to have this reverse situation you take a bigger area from a smaller area is going to end up being negative you get Negative of what you actually want so in order for the story this note says that FX must be bigger than or equal to it could come down and touch it okay it could do that as long as it maintains the the property of being bigger than afterwards so this is possible here's G of X here's F ofx that could happen if this is f ofx and that's G of X that would be fine between here and here f ofx is still on top of or equal to it wouldn't make a difference do you follow me on that the problem you know maybe I'll use different colors so you can see it a little better that would be okay perfect the problem would be this why would that be a problem not specific ones about the other okay so the the purple line is on top of the black line here but the black Line's on top of the purple line here that would be an issue because one of them is not continually above the other one for that whole interval so for this to work for this to work by the way this would be the case this would be if you just did it the way it was F ofx over G ofx it'd be the case of net signed area this would be positive that would be negative cancel it out it'd be gone you get it so for this to work properly for to get the total area which is what we are looking for what you must have is f ofx greater than or equal to G of X for all X in A to B that little e that's like an element says X is a part of that interval in layman's terms this says f ofx is above G ofx for the whole interval did you understand the concept that if f ofx is not on top of G ofx the whole time if it does this then this area would be probably positive but this area would be negative and it would it would get rid of some of the positive area that you're looking for so basically we're looking for the total area notice that we have done this the whole time we really have here's why we've done this the whole time when I ask you to find the area under a curve what you've interpreted that as is the area between FX and what the X AIS the equation for the x- axis is y y z yeah y equal Z so the integral really was a to B of FX DX however think about it it was really zero because that was a second function we've always been finding the area between two curves the second curve was just the x axis x-axis has an equation of zero y equals z so you were subtracting Zero from it which is why we didn't show it also this means that when we went below when we below the x-axis is why I gave you that picture just a second ago is why those areas eliminated each other because one is positive one is negative because the the function flip-flopped what was on top and what was on the bottom does that make sense to you so basically this would have to be written for total area as this function on top and Zer on the bottom and then this function on top and zero on top and and the the function on the bottom which is what gave you that negative from the absolute value to begin with you remember the absolute value basically you could do it this way if this is C and this is a and this is B wherever that happens to be you could go okay from a to c of FX - 0 plus C to B of 0 - FX yes no that says keep the top function on the top here's the top from a to c f ofx minus 0 for xais here is from C to B great Zero's on the top the functions on the bottom notice how what this actually does here is gives you this relationship that we got exactly the same thing from absolute value exactly the same thing this gave you some integral FX look what would happen 0 - FX is negative pull out the negative minus C to B FX DX it subtracted the negative area making it a positive area it changed the sign on it and that's what absolute value would do as well do you see the connection between the absolute value way we did that for total total area and now the idea of area between two curves do you see the the connection if you don't that's okay but I need to know are there questions on it so absolute value said hey just take the area make it positive great that works the same way but area between two curves says hey think of it as two curves think of this as one curve but think of the xais as another curve then the area between two curves become to it becomes the idea of total area it says you take this function on top of that function for this interval no problem and you add to it this function zero on top of this function for this interval and that's going to make it positive that's going to keep come up with total area the same exact way so area of two curves and total area are the same do you see it now that's kind of cool right so now we have two ways to approach that I would suggest that this is probably the easier way to approach that if you know the x intercept that's probably easier than absolute value because you have to think of that but either way is not too too difficult now we have done no examples would you like one all right did you understand everything we've talked about so far yeah are there questions so far you're allowed to ask questions I promise I won't get too mad at you not even mad not even a little fine Mak sense's not I love the disdain with which you asked that word problems are there they're all word problems they have words in there and problems we're going to start off nice and simply u i I'll give you some very easy ones to accomplish and after that we'll have more work involved in them so I want to start you off just basic basic okay so most most of your homework will not look like this uh some of the ones that are like on the first part will it'll just give you a picture and say hey this one's on top this one's on bottom then I'm going to show you a way to find out which function is actually on top so on this I'm going to say find the area bounded above which tells you the function above and bound it below which tells you the function Below on a certain interval very easy to set up that's the one the pictures are going to give you on the homework they're easy to set up they're not bad so we're going to do one of those and then I'll show you how to do something more advanced so find the area bounded above by that function and bounded below by this function on a given interval they got to give you an interval or you have to be able to find one on Z2 you know sometimes for these if they don't tell you what's bounded above or bound below it's nice to draw picture get the idea see which one's above which one's below you don't have to absolutely because I'm going to give you a way to do this uh without having to draw a single picture but sometimes it helps just to make sure you see your head you with me on that okay now I can see which one's above and which one's below that's nicer but you don't have to well hey let's try to set it up we all we need to know for this is where you start where you stop and which one's on top that's basically it so area between two curves says hey where you start come on zero where you end what function is on the top uhuh when it says bounded above it means for the whole interval when it says bounded below it means for the whole interval uh if it didn't say bounded above below we would find those regions and we we'd be able to determine that so bound above by 2x + 5 uh do I add or subtract subtrac yeah you're subtracting remember you're basically taking big area minus small area to find the area between them also I'm going to show you something here that I don't want you to neglect some of you are famous infamous I guess would be the word for neglecting parentheses notice that parentheses not in this case but in some cases will be very important because that sign will distribute if there was more than one term do you follow me on that if I gave you uh X Cub + one for instance there's a huge difference between this integral and that integral do you see it the sign would definitely definitely change so I'd like you to practice putting parentheses just saying hey this is my top function this is my bottom function then if the parentheses don't do anything so what you erase them but at least you don't forget them you got me because that would that would be so horrible to understand this concept which you seem to you know and be able to set the problem up what you seem to and then get the wrong answer that's the worst kind of ignorance oh my gosh being able to do something and not following through and getting it right that's the worst because it's not even ignorance right it's just failure to perform no one likes that so parentheses in this case aren't doing anything we got 2x + 5 - x Cub DX notice how we don't have to have two separate integrals when we put them together like this it just basically becomes one large integral which is great we can we could easily do that it's just subtracting off this piece of the puzzle can you do the integral go for it go for it do the integral evaluate you know how to do this remember that what I'm teaching you now is really not anything new it's just an application of the process application of integrals to find area between two curves the next problem is one you can expect on a test uh this coming test as it were something like the the next one so we we'll do this one be prepared this is kind of an easier example that I'm giving you it's very easy to set up it's all given to you and you can do it very quickly that one has a little more setup and we'll talk about that in a bit so doing your integral here hopefully you were able to come with what which is what I'm going to do 2x^2 over 2 plus 5x don't forget about that 5x - x 4 over 4 yes no now of course the two we can simplify that so x^2 + 5x looks a little funny + 5x - x 4 4 and we're going to evaluate from 0 to four 0 to two there's nice there's no substitution that we needed we can just go for a direct plugging in some numbers so our area is we'll plug in the two subtract when we plug in zero we are going to get zero I'm just going to show it so we don't forget it don't forget to plug in zero because sometimes if you do have some constant in there especially with the substitution it won't be zero but make sure you make a note of that so in our case our area is going to give you how much is all that how much 18 18 more people got 18 10 see four 10 and four 10 watch the negative that subtracts four show hands help me f with this so far cool deal now would you like to try a problem that's a little bit more robust this one pretty basic pretty basic hopefully we're we're all okay with that one now something that's not as basic is find the area Bound by or another way to say that is find the area between these two curves I'm going to give you some steps on how to do that follow these steps to the letter that will walk you through every problem okay follow the steps when it said when it's like this very easy you can set it up from the problem when it's like this follow the steps here's here's the step and a sketch does help if you have a graphing calculator sometimes it does help plug it in find out which one's on top but I'll show you how to do it without a graphing calcular of course first one you know before you can find the area between two curves you got to find where those curves intersect do you notice I didn't give you a range I didn't give you from 0 to two or from something to something that means that this is going to be completely enclosed between some boundary of our curves when that happens when I don't give you an interval you need to be able to find the interval now fortunately it's just based on the X intercepts because that's how our integrals work from x equals whatever to x equals whatever from a to d so step number one is find the x coordinates of where your curves intersect okay tell me how do we find the x coordinates of the intersection of our curves what would you do for that say what y equals z equals zero not quite you're close how do you find out where two curves cross you set them equal you find out where they are equal right where they actually intersect so how you do this set the curves equal to each other not zero but to each other I'll do it that way set F ofx equal to g ofx whatever your first function is equal to your second function because right now U just off the top of your head do you know which one of these is on top of the other one CU I don't just by I mean I can probably figure it out by doing a little math but right now just looking at it it doesn't say it explicitly does it doesn't say hey this one's on top it doesn't say that anywhere so we're going to have to do a little work and this is kind of easier example but most of the time you're going to look at and go I don't know you're going to have to do what I'm telling you to do so take the two functions set them equal to each other so go ahead and do that now I why don't you try to solve it get in the habit of doing that again we haven't done stuff like that in a while here's what I mean by set them equal you take your x^2 in this case set equal to X+ 6 in this case no problem can you solve it yes yeah I sure hope so I sure hope so so this goes back to your algebra days right whenever you see a quadratic you always get things to one side and you solve with quadratic formula or you factor typically factoring is the best way to go you rarely want to complete the square it takes too long and if you can't Factor you use quadratic formula so that's how you complete quadratic so in our case we have x^2 - x - 6 = 0 yes no hopefully factoring is pretty basic on this one you're going to have x - 3 x + [Music] 2 that means x - 3 = 0 x + 2 = 0 stop me if I make a mistake by the way you allowed to do that 3 and -2 how many other people got down to that far okay so your Al algebra still checks out right hey guess what you have right now your balance got your balance got bounds integration where do your bounds start uhhuh where do they stop so automatically you have this you know your integral starts at -2 and ends at three because that's where they intersect that's where your areas are going to start and stop that's going to be enclosed in that graph you got to figure if your graphs intersect two spots here and here and they're continuous there will be at least some area between them unless they're exactly the same curve which they won't be otherwise it'd have an infinite number of intersections right so they're going to have some area between them now it could do this like it could go there could be lots of areas but it will have at least some now if there were more than just one there'd be more numbers here wherever the intersect would give you another range of an integral another balance of integration so this just has one range it's from -2 to three that means we'll only get one integral are you with me on this so I'll say it again because some of I lost you I can see in your eyes um listen when you set two functions equal to each other you find the only places that they will intersect you believe me if they intersect at two spots there's only one region between there if they intersected at three spots there'd be two regions between there they intersected four spots there' be three regions between there that you would have to calculate do you get it and it would might Alternate which is on top which is on the bottom here we only need to figure out for this one which is on the top and which is on the bottom so that brings a step two determine which is on the top which function is on top how would you do that how would you do that say what kind of maybe overthinking it just a little bit let's go back to this where did your integral start where's interal stop would you agree that for that interval one function will necessarily be on the top of another for sure it will not cross because if it cross folks it have another intersection right it starts here it stops there One's On Top one's on the bottom you got me so if one's on the top one's on the bottom for this interval tell me how you find out which one's bigger than the other one plug in a number man plug in a number whatever number you want provided it is within here you don't want to plug in3 or like seven that would be a little silly plug in a number on your interval and it's going to tell you which function is on the top very quickly so which function on the top how you going to do this pick one point on each each interval to plug in there's only one interval here so we only have to plug in one point step number three it this you're you're almost done it's going to be the setup and solve the integral but let's go ahead and I'm going to show you how to do this we already know this is going to be the case I'm going to not complete this integral until we go over here this is just like a starting point for us I want to have -3 to two that's my interval I know that one's going to be on the top one's going to be on the bottom so we're going to take a number and we're going to plug it in oh I'm reversed my bad I'm glad some of you have very good confused faces otherwise I'd be a loss of what you know some be like wait a second wait a second you can't pull that one on I'm just testing you you passed mhm yeah you buy that we're going to test a point what's a good point to test between -2 and three clearly plug in zero so we'll do y = x^2 do down here see a little better y = x^2 Y = X + 6 you said we're going to test zero you're going test zero this is not too hard to test you're just going to plug in a number to see which what the number is so plug in z y would equal Z plug in z y would equal which one is on the top M wait Y what okay so for your interval this is a nice little graphic organizer says what's going to go on the top ah x + 6 what's going to go on the bottom X very good do you feel okay on getting the X plus 6 is on the top of the interval the top of the the graph I suppose for the interval and then x s is on the bottom of the graph for the interval that helps you set it up doesn't it isn't this kind of like a picture of your integral right here says you start at -2 you go to three this is on the top this is on the bottom set it up subtract them and you're good to go but you going feel okay with our our idea here the idea behind it are there any questions before we actually set up integral and do it okay let's let's go for it then okay so our area we already knew that it's going from negative mess that up again -2 to 3 we now know which function is on the top it's the x + 6 so that's going to go first I'm going to get in the habit of putting parentheses around it that way if I have to distribute anything I know my signs are correct minus not not plus but minus we're subtracting big area minus small area if we know what's on top that's set up perfectly for us minus what now don't forget your DX now of course those parentheses don't do much for us in this case it just was a way to organize and say Here's my first function on the top here's my second function on the bottom and then subtract them whatever they happen to be so our integral goes from -2 to 3 of x + 6 - x^2 DX you okay with that one go for for it why don't you find out how much eror we got the basic hard part is over with it's finding out where you start where you stop and which one's on top that's the hard part the integral you already know you mastered integrals you know how to do it at least I hope you've mastered integrals that homework's going to tell me right now right by the way as I'm thinking about it right now before you get going uh notice that if they say find the area that's Bound by a function and the X AIS you would do exactly the same thing only the second function will just be zero remember how we talked about that earlier today so you just have to do the same thing just set the function equal to zero and solve it find out where it's on top where it's on the bottom same idea yes where's that 3 * three oh should be six that's two today I must have a case with the Mondays darn it I hate Mondays oh I just made a mistake that's all fun you have2 two yeah right oh sorry I reading it back now you making me doubt myself Joe come on now no killing me I think that's right it is I'm going about it for I'll other some fractions there yeah I came up with 125 over six yes I show hands how many people also came up with 125 over six let me ask you this question were you okay down to at least here okay good that's the calculus after that make sure you plug the numbers in right watch your signs signs are real pain when you're doing this uh you especially the netive -2 I mean you got to really be careful with that pretty sure I did that right that should be 54 54 + 40 no I'm uh 81 44 that's right are you ready to try another one or there any any questions on that one you feeling good about it feeling like you know how to handle these type of problems so far are you seeing the similarity between what we've done already and what we're doing now the integrals are exactly the same we're still finding areas it's just now I'm giving you two curves to start with but look it makes the same type of integral set harder setup is harder set takes a little more work motion the same mhm now let's go ahead and find the area Bound by y = x cub and Y = X have I given you any bounds of integration here bounds of integration so where you start and where you stop on the x-axis do you know that yet that cludes you in I want to do first then what are you going to do first okay very good now notice something if I gave you a problem this is going to be very too simplistic for you but just watch if I gave you this Bound by the X AIS we just do and that this would be yal 0 in this case you could still follow the steps you could still follow the steps you'd have well it wouldn't be bound though that would be a problem how about uh like that if I ask you to do that find the area Bound by the x-axis and that curve how you would start it out as you would do the same thing set the curves equal to each other just like that see what I'm talking about yes no yeah and then you'd Sol you'd Solve IT x x - 2 = 0 x would equal 0 and x would equal two and in that case well it's going to do the same thing as absolute value would do for you you'd set up your interval from 0 to two and you plug in a number plug in the number one to zero it's zero plug in the number one to this it's almost fell asleep you guys ready are you with me so far so you have two functions right yal 0 and Y = x^2 - 2x if you plug in one y still equals z if you plug in one well you get y = 1 - 2 you get1 which one's on the top zero which one's on the bottom do you see what it's going to do here's what your integral is going to be set up as your integral would be 0 to 2 0 - x^2 - 2x in parentheses because that's going to change that sign the back end how many people were able to follow that one now I went above and beyond all right that was just giving you something a little extra that wasn't even our problem but I wanted to make sure you saw it at least once that way you're like what's that x-axis mean what's that mean it means zero do the same exact thing find out which one's on the top if the Zero's on the top basically it's just going to make it negative it says that your area was below the x-axis and making it negative is going to make it positive negative negative equals positive that's what that's doing for you now let's go back to our original problem it's not going to take us long to set it up so we'll finish it today and then we'll start on something uh a little bit different next time so what did I give you anyway X Y and Y not how about that yeah that's what it was okay if I don't give you bals again you got to find your balance find your balance by setting those things equal to each other that's step number one yes no yep okay have you already solved it yeah so solve it by subtracting the X you're going to get to X Cub - x = 0 Factor it of course you're going to get x * x^2 - 1 keep going zero x + One X - one you get how many points 1 2 3 4 three don't forget about that one x = 0 x = 1 x = 1 I think I have those out of order but those are the three points that you you get raise your hand if you're able to find those three points feel okay with that now when you set this up where's our ultimate interval where does it start no where did it start where's it end notice how what you did you found the only three points in the world where these things actually touch right you found the only points in the world where they can actually B bound have have bounded some area together so negative one starts it one ends it but there's a point in the Middle where it could change remember the graph that I gave you at the very beginning of class where the color switched M that's might be what we have happening right here so you got to check for that so it needs to include that point zero and how many intervals are we actually going to test two intervals typically means two integrals three intervals means three integrals four means four one means one so this means we're probably going to have an integral here and we're probably have a different integral here with just our functions reversed depending on which one is on the top and which one is on the bottom um so for each interval test a point in both what point do you want to test over here and over here probably 12 if I'm testing - one2 y = x Cub when I plug in that2 it's going to give me -8 if I test this in the yal X it's going to give me well this is pretty easy -2 now think carefully which one's on the top this one's actually bigger than that number right it's bigger so this one is on the top X cub and X do you see how this this picture shows you what how to set it up it's kind of nice I would encourage you to use that you don't have to but without drawing a graph that's a really nice way to do it you go okay Starts Here ends there that one's on the top that one's on the bottom you see why that cubes is on the top you plug in any number in here this L points being equal zero that one's always going to be bigger than that one now the 1/2 when I plug in one2 this will be 1 18 and this will be 1 half which one's bigger here x x very good so X is here x cubed is there we're going to do the setup and then we'll end there because I'm pretty sure that you can you can do this on your own but stick with me for the setup at least so let's do our setup make sure it's right before we go we're going to have how many integrals do we have so it's basically like a two-part problem here we're going to have one integral from -1 to zero that's where it starts and stops which function is coming first here x and then what- X very good DX I would typically be putting parentheses around those things but because they're only single terms each we can kind of neglect that we just have X Cub minus the X now you have you're okay with that so far okay what are we going to do now are we going to add or subtract we're combining the two we're basically wanting to say the area here and the area here right I don't want to subtract them I want to add them I'm doing two different problems right now and they have to be done differently because the order changes top and bottom change you have to have twice so big old plus another integral where's the integral start 0 to one of what now just because this goes from 1 to 0 and this one goes from 0 to one you can't combine them because they're not exactly the same function so you have to do two different integrals do this one do this one figure out what it is and then uh we'll start here we'll probably start here next time I'll just start with this integral I'll give you the answer and that'll be our all right so we're on this problem let's finish it up uh we're basically down to the part where we're just evaluating the integrals which is going to stand for the area I think the way we did this was we realized that we need to separate any interval into how many segments you have find out which functions on the top which function on the bottom for each interval and then make up basically one integral per interval so if you look at last time on the video or you look at your notes from last time the way we set this up is we had X cubed on top of X between 1 and 0 and then another interval went from 0 to 1 but X was on top of X Cub so that's where these setups come from at least for finding area between two curves now as far as accomplishing the integrals let's see if we got them right so we got x 4 4 - x^2 over 2 and we'll be evaluating that from -1 to 0 and then we'll have another integral giving us x^2 / 2 - x 4 4 from 0 to one now unfortunately I think I said this last time but I said it as we were leaving unfortunately there's no way to put those together to make one integral out of it even though the bounds match up they really do 1 is z and then 0 to one because our functions are not the same we can't do that feel all right with that so far okay so let's go ahead and accomplish this one and plug in all of these numbers 04 - 02 minus -1 to 4 4 -1 2 / 2 and make sure you have that in parentheses it's important to have that because the sign's going to change this is basically this first one that's what that is then we're going to add to it a whole other one well plug in R1 subtract off our zero force it for us our zero doesn't do anything but I still want to show it because I don't want to lose it in case it did do something a substitution sometimes you'll still plug in zero and you'll still have a number after that how many people made it that far by the way on that cool deal now work through this and try to get some some proper answers this is going to give you zero this gives you 1/4 Minus 12 and it's in parentheses still plus this gives you 12 -/ 14us 0 are we still okay so far all right very good what you're going to get out of that hopefully you're going to get 1/4 did you get 1/4 that's going to change it to positive 1/4 so this segment is 1/4 plus this is going to be Al together you have how many we find area 1/2 which kind of cool when you think about it we're we're able to find now the area between two curves when one of the curves isn't the x-axis we talked about that last time right basically we're doing the same thing finding the area between two curves where one of them was the x-axis now we're saying what if it's not what if it's some other curve it's not that big of a difference all we have to do is make sure we know where those curves intersect that sets up each of our integrals then find out which function is on the top for each of those curves raise your have feel okay with what we've talked about so far all right now I want to show you a couple appliations and another way to think of this concept so basically I'll show you an application and I'll show you one example that we're going to do two different ways one way is going to be the way we've done one way is going to be significantly easier you ready for it yes rock on let's do this thing so here's an application I want you to see this do you guys like racing like cars and stuff I love racing cars personally watching it whatever I'll race anything I I I love doing that so so anyway let's talk about racing cars and to keep it simple we're going to do this you pull up next to me at a red light and then the light turns green and right as it does cuz my reflexes are freaking awesome I gun it and I way ahead of you because my car is fast and I'm awesome so naturally it's going to happen unless you drive a motorcycle you're probably not going to beat me in my car so let's say we do that here's what's going to happen we're going to compare our time to our velocity where do we start if we're to dead stop we're starting at zero both of us are starting at zero and my velocity goes like this I hit my little Peak right and then my I I switch gears or something and then I go that's me this is me and here's you you okay that's you sorry but my car is awesome I'm going to win that race every time notice that the meat what these things are this is a function of our velocities according to time at Time Zero we're to dead stop time one I'm going very fast and you're not fast yet anyway I don't know what card you have I'm just making a joke anyway but these are our velocities this is veloc velocity one or velocity me and this is velocity you two Le the technical ter sure my question is between here where we start and here where the race is over that a or zero and B where the race is over do we have any area between the curves yes the question is what does that area actually represent clearly I won clearly I won because my velocity was quicker than yours this is not position by the way this is not position what this would be if you had a position curve or if you have velocity curve you could integrate to find your position remember that velocity to position you integrate or if you had a position curve you could actually find the derivative to give you velocity make sense so you can get this and this would might be this the function of a a slope of a position curve that's what this is so these are velocities now tell me something we're finding area right area what's the width time what's the height what's time times velocity dist you ever seen that before distance equals right times time right that is an area basically what you're doing in these think back to what you're actually doing what you're actually doing here is finding little rectangles right and adding them all up a little rectangle would be a little piece of time times a little piece of velocity time time velocity is a distance so what this area represents is the distance that I be you the at the end of this the distance between my car and your car do you get the idea that's kind of cool so given two velocity curves we can figure out not only who won the race but how much they won the race by that's neat you can't do that if you just compare the velocities like at the end of the time say oh I was going 120 you were going 105 well who won May probably I won cuz I'm going faster how much should I win by I don't know that you could say seconds right you could say you won by 4 seconds does it say where you were and where I was when I won no but this does this says if I were to find the area between them the area between the two curves so notice here this could be a velocity area is velocity time time that gives you a distance so the area between the two curves is representing a distance between my cars in this case the area equals the distance that car one me is in front of you all right in this case the area represents the distance car me is ahead of car U how would you find the distance how do you find that area our I think we've been doing okay how specifically would you do it you would subract just subtract them oh no I'm kind think how to word how how would you do it come on how would you find an area between two curves set it up where did it start where it start a or in our case if we're a dead stop z z where's it n yeah wherever that time was in our case that's B is going to be time time after 20 seconds or whatever say how far am i ahead of you after 20 seconds that's what this would do for you what's going to come first uh V1 sub v sub1 t or V sub2 T explain why definitely notice that this was kind of a simplistic example sometimes cars go like this right they start off and you have an automatic and I have a I don't know a stick Shi so probably I'm ahead of you and then if we have very equal cars I'm going to shift and you're going to keep going at the automatic you know so we might go back and forth and back and forth you'd have to set up several several integrals to figure that one out you get me every time we cross back and forth that interval would be a different integral that would give you the overall distance between the two cars as we went now if you wanted to figure out another sub Point here figure out the total amount of time that sorry the total distance at the end that I'm ahead of you that would be net change you have just do one integral if you want to find total distance as we went as a like a cumulative effect of how much our cars were apart whether I was in front or whether you were in front that's where you'd have all those different integrals does that make sense the area between the curves would represent the overall distance that we were apart the whole length of time net integral where you just went from no matter what happened here from zero to or from A to B or Z to B that that's going to say at the end of the the game who was ahead that's what that would do you get the difference there so it's it's kind of a little a fine point but it's kind of an important one that's what you so basically the same idea so right now we could think of these things as distances if we really want to if we're racing cars it's kind of cool I just want to throw that in there because I love racing cars that's kind of interesting now let's do one more example because I want to show you a couple ways to think about this do you have any questions on that before we get going I'm guessing your silence says no no all right okay you might not like this example so much but it's good for you to see it because you're going to get some like on your homework so stick with me even if you don't like it stick with me not bad difficult maybe to understand at first after after at first it's not bad okay why don't you like the example so much because solve for y it's not even a function in terms of X is it it's actually a function in terms of Y not in terms of X combined to the function that is in terms of X so that right there goes gosh do we have to have functions not necessarily not if we can break them up in some some manner which is what we're going to do for the first method of doing this secondly I don't tell you much about this I don't say where you start I don't say where you stop I just say do it so we need to find out where integrals start to stop right okay one thing is probably you're going to want to find the intersections because that's going to give you at least some range also a picture would be very very helpful here very helpful we're going to draw a picture first so that you can have a Graphic representation of this um in general you don't need a picture as long as you really understand the Curve cures one thing I'm I'm telling you about is is this if you just do the intersections of the curves when you don't have functions in terms of X you can miss key points uh for instance on the xal y^2 do you know what that is okay not just the square root of x though you remember when you take Square you have it's actually Parabola on its side do you see the parabola on it side what that means is that our curve is probably going to intersect here and here which is what it's going to do we'd be missing that point that point right there is going to be xals 0 the start of your Parabola right so even though the function does not intersect right there that is a key point because on the x axis that's where we're starting so that's a key one so you need to see things like that as well that's what makes this problem difficult let's draw the graphs first that way we can really get a picture of it I'll explain everything I just talked about okay first one x = y^2 if x = y^2 that means that y sorry uh X is a function of Y that means that basically you do this you take your graph and you go and you look at it sideways so if we look at it sideways this thing is actually parabal you okay with that one so far yes no yes the other function the other function is pretty easy other function is a line y = x - 2 can you graph that on the same set of axes okay let's go ahead and do that y = x - 2 says the Y intercept is where ladies and gentlemen where and the slope is those are our two functions would you agree does it have bounded some area within it now let's go go ahead and try to focus on where that area what that area is first thing you're going to notice if I find my intersection points does it tell us where to start and where to stop well does tell you where to start is it going to miss some it's going to miss some area do you see that it's going to miss a lot of area because starting would start here and end here that's that's a problem we actually have to start here which is where the picture comes in nicely or really understanding your graphs you really have to know what they look like you have to know where that thing starts hey I know because I've done this stuff before I know that's starting at xal 0 I know it and it's facing this way so I know that that integral has to start at xal zero I know it's going to end somewhere but I know it's starting right there does that make sense and a picture illustrates it very nicely for you but at least you have to have that picture in your head before you even contemplate this problem now the next thing I told you was okay follow the steps down follow step one which is set these things equal to each other and solve them okay set them equal how are we going to set them equal to each other to solve for y you could solve for y that's going to be a little difficult because you're going to have square root plus and minus for X right maybe solving for x would be the better idea so step number one says all right I have X = y^2 I also have y = x - 2 and I want to find some way to set those things equal now solving for y again might not be the best bet because you have to take a square root with a plus and minus that's difficult to do other way you could do it well this is already solved for X isn't it this one's not hard to solve for x how would you solve that for x so I would say x = y + 2 I reversed them on you but x = y + 2 now you have you're okay with that so far well now that I have x = y^2 and x = y + 2 what do you know can you make a different equation out of that can you solve yeah very easy how would you solve come on tell me the idea is to get everything on one side and then Factor it yes it is a quadratic after all it's in terms of why it's a quadratic and hope that it factors really honestly hope that it factors it doesn't it's kind of a pain if it doesn't really is uh y - 2 and y + 1 is what I got out of that did you get that as well that means that y - 2 = 0 and y + 1 = 0 you're going to get Y = 2 y = 1 by show hands how people feel okay with what we've done so far okay true or false our integral is going to involve the numbers 1 and two okay okay well those are those or that's my question one of them is a bound and one of them is okay I'll give you that zero is going to be one of my bounds yeah zero is 2 and 1 other bounds and negative one is your y AIS bound going downwards and then you have your your two would be your bounds on your xais going to the right okay so that's my question actually you have an integral in ter y well that's my question what are you integrating with respect to the x- AIS or the y- AIS the answer is the answer is either one but you have to make a choice okay either one but you have to make a choice I'm going to show you two ways to do this the first way is saying I'm going to integrate the way we've always done it with the x-axis in this case these numbers really are only there to get you x intercept x x values to get tell you where your integrals start and stop that's it this isn't good enough if we're going to integrate this way so if we're integrating this way it says hey look I basically have three different functions I'm talking about three of them check it out if I'm talking about functions this way I think this as oh my gosh well if I solve this one uh X = Y if I do solve that for y I get plus or minus < TK xal y do you follow me on that this right here because look it if you if you're going to integrate you have to have functions in terms of X you have to if if you're going to integrate X's you got to have functions that work you can't say and plug in one number two things out you got to say here's one curve and here's the other one does that make sense you can't treat it as one big function of X because it's not a function of X what it is is a square root of x here and a negative root of x there can you follow that one you sure no I understand where the two formulas the two different functions from this one and this one I'm not sure I'm following the ramifications of that okay ramifications are you have to go ahead you have to be able to integrate some way if we're talking about integrating with respect to X you have to have functions in terms of X unfortunately there's no way to represent this as a single function of X it's not a single function of X it is actually two functions of x one on the top and one on the bottom Have I Lost You Yet gone over your head by blowing your mind up like a grenade wow that's great little bit it should be just stretch your minds not too far though that been freaky big heads walking out of here anyhow do you see how I'm getting the square root of x and the negative Ro of X we have to break it up into functions of X so this has to be written in terms of X in order for you to integrate it with respect to X they can't have y's in there if you're integrating with respect to X you get me now can you hear me now good so I'm breaking that I'm saying hey xal y^2 no no no take a square root involve a plus and minus and you get plus orus of X plus the of xus of X so those are two separate functions yes very good Square Ro of X and negative Ro of X those are two functions in terms of X and then a third one y = x - 2 that's another function of X so how many do we have all together one 2 3 three functions in terms of X the problem is we are in terms of X what variable do you solve for one can you go and change these into X's using what you know though yeah okay let's do that so for y = 2 xals what for y = 1 xal what four and one how' you get four and one um y yeah perfect exactly right you can do it with the other problem you get the ex you could you could do it from right here as well correct so either one of these things if I plug in y = 2 hey X is 4 plug in y = 1 hey X is 1 you get me on that do it here even and like you said if I plug in two I get four if I plug in negative one I get one it has to work because you said them equal but that has to be the case how many you feel okay on getting the X X bounds now what I'm going to do is change my graph just a little bit I'm going to eras the parts that I don't need because it looks a little confusing to me right now this part is not binding any area if you want to say it that way neither is this part neither is this one neither is that one if you don't mind I'm going to redraw this picture a little bit bigger so you can see it would you be okay with that okay it's clearly not the scale but it's the same idea you see the the curve I'm trying to draw here let's think about what we actually have going on remember we are talking in terms of X in terms of X what's this top function from zero to whatever this point is what's this piece right here what's this piece right here yeah very good now tell me the points where does my functions start at zero good zero we saw that actually basic from the picture or understand that's a parabola starts uh y shaped really going this way a function of Y but starts at zero hey what's that point what's this point we found out they intersect at one and no one and four on the x-axis that's where these numbers are coming back at the Y's the Y said they intersect at - 1 H look at that and two on the y- axis yes that's true we don't care about Y in this context if we're dealing the functions of X we care about X's that's why we had to find the X's I you hope you're okay with that the Y's would have given us something completely different if we did it this way with Y values would have happened this goes one four sure now I've kind of given this away by this picture how many integrals do you need here explain to you why two right two why two 0 to one 1 to four 0 to one 1 to four but why oh your two intersection points only we have two intersection points you explained that yesterday that however many intersection points you have you're going to have theal okay so how many if you consider this as three functions how many intersection points do we have not two I'm holding it up yeah if you consider say three functions look you have two function that's one there's two there's three yeah you have three functions Joe you were going to say something I thought maybe it's you're going to add the areas from X to x - 2 and then X we're going to deal with this as just two basic basic areas but I I want you to see you're kind of missing something you're kind of missing something think about it this way I'll I'll try to lead you to the the answer uh the way integrals work for areas is one function is on top the entire time and one function is on the bottom the entire time three function we have three functions so can one function be on the top the entire time and one function on the bottom the entire time that would only be two functions my question is do you switch functions somewhere yes where do you switch functions so basically look at you have to deal with the top and a bottom right you have to have this the same function for that whole interval so the same function goes the entire top that's great however right here I clearly change functions that necessitates two different integrals CU I don't even have the same function do you get that idea so here's the setup for us setup for us goes and hopefully you can see I want you to help me here integral where does the first integral start very good where's the first integral end good because that's the intersection that's where I'm trading off my two functions in fact if you did it this way and you did what I told you and you had 0 one and four you'd see it you'd see it you'd say oh look at that sare root of x is on the top negative of X is on the bottom do you see it and you did it here what's is on the top for this range square of X is on the top what's on the bottom oh not negative of X but what yeah that shows it I I sore I I told I gave you everything you needed no I really did it's right here you just need to realize what's going on so 0 to you know make a little clear of X zero to where of what xus because you know you subtract top one minus bottom what's the bottom one don't lose that negative otherwise your integral goes to zero we don't want that to happen minus that DX for sure DX would you agree that that integral represents this little area right here big old plus one what what no 0 to one 1 to four it's all right what's on the top now table does it if you want to do it that way I love the table I just made it up like this last class cool x minus minus what parentheses oh parentheses are pretty important here DX sure sure absolutely can you do those two integrals before you do them be smart about it simplify what you can okay don't start just taking random integrals before you start simplifying and putting things together that would be a silly way to go you definitely don't want to start dealing with this with all parentheses you don't want to start dealing with that until you combine like terms which you do actually have here so let's go ahead kind of nice and slowly and think about what we what we're doing we got an integral from 0 to 1 we got aunk xus a of X how much is that hey that makes things easier already 2un plus another integral from 1 to 4un x - x + 2 you see where the plus two is coming from that's a big deal DX let's keep it going you're we on a rule 0 to one how are you going to write that integral x x to the 1/2 very good because then you can use our integration table and and do that probably also you might want to be pulling that two out just for fun you don't have to you can you can surely leave it inside of there that's really a just a prep personal preference the next one I'll have from 1 to 4 but I'll have x^ 12 - x + 2 DX oh x to the 1/2 don't forget we're adding and dividing 3es over 3es so when we're setting I I not put my integration or my evaluation symbols up there yet I want to simplify it first but remember that this is from 0 to 1 and this is from 1 to four so before I plug anything in I'll put move the two up to the numerator that's going to be 4 x to 3 over three and we're going Z 1 plus this is going to be 2 X 3 over 3 - x^2 2 + 2x from 1 to four by show hands how many made down that far hey the rest of it just evaluation plug some numbers in let's see if we can do it I'd like for you to hopefully do it on your own for for stop me if I make mistakes by the way I'm doing something wrong say what where here am I still okay thank so keep going keep going I want to say that's 136 from right here did you make it down that far just to make sure I'm doing it right okay and then all said and done when you're let's see multiply by 2 32 8 40 53 over 6 no 55 6 what six make sure I'm good up to here I got 43 4/3 16/3 um 163 - 136 - 13 okay M by two that's 32 multip by 2 that's 8 32 and 8 is 40 276 what I'm getting okay I need know how many people got 27 six have like a quadruple a quintuple check whatever 276 276 276 I hope not hopefully you reduce that as well nine halves perhaps yeah that's what I count half just making sure 276 well before we reduce yeah 276 okay I three is a common factor let's go back down to our to get that nine half do you see the nine halves yes do you feel okay with our example yes by the way this is the worst possible way you could do this problem the worst why this is very hard this is very hard to split that up in general hard to do easy for this one hard to do in general it's have two different integrals now what I want you to do is face the board turn your head like this seriously are you doing it yeah like this is there one function that's on top of the other function when you're doing this that means you can do it easier with respect to Y than you could with respect to X I'm dizzy now seriously I am let's think about this for a second I I might go a couple minutes over today but you need to see it because we're going to finish this up so my apologies it will not take very long here's an idea for you sometimes you can switch the roles of X and Y let's suppose you had two functions now of course these functions are going to be in terms of Y not in terms of X so it will start with something like x = h of y x = g of Y like that it will be going not according to the X don't care about the X care about the Y it will be going from C to D and the area we're talking about is that area notice that if you put your head like this right takes the place of top left takes the place of bottom but we still go from C to D it's basically like taking this picture and doing this with it like reflecting it across y almost like reflecting across y almost is that g of Y yes our area in this case would be where would it start on the y axis where does it start for here see C where's n d which one's going to come first oh which one's on the top or on right h y so it' be h of Y minus G of y d what d d y terms of Y now terms of Y so basically h of X is to the right h of X is to the right and this of course is if h of Y is greater than or equal to G of Y for all of C to D guys this says the same thing I said for for this type of thing it just says in terms of Y instead of terms of x uh let's go ahead and let's do this setup on on our problem over here I will show you it will be basically very easy the same one as before same one yeah I want you to see that this works out the same now if we're in terms of Y I need you to notice something that this we had this uh we had X = y^2 and we had y = x - 2 you with me if we're going to do this in terms of Y our functions need to be in terms of Y now this one's great we love this one this one's not great explain to me why it's not how do I solve it for terms of Y those would be the two functions I'm comparing if you set them equal to each other I'm going quickly through this because this is exactly what we've done before you're going to get the same exact points that we did before Y = 2 And1 are you still okay with that mhm honestly raise your hand if you feel all right with that cool so now that we have these functions in y we have y^2 here we have y + 2 here is there one function that's completely not on top of but to the right of if you turn your head like this it would be on top of if you have one function that's on the top or on the right of another function okay now from from this way where does it start where does it start where's my integral start it goes from bottom to top where's my integral start where's my integral n so my area is from1 to 2 notice that's from C to d-1 to 2 that's why I had my y's it's in terms of y-1 to 2 the function on the right was y + 2 the function on the left was y^2 Dy yes no feel okay with it so far just use the Y AIS as we would the X you're exactly doing that you just turn kind of but you can't go from left to right you're going from bottom to top so that is that is wrong you can't go from 2 to 1 you have to go from 1 to two so you can't just turn your paper that doesn't work for your balance it works for your functions doesn't work for your balance so be careful with that did did you see the point what I'm trying to make there why is this nicer hey how many integrals two one integral one integral if you do the integral parentheses really don't mean much here you're going to get y^2 2 + 2 y - YB 3 and you evaluate it from 1 to 2 if we do that work it out but you're going to get exactly exactly the same answer you plug in your two uh whatever you get there you plug in your two you plug intive one you subtract them you were going to get nine yeah easier yeah it is it is easier because we have one function over one function in terms of Y but we didn't have that in terms of X so sometimes it would behoove you to really look at your function before you get started you follow me on this how people understood that example feel okay with it so can you switch your variables and deal with this in terms of why then in in terms of X absolutely just be careful be careful with your bounds especially if we're solving for uh functions and Y have your y variables if you're doing in terms of X have your X variables plug them in accordingly and you should have no problem
