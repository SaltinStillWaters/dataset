Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 4.5:  The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
yes yeah I was hoping so this is the good part you guys ready for the good stuff for good stuff you don't watch good stuff it's got cool words in it man other words like fundamental and Theorem and calculus we're gonna talk about the fundamental theorem of calculus oh that's right I really like to see every weekend consists uh it's like in front of the mirror doing all this stuff when I go to the gym to get my pump derivative no that's not true foreign you know that this is an area you also know how to calculate indefinite integrals you know how to calculate them like this but this was capital f of x plus C remember the plus C part all doing that we know how to do integrals we've done that already here's what this represents though what this says is okay an integral represents an area this is the antiderivative but what do we do with that plus C let's talk about that for right now and then we'll have a really good picture of what's going on so here's our I'll use the same graph I have over there here's our graph and this is f of x we're looking for the area what we want to do is find the area from A to B that's the goal without using our Riemann sums or the summation notation we don't want to do that we want to really just think of this as an integral because we know an integral geometrically represents the area so how can we go from this picture and this thing and tie it all together what we want is the area from A to B thank you here's how we're going to think of it we're going to think of it as well how about this could you find the distance from A to B how would you do it you would do B minus it if this was 10 and that was 3 you do 10 minus 3 right we're going to do basically the same thing we're gonna say let's take the area up to V minus the area up to eight would that make sense to you we'll take all of this area minus off all of this area no matter where you start that would work for you would you agree we'll take all the area from left to right all the area no matter where we start up to B and subtract off all the area up to a and that would leave us with this little bit how many people buy into that feel okay with it that's exactly what we're going to do so we'll take the area up to B starting from wherever you want it does not matter as long as you start the same point for both yeah a say what can you just make your starting point a would so you'd figure out the area of B and then subtract zero well we're I have to give you something that this makes sense right and the way to do that we we are going to start at a and go to B but find action you can see why we have this next piece in there right now if I if I give it to you you'll probably follow it but I want you to understand the concept of why we have a subtraction in this at all okay and we're going to have one right now so let's think of it if so the area is this is not changing there is this what we're going to do is take the area up to B minus the area up to eight now here's what you have to realize what we're doing here is calculating the area functions remember me introducing that to you a long time ago that this indefinite integral axis area function was a family of Curves we just know which one it was well if we have that family curve but we're going to actual point that says this is where you're going you're stopping here that solidifies it for you it's no longer indefinite it's definite you're starting at one point you're stopping another point so this right here that's an area function and we actually have something to plug into it we have the the point well where are we stopping the area of to be you find the area by playing B the area up to a you find the error by plugging in a so the area from A to B is the area up to B the area up to B that would include wherever your starting point where your starting point is for area that would include everything up to the point B everything above the x axis to the point B you got me and then we'd subtract off this point a now really what we'd consider is starting from zero that way we're not being silly not going way too far we say let's just go from zero okay you'd have this area minus this area it'd give you what's remaining the area up to B plug in B the area up to a plug in a that's how you do a definite interval you find the antiderivative and you plug in your balance it's actually that easy not bad not bad look come on now there's one one question out there what's the question come on do you see it what are you doing oh good do you see it where's the C by the way this right here this statement is a fundamental theorem of calculus part two I'll give you part one minute fundamental theorem of calculus at part two what happens to the C oh dear why do we have a c is well you do know definitely so we shouldn't have a seat but when you think about it remember when we're finding out this this right here this is a family of Curves right how do you actually smell where it's at when to curve way up here have a different area than one right here and this is clearly the height would be different so why does this even work well think about this for a second what about the sea how about C suppose you considered it by the way the way that you you write this um I should actually give it to you this way one more thing that's also written foreign X that's an evaluation symbol from A to B that's how you can write that and we're going to be practicing that as well it says the same thing okay this this and this is the same how you do this is you plug in B and you subtract off a you plugged in B to your nana derivative and you subtract it off F of a are you guys okay with the notation so when you see that that line right there it's like half a bracket goes from A to B that's what that means so this equals this and this equals to this let's suppose that we actually included the C now some of you might be wondering when you think about it you might be wondering why don't we have a C1 and a C2 say it again they're the same concept why are they the same constant how do we know that for sure he's right why say it louder so from the same function if you're integrating that same function you're not switching functions on me are you and you're written the same thing then whatever C you get is your C no matter what you're plugging in that's going to be the same function itself does that make sense so wherever you're at that's the same function so we integrated one time look what's going to happen if you have F of B plus C it's not C1 it's just c f of a plus c is not C2 it's just C what's going to happen to my C's wherever you see is wherever you see is that height the height difference will be eliminated it drops out of your equation as your book likes to call it the C's are gone so remember the plus C that's just the height right height of your function even if it's way up here same type of function just way up there but both of them would be way up there the F of B plus c F A plus C we're subtracting out that plus C part the plus C's will be eliminated from your equation thank you and that's how we get what we get so the sea is gone drops out so we don't write it for our definite integrals indefinite absolutely but definite we should end with a number end with an area because this thing is an area if I show hands some people feel okay we're talking about so far today would you like to try a couple examples you're going to really like these by the way are you ready to really like something yes in this class after that this weekend you're sunk now welcome to the privilege okay so an integral from one to five of X DX this is an area which means we should end with a number it's actually a definite integral why is it a definite integral in it and not an indefinite integral of constraints right there there are bounds or bounds of integration we actually have numbers we should end with an area now can you integrate x DX easily yeah we already did no no need for limits no need for any of that stuff that you've spent your whole life doing just now okay it's doable you did it right but this is a shortcut not sure okay I guess there's a shortcut to doing it what is the integral of x please where are we integrating from where do we start our area where do we stop our area one to five why don't we have a plus c here even if it fell out even if we even if we did it's gone because you can subtract it off anyway it's the same plus c one to five here's how you show your work you do this step first you show me what your integral is you show me where you are plugging the numbers from you plug in the top one first subtract then plug in the bottom this would be 5 squared over two minus 1 squared over two is how you show that see where the five and the one are coming from so we're going to get 25 halves minus one half how much is that 12. yeah 24 halves is 12. is that quicker than a Ramon sum all the stuff you've been doing left end points yeah what is 12 what's 12. exactly right area under that curve which is just a diagonal line from one to five thanks you're welcome the other stuff is good to know it shows you where it's coming from it shows you why you're doing it shows you how you do it and you you make sure you know what what all this stuff means right if I just gave you that you could do it but you'd have no way you would not understand it uh we did the limits of the sums so you would understand why you do this how you do this now we needed something else though because when we get to things like this foreign doesn't work all that nice for that Gabby will do an integral with that so this is also an area it's an area from zero to pi over two of cosine X that's your cosine curve now the integral of cosine X you've got to be able to get these right otherwise your areas are going to be wrong you'd show an area above the x-axis when it's below or below when it's actually above what is the integral of cosine X please do you need to memorize that yes yep and where are we going which one do we plug in first the pi over 2 or the zero all right which one the pi over two otherwise you'd have negative which would find it by the way if you notice that when your bounds are reversed notice how you're subtracting off the wrong thing let me switch your sign of your area right that's why the whole the property I gave you where you can switch your balances which is the sine of your integral that's why that comes about so here you'd have sine pi over 2 minus sine of zero all right come on now people I know you love some trig functions throw it at me one which one's one minus zero equals one your area is one that's weird oh my gosh have you thought of this what this is if you do you understand what this is yeah what's the picture it starts here goes like that here there right hope so hard cosine goes to oh I have to race it to draw a better picture did you have questions on that nope that's the video on what yeah you just found yeah don't draw these first round your card first shoot come on now so teach you a master's degree yeah yeah that's your area that you just found that's equal to one isn't that very interesting that's interesting it really is interesting in excess probably negative one and then it'd be very positive so on and so forth positive one negative one negative one positive okay and then do positive one so I'll add it all up zero yes okay is that just so it's the area of a circle zero did you catch that would it be if you did an integral yeah yeah because you had area above and the area below would match up because we're talking about net signed area right now we haven't made it to total area which is what we'll do in just a little while uh we haven't made it there yet total area would change the area below the x-axis into something above the x-axis so you could actually add it together we'll talk about that in just a bit but right now we'll do a couple more examples just to really illustrate this stuff and then we'll go until next class now they're always adding up to zero is that still true for also tangent no tangent has undefined points you can't go forever if you think about tangent yeah also one that would probably be kind of hard with uh Ramon sum and those are those limits okay not one that's great however can we do integrals with it sure sure you tell me what you do first thanks to the one half you know that'd be a good idea standard immigration sure don't jump to something super hard right away don't jump to a substitution I haven't showed you that for this yet right so that's off the table right now don't jump to that stuff see if you can do it easily all right make sure you use maybe change a root or two substitutions often work when you have electric functions as a good indication for that you should probably try or if you have parentheses that's a really good indication you should probably try and it won't distribute nicely that's a very good indication you should probably try so x to the one half yeah I'll bind to that DX I like that and combine that X2 that how much should we combine those you add right your X is five halves extra five times yes yeah can you take an integral of x to the five halves very easily this would be x to the seven halves over over seven halves over the same exact variable I'm sorry exponent uh exponent up top X1 on the bottom no problem make it a little bit prettier here we're gonna have two x to the seven halves over seven and then we get to evaluate from four to nine if we plug in a nine first I've actually given you some nice numbers do you know how to view seven halves uh on without a calculator or to make it quicker on the calculator this is power over root right oh geez I hope so do you remember that power overview so you can take either one whatever you want first I would take a square root of nine square root of nine is three three to the seventh that's what you plug it in your calculator I don't I can't do that in my head that's a pretty big number three to the seventh is huge so this is two times someone tell me what nine to the seven halves is or three to the seventh how much minus this is the square root of 4 is 2 then you do 2 to the seventh times two to the seventh blue are you okay on getting those numbers out ladies and gentlemen 2 times 280 2187 is what this should be 256. someone give me since we already have a common denominator someone give me 4374 minus 256 please does that simplify at all that's that's not there's a y7 then you'll leave it for the decimal if you really wanted to let's make sure before we end this that our math is correct okay get a double check on two one eight seven yeah you got that as well can I get to double check on the 128. same thing here as well all right how many people give what we talked about so far awesome we'll try a couple more examples we're almost done with our definite integrals all right well what do you say we continue some examples here up here we got the integral from 0 to pi over three of secant squared x DX now we don't have any substitution for definite integrals yet I'm going to show you something about that in a little bit so right now everything basically has to fit our integration table what we learned last time was that when we do an integral like this a definite integral we found out firstly how to do it and secondly that's exactly like find the area with a Vermont sum or the sum of those partitions which is very nice very very nice so let's go ahead let's take the integral of secant squared x DX do you all remember the integral of secant squared x DX tangent tangent squared just tangent good so here's how you write that he'd say okay I know this is 10x plus C or not yeah if it has bounds no because you're going to find an actual area because what you're going to do right now is you're going to be subtracting F of B minus F of a and if those did include C it'd be the same C that would drop out of your equation anyway so no we don't have a plus c on this what you do do is you have this first and then you throw up you know throw up sorry that's it when you get home for your homework you put up the the integration oh sorry the evaluation symbol you go okay I'm evaluating from zero to pi over 3. so therefore you show me what the integral is you show me your bounds of integration your bounds of evaluation and then you plug them in which one do you plug in first zero or the pi over three okay so what this says is tangent of pi over three minus tangent of zero plus not too painful how much is Tan pi over three don't leave me hanging awesome 1.73 like my calculator says yeah okay very good learning unit circle Route 3 over 2 divided by one half reciprocate multiply you get root three that's because it's sine of a cosine ah you need to know that okay anyway uh so we have our our integral that area underneath the curve of secant squared between 0 and pi over three is ah we got it square root of three it's interesting right it's kind of weird that we're able to find those areas so nice and neatly oh you need to try a couple more of these things yes no yes did that make sense to you besides the square root of three which you all just kind of screwed up right now all right hey you're the one screwed up okay explain to me something about this problem okay very good explain why what's wrong with this problem it should go from smaller to larger bounds in fact in fact if you did you would get complete you get the right answer actually if you try it right now you'll get the right answer but that proves the statement that we went before that this is going to be negative so for instance if you did this you get x to the fourth over four right no plus c but if you evaluate it from four to zero like it says you'd have zero to the fourth over four minus four to the fourth over four and what that would end up being is negative four to the fourth over four so four cubed negative 64. so I've done my math correct did I do my math correct yeah now let's check to see if we get the right answer the other way as well we also knew from a property that if I reverse this and go zero to four that becomes a negative well let's see that would be negative x to the fourth over four that would be negative you need brackets there because you can have a sign in the middle of that and that's evaluated from zero to four 4 to the fourth over four minus zero to the fourth over four that would give you negative 64. here 64. which by example kind of proves that that was true that I can reverse my bounds and that makes makes me change my sign so just by example we see that that is true but notice how you do actually get the same exact answer either way that's because it is true it has to be what it represents though it's kind of awkward because this looks like it's an area above the x-axis when in fact it's not this is just read wrongly incorrectly so the correct way to do this problem would be to write the balance in the appropriate order with the negative out in front of it and that would give you negative 64. either way but this is this is kind of showing you okay this is an area underneath the x-axis not above it how many will feel okay with with that one foreign okay we could bring that square to the top foreign okay all right you'd have negative one over one minus negative one over negative one Disco hopefully if I did that right make sure my signs are correct I'm looking at this negative one over one minus negative 1 over negative one that's negative 1 minus one negative two you get an answer you do but now think about the answer well you can have a negative it would mean it's underneath the x-axis oh that'd be okay think about the function then graph it on your graphing calculator if you can't think of the function it's a domain no because it's negative think about the function what's the function do I don't want to draw it in crayon for you think about what the function actually does we have done so much in this class for you not to know this say what where does it have an asymptote okay it does have those that's okay though because I'm between negative one and one I'm between that draw the graph if you if you draw it you should know the shape of that graph you really should okay you're gonna make me do it you're going to make me oh my gosh plug in zero why not so what's it tell you at x equals zero what do you have look at your bounds where they start okay so are you adding up areas that actually are undefined at zero so it says you're making rectangles one of those rectangles is going to Infinity do you see it it's probably infinite infinitely many of them are going to Infinity because when you go that close you're gonna anyway so can you add actually add the area even though you can do the work that doesn't exist there's a there's a theorem in calculus I don't think I get to it but basically it says that if you're not bounded somewhere if you're not bounded you can't add up those areas so if it goes on forever in One Direction right you can't you can't do it so you have to have that here we have an asymptote going to Infinity we're not bounded in any way shape or form therefore that area cannot exist or it does exist but you can't find it using the methods that we use there could be something else I'm not sure if they they have a way to do that to be honest with you right now but I I for what we know that doesn't work it's not negative two if you think about 1 over x squared that's positive anyway didn't it yep and if I did my signs wrong it would come out to zero I don't think I did my did I do my side wrong no hope not I did it real quick but if you did it would just come up to zero anyway which you know there's an area it goes like this it's it's it's a positive area so that it's not it makes nonsense and it's because there's a domain issue you you had it right it's not the negative it's a fact that we start here we end there and there's a problem between them that would be the problem do you get it there's a problem at zero zero is between negative one and one you have to be at least bounded between there typically you have to be continuous and bounded and that would make it work yeah even if even if our bones were a little bit wider it still wouldn't be on the fine sense that you can't measure measure at x equals zero what I mean by bounded isn't this way I mean this way um you have to have this here's a curve between these two points it's got to have a low point and a high point which means you can't come up with something here and come something there that's between really it's just if you're just talking about the x-axis is only above you just have to be bounded above it doesn't go anywhere if it was below the x-axis it'd be bounded below so this one's really irrelevant when you're talking about the x-axis that one doesn't matter but you find an area here it's got at least speed boundaries above when you do something like this hopefully you see the problem you see the problem how are you supposed to add that area that goes to Infinity I don't know what the area is I don't know if you can if it's if you can say infinite area I would assume so because it's going to Infinity but you can't calculate it like this like this how many people understood that where the problem is what's the problem again explain to me again what's the problem diminishing why why domain issue someone else domain issue why at zero and why is zero important it's actually in our interval if I had done this would there be a problem no not at all but if I cross over that undefined point where you have a domain issue and go into Infinity that's an issue for us we can't do that now is it kind of clear for you all right you guys had it come on you should know around the bed you should know that this picture looks like this too like that just by thinking about asymptotes you should know that it's until going to days like this asymptote in the middle goes like this says they're both positive pulling into positive is positive pulling a negative is positive goes like that you should know that anyway this none of that works so we just put undefined for well this one you would do oh yeah the new one would do but the original problem would be tried undefined or you would explain to me that there's a domain issue and that since our bounds are going from negative one I cross over somewhere we have a vertical asymptote therefore you know we can find the the area of that curve between those two points okay now let me show you one more thing that we can do are you ready for it were there any more questions on that line that's a good one huh even though because it looks like you can do it and you do it you go I win negative two but you don't think about what the function actually is it burns you up you don't want to do that by the way I don't assume that all of them are going to be like that on the test so if all of you go oh yeah it's got a domain issue I can't do it you're probably mistaken I'm not going to give you 20 integrals that you can't do okay you might get one of those 20 right yeah maybe one maybe maybe one I always find that funny I tell you one thing and you always assume it's that thing oops oh you know what I can show you one more thing on this uh so that you would you would actually see it as well if you you should know going back up here you should know that because of our property that we had okay that should be true right and now when you think of that you go oh there's a problem there see the problem there not zero the ending bounds there you couldn't even try to do the interval there you couldn't even plug it in you'd have undefined and undefined and I would show it to you right there okay so it's trick sum when I put it like this but when you see it like that you go oh yeah it's more clear now how about this one oh my gosh piecewise function can you do it with a piecewise function of course you can it's actually not even that hard what you have to do though is realize what this question is asking you this question says I want the integral from 0 to 6. of f of x where f of x is defined as X cubed when X is bigger than or less than two five x minus 1 when X is bigger than or equal to 2. so can you break up this integral in a very similar way I did up here so that you can make maybe two different integrals well let's do that where's our first integral going to start let's let's do this zero very good and and where does it go yeah because that's our separating point over there too um what function is defined between 0 and 2 the top one or the bottom one good the X cubed very good plus because we know using the property actually to find up here again for you we can separate an integral into two different integrals by matching up the bounds zero two and then two two of which other might have a question well does it matter that this one's actually less than two and this one's greater than or equal to two no not really we're we have such small rectangles doesn't really matter uh they're they're all going to match together anyway so no no if you have say that it wasn't greater than or equal to two then it would say which is greater than it would matter correct because you could have a gap like that no still do it although wait wait did you say that this one changed no the one that didn't have it then you'd have an undefined point yeah you I'll say it this way the area of one point doesn't even exist anyway so you could technically do it with two different integrals because the area of that one point doesn't matter uh it's one point area the width of one point is you can't do it there is no width between one point it's it's a a point is that which has no breath which means it does not have a width no matter what the type is the area would be zero of that single point however this wouldn't make sense from zero to six this one couldn't be given to you like that because this says continuously from zero to six and so that really wouldn't make sense does that make sense I couldn't do that to you because you wouldn't have the ability to break it up because to break it up it does have to be continuous um that in another without I think I gave that to you I don't know if I stated it word for word the way the book does but in order for that property to work the ability to split up that integral has got to be continuous that's another reason why this one would fail that's not continuous do you get that you could even split up to begin with it's got to be there it's got to all be there you kind of have the ability to break it up that's the only way this works otherwise you are missing points like you pointed out that's a good point a great question I talked through that pretty quickly are there any questions about what I just said were you able to follow it yes the bottom function is minus two or something either in the jump that you won't be able to do it either or if they didn't actually match um oh that's a good question you mean if there's a actual Gap like if we plug in 2 and it doesn't look they're not the same for both functions yeah they're not in this case no it doesn't matter just it means that you're defined for every point from in this case from zero to six that you have something for every one of those points okay that's the ability to break that up now in practicality does that if you add those areas or you add what was it here if you had those areas it's going to be the same you just can't do this if you don't have that that's the the point does that matter you just can't do it legally Legally speaking you can't do it theoretically we've made no difference so theoretically does make a difference that you cannot actually do it practically this area plus this area will equal this area yes sorry right now this area plus this area this area plus this error I should do it this way this area plus this area even like that will equal that area because the area under the point is zero but you can't do this unless you have this good questions you're making me work for my money today that's why they pay me the big bucks you know that right explain all this junk to you um the Audi I drive is o1 so huh okay the integrals aren't actually that hard let's plug the numbers and getting that right huh that's the biggest problem in math is small stuff my gosh don't forget any signs don't lose anything keep track of all your numbers get that stuff right new map s did y'all get your integrals correct you got access for them before from zero two you got five x squared over two minus Exogen forgiven to the minus one right from two to six did you get that far yeah now we plug the numbers in um probably I don't know if I should count on you guys on that one right okay you know your grouping needs some brackets and parentheses on this thing because you got stuff going all over the place especially when you have those those multiple turns being added or subtracted this one's pretty easy this one you just plug into two and you plug it into zero and that's very straightforward you get two to four over four minus zero over four this next one you got some things going on notice how you have to plug in the six that's giving you the five times six squared over two minus six then you plug in the two but you're subtracting remember it's F of B minus F of a the whole thing do you see why the parenthesis are important here okay if you wanted to distribute you distribute that sign with chain you know typically order operations say you add all that up together before you subtract anyway but it's important that you know that so we're plugging in the two we got all that down uh you want to help me with the math that should be what four four plus so that's four thirty six 90. 84. okay so that's 84. eight minus eight right looking like 80 to me did you get 80. cool how many people were able to find the 80. do you feel okay with it if you weren't able to actually do it on your own you were able to pick okay with it now what's it represent what did we just find the area of what yeah of this when it's defined this way between 0 and 60 if you found the area under that curve or actually the area uh the the net signed area if this thing went below the x-axis I'd can't see that it does but if it did go below the x-axis then we would actually have the area that's that takes the difference between the area above and the area below that would be that signed area do you feel okay with this example do you have any other other questions whenever we have multiple terms in one we just take the first one put in for all the X's solve and then take that absolutely what this says to do is you plug in the six the whole way through you figure it out that's the area from zero to six above this function then you subtract from 0 to 2 and that's what that's going to give you okay and so no matter how many terms we would have plug them all plug them all in and then subtract and then plug them all in and that's what you do you got to plug them into everything yeah and for this instance your X becomes six every vcx for this instance it X becomes two wherever you see X and then you subtract and that's what this meant F of B minus F of a that's what that meant you take your B you plug it in take your a you plug it in and then you subtract it okay now while we've been talking about this entire time is something called net signed area I gave you that signed error before what net sign area was was this you took the area one you took the area three because it was above the x-axis and you subtracted area two because it was below that is what your definite integral will do automatically without asking you it will do that why does it do that well because area below counts as negative area for a definite integral that's actually one of the things that we saw with our switch and signs that's another reason why that comes out negative is because when you go from whatever this point to whatever this point is if it's below it's going to be subtracting those those areas in thereby cause them to be negative so this counts it gets your your total area now in order to count total area what you do is this you say I want to count up the area that's between the two curves I don't care which one's on top or which one's on bottom I want to find out the actual area between them so find the area that's here and here and here that would be total area this is net signed area so one push and a half for you is how in the world could we get this area to become positive how would you do that absolutely see you later absolute value absolute value will absolutely take any negative thing and make it positive what whenever you see it right so what we're going to try to do is this we're going to try to take this one and flip flip it over and say all right well total area then should become area one area three not that we don't want that that's going to count as negative area what we want to do is find a way to flip it over here and make it count for us that would be total area for a total area we need to change the sign of area two in other words if you kind of go on further than this you say well I want to change the sign of any area that's below the x-axis if I can do that then that negative area actually counts as positive area we added up together and what we end up doing is we end up finding the area between two curves one of the curves is the function the other curve is simply the x-axis now in section 5.1 we go further and we actually do legit two curves not just the x-axis but keep in mind that this is exactly what we are doing is finding the area between two curves so I'm going to draw on this later you understand so this is one curve this is the other curve it's a very simple curve it's just x equals zero but what we're doing is finding the area that's bounded between two curves that's what we're doing literally in order to do that that's positive that's positive that's negative we have changes sign of that for the x-axis that's it so for total area we need to change the sign of area two or in other words the area of any piece of the region that is negative foreign excuse me that's the area that's below the x-axis no I'll show you how to do it right now okay now check it out here is net signed area net signed area said you start at a you go to B you just take the integral of whatever function you have and whatever happens happens positive area means most of it's above the x axis negative area means most of it's below the x-axis even if we cross over it just basically says your net change what what is mostly happening whether you're more positive the negative or more negative and positive no matter what it actually is on the on your graph does that make sense to you now total area says no no no we're going to take all the negatives and we're going to make them positives whatever the positives with us we're gonna leave them alone the thing that leaves positives alone and changes negative suppositives is of course absolute value like you said so total area says all right we'll still go from A to B but now we have the absolute value of f of x just remember one thing the absolute value of f of x so the absolute value of any function is actually piecewise it's going to look kind of like this is why we did this first it says you keep f of x if f of x is positive you make it negative f of x if f of x is negative that's why you do absolute value it says shoot man if your function is positive why are you going to change it that's going to be a positive area in fact we know it's going to be positive area for one of the properties I taught you before whenever your function is completely above the x-axis hopefully we need to listen to this whatever function is complete above the x-axis your area would be positive remember that whenever your function is completely below the x-axis you're going to be negative if we make an area a negative area negative that's changing the sign of your negative area it will become positive so here's what this says this area will be positive this area this area will be negative so we're going to change the sign thereby making it positive are you clear on this did I blow your mind grenade did I really hope so would you like to see an example in practice Yeah it's not hard thank you it's gonna look a lot like this as a matter of fact there's just one more step to be able to figure out where you separate it you see we just did this piece of ice function only in this piecewise function I gave you the separating Mark right I said you go from zero two and two to six all you're going to have to do is figure out where that Mark is for yourself what that's called is a sign analysis test bam I told you this is exciting exciting stuff here folks signing out how can you not get excited with Sun analysis test find the area between f of x equals 1 minus x squared and the x axis on zero two well what we mean is total area let me let me insert that right here find total area total area between that side area would be very easy net side area you would just take the integral look at here would be net sign area it would be from where would your integral start ladies and gentlemen where where would it end so your function is 1 minus x squared DX this right here is net signed area do you understand it would take the area above the x-axis subtract the area below that x axis because it would be negative and that will be your net gain your net change in area okay that's what that would be this says Ah new total area the total area will do this it will take the negative area and we'll flip it above the x-axis or at least it'll change the sign of it and that would count as positive area it would say I want to find the area between them take all of it and add it all together no matter what the sign is added together because the absolute value will change it to a positive you're following that okay so how do we actually do it well here's your steps step one you've got to set your function equal to zero do you know why you got such a function equal to zero not wires hey if you're trying to figure out where the function is above and below the x-axis you better find out where it crosses of the x-axis that makes sense to me does that make sense to you because you know where across the x-axis then you can perform a sign analysis test plug in some numbers easily and say oh it's above it's below therefore I know when the area is going to be positive I want to be negative you get me so set the function equal to zero and solve so for us I'll do that in purple so you see the work over here we're just going to get 1 minus x squared equals zero well there's only like two more steps what are you going to do with this probably add x squared yeah and then you're gonna yeah sure square root plus or minus x equals negative 1 and 1. raise your hand feel okay with this so far okay now the next step you got to set this up correctly what you're going to do is you're going to do a sign analysis test analysis but you only need a few of these points what points do you need well let's see do you need the zero yeah do you need the two of course do you need the one yes do you need the negative one no no no no you don't need that one why not it's not just doesn't care so really you're going to make a side analysis with your endpoints of your interval your bounds of integration and whatever points fall between them that's it so make it with your your endpoints and your x-intercept that fall within those endpoints foreign points then you know what you wouldn't even need that because it's either all going to be positive or all going to be next you just test one and go with it yeah so signals with endpoints and any x-intercepts that happen to be within your bounds of integration well let's go ahead and do that now so we're going to make a sign analysis test here's how sign analysis testability case you forgot what you do is you take your balance of integration first the balance of integration start at zero and then end at two you take any of those x-intercepts that you have those are the places where you're crossing the x-axis and therefore that's the places where your signs could possibly change well only one of them that's one feel okay with your seven analysis so far after that after you make that that number line you just determine when f of x is above zero and f of x is below zero that's just clicking into Point plug in one point for each of these intervals that's only two you want to feel over here I don't care I don't care about that one either I care about these two intervals plug in one point see whether it's above or below the x axis recall that if it's above the x axis the area has to be positive if it's below the x axis the area will be negative and this is a separating point between those two areas that's why we set it equal to zero so we're going to determine what f of x is greater than zero that would be above the x-axis or less than zero below the x axis have you done it already you plug in probably one half where are we plugging this in by the way to our original function yeah plug in the function it's going to tell you I don't care about the number I care about the sign of the number which one's one half okay so this is positive and this one's negative cool what this says is that from zero to one I'm above the x axis from one to two I'm below the x axis we're going to have to come up with that that sign change we're going to do it right now what we do is we're going to split up the integral using the definition for absolute value foreign foreign okay here we go this is a good part let's find tool area so where are we going to start and where are we going to stop for our first interval where are we going to start zero to where cool yeah yeah absolutely now think back to this what the absolute value of x says it's sorry absolute value of f of x says is if it's positive you leave it alone if it's negative it changes the sign so when this is positive here's what we're going to do between 0 and 1. do I change the sign or not what do you think I'm going to leave alone I'm just going to do 1 minus x squared why don't we have the absolute value still foreign I'm actually using this to change it I'm saying well if f of x is positive for that region then I know the absolute value of f of x is simply f of x I know that this is positive for this region therefore the absolute value of f of x is simply f of x that's the that is what this says it says hey if it's positive you don't change anything about it you basically just drop your absolute value signs are you with me on that okay DX plus again the reason why we do this just like the piecewise example do you recall that between 0 and 2 if I find some intermediate point I can split up my integral from 0 to 1 and then also from one to two remember that it's continuous no problems no breaks that's great between zero and two we're going to go zero to one we're going to go one to two now between one to two this is why we did our sign analysis test our function is negative which says it's below the x-axis it says that the absolute value of x well if f of x is negative you're gonna have to change that sign if you follow you can't just drop the absolute value because it's not positive you go all right well back up here I'm going to have 1 minus x squared sure but negative it makes you feel better I can do this too you can do lots of things as you want so hands I'm gonna be okay with that so far okay I'm not gonna do much of a recap I'm just going to say what we're doing here is basically using a sign analysis to our advantage to determine when our function is positive and negative where it is positive for that region you leave it alone you you just write it no absolute value where it's negative you just write it but you have the negative in front of it this is the reason why though is because we have this scenario because we know that the function's above the x-axis the area will be positive if the area is if the function is below the x-axis it will be negative and that one nice property to set if you have a continuous function between two points you can split up that integral into two different integrals by using some number that's between them that's all these properties coming together there's a lot of properties we're actually using here to be able to do this it's kind of cool now what I would do with this integral I wouldn't distribute this I pull the negative out I would do I just pull the negative out just make it a minus that means the area is 0 to 1 of 1 minus x squared DX minus one to two one minus x squared DX I'm doing this just so you can see this this part of it check it out but you know this area is positive right right you know this area is going to be negative right minus a negative area that's adding the area that's all this really does for you why don't you go ahead and do those see what you get foreign foreign foreign foreign did you get two I got two I don't know if I did a ride there pretty quick did you get two if you didn't get to his old fraction work but hopefully you got two where how many people were able to make it down to this part right there that part the integral did you get that far good did you plug in all the numbers at least this far yeah from here on out it's just fraction work uh calculators are fine I don't care as long as you're able to get the right answer down here be able to do that uh can someone please double check my work to make sure that I am correct on that yeah make sure all my signs are right you did how many double checks do we have they got two good for you good for me actually I did shoot come on all right well we're ready to tackle the fundamental theorem of calculus part one the first part we did was actually part two that was all the area things and being able to calculate a definite integral which means an area by doing that whole subtraction find an anti-derivative plug in B find the anti-derivative plug in a and subtract the two that's the fundamental theorem of calculus part two the part one basically says this it says the derivatives and integrals are inverses says one undoes the other that that's basically the idea the most common like small sense I can make it so let's suppose we have this this function y equals f of x is some function and it's continuous over a certain interval starts at a a point and ends wherever we want ends at some X down the way you get me on that some some X even even changeables provides continuous up to that point then the area is a of X we already know that area is going to be some area function such that when I take the first derivative of my area what does it have to give me in this case say it again very good so if f of x is continuous over this then the area is a of X some area function and the derivative of the area function must give me back my function of my original function that was the antiderivative thing saying that this is the anti-derivative this is the antiderivative of that treating this like a derivative going backwards well I could write that a different way I could write that also as the area then should be the integral of f of x we also had that from the the for more missing right says that if I want to find the area it should be the integral of f of x DX from a to X you okay with that as well it says that the first derivative of the area is going to give me my function back therefore the antiderivative of my function between my two bounds whatever they happen to be should give me my actual area it should give me the area now this is in terms of not a b but an X so as to give me the a of X not the actual area does that make sense it'll be a function of the area that's what it's saying there how you'll feel okay with that so far now I'm going to do one thing so that we don't get a little bit confused because it's kind of awkward to have a function terms of X and then have a bound of X what we use here is called a dummy variable it really doesn't matter it's just a variable that we're going to be integrating because you're going to be plugging in X later anyway so the X's will appear so typically what people do at this point they go you know what let's not call it f of x let's call it f of t DT they make it a dummy variable now why the dummy variable doesn't matter is because when you think about it when you take the integral of this you're going to have a function in terms of T correct but look at your bounds of integration you're going to go from a to X you'll be plugging in the X's somewhere for your t's you'll reinsert them into your equation that would give you an area of function in terms of X like we're looking for how many go feel okay with this so far okay well here's the basic idea I'm gonna try to tie all this together for you real nice and I'm going to try or try to try I really will try to make it neat would you agree that this equals this yes for sure you you believe that yeah oh then we're almost done that's fantastic very good because this means a derivative right that means a derivative so the first derivative equals f of x the first derivative equals f of x however we we also have this statement right here what I'm going to do is make is make a little substitution right there so what this says is the derivative of a of x here's another interpretation of a of x what's F equal what did the sequel are you seeing that this is the same thing as this yes or no this is a of X so is that from right here I just went this way I made a of X that way that has to equal f of x as well this right here is the fundamental theorem of calculus part one okay yeah because we talked about this first and does it and so and so where you have the F of T because of the way you do the integral you're just swapping it out and inserting your X to make it come out with f of x not F of T right we use the uh we use the T here so you don't get confused in X of X because it's hard to think about oh I'm going to plug in X in for an X that's weird why do we do that but so what we do is we use a t and say I'm plugging in both X and A for my time or you could like use x subscript One X subscript 2 to keep them separated or it doesn't matter what we use besides t no you could use the H there if you really want T is a dummy variable it doesn't really matter you're gonna need you're going to be integrating some variables right for those variables you'll be plugging in X's that's the idea did you follow a of x equals this derivative of a of x equals this therefore derivative of this equals f of x that's a table of theorem of calculus part one here's what it says in plain English okay it says if you take a what's this stand for of uh what's it stand for it will give you back your function that's it if you take a derivative of an integral basically it undoes everything it essentially says they're inverses it says a derivative undoescent integral a integral of your function gives you something right an area function as it will then you take a derivative of that it gives you a break gives you original function back now why why why is this important because that seems pretty Common Sense doesn't it well you've already kind of thought that well I mean shoot if an integral is undoing a derivative it should be the inverse of a derivative this this proves it the derivative is inverse of an integral but how why we do it is because sometimes it makes um make certain integrals very easy to do here's why maybe not in certain integrals but certain computation is very easy to do foreign any work any work you can tell me what this is actually x to the fourth without doing any work why well because you have a derivative of an integral the integral starts I don't care but it ends at X wherever it is that means that this is going to be whatever our dummy variable is but with an X instead so this becomes by this by this theorem if you want to see it proved out which we can do that directly I'll show it to you right now um that will be a derivative of if you did the integral you're going to get t to the fifth over five from one to X true what that would give you is a derivative of x to the fifth over five minus one to the fifth over five do you see where the x is coming in you said why we have a dummy variable it doesn't really matter if you're plugging in export anyway okay do you see why this number doesn't matter when you plug in a number to that you're going to get all constants what happens when you take a derivative of constants zero so really only that matters so you're going to get a derivative x to the fifth over five minus one-fifth what's the derivative of x to the fifth over five minus one-fifth ladies and gentlemen foreign which proves it well at least for this example I basically kind of proved it here with this statement here it's done there's some more serious proof to it if you really want but that's basic enough for us now that you could do directly some of them you can't so when you get to this this integral like this I don't want you to spend too much time on it because there's no way you can do this integral in this particular class let's say you had something from 1 to X INE of T over T DT you can't do that integral directly you can't do it the same way I did it all right it's not you can't just Hammer at it not an integration table you can't do it however because you have a derivative of an integral from 1 to X from a any a to X you can use the same property right here so how much is this going to be equal to sine X over X is right that's exactly correct now one thing does have to be defined for the entire just like remember how we found out last time it's got to be defined you can't it's going to be continuous it's got to be very nice you can't have the undefined points it has to be bound somewhere I'll be okay here one to X remember this is a small number so it can't go backwards are we okay what's the one number that's not okay we miss a zero so we're okay if this had gone from like negative one to X we probably have a problem because we couldn't evaluate that in the goal foreign so when you get to some of your homework some of it's going to be kind of easy uh if it looks like this a derivative of an integral and you're going from a to X and it's defined for that whole region that means it starts higher than any problems that you have that's all you got to do plug in your x's and you're done a derivative will undo an integral that's the fundamental theorem of calculus part two part one what I say two part one that's it everyone understood that good for you that's fantastic which all intervals were like that I know right well the thing is we don't always take derivatives of integrals right next to each other it's not doesn't happen very often but it's a it's a statement that says it is true it's proving that they are inverses now we're going to move on this is typically a different section in most other books but this book ties it all together with this we're going to continue doing definite integrals only we're going to do some more I guess tricky ones they're not super tricky but they're going to incorporate something you've already learned in this class which I guess is kind of nice but we haven't dealt with it yet we're going to start talking about how to do definite integrals that might involve a substitution you ready to learn how to do that it's not hard you've already learned a substitution right yes so if you've already learned substitution I just have to tell you what to do with the bounce the bounds of integration after that everything falls into place so same idea let's look at how we deal with balance that will be our the rest of our lesson okay Okay so oh what are we on we're still on uh 4.45 4.5 it's still a good station with that so we'll talk about definite integrals thank you but this time we might have some substitution it's still in your best interest on your homework to check if you can do the integral without substitution if it's just a simple distribution or simple a simple changing of some exponents from square roots into one house I think we had one this last time right and you combine them that's probably easier than substitution because substitute might even work in that case but if you have to use a substitution at least you know how to do it already there's there's basically two methods I'll show you method one first and I'll show you method two method one says this foreign it says you're not going to change your balance you're going to do the same exact thing as before but you're going to be sure to substitute back in for you before you evaluate so method number one is don't change balance Sub in for you at the end foreign don't change the balance substitute back in for you before you evaluate and you'll see exactly what I mean on this example foreign there you go okay let's look at the integral that's the first time we've had like a honest to goodness integral with some numbers up there and something that was wasn't just super super basic so this looks like a real integral with some real numbers and some honest work to do first thing could you distribute everything out you could you really could in this example you probably wouldn't want to though because that's a power three it's going to take it take you a long time so substitution in this case would probably be your best bet ignore the bounce when you're picking your substitution it's just a basic integral just like you did with indefinite integrals pick the correct substitution why don't you do that now at this point I'm hoping that most of the substitutions are pretty obvious the only times they might be maybe wouldn't be is uh with some of the square roots sometimes people forget about that or trig functions sometimes they're not obvious you have to guess and check so you what's you yeah good what's d u H yeah don't forget that yes you need the DX and then hell I've taught you how to do this is I've had you solve for DX that makes a substitution nice and neat so in solve for DX you're going to get d u over 2X equals DX you came to so far everybody okay now what do we do so we're going to have what are we going to have a why don't you tell me exactly okay I've heard 4X what'd you say after that yeah perfect and then what excellent zero can we talk about that in a second person how many people feel okay with our substitution Forex is still there for right now the U cubed comes from U cubed DX no no not DX anymore d u over two x and then we start simplifying things and then Michael said something interesting from zero to two um yes and and kind of no yes and no we're going to put it there but I want to show you why method two uh can do something different for you because as soon as you do this from zero to two as soon as you do that from zero to two look what's going to happen sure you're going to eliminate this two and that's going to become a 2. yeah and you eliminate this X and this X and what you would get is zero to two with a 2 out in front of it you see where the two out in front of it's coming from that two pull up front U cubed d u variable what's your variable Union if it's you not you you it's you what were these bounds originally in so we kind of have bounds that don't match our integral right now which is sometimes leads to problems because what people do often is they'll do this they'll go okay hey I know how to take an integral it's very easy I'm going to have 2 U to the fourth over four and then they do this explain me why that might be incorrect yeah right these are in terms of X right but the integral makes it seem like you're plugging them in for U now you can do it this way you can you really can provide that you do one thing provided that you don't change the balance we didn't change the bounds and substitute back in for you before evaluating so not here this would be the wrong way to go do you see why it's the wrong way to go honestly do you see it yeah you're trying to plug in X is for use that's not going to happen so instead we're going to do a little bit of Supplication still we're going to get the fourth over 2 and you all said that you're going to substitute back in for U in terms of X before you plug this in you see if these are in terms of X I want my function to be in terms of X my integral to be in terms of X when I got to be in terms of X before I evaluate so we'll substitute back in for the U we'll get our x to the second minus 1 all to the fourth power then over two and at this point this is where I should evaluate so right here a little bit of craft up there now we need to go from zero to that's okay that says now that we have this in terms of X is great they match up with our X bounds that we started with now plug in the two plug in zero once you do that and see what you get don't neglect that zero zero squared minus one isn't zero so you're going to get something over there I got that did you get that cool what's it mean it's an area what type of an area is a total area an assigned area good we haven't talked about absolute value or anything um not sure if that one's going to have any negative area if you graft on a graphing calculator you could tell or if you wanted to find out total area what you would have to do is find out whether that's above or below the x-axis for all of those points I'm not sure in either case maybe you can look at that but you'd have the absolute value for total area you remember doing that from last time yeah that's a value you take this you said equal to zero you'd have your pain points and any points in between there that would change the sign of that thing and you separate those two intervals and that's how you do that problem so this actually is net signed area whether or not we have it all above or or below and this if it was all above the x-axis netsigned area would be told area but if there's any area below the x-axis it would have automatically subtracted in there for us so that's the case otherwise anyone graph that do you know if there is any area below the x-axis between zero and two I guess we could find out real quick between zero and two yeah yeah there is between zero and one it looks like this is negative yeah okay that's what it looks like I mean there's a little portion like that just a little bit on the side of the row it looks like well ah C you can see yeah we have a little bit below the x-axis between zero and two so that's going to be counted against our area right here so this is actually total not not total area this is net sign area it's discounting the part between 0 and 1 and then we have from one to two that would actually be positive but it's greater than the negative area that's why we have a positive 40 out of that and we will do okay with that so far would it be substantially harder to do that it's actually harder to break them up not really it's actually just a matter of separating our integral going from zero to one and having a negative in front of that and then going from one to two and doing it just like we just did you just plug in some different numbers so it's not that much harder just have to do an integral twice so I don't want to do that right here because we have to change bounds a lot in the next next example but that would be something to talk about are you okay with uh with this first example do you understand the idea of not changing balance basically the same exact thing you do for every example you just don't change the bounds you do the integral like you normally would change it back into action like you normally would and then plug the numbers in that's the first method second method says well maybe there's maybe not necessarily A quicker way it's not quicker maybe we can just do it a different way and either way notice that you're going to be plugging these numbers in you will be plugging in zero and you will be plugging in two usually do it a different time so we're going to talk about method two I'll show you how that works yeah I'll tell you which method to use on the test when I want you to use it if I don't tell you a method you do whatever method you want okay you must usually learn both methods okay method two method two is you change balance you change bounds during your first substitution thank you if that's the case here's I'll give you like a little foreshadow of what's going to happen you're going to change your balance from X's into terms of U using your substitution if you change your bounds into terms of U do you need to substitute back in at this point for x no no because they'll be in terms of U so if you do method two you change your balance and then you do not substitute back in before evaluation it's the same tell you what let's do the same example can we do the same example just do a different way foreign so you can see I'm not full of smoke here it really does work out I'm not here to re-teach you how to do substitution I've already got you everything you need to know that's that's not doesn't change so that's nice you'll still use the same substitutions no matter what what I'm here to tell you is there's a slightly different way to do it so if we pick the same substitution U is still x squared minus 1 and a d u is still 2x DX and sure enough d u over 2X still going to equal DX that doesn't change at all still okay with that here's the change the change says well since we're substituting everything anyway I mean we're substituting this for you this X part for U and this X part for you why not just do the balance as well why don't we substitute those things for you as well and here's how to do it you're all right well that's a good idea Mr Leonard let's try here's the point when you look at that that says X is going to become 2 that says X is going to become 0. why don't you find out what U would be when X becomes 2 and U becomes 0 and that's the that's the question notice how we're actually doing that right here we're plugging into two we're plugging in zero zero it's just within the evaluation process here you just do it beforehand so that when you get your balance it's in terms of U so you don't have to do this step you just go directly from here it's basically do you want to do the work beforehand or do you want to do the work after does it matter you're going to do the work either way so it's really up to you now I'm going to make you learn bold I'm going to tell you what to do but it's an option for you you got it so we'll say if x equals 2 at x equals zero this is the whole process of changing balance if x equals 2 then U equals 2 squared minus one then U equals 2 squared minus one see where the two is coming from right and U is going to equal what okay if x equals zero U equals zero squared minus one very good well now we can make a substitution with everything and the bounds will match to the uh the variable which is nice so let's do it do we still have a 4X of course do we still have x squared minus 1 of course not that was our U notice how it's going to look exactly the same as the previous problem d u over 2x the only thing that's going to be different is what what is the what does zero become what did the Two Become it's going to be done the same way two is gone X is gone so negative 1 to 3 will still pull the 2 outside you did the third du hey we even do the interval the same way we're going to get two U to the fourth over four and we'll simplify that U to the fourth number two but now when I do my evaluation do I have to substitute back in for the U no because we did our balance and that's the only reason why we had to here because the bounds were in terms of X here you've already changed them you've taken x's and you made U's out of them once you make use out of them you can use it right here get it you can use it here negative one to three because those are in terms of you plug them in you're going to get the same answer so let's try that hopefully you get the same answer it makes it so your evaluation is just a little bit simpler by the way because you typically typically because you have uh this function is gone right now that you don't have to plug that in and they don't do all the math basically you just do it ahead of time you're still doing it though you're still doing it it's just kind of set aside for you up here which is I suppose nice minus negative one to the fourth over two well what that's going to be is 81 over 2 minus one half and again that's 40. show of hands how many people feel okay about the both methods how many people prefer method one method one okay that's cool you can it's fine how many people prefer method two people seem to to like that a little bit better for some reason uh simply because you're doing the work ahead of time you don't have to worry about this later on the two mistakes I see are are this uh I see because people integration is not that bad I see people making mistakes here they either forget to substitute Back in X here or they accidentally do it here again and they get something way off you see what I'm saying that's where the mistakes happen so do one or the other now of course on a test I will ask you for both maybe not even that long so you do this if you want but I'll give you some where you have to change balance I say I want to see you changing balance so you do need to learn that method either way so those intermediates since like where it says two kind of integral of your Q been zero and two that's not actually true right this is slightly off right so yeah how would you actually write that if you're still right yeah you're so right uh but that's this is one of the reasons why we have that because you go oh these fountains don't really match up with that letter now you could say well maybe we'll just treat like a dummy variable it's really not because of substitution but we know in our head that we're just going to plug back in for X so it still works but you those really don't match up all that well actually at all they're x's and that's a u good question any other questions before we go on he actually work it has to do the same thing it is the same thing you're just doing one part here and you're doing one part here one part before evaluation before even integral another part after the integral during evaluation that's really it you're doing the same work same one just two different places good questions any other questions before we go on well why don't worry why does it work yeah well it's taken a function to make it something else uh basically translating into a different variable yeah and then you have to change your X variable into your U variable to make it work okay so right now this is zero two but it's regarding the X function this is negative one to three but it's regarding the U function that you just created does that mean that the integral level translating into yourself within that family okay that way it comes out to be in the same area well that's a good question um you're completely changing the function when you do this right you really are and so you're just making it it's almost magical it works kind of cool but it's you're making a different function and saying the areas will be the same because I'm working with different balance in that function if you try to do it graphically man I have a hard time believing that too too you cubed is going to look anything like uh 4X x squared minus 1 to the Third in fact I know that because a cubic is just goes like this right 4X x squared minus 1 to the third does well we saw it I showed you the graph it doesn't look the same so you're changing functions but you're only talking about the areas so basically you're saying the area here between these bounds is the same as the area here between these balances I suppose perhaps but it's a direct rate that means it's equal a new portion would be a better way to make analogy there um but something similar to that idea it's kind of it's very cool now you need to know the substitution doesn't always work right so you can't always it's only very special cases I can give you lots of intervals where you can't use a substitution in fact most you can't use a substitution that's special well everyone that you can do substitution with the derivative has to be in there somewhere right it's got to work that way in your next semester which I'll be teaching in uh no spring of oh one three a year from now a year from now so just go ahead and fail this class or something take it next semester pass it with some other teacher and then come and see me just 4B for now you need to skip up to 4C no okay then my videos won't be in order I see that wouldn't work they're going to be in order all right what do you say we practice a couple more would you like that yes hmm you're not sticky enough some of you always complain I give you stuff that's too easy in class and doesn't look like your homework well here deal with that then huh actually it kind of does look like your homework most of the top I would say some of them are harder would you not say I think except for the most part anyway that's fairly difficult looks like something that would throw some people for a loop let's talk about it uh firstly can is it a fit your integration table directly just like that oh not at all so it's going to probably involve a substitution if we can do it it will involve a substitution I want you to think through don't say it out loud just think about what a proper substitution would be in this case think don't say hello some of you might be asking well could it be 2X could it be 2x if it was 2x it'd be sine of U to the fifth times cosine of U side view the fifth times cosine U does not fall in the integration table so that doesn't really help you at all let me change it let me see if I know what you're saying you're saying that if I change it to this change it like that okay that's good why is she changing to that what do you think it really is easier to see isn't it uh your U should not be 2X not 2x that's not going to work for you I know I said it's supposed to be the inside thing this is an inside thing however if you take the 2x the derivative of 2x is only two that's just a constant it's not going to eliminate the cosine it's not going to eliminate the sine you're still going to have sine and cosine that would be a bad choice but you'd see that bad choice within like a minute right at least I would hope so because you go through the process of your way to say yeah something's not right here micheliner I changed this thing and you change it then you look back at your integral and say well do I pick sine of 2x or cosine of 2x because that's the only other thing I'm going to do I'm definitely not going to pick to the fifth power fifth power you'd have it you know you'd have some sort of a chain chain rule or general power if you want that's going to make things a little messy because you're going to have sine then cosine because it's not going to simplify out for you very nicely you typically pick the inside of something without the power so we're going to pick sine of 2x foreign remember how to take derivatives of sine of 2x because a lot of people here forget one thing about this do you see that sine of 2x is actually a no it's not a negative image it's a change or whatever D U equals here's how you do chain rule how do you do a chain rule uh do you people don't take your side flip the cosine 2X multiplied by DD of X of 2x okay cosine 2X absolutely but then the derivative of the inside must also be there you see when people do this a lot of times they're offline factor of two actually a factor of one half because when you divide this one-half but they're off by that they're off by a factor of two because they forget all about the two do you see the two don't lose two okay so we're gonna have d u equals cosine 2X times 2 DX otherwise I'd probably write it as 2 cosine 2X DX that's the appropriate way to write that just don't lose the two it's a chain rule you got to have the derivative of 2x somewhere the derivative of 2x is the 2 move it out in front of your cosine so what we're going to get is d u once we solve for DX it's going to be kind of obvious that we picked the right choice and here's where you'd make that judgment by the way you're getting more practice on uh substitution right now too right it's kind of nice do you see anything that's going to cross out that's where you make your your judgment you go okay if this becomes a you I'm good to go if this gets crossed out that's fantastic and I'll be left with no more x's and that's exactly what we want you feel okay with this so far now at this point we're also going to change our bounds we're going to change our balance because I don't know about you but I'd rather deal with the bound changes now and then just have to plug in some numbers rather than change everything back to sine of 2x and then have to plug in numbers and then figure out sine of that again you follow me I don't have to do that so when we have x equals pi over 8 and x equals zero let's figure out what those things are some of you guys are zoning out don't zone out stick with me here you use your U substitution you plug your X in and you figure out what U's value is so here we'll have sine of 2 times x well X in this case is pi over 8. how much is sine of pi over 4. 2 divided by 2 very good absolutely right you guys okay with the root two over two awesome let's do the zero I'll take care of the zero for you sine of two times zero I love this one that's sine of zero sine of zero is one right good just checking I was really checking it yeah and zero same zero is zero so do you know your new balance let's do the substitution let's do it correctly let's substitute everything we can we'll substitute for DX we'll substitute for the sine of 2x we'll also substitute for bounds so here's how the integral looks when we've done all our substitution we go from where to where now where do we start zero to where that's because we're going to change all this stuff in terms of U that's why we did our changing balance okay is the sine of 2x to the fifth power still there can you please tell me what I have instead people on the left U to the fifth not just you but you to the fifth that became a you yes you to the thing do I still have the cosine of 2x there as of right now yes do I still have a DX there yeah no that's our substitution right here we're going to do d u over two cosine 2X but I show your hands how many people feel okay with this so far so far good that's awesome almost everybody okay tell me some nice things that happened what are we going to do right there you know for sure your substitution working you have nothing but use you've already done your balance change that's great and do what else great the two's on the denominator becomes a one-half I like it zero to root two over two dependable do you now that is a nice easy integral the numbers you have to plug in aren't all great but that's okay just plug them in so take our integral we're going to give don't forget about that one half one half U to the sixth over six I'm going to make this nice and neat before I evaluate I'm going to get U to the 6th over twelve foreign do I have to plug in the X back into this thing before I evaluate why not because you avoid taking care of it I'm going to change my balance that's exactly right okay so root 2 over 2 we're going to plug that in first then we'll subtract and plug in zero so root 2 over 2 to the sixth power over 12 minus zero to the sixth power over 12. foreign now root 2 to the sixth power is 2 to the third eight so you got 864 stairs well yeah root two to the sixth a it is eight right yeah that's going to be one eight yeah one eight yes am I way off or am I okay 1 8 over 12 over one reciprocating multiplied okay okay what I'm asking you are you okay up to here are you okay up to here after that use your calculator I'm gonna do it I did it because it's uh square root of 2 squared to the third so square root of 2 squared is 2 then 2 to the third is eight that's how I did it and then two to the six I had to have up with that that's that's the 64 and then you start simplifying that but that's the way you probably do this without a calculator how many people understood what we just talked about feel okay with both methods you can do it without changing balance right that's pretty basic just make sure you sub in before you evaluate now changing balance a little bit more advanced of a concept but it makes things easier sometimes nice nice doing this off to the side you have to really worry about it then you just use your U just make sure you don't the worst thing you can do is substitute back in for X here and then evaluate with your terms of U that does twice the work with no reward all right let's continue a couple examples like I said we got maybe two more to do I'll show you how even and odd functions can play a role in calculating some integrals sometimes very nicely and then we'll get on to how to find the area between two curves and you're going to find out that it's it's just a small extension about what we've been doing so far you guys ready for today let's do this so looking at our first example we got the integral of course we're talking about a definite integral so think in an area from two to five of 2x minus 5 and x minus 3 to the ninth power now does that fit your integration table in order to make it fit you'd have to distribute the x minus 3 to the ninth and then foil well foil oil first Outside Inside all that not just foil anyway several several times until you got this huge polynomial then take the integral of each piece which would be fine to do it would take a long time but it is possible and then you plug in the numbers to every single variable that get a little tedious right so if that's the case when it looks like that you're probably going to try a substitution probably going to try substitution now one is not readily apparent because what I've told you about substitutions is normally usually the derivative has to be up there somewhere right it's got to be if not you need to manipulate the substitution somehow so let's go ahead let's pick a substitution the one that you probably want to pick right now anyway and then let's see if it works for us okay so pick a substitution right now go for it on your own using what I've told you pick a substitution is it 2x minus 5 or x minus 3 that you picked good including the ninth power or not no it's usually just the thing inside the power that we we take okay well that's all well and good U equals x minus three what do we do after that this is pretty easy in this case d u equals DX hey that's nice that's a direct substitution from d u to DX however when you look at the problem we go from two to five we're going to change this in a second by the way I just want to make sure the substitution is going to work before I start changing bounds and doing things like that I don't want to waste any time I still have a 2X minus 5 and here I'm going to have a u to the ninth and my DX will be a d u u to the ninth got it DX is D U Got It what's the problem there's still a mass that's the problem you have a d u but you will have a u and an X and these are still in terms of what right those are in terms of X so if we can make the substitution work I'm going to go back and change the balance but I want to make sure it works first before I waste that time you got me when this happens to you and it will when it happens that you make a substitution and you know you made the right one yeah if you made this one that certainly wouldn't work in the way shape form but if you know you made the right one you know wait a second that's not falling out of my integral anywhere sometimes sometimes not all the time but sometimes it means that you have to manipulate the substitution to solve for x and substitute in for x and that's sometimes what it means so when we have especially when there's no power or anything you can do that oftentimes and we'll be able to distribute later so it says okay U equals x minus 3 can you solve that thing for x how would you do it then what you say is all right then X is U plus three correct now we can make the substitution instead of X hey what else could I write let's do that then it changes everything into ease so our integral I'll do the balance in just a second our integral is 2 what else parentheses I like it minus five and all that well yeah big old bracket because you're still multiplying by U to the ninth well let's see if we can all follow that do you see where the U plus 3 is coming from ladies and gentlemen so we're using the substitution we just made to solve it for the other variable solve it for X that way we can substitute that in and it changes everything into use and that's great so we change that into a u we have two that's U plus three and then minus five the whole thing still being multiplied by either the ninth so I still have to have that bracket now at the same time since we're now all in terms of U now that's where we probably will at least change our bounds that that'd be a good thing to do so once you go through right now and change your balance for me I'll do on the board as you're doing it but make sure you can do it don't just follow what I'm giving you foreign did you get 2 and negative one all right so let's change our bounds down here instead of going from two to five we know that if we plug in 5 we're going to get two we know if we plug in 2 we're going to get negative one so that changes from two to five that makes it negative one the two now a quick question just to refresh your memory when I get down to the very end am I going to have to substitute back in for x or not because now in terms of you and that makes it nice so at the end we're just done we just plug numbers in that's why we change the balance in the first place okay hey what next come on this We're Gonna Roll I don't want any rate right there yeah distribute out here too and minus your five and then multiply by you tonight yes we call that tedious algebra work ah two U plus six minus five then U to the ninth d u two U plus six and then minus 5. okay well that means we'll have two U plus one tell me something about this integral what I absolutely have to do in order for this to work got it I cannot just integrate the way it is we found out that we can't separate integrals by multiplication the only way to accomplish this is to distribute and then we do the integral piece by piece so when we distribute please note that we're going to have same bounds of course we'll have 2 U to the what and very good do you hey that's a whole lot easier that's a whole lot easier to integrate than that one but that looks almost impossible if you really if you didn't have this to follow you go wait a second a substitution won't work try one anyway see if it will work see if you can manipulate like I did and then maybe it will if that's the case it shoot it makes it a whole lot better to work with and your balancer even change so that's even nicer so now we're going to integrate let's go ahead and integrate and then we'll we'll evaluate so our integral is 2u to the 11th over 11. plus u to the 10th over 10. are you guys okay with the integral some of those integrals are pretty nice right just take the basic stuff and substitutions that's that's what the substitution is supposed to It's supposed to make your integral easier not worse easier as it definitely does make it easier now what do we do good because we changed the bounce first we know that our bounds are in terms of U not in X anymore these were in X's those are in use so as soon as we get down to the very end it's now evaluation time just make sure you evaluate very carefully we're going to get two times two to the 11th over 11. 2 to the 10 over 10. that happens from when we plug in the tube we get it plugged into both those those terms it has to go to both of them so this this piece right here is just the two evaluated are you all right with that so far yes or no ladies and gentlemen yeah okay then what do we do subtract all right you gotta do that and we'll plug in the negative one two negative one to the 11th over 11. Plus negative one to the tenth over ten oh my how much is 2 to the 12th because that's what that is that's two to the 12th 2048. okay I'll leave you foreign times two that's going to give you that or just two twelve gives you that plus 2 to the tenth one thousand okay all right minus well two times one negative 1 to 11. negative 1 to 11. just negative one get the odd exponent up there is going to be negative so this is negative 2 11. that though that's a negative to the tenth power that's going to be positive one so this would be plus 110. I'm going slowly so you see where all these numbers are coming from can you follow the fraction work I know fractions are that's your favorite thing but it's Friday right what happens on Friday directions obviously so fresh and Friday Okay so we've got 40 96 over 11. Plus 10 24 over 10. plus 2 11 minus 110. so far so we're good on sign changes all right we'll combine some like fractions we got 11th and elevenths that's going to give you four thousand 98 11. that's going to give you 1023 tenths and then you're going to find a common denominator all right which is probably yeah 110. I don't want to do that it's 52 233 110. wait 52 233 over 10 over over that's the simplified fraction times yeah that's it awesome I mean that's easily relatable right now of course what is this that we just found don't get confused with all the mumbo jumbo what are we doing that's an area could you find a decimal equivalent for that yeah if you had to actually give an approximation for area you could do it that's the area under this curve between those numbers that's what that's doing how many people feel okay with that your calculator will do a lot of the fractions for you so don't let that hold you back if you can get it down to here your Calculus is done evaluation that's actually doing all that stuff now the numbers and Prouds per hour that big but you can do it you ready for one more yeah any questions on this one before we begin your face says question well your mouth doesn't I got to that point where I messed up my evaluation I'm trying to figure out what fraction I screwed up got it I'm gonna say that's on you yeah okay okay foreign okay granted this one doesn't look fun it really doesn't look fun uh it looks fun to me I love this stuff but maybe not look fun to you why does it look fun yeah tree always throws you guys for a loop oh tree seriously oh I hate tree too bad second he goes man it's not just an X in there which is actually fortunate because you wouldn't be able to do the problem if it was uh but it's a pi over X and then it's over x squared so there's a lot going on it certainly doesn't fit the integration table one question I have for you that's going to kill me if you get this wrong it really my head's going to explode on the camera screen and then no more videos so don't do this to the people at home watching me literally stuff but let's see can you combine this or this and get oh good okay it's not cosine of pi over X cubed right right yeah it is gone no it's not it's not that then you get cosine of pi the the very easy integral that's not the case though this is an angle over a function of X that's what that is so we have to somehow use a substitution that's the only thing we have in our Arsenal right now we have direct fit or substitution later on you'll get a lot more okay that's your next class but right now that's two things we can choose from if it's not a direct fit that we can't combine things like we cannot do here then it has to be a substitution for us to even do it if a substitution doesn't work then we are Sol sorry out of luck uh you can't do the problem anyway uh let's go ahead and let's look for a substitution then true or false the substitution should include the cosine true or false why because then you take a derivative of the cosine right and that would give you negative sign does negative sine appear up there that is probably not the right choice true or false the uh the substitution should be pi over X 5x true y naught x squared because it's not but it's not inside anything it's not exciting thing that's a good place that's a good reason also when you took the derivative of uh x squared it'd be 2x right you know and that's why I asked this question that this is an angle no matter what you get you cannot cross that X Out you follow me you can't touch it angles we can't do we can't touch that with anything so even had you taken that as a you it's still and simplified you cannot go inside of that cosign like that unless you have one of the like double ankle half angle Pythagorean theorem identities to break up things you cannot do it and so the only option we even have is pyrox so take a substitution of U equals pi over X go for that right now take your derivative if you can you know how to take derivatives so we've passed that portion so take your derivative thank you also I want you to change your balance right now notice to take a derivative you'd have to do that you got to bring that X up to the top to take that derivative did you do that unless you want to use a quotient rule which you don't trust me pi is a constant you don't want to use a quotient rule but this is not a prodigal either because Pi is a constant it's like the number four it's like number two you don't have that here so if we take a derivative of U we take a derivative with respect to X on this side you're going to get what yeah I'm going to do in two steps you see the negative pi x to the negative 2 DX are you guys okay with that how many people made down that far what you have you did good at least you forget how to take derivatives right so we need to know how to take a derivative and what are you supposed to solve for DX yes solve for DX maybe make it look a little bit prettier before you do that because right now it's like confusing what am I doing sort of divide by X and negative 2 you can and then flip it up but what this really says is d u equals negative pi over x squared DX do you understand that that's the same thing I the negative pi stays there the X to the negative 2 goes to the denominator of a fraction now you can solve for DX if you saw fight it for DX probably multiplying by the reciprocal would be the appropriate way to go on both sides or you can do two steps dividing by pi multiplying by x squared in either case hopefully you can follow this one you're going to get negative negative x squared over pi d u equals DX I need to see if you can make it down there on your own because that's some basic algebra but you've got to be able to do it imagine if you can yes guys on the left hand side yeah okay so basically multiply by the reciprocal on both sides and this is exactly what you're going to get also I told you to change bounds where do you change bounds do you do it here where do you change balance way up top all the way at the beginning so let's go ahead we'll change our bounds we'll do it right here in this corner when x equals three we want to find out what U is when x equals one I want to find out what U is when x equals 3 U is supposed to equal pi over that X so that would be pi over 3. that one was almost in the way so I didn't want to confuse you pi over three did you get pi over three as well when x equals one you're supposed to be pi over X so U would equal I how many people feel okay with this so far make sure you have these in the correct order make sure you map them correctly from X to U correctly if you don't you're going to get the wrong sign on your integral so Watch What Happens here when I do my substitution what was X well it's three well it's the U that correlates with three pi over three when X is one what's the U that correlates with x equals one right now you'll notice something do you see what's technically wrong with this picture it is backwards that's right it's backwards it's going from PI to pi over three that's pi to pi over three which says if you want to you can interchange them but it's going to make your integral negative I can guarantee this integral is going to end well I can guarantee you this integral is going to end with a negative area that's what it's going to do so and that's because of that that relationship right there so the reason why I said be careful is because if you go oh yeah integrals always go from pi over 3 to Pi then you're going to miss that negative you had to write that right like that first because the three maps to pi over three the one maps to Pi that's what those bounds were you can't write them backwards just because you want to okay that didn't work we got to really be careful on that and if you're going to switch them around then you're going to have that negative out front okay now for the the other good stuff uh we have uh what else is up here come on now cosine's still there yeah if it's not part of your view it's still there cosine of what are you you x squared is still there for right now the DX is definitely not there instead of DX you're going to write what DX equals to that's negative x squared over pi do you foreign I do like that for you now some interesting interesting things are going to happen interesting things are going to happen some things you're going to cross out some signs are going to be pulled out some constants are going to be pulled out let's see everything that happens here tell me one thing that happens experts are great if that didn't happen you need to have to manipulate that somehow like we did before which would be kind of be a pita a pain in the rear end okay you don't want to do that or that's about it you can do it so cross out your x squared that's great what else can I move out in front of my integral now you have negative 1 over Pi yes sometimes you already have a negative I'm not doing that yet okay let's see if we can all make it down there in our heads are you feel good with that so far so just doing our substitution we simplified some algebraic things up here moved out our constants which is great now this is in the wrong order but right here that's going to look like it helps us a little bit if I reverse them notice I can change the sign right put them in the correct order I'm going to change the sign so what this says is let's go ahead and let's let's flip these bounds when I flip the balance I'm giving it negative negative 1 over pi my integral will change from pi over 3 at pi to pi over 3 back to pi over 3 to Pi cosine Udu okay make that negative way too big there we go but you see the negative negative right technically what I really should have is a big bracket around here if you want to draw that you can but that negative negative is going to change that's going to become a positive so we get our 1 over pi from pi over 3 to Pi of cosine u d u by the way it's really nice that we change bounds here because otherwise we'd have to substitute back in for that and it's a little bit more confusing you have to figure out a couple things as you're going it's nice that that's already done for us what I'd like you to do right now would you go ahead and do the integral go ahead and evaluate it the way that we've written it the way that it's kind of nice for us and then see what you have don't forget about that one over Pi out in front remember it's positive now because of negative negative gave us that positive oh yeah by the way the integral of cosine sine or negative sign sine okay that would change your problem right remember that the derivative of sine is positive cosine so the integral of positive cosine is positive sine no plugging in back for X's we already change our bounds that's great so we don't have to do this whole resubstitution thing we don't have to do that we've changed our bounds off the side we were already in terms of U that just means from right here let's evaluate it so we'll do one over Pi that's going to be out front inside we'll have sine pi minus sine pi over 3. same time zero zero okay heavy stuff for a second I don't know why what oh yeah I had it in my head is something different sine of pi over three how much is that good are you able to get that as well cool zero minus root three over two negative one over pi negative root three over two put it all together you're going to get Negative root three over two point that's your area looking at your area would you say that this curve is above or below the x-axis for most of this region for most of this region if it crosses I don't know whether it does or not but if it crosses most of it is below the x-axis because our area is mostly below the x-axis so area speaking it's mostly the advanced axis how people feel okay with our example okay that's the one the last one you get about Direct substitution with a different angles and changing balance I'm going to show you some kind of tricks some night nut tricks properties of things you can use to make a even and odd functions work for you sometimes are you sure there's no more questions on this stuff do you feel pretty comfortable with it substitution no problem now it's just changing balance and being able to evaluate I've given you some kind of nice examples that kind of illustrate that a little bit better for you but let's talk about even in odd functions and how we can use them to our benefits sometimes foreign even and odd functions and integrals let's talk about even functions for a second hey tell me something what do you know about an even function oh so say that again symmetric yes about about what thanks x-axis no well yes the other one okay yeah it's symmetric about the y-axis dear goodness me yeah that's what even means uh x squared is an even function export even function x squared minus two even function they're symmetric about the y-axis that's one thing we know about even functions here's the definition of it actually even function says foreign I hope it makes sense on why that would work it says you plug in the number or the negative version of that number and your height is the same what that's going to do is make it symmetric about the y-axis notice that plug in 2 you get out seven whatever like a negative two you get out seven that makes it symmetric it's going to go up at the same rate on either side of the of the y-axis and that's what this is doing so it's this and what it means is symmetric about the y-axis thank you just make sure you know it's the why well let's think about this for a second then let's suppose that if f is even foreign and I'm going from negative a to positive a go from negative a to positive a taking the integral of f of x DX if f of x is let's go through the logic K Bar if f of x is even what do you know about f of x symmetric so that means that when I plug in negative a and I plug in a I get the same output at any point between the plug in the negative and the opposite of that I'm going to get the same output right would you agree then that the area from negative a to zero would be the same as 0 to a yeah if it's symmetric about the Y it better it better be because you're going to get a picture like this I don't know what f of x is going to look like but I know it's going to be something like this whatever this does this is going to do the same thing on the other side it's supposed to look the same by the way not that good of an artist my paper looks better I should show you my paper thank you still laughing at two They're laughing at my picture hopefully you can't hear that in the video They're laughing at me well if it's even you're gonna get that relationship if you're going from negative a to a that's actually a special case right it can't be going from like negative B to positive a because those numbers wouldn't match up that would be different but it's going from negative to positive the same number well then you know this area has to equal this area which means that this integral is going to equal that integral does that make sense sometimes it's easier to calculate from zero to a number than it's from negative to another please or do that so if we can do that no problem if it's even function shoot we can do this we can calculate two times that integral we're good to go zero is normally very much easier yeah now if you have to use a substitution the zero might change but normally zero is easier let me just show you with an example that this does actually work the only thing you have to do which kind of stinks is that you have to prove it's even before you can do it you can't just say ah I think it's even let's try it no it doesn't really work all the time so you got to show that it's even so for instance let's talk about that one now that's a pretty basic integral um you could clearly do this integral just the way it is you could just do it and that would be just fine I'm not going to give you a super tough one where where it's super super nice to do that I'm just going to show you with one that's easy for us to see that is possible uh first thing you do though you got to prove it's even here's how you prove it's even you start out with f of negative X and you have to show that that's equal to f of x so f of negative X says this you go to your function f of x and you just replace x with negative X so for us that would be negative x squared plus four do you see how I just replaced the X with the negative X and then you work it down you see what you get what's negative x squared squared plus 4. what's x squared plus 4 it's f of x that's exactly what I have back here right there that proves it's even if you start here and you end here that means you have an even function okay what that says is that instead of doing this integral the way it is I know that this is going to equal 2 times integral 0 3 not that x squared plus 4. I'm going to let you do that the rest of the way out what you would do here take your integral evaluate it from zero to four no no no you wouldn't zero to three you can go from zero to three and then multiply that by two has anyone done that already once you work on it let's see if we can get a couple of the same answers up here are there any questions on the even part of the board before I erase it did you understand the concept even means submector about the why you prove it's even that means the area on the left and the area on the right will be exactly the same therefore you go from zero to to a whatever that number is and multiply by two just be very careful these numbers absolutely must match up for this to work for even functions if that was a negative four and that was a three all bets are off you can't do that anymore thank you 42 I have no idea while plugging in the zero is a whole lot better and plug in that that negative three huh that's nice that really is nice make sure you have parentheses there for you to do it 9 plus 12 times 2 21 times 2. 42. 42. do that 42. this I think it is 3 cubed over 3 is 3 squared 3 Squares nine nine plus twelve is twenty one twenty one times two is 42 so cool deal did you get 42 as well awesome so it makes it a little bit easier since we're plugging in zero now odd functions what do you know about odd functions they are symmetrical very good across the y no that would be even function not the not the X across the orange if they were cross decks it wouldn't be a function no that's an inverse darn it the darn thing I don't know I guess everything else I know yeah origin yeah exactly right it's symmetric about the origin which means that it's a basic rotation of 180 degrees about the origin so it says well it says this actually it says when you plug in negative you get Negative of the function and it says this when you plug in like negative three it's going to give you some value if you were to plug in 3 it's going to get Negative of that value so it's going to take it from up here and move it down here that's a rotation of 180 degrees or a what they call symmetric about the origin so that is the definition of odd and what it means that it is symmetric but it's symmetric about the origin thank you not in the axis let me give you the picture before I even even do this here's what an odd function would normally look like X cubed is an odd function x to the fifth is an odd function that's an odd function thank you very much you know what maybe they do a little bit different here for you it's easier to see this way uh that would also be in let's let's pretend that's an odd function a little bit easier to see here let's say I'm going from negative a to a tell me something about this area and that area if it's an odd function and symmetrical about the origin tell me something about those areas wait explain something about the areas first this and this they are the same area would you agree on that since it's metric they have to be the same it's a rotation of 180 degrees that is the same now tell me something about net signed area y zero what netsite area says take the area above and the area below variables positive the area below is negative and see how much change you have and here would be zero there'd be zero net area out of this thing does that make sense that would be for net area if it asks for total area total area it'd be exactly the same as an even function yeah it'd be this times two just like an even function was for a total area now a definite integral does not automatically calculate total area a definite integral automatically calculate net signed area unless you have what in there that's the value that's exactly right so what this says if your function is odd an integral is going to calculate the net assigned area therefore if you have an odd function if f is on and I'm going from negative a to a notice of those numbers they have to be the same do you see why they have to be the same if I go just a little bit closer right here are the areas the same anymore clearly not so they have to be the same but what do you know if you're going to take a an integral of an odd function which is symmetric about the origin and you're going to go from negative a to a which says where you end is exactly the same but opposite it means your area is going to be exact same how much is that integral Oh shoot that's nice do you even have to do the integral no no that's beautiful thing not unless I ask you for total area if I say total area then this is what it does this is above and beyond what what the book does right now but if I ask you for total area then it would be this right and what that would be is because they're equal areas you'd have two times zero to a just like you've had an even function it basically think about what it would do just think for a second what absolute value does absolute value pretends that anything below the x-axis is above the x-axis right so absolute value hope this makes sense absolutely we go ah what's that do changes from odd to even see it kind of cool right and then you have exact the same thing for an even function that would be for a total area if it's just like this though given to you just like that that implies net signed area that means areas are the same but not the size of the x-axis that means the area is equal to zero hence the integral would be equal to zero would you like to see one application of this sure you're gonna like this you're going to ask for 30 of these on tests well maybe one maybe five are we going to get it you can always hope one question in this one expectations excuse for one question test right one person never mind we lie we don't want that on there no you don't the thing about using these properties is that you have to prove that you can you can't just say I think I can go because all of those would be zero for you guys you'd be like oh negative three or three zero I'm awesome no you're not awesome well me you might be awesome but not at that you gotta prove that it actually works just like you had to prove it was even you have to prove this was odd now this says I can do a lot of integrals that otherwise I couldn't do do you see why it says that says my my gosh I mean did you know how to do that I don't right now just looking at him thinking trig substitution but you don't know trig substitution you know substitution substitution you know use substitution so that's off the table no matter what you do with the substitution that is not going to work take the take 1 plus x squared derivative is 2x that doesn't appear takes sine X there's no cosine you're stuck the only thing you can do is say well it's going from negative three to three let's see if this is even or let's see if this is odd if it's even we're probably stuck anyway because they still can't do the integral even doesn't get you away from the integral just says I can multiply by 2 and have a zero in it that's nice odd gets you away from the integral that's even better so let's try to see if this thing is odd what you do is you start out with your function that's what we're trying to get to but maybe you have a negative part and you say what I want to have is I want to plug in Negative X and let's see what it does for us so take everywhere you see X and see what happens so negative x negative X if I do that this actually isn't that it looks bad it's really not that bad square root of one minus or sorry 1 plus negative x squared how much is that wait minus x squared plus x squared okay does anybody remember anything about sine of negative X yes that is a property it's a sine of negative X is the same as negative sine of x if you don't believe me look it up that's a true statement sign is when you think about it an odd function it is inherently an odd function because it does this and it does that it's it's symmetrical about the origin right so knowing that signs and odd function says this absolutely must be the case right there sine of negative X has to be negative sine of x it will work out for you so that's true well look what we can do this is equal to negative sine X over the square root of 1 plus x squared which so this is negative f of x so right there is it odd or not if this happens it's definitely all well it's not so odd which is awesome and then we can just do this and go how much is the integral sweet didn't even have to do it how people should we talked about today yeah okay
