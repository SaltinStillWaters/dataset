Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 4.3:  Area Under a Curve, Limit Approach, Riemann Sums
so now that we've basically mastered how to take an anti-derivative find an anti-derivative we have fit in the table which is in the problem just undoing a derivative and we now have integration by substitution which does the same thing just a kind of fancy way to do it we're going to find out why all this stuff actually works so we're going to study in section 4.3 how to find the area how to actually find the area now we've done this I've told you that it is that integral is basically find an area but would you like to see why I hope you want to see why this is the Y part so here's the Y because I said so no I wish make my job easy do it because I said so so let's talk about area as a limit before we can get to area as a limit I got to tell you something about what's called Sigma notation you ever seen a sigma before yeah if you're ever in a fraternity or something you know there there's this Greek letter is called Sigma uh Sigma is this looks like a sideways capital M looks like that you seen those what's it mean yeah it's a Greek letter s really so it means Su it says what you're supposed to do is add whatever I tell you to add so let's just give a quick easy example that right there that k = 0 says the variable or the indices I'm going to be using is the letter K I'm going to start where k equals 0 I'm going to stop where K = 5 and I'm going to do that to each of the following K cubes here's what Sigma notation means it says what you're going to do is let K go to all the integers integers are are the whole numbers between this one and this one so basically between and including so you're going to start at zero for k then you're going to go 1 2 3 4 5 and six right why not six that's too far that's too far so we'd stop at five and we're going to add all of that up so Sigma notation says it's a sum Su means add you'd have 0 cubed plus because you have a sigma then you'd have oh the next one is 1 cubed and then okay we're going to add to Sigma then we'd have 2 cubed we'd have 3 cubed we' have 4 cubed and we would have 5 cubed and that's what the sigma notation actually stands for do you feel okay with the sigma notation I need a head not before we go on any further you okay with that okay good well scared me for a second now do I care what that is yeah ultimately I do but I'm going to give you better I'm going to give you better ways to manipulate that before I give you those ways I got to tell you about some properties they're not hard properties in fact you're going to discover that they're very very similar to what we can do with derivatives and integrals namely these two uh if you have any summation oops I missed something and you have a function of K that's a function of K right times a constant what you can do is this that c if it doesn't depend on the K you can pull out in front of your summation that's a true statement you can pull out any constant so this would be if C does not depend on K only in terms of multiplication yes if C does not depend on K let me show you an example this is going to blow your mind like a grenade like a m grenade some of you aren't going to like this very much till you really think about it hopefully you think about it that way you like it that's my circular Logic for you um what's your indices your index no your index should be the letter that starts at one and goes to five J is your index here so the function should be in terms of J anything depending on J cannot be moved outside anything not depending on J for this context is like a constant what's the function inside x x x to the X to the 3 right is that a j no has nothing to do with J right nothing at all you know what I can do with that that's this this does not this does not mean the same thing as this does right this is not that right here this is X cubed x Cub if I had this if I had X Cub * J then this would be X Cub time summation J = 1: 5 of J I could do that anything not depending on J that's being multiplied I can take out believe me now I'm going to erase this because I want you to really think about what this means when I have no J when I have no J what's there a what you were right I just didn't hear you I didn't make sense yeah won very what does it mean to do a summation from J = 1 to 5 of one I need you to kind of get that where you have constant inside here's what this this actually means it means you add up whatever's here from 1 to 5 right now there's no place to plug in one there's no place to plug in two or three or four or five so what this means is the X Cub is going to hang out front X CU is going to hang out front no matter what you follow me this says what are you adding from 1 to five what are you adding from 1 to five is one a constant then one does not change this says you have when you go to one you have one when you go to two you have one not two when you go to three you have one when you go to four you have one when you go to Five you have one this basically means 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 1 2 3 4 5 mhm does that make sense to you basically this is going to be whatever that number is n five in this case so this would be 5 x cub that's what that means now it should make a whole lot of sense because if you just think through it I mean think about this this says you have X Cub + x Cub plus X Cub plus X Cub plus X Cub you get 5x Cub feel okay with the first property yeah why not you sure are the questions so far some of you staring at me blankly some me I'm boring you tears I hope I boring you tears I don't do with tears very well so don't start crying makes me feel awkward sensitive and stuff okay second property second property just like you do with derivatives or with integrals you can break up addition and subtraction so if you have summation of two functions in terms of K that are being added together yeah it means that you can do summation of the first function plus summation of the second and and it also works with subtraction we got to do one more thing before we get into actual theory on why this stuff works I got to tell you some uh some ways to manipulate these things the way you can figure out some sums which is kind of nice uh the formulas now these are in your book but I'll give them to you explicitly the most common ones that you're going to use and then we'll start talking about this so let's kind of consider what this is you know maybe I'll give you a last one too I'll start with this last one because I want you to see it we've talked about it though what would a summation be from K = 1 to n of the number one the difference between whatever you're overthinking it n n 1 + 1+ 1+ 1+ 1 n * yes K is like equal to five n time five I mean four say we start at one because that's a one okay you always start one oh it always does no matter what unless I tell you otherwise but yeah no room you start at one so if you always start at one like I showed you here you start at one and you go to n you add one n times you get n you see the N also if this had been any other number like four notice that what you could do is p pull the four out front four times and change that into a one that works that'd be four * n 4 n yes if K starts at two or at three that was his question it won't it doesn't do that not for these formulas to work if it did you'd have to figure out from one to n and subtract off from one to four okay or whatever wherever this started that would be the appropriate way to do that is a good question you can do just understand the point I said if you figure out from 1 to n but you start at four just figure out from 1 to three one less than that and then you subtract that that'd be fine it is some now back to this what this stands for is let's see 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 plus all the way to n true okay and what this stands for is 1 2 + 2 2 + 3 2+ all the way to N2 agree okay and what this one stands for is 1 Cub + 2 Cub + 3 Cub plus all the way to NB are you okay on all this this notation right here what this is what this is called is open form this is called open form notation so where you're actually explicitly adding every thing together youie Okie doie so far what's awesome about this is someone's done the work found the pattern and you can do it on your own if you want I'm not going to do this for you takes a long time not too long but I'm not going to prove it I'm going to give you what's called the closed form the closed form says shoot if you know where you start and you know where you end and you know what you're doing you should be able to come with a formula for it and there are formulas the first formula for this for this one so if you go from one to n of K summation of K it says if you take the the number that you're ending at what number are you ending at here n yeah sure and you multiply it by n + 1 and you divide it by two you're going to come with the same answer which is pretty fantastic actually it's kind of cool uh there's this guy named KL Frederick G and way back in the day uh he's I don't I don't remember his exact age but he was in grade school and the teacher came in like hung over or something and uh this is way back in the day by the way like on a Wednesday um said uh said you know what I'm not feeling why don't you guys just add the numbers from one to 100 and so he goes okay like two minutes later he comes and these are little kids comes back goes it's 550 or whatever it was I don't remember what it was uh it's it's this and the teacher goes how in the world did you do this so quick he goes well obviously he he invented that he came with it on his own is it you yeah yeah the count Oiler Oiler I'm sure he would have as well maybe he did maybe have the names conf I doubt it I don't think so because Leonard Oiler his first name is Leonard and it's near and dear in my heart so okay second one's a little bit more advanced second one says what you're going to do is take n * n + 1 times the 2 n + 1 and divide by six and that'll do it kid also came up with that let me guess he grew up to win a Nobel Prize in mathematics I don't think there was a Nobel Prize but if there was he would have done it yeah got a genius um Jordan gon elimination is what you use for Matrix operations can't believe that um and some Far reaching mathematics it's just out of this world literally uh spatial things like Newton did the last one's really similar to the first one very very similar here's how you calc the last one looks exactly the same but you square I don't have the time to show you how these things are made up I really don't it's it's for a different class actually there there's ways you do this um if you'd like to see that come and see me some of the time and we can figure it out together we'll just go through and invent them if You' like uh but for right now just feel okay with this okay also feel okay with with this one as well yes even if that's a constant [Music] so we should have memorized yeah would you be able to follow that as well if one gives you n c gives you C * n c * 1 that would be the same TI let's do one very quick example on how you would go about doing this but you'll see it's not actually that bad it's plugging numbers in and then just manipulating those numbers so you will have some homework on how to do this uh follow the appropriate form and see that you can actually manipulate them because we're going to be using this in the next area idea that we have okay what we're going to do is we're going to try to come up with the sum of that thing what it actually equals that's a number number a number so we're going to come up with a numerical expression that represents that thing now give me some ideas what you can and what maybe you can't do on this name one thing you can't do right here what I haven't told you about distribute the K can you distribute the K I don't know that's a good question can you separate by multiplication is if they both involve a k can you do that no not if our index K which it is if these all match up you can't separate that multiplication that's not in our property list you follow me on that that's a no no can do on that one can you distribute the K yes you can though it's a function of K times a function of K you can distribute that that's okay so that would actually probably the first thing we would do because right now we can't use any of those those closed form this called close form the Clos form uh formulas to work with the stuff until they look exactly like this this or that you got me so Joe's got a good idea k s + K yes no very easy name something some on the right hand side of the room name another thing that you can do right here break it say it louder break it apart sure by addition because we know we can do that hey one thing real quick could I pull this k out in front of this no what if that was an X yes okay very good do these fit now yes now we can just use the formulas what's the N that I'm talking about what is that n that's just the number I'm stopping at in this case that's 10 so if we can figure out how to plug 10 into this one and this why these two hey they match up that's right there I mean that's exactly like what we have only there's a 10 that's exactly what we have only there's a 10 plug the 10 in and we can figure those two things out so the first one giv us our K squ we take here's how you plug it in 10 10 + 1 2 * 10 + 1 all over 6 that's from the first one then from the sum from 1 to 10 of K well we got another one for that we got n n + 1 over 2 so that's 10 10 + 1 / 2 that's that one why don't you all figure that out and see what we got okay go ahead and do that on your own do you guys understand where those numbers are coming from first of all this is kind of a basic concept just actually a little review concept so make sure you get it before we go any further what did you get 2 how much 275 275 43 oh my gosh oh my go I said gush that's how bad it is oh my gush 440 440 let's get a quintuple check on that how many people got 44 40 okay if you didn't get 440 hopefully you're wrong cuz that's what I'm putting on the board right now real answer is 440 is now the right answer it is now I'm not changing it hopefully you got right whatever SK 440 people home me me later feel okay with our Sigma notation how to manipulate it using our formulas those first three formulas those are the ones we use most often for us are there other ones yes but they get difficult um so we stick with those ones otherwise the math just gets kind of kind of tricky we have a lot more time so now we're going to start talking about how to actually find areas of of under the curve of some sort of function you got me remember how I introduced 4.1 I said there's there's two methods basically anti-derivative method which we've already conquered but we don't really understand fully trust me you don't uh because you don't know where it's coming from second method is the rectangular method it says how the anti-derivative method comes about I'll prove it to you why that comes about you ready yes so area yeah L thing in come of calculus theme music But realize it's already been done Empire Strikes Back so and everything comes back to Star Wars of course I'm going to try try to draw you some pretty pictures here but I'm not much of an artist unless it's boxes I can't do much with it let's say that we have some function f ofx I understand that I've given you this picture several times before but I really haven't explained how to do it very exactly to the point literally to the point on how to do it that's what I'm going to do today the idea that I gave you initially was what if we were to cut this space into n equal subsections the fact that it's equal just makes them easier for what we're going to do next that's that's what why why they're equal so basically we'd say okay I'm going to cut this into n equal subsection so right over here I'm going to make a little cut I'm going to go over the same distance and make a little cut then another distance make a little cut I'm going to do this until I get however far away to be so equal subsection I'm going to find out the the length and cut it into a certain number of subsections you got the idea this one will be our first cut x sub one then x sub 2 then x sub 3 x sub nus1 why n minus one because the next one would be at B that would be our last one x sub n be our last cut my question is can we find the width of each interval the with of each anable are you guys okay on the x sub one x sub 2 x sub 3 that's give us a certain number of cuts remember a loaf of bread says how much many times you cut it you get that many more sections so if I cut x sub n minus one times I'm going to get X subn actual rectangles you follow me on that so you slice bread right you cut it once you get two pieces cut it three times you get four pieces cut it X of n minus one we get X of n number of pieces X of n rectangles the last cut would be at B that's where it would be and that there's nothing past that so that would be the end our area did you follow now the width of each little interval we're going to call that Delta X like change in X Delta X would be the change from a to x sub 1 or or x sub 1 x sub 2 so we'll call the width Delta X how would you figure out the width of each of those things what would you need to know in order to figure out the width total you need to figure out total length so someone right hand side of the room how would you figure the total length from A to B total length how much I I need it in terms of what we have on the board already B A say it again B- a B minus a if this was 10 and that was three your length would be sure because you did 10 minus 3 right whatever this is minus whatever this is is going to give me my whole length of that area segment does that make sense to you are you sure now that's the overall length how do we find find the length of each little interval what do you think about that number sub divide by the number of subsections can you tell me how many subsections I have here I don't have infinite no no no this is finite number of cuts x sub nus one that's fin number n minus one is the number of cut remember we just talked about bread we just talked about bread right if you cut a loaf one slice how many pieces you get if you cut it three times how many pie you get if you cut it eight times how many pieces you get extrapolate that concept you cut x to the nus one how many pieces do you get n n do you understand we have n subsections here n literal intervals so if you take if you take the whole distance and you divide it by how many equal intervals you have that's a division problem that says that I should have B minus a Over N for my width of each little interval ra you understand that concept that's kind of a key one you understand where that's coming from are you sure guys over here yes all right now here's the idea we're going to make some rectangles out of this I introduced that idea already we're making rectangles we already have the bases of our rectangles we got this and this and this and this and they're all equal right that's going to make them very easy to add together later which is nice but what we've got to do is find out how tall our rectangles are how high they are because in order to find the area of a rectangle we're going to find the the base the base times whatever the height is right we need to find a way to find the height once we do that we'll have all these rectangles we'll add them together be very nice and easy but here's how we're going to find the height what you're going to do is you're going to pick an arbitrary Point arbitrary Point somewhere in this interval we'll call it let me write it down first pick an arbitrary Point what's arbitrary mean just random random you're going to find out that it's not going to make a difference at the end of our problem pick an arbitrary point for each sub interval bigger bigger is always better right so you can see it you okay with that here's what we're going to do pick an arbitrary Point some random point in between there now I got to explain to you why it doesn't have to be a specific point but why it could be a random point because as soon as I start stacking infinite number of rectangles in there as soon as I let my n Go to zero the width I'm sorry I'm sorry let my n Go to Infinity this distance becomes zero does that make sense n goes to Infinity number of rectangles go to Infinity the distance between them finite divided by Infinity goes to zero right goes to zero so that means that any point I pick is going to be really just squished it's going to be bound between two numbers that are different so it's going to be between there certainly between but it's not going to matter where it was because it's going to be Swit in there no matter what right it's like trying to put two hairs together and saying find the distance between them you always there's something in between them but it doesn't really matter because they're so thin anyway who cares so we'll pick some arbitrary Point let's call it l that arbitrary point we're going to call this x sub 1 dot yeah I know te yeah X1 dot but the dot stands for some arbitrary point doesn't matter where it is and here we'll pick X2 Dot and so on and so on and so on here's what we're going to do with X1 Dot and X2 Dot and so on and so on and so on we're going to take those values the the X values plug them into our function and that's going to give us the height at that exact point does that make sense to you so what we're basically doing is saying I want you to find the height here I want you to find the height here and I want you to find the height here at X3 Dot this one by the way would be xn dot not n minus one that's the previous one that's xn dot that says that you have n rectangles do you see what I'm talking about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 n at each of those points what we do is we say all right understand that this is the width of our rectangle right there if I go up from this arbitrary point it's going to give me the height of that rectangle do you follow that you build your rectangle around that okay that's going to be the height of my rectangle my next rectangle is going to have this height my next rectangle is going to have this height and you keep going all the way down the ne the last one would have this height so we pick an arbitrary point for each sub subsection and make a rectangle now I don't want to redraw this picture so I'm going to go one more step I'm going to show you why we do what we do okay cuz I don't want to redraw this I'm going to show you one exploded version of one of these rectangles understand that we can extrapolate and get this picture back from each one individually just by adding them together do you understand the concept of this first though cutting this into equal subsections find the height of each one at arbitrary point then to find the area we'll just add up the rectangles it will be an approximation for right now I'll show you how to make it better later here's the the each rectangle so the height of it each rectangle let's say I just take one of my rectangles my arbitrary point is any X whatever I'm talking about K dot X of one or two or three or four or five or n whatever that is dot next time when we start back we're going to start with this picture we're going to find out the width of each one which is already on the board we'll find out the height of each one therefore we'll be able to find the area since it's a rectangle add them all up together and you're going to see why we have the integral that we do uh from these areas did today make sense for you uh so we're we're right in the middle of trying to find the area under a curve and what we've realized is that this is the second rectangular method we're breaking up this area into equal width rectangles and then we're going to find the area of each rectangle add them all together that should give us at least an approximation for the area under under curve now it's going to be a little off because as you see we're Under and Over the curve at certain spot so this is going to be approximation to start with we'll talk about how to make it better later I think I gave you a preview on that last time what I've done here is I've taken one of our rectangles and we're going to try to find the area of one of these rectangles so notice that we we're somewhere Within A to B you follow me on that now I gave you some definition for the width of each of the rectangles last time how much do we call the width it was B minus a Over N that gave us the width of each one but we had a term for it Del Delta X that's the width of each sub interval did you follow me on that so this this width is Delta X of course it's important to have something that represents that because well we're going to take base times height to find the area of a rectangle so that's important now also we called this we had a point in here somewhere now this looks like a midpoint but it didn't have to be what was that point was it how do we find that point was it an arbitrary point it's some arbitrary Point arbitrary means it could be anywhere within that little sub interval and it has a DOT we call it x sub one or x sub 2 or x sub 3 whatever but a DOT meaning an arbitrary Point that's within that rectangle in in the the first rectangle or the second or whatever the indices say that's what we're in so if this is the since I'm being kind of generic here this is the Ki rectangle right whatever I'm talking about first second third fourth fifth k whatever this is the X subk dot that's the arbitrary point at somewhere in that rectangle you feel all right with that now how we use that arbitrary Point who just said well at that at that arbitrary point in my sub interval what I want to do I want to make my rectangle that height that way I can have at least some stopping point not always the left always it doesn't really matter where it's at but at at some point I'm going to make go up to the function and that's where I'm going to draw my top of my rectangle do you follow that well here's what we need to do now we need to come up with some way to find the area of a rectangle I just spoke about it but how do you find the area of a rectangle base times height base is done they're all going to be Delta X that's nice what's the height going to be the length would you agree it's the length of that right there where my arbitrary point is right because remember the arbitrary Point gave us the height and the height is based on the function so if this is is let's call this F ofx if that's F ofx how tall is that FX how would you find so some people I can tell you you're a little bit lost on this how could you find the height let's say that this point just happened to be 4 let's just pretend it was at xal 4 you would you'd plug in four plug in four to what so would you agree that if this was a four the height would be F of four right if that was a seven that'd be F of seven do you agree because F of whatever gives you the height of whatever this is our whatever XK dot so the height of this rectangle which means the height of this line is the height of the rectangle the height of this line is the function's height at that point the function's height at that point F of XK dot yes no yes yeah the guys over here okay so let's say this let's talk about the height of each rectangle since we already did this we know well the height of the first rectangle now this was every single rectangle we could think of right has this height what's going to be the height of the first rectangle well let's let's let's look at it it'd be F of X1 dot right whatever the first arbitrary point is we go up to to that height that's the height of the rectangle make sense that'd be the first first rectangle then the second one will be F of X2 Dot and then so on all the way when we get to f of x subn dot our last arbitrary Point that's somewhere between x sub n minus one and B the ending point oural so that would be our last arbitrary Point xn dot they give us n rectangles that's exactly what we want you sure you're still okay yeah now the fun part comes everything's going to make sense now oh this is so cool aren't you excited I'd be excited if I was in your shoes now I'm still excited and I know how to do this so that's pretty impressive you should be excited I'm building this up because it's going be very exciting exciting building up too much Ru the suspense area of a rectangle said this like three times now but the area of a rectangle is base time height well for each rectangle then let's look at the base times the height would you agree the base is Delta X for every single one of these rectangles so here here look here is the height of every rectangle right here's the base of every rectangle therefore the area of every rectangle would be f of x 1 dot * Delta X this is the area of the first rectangle that's what this is area of the first rectangle how about the area of the second one well it's still base times height how about the last one well it's still base times hyp you okay or not well what have we done really we've broken up it's it's actually basic geometry is what we've done uh we've broken up this curve this curve the area curve the interval into little equal rectangles right well actually segments for each segment we pick an arbitrary point at each arbitrary point we find the height and to find the area you multiply base times height and that's all we got base height base height base height for each individual rectangle now since this is the area of each individual rectangle from one through n and that encompasses all of them how do you find the area of the whole thing add them up so then area would be this we add the first one through the last one yes no okay cool well is there a better rep way to represent this this thing using or Su using or sum yeah using or sum how would we use our our sum is it going to be based on X or k what are we actually doing are we changing Delta X from rectangle to rectangle no that stays the same in fact if you wanted to factor it out you could really you could do that it's in each one of them some people do that to prove this but this is in every single one of them so that can't change does the F change does The X Change the index of the X changes the first one the second one the third one the fourth one so that's really the only thing we want to change where's the index start zero or one or two or three one where's the index n n at n so this area says I'm going to add up what am I adding up areas of rectangles going from let's call it K 1 to n do you know why we use K we use the same symbol that we use there that's X subk right that means each individual one we're just going to let this go from the first one to the second one to the third one to the nth one however many we have we say we don't want the have to change we definitely don't want the Delta X to change it's not what we're talking about what we really want to change is the index I need you to understand where this is coming from because if I I could have just given this to you right and said oh here's your area but that's pretty lame so here's what this says well you can probably figure it out what's this part Bas what's this part the height what's this do adds them up that's all it is height of each one because we're changing it right it's just a quick way to write this it's basically all we're doing what this is that's an approximation that's based on a finite number of rectangles did you agree because you have to have a finite number for n if you're going to actually do this in practical application well not practical application but if you're going to do this and separate into a certain number of rectangles you'd stop somewhere you'd say okay let's actually find this stuff out and you go from 1 to 5 or 1 to 50 or 1 to 100 so what this gives you is an approximation based on N so this is an approximation based on him how many rectangles you fit into that little space the more rectangles probably the better how can we make this better and better and better and better make it approach inity so basically make more rectangles right if you get more rectangles in a finite space if I only had two rectangles in the space and I had some curve probably not that great but if I had like 500 rectangles in this finite space probably better right if I had a billion probably better if I had close to Infinity of them probably the best we can get in fact it'd be so good there'd be no difference between the area of the curve and the my rectangles added together that's the concept of a limit haven't we covered the limit before it says if I let my n Go to Infinity if I let my n Go to Infinity that changes this from an approximation to an exact thing so how do we make it better I'll make it better I'll make it better that works for me actually I'm a math teacher I really don't care how make it better let N get bigger basically let N get as big as you can what that does is forces more rectangles into a space keep in mind that the rectangles are going to be the same width right so that means every time you force a new rectangle in it they all get narrower and narrower and narrower until they have virtually no width they have to have something because here's why they have to have something can you find the area of just a straight line no you have to have something don't you to find the area so you have to have a base but that Bas approaches approaches zero I'll make it better n goes to Infinity here's how we make it better for us we want n to go Infinity what's the only thing that lets us take n to Infinity Li we add limit that's that's how you find an exact area now I'll tell you a little secret this right here this is an integral here's why it's an integral a sum you see that the sum here when you take a sum to Infinity remember how I told you the the integral was elongated s that stands for that limit of a sum that's how you get that function that's some f ofx Delta X DX basically the same idea okay that's where the symbols are are kind of coming from you you the integral does mean a sum it means when you're adding up all the rectangles some function and that's a width of rectangle basically that that's you can translate that um so those two equations are the same that's what we're doing okay I just got for a second sorry yeah well remember we talked about integrals are anti-derivative they also mean the area of under a curve right this is the area under a curve this is how this is the they're the same construction the the difference is well you use different symbols instead of a limit of the sum and no you just call it integral it's it really is a sum that's a giant s it's it's called a sum uh the integral just means in the terms of a definite integral it just means you're you're actually finding the area so there's more a little more to it than that basically that's that's the idea now back to how to use that thing because you're going to have to do it you're going to have to use this to be able to find some areas would you like to see how yes we generally choose XK dot to be one of three places you can choose it to be anywhere arbitrary Point could be the far left of the sub interval could be like way over here it could be at the left could be the far right could be at the right could be the middle could be anywhere in there it doesn't matter why does it matter how wide is this getting to zero it's going to zero the width is going to zero that means no matter where your arbitrary point is it will be squished right it's basically just in the middle anyway so it doesn't really matter where it's at what we choose it to be is either the left for all of them the right for all of them or the middle for all of them that way we're more consistent and we can work a formula better does that make sense you don't want to pick arbitrary and have them all random because it's it'd be hard to do the next thing we're doing so in general we typically choose our XK Dot choose chose choose choo choo choose me choo choo get it we generally choose XK dot to be left end points right end points for midpoints of each sub interval for uh by the way your book has a tendency to call this um XK dot c subk as well so if you see the C subk we're talking about the same thing I prefer the XK dot I think it it looks better because you have in terms of X I like that better the book uses C subk so whenever you're reading it's a c subk mean XK dot they mean the arbitrary point point in there either left mid or right end points you follow me on that so when they you see C sub K that's what they're referring to is a left the mid or the right end points same thing we're going to be referring to now here's how to do it let me give you an example when you're talking about area you're talking about a finite thing right your area doesn't go on forever it starts and it stops somewhere starts at a it stops somewhere at B wherever B happens to be what we're doing here is we're starting to make Cuts wherever our Delta X's that's where we're making our cut so we'd make a cut here and a cut here and they're all equal and a cut here and a cut here and those cuts would be xub one and xub 2 and x sub3 and xub 4 and xub 5 and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on can you please tell me the distance here oh don't overthink it what's the what's the width of every single rectangle we have Delta X what's the width here oh good don't overthink it what's the width here very good within each of those cuts we would make a little arbit point right this would be like our x sub1 dot that would be the arbitrary point that we're talking about does that make sense and then here would be xub 2 Dot and so on and so on and so on so arbitrary points will be somewhere in there now here's the the point I'm trying to make your arbitrary points are either going to be look here your arbitrary points are either going to be your left end points that would be here and here and here and here and here see how we have each inter interval that would be the left end point starting here and here and here and here the right end points would say oh for each interval I'm going to start the right here and here and here and here and here does that make sense the midpoints would be kind of what this one looks like it would say here and here and here and here in the middle of each of our our little areas we only need one because no matter what we're going to go up to the function right and that's going to give us the height so for each interval you just need to be here or here or here that's typically what we do it could be anywhere but we choose lefts left left left we choose rights right right right or we choose mid right in the middle of it here's how you find out each one I'm hoping that you can walk through this with me and and understand where they're going let's talk about the left end points first then we'll do right end points and finally mid points so in each case we'll have an X dot by the way some of this might be a little vague to you in we actually do an example you see how to use xh dot but ultimately we're trying to do this look up here for a second we're trying to figure out a way to substitute this into this because we need to have some sort of expression that represents it right otherwise we can't plug it into our function and then we can we could do anything with it so we're ultimately trying to do that trying to get some expression for XK dot plug into our function after we plug into our function we'll have something in terms of x and and and and things like that and KS so and that's what we want because we need x's and KS to deal with our summation and we need that to deal with the limit so that's the whole idea here so far so good yeah okay very good so um let's talk about all these what are we going to let these things equal and we're talking about left right and midpoints respectively let's talk about end the left end points um where does this whole things start not at zero or anything like that at what a starts at a wherever a is that's where our interval is going to start agreed so each of these is going to have an A you know maybe I'll do the right end points first I think you'd probably understand that a little bit better we start at a let's say that I wanted my my end points to start at the right of each sub interval so for right end points for right end points do I want to start here for my very first one or here for my very first one this one so I'd have to add something to get from here to here what am I going to add it's already on the board what am I get to add okay so would you agree that to get to a right end point I'm going to add Delta X yes or no M so to get from here to here I don't want to start at a for right end points I don't want to start at a I want to start at X1 so I'd start at whever this is but plus Delta X right the next one how far now this is going to seem weird I'm going go back to here but how far away is the next end point from here two Delta X is away how about the next end point 3 Delta X and four and okay yes no yeah can you see how that works I've gone over your head some of you you need to stand up so I don't go over your head just kidding uh we're trying to find segments that are Delta X away right Delta X is the width if I'm talking about right end points I say how do I get from one place to the far end of a of a of my sub segment my sub interval well I'm going to add Delta X to it if I start off with with this plus Delta x * 1 because we start at one right that's going to give me this point then 2 3 4 5 six notice how I've gone 1 2 3 4 5 all the way to n and each of those will be the right the furthest most right point on each of our intervals yes or no yes okay that's for right end points let's talk about left end points left end points I want to slow this down by one because what I want to have happen is I want to start here right and then on my second one I want to be here does that make sense to you I hope I haven't lost you I really do right end points would be here right one right two right three you get it left end points that will be a plus Delta X for the first one a + 2 Delta X for the second one a + 3 Delta X for the third one a plus uh Del x * k for any of them that's right end points left end points would do this left one left two left three do you get that so what's going on I'm actually hitting pretty much the same exact values aren't I except I'm starting one earlier I'm starting at my a so I need to slow this one down by one if I slow this one down by one I'll have my left end points how do I slow this one down by one subtract Delta x with the same thing as subtracting one from K you have it right if I do that subtracting one from K so for instance how do I get to here I'm going to add basically I'm going to add zero Delta X's zero Delta X's that would be because we start at one Kus one you okay with that have I lost you notice that K always starts at one for us right K - 1 is 0 in this case so 1 - 1 is 0 0 * Delta x is 0 you would start at a you with me the next one would say okay plug in plug in uh two 2 - 1 is 1 you would have 1 Delta X away for your second end point Ah that's right there third fourth fifth so I basically just slowed it down by one you okay with that now the trickier one midpoints not really that bad not really this would be midpoint one midp point2 mid3 here's the question how much of Delta X am I I adding to get from here to here I'm adding half of it that's exactly what it is little bit weird though because uh you're going to take it say you've got to have the same Delta X right so you're going to have that subtract 1/2 from K and then multiply it so take 1 - 1/2 you get 1/2 you have adding half of Delta x 2 - 1/2 that's one and a half then multiply by Delta X and that's what you're doing here and that's the idea but you have the idea you had the idea basically down in fact you I think it might work a little bit better would you mind if I switch those around so instead of having Delta x k minus one I think I'd like to keep it kus1 Delta X I believe that's how perhaps your book has it K * Delta X and K 1 * Delta X by show hands how people understand the the end points and lastly you might also see this as C of K so note that that's the same thing is what we're talking about so when you see C subk that's the identical identical now would you finally like to see how this is put into practice would you sure I was hoping you would otherwise I I've got nothing so that's good my lesson would kind of fly you a little bit it's a good thing you want to know you understood the idea right Aries it's kind of cool it's an interesting idea isn't it to take all those make them really small add them together we have it we can do that now because we have this idea of a limit limit basically gives us the idea of calculus that's it that's I know you think it's a derivative but derivative is based on limits right and you think it's integral but integral is based on limits right yes that's all it is limits adding things together so let's see if we can add these things [Applause] together we'll start off kind of simply just so you get the idea of how to do this the process will be the same the uh as you guys have found out sometimes implementation is more difficult but the process is the same some problems are harder than other problems clearly but this one shouldn't be too bad to give us a nice understanding about what's going on here let's go ahead and find the area under F ofx = x^2 on 0 to 1 and what I'm going to in general in your real life you can pick whatever end points you want it really doesn't matter it will all work out the same what I'm going to tell you is in what end points to pick in this case I want you to pick right end points again it doesn't matter when you're taking a limit because n's going to Infinity it's all get squashed anyway I would say I would say it looks like right end points tend to be the easiest for me so I don't have to deal with this I don't have to deal with that to pick right end points ready to get down to it the first thing you do whenever you're doing this you have to have we're basically trying to fill this out so we're going to start on the right we'll work our way left you got to start and you got to know what Delta X is so Delta X recall that Delta X is what was how do we find Delta X B minus a over what okay so this is like step number one in our case Delta X by the way that was my fraternity so I always I always like writing that Delta Kai was the fraternity I was in so every time I write that I'm like no actually I don't even care but it's kind of fun I was in a fraternity that was your it we didn't call it Delta X it's Delta Kai Kai anyway fun times fun times uh what's B in this case how are you getting the one this is B minus a yeah that's right uh the interval tells you A and B right so where you start is a where you stop is B where do we stop one minus what is your a I need more than this guys more than this come on yall should be participating here if you don't see where it's coming from tell me that's fine but don't just sit there Sil do you see where the B's coming from you see where the A's coming from okay what's the N I don't know we can't do that because we're letting n Go to Infinity later so we don't know what n is I'm not telling you five or six we want better than that we don't want approximations we want exactness so we need to have an N up there do you feel okay that this is going to equal 1/ y or no okay cool the next thing you have to do is you have to come with some representation of your XK dot you need that because we have now our Delta X that's great one we now need our XK dot XK dot oh let's do the XK dot I said left right or mid which are we doing so you'd you'd go over here you'd find which one is appropriate for you based on what the problem is telling you to do sometimes in your book you'll get mid sometimes left this case I'm giving you right so we're going to do this exact same thing so in our case because we're right not all the time but because we're right end points we've got a plus K Delta X by the way this order is non-negotiable you have to go in this order you'll see why right now so for us XK dot equals uh how much is a zero zero is not Z plus do I have anything up here that says K in it do I do I have any any numbers for k then leave it K times oh that's a Delta X have you found out what Delta X is yet that's why you have to do it first because you're going to be using it in your next step anywhere you're going to be using Delta X it was 1 n which means for us that we're going to get k n by the way this becomes fairly harder when you don't have a zero okay fairly harder if you have a zero it's kind of nice why well we add zero to anything gives you anything but the next step means that having a number over here could potentially make it a lot harder because the next thing we're going to do we have our Delta X right we actually used it we have our XK dot yes what does f of XK dot mean put that into a function you plug it in to the function so so step number three says I want F of XK dot in our case that's this folks look go slowly what was showing me every step that's F of what is XK dot for us ladies and gentlemen what is f f of XK dot k Over N so we're going to take F of K Over N oh my goodness how do you take F of something what if that was F of five just you should be able to tell me right now if that was F of five what you would have 25 how are you getting 25 that's because it's F so take this plug it in that's a composition substitution so this says you're going to take whatever's in here and based on our function you're going to square it do you now see why if you had a constant up there it might make things a lot hard yeah if you have to square something with a number that's distribution if you have to cube something with a number that's a lot of distribution that's a pain right good thing we have integrals because we we I just told you ahead of time that this translates into an integral so we can do this uh but this is the idea on how it works this is it are we are we going to see doing this mainly through integrals and we're just proving integral or is this way we solving you're going to be solving with this for right now we'll translate to a definite integral later okay for right now you kind of need this concept now are you okay with this so far as soon as you have your Delta X great you can find your XK dot no problem as soon you find your XK dot okay you can find your F of XK dot now the last thing we're going to do take all this stuff put it right up there and we'll have enough to do our integral I'm sorry our limit of our summation you ready for it no can you make it down this far yes it's not too bad really just follow steps one two three step number four important step you don't worry about the limit yet don't worry about that not yet you're welcome fill this whole thing out if you fill that whole thing out you can't change the sum however you do have expressions for this and for this what did we find out was our F of XK dot all said and done what was it K Over N what okay and we also should have an expression for our Delta x what was our expression for Delta X one over N I hope one over n for Delta X One n I need to show hands if you see where those things are coming from okay it's still another substitution but now we're we're pretty much good to go what we're going to do you you'll have practiced this by the way uh on some of your 4.3 homework what you're going to do get rid of that square work this thing down make it look nice how do we make it look nice well you use those properties that I told you last time here's the properties I told you last time these are these are important ones the important properties are you can pull out any constants that you want a constant is defined as not being your index your index is K's K's I don't care about the N K's you got me means you get to pull out x's and anything else that's not a k and you can separate by addition subtraction that's the only two that you get to deal with so in our case what's nice about this is which one of these after we do the next step you you'll see it which one of these things when I write this as k^ 2 over n Cub which one of these things can I pull out the K2 or the N Cub or either or neither or both can I pull out the case the case the K has to do with my index I can't touch that can't touch this okay I don't I'm not wearing my hammer pants but that's the song um are you guys too young for MC Hammer no I'm not sweet now n Cub now I'm only 21 so I'm a little young for that the N Cub that does not deal with K we're talking about that K right there not that n everything's going to n that you can pull out is it n Cub or one over n Cub can somebody please tell me why we did this why in the world do we do this does this look familiar yeah that's why we did that notice what we this is kind of crazy but we've changed this entire ugly nasty weird thing into ah nice you have a formula for that in fact the formula for that do you remember um something over is [Music] N I didn't hear a word of that but I'm just going to do it on my own uh the one/ N Cub stays the same I was focus on something else times the summation from 1 to n you have this in your book I've given it to you before I think you were probably right if you just read it off that it's n n + 1 2 n + 1 all over 6 why is it nice that we could pull this N Out well look at that that's the same exact end right same n that's great that's so convenient for us what are you going to do now probably make it a little bit prettier I would say um I would say that this is being multiplied so I know I can eliminate that n and make that a two right could do that before you start Distributing you might want to do things like that right that that that'd be a lot better are you still okay so far how do you feel just fine with with this thus far now you'd probably distribute why just go ahead and do that I hope I'm right am I right yeah I love being right that's great did you get the same thing yeah now those of you who have been paying attention up here what's the one thing that we haven't done yet limit the limit oh we've done this we've done this we've done this in fact this is this that's what that is right that's what we've done so far it doesn't look like it because we used our our formula that's great it's kind of nice we haven't done this so before you start writing an a we're not at the a yet here's the fifth and final step take a limit as n goes to Infinity that's it notice the variable we ended with that's kind of cool we want n to go Infinity what's the only variable we have fantastic that's great why is that going to happen because you're actually going to Numbers if you're going to numbers you need to end with a number right if there was X's up here or anything yeah that you'd have X's within your problem but we don't we're going from Z to one that's called a definite integral you get a number so we'll take a limit as n goes to infinity and if you remember anything about limits which is why we did this it was just a little while ago 2 n^2 + 3 n + 1 over 6 n^2 some of these basic polinomial types are very easy to find a limit of when we go n to Infinity what do we do what was the idea largest power largest power in the denominator and you divide everything by it right in other words you look at the leading coefficients the leading coefficients are the coefficients of the terms of largest power so leading coefficients here are two and six respectively notice how the powers match up if you divide everything by X squ the only things you're going left with are two and six and everything else is going to go to zero I'll show you that step right now but basically I know this area is 1/3 right now 2 over 6 is 1/3 here's the work that you would show you'd say okay that's a limit that over n s that over n 2 that over n s and 6 N2 n 2 do you remember me teaching that from a while back and what we do is we simplify what we can these n squs are gone these n squ are gone but this one's not that just becomes an N so this is the limit of 2 + 3 n + 1 n 2 all over six tell me what happens when you let N Go to Infinity does the two change no does the six change what's this become zero and perfect that means the area because that's our definition for an area is 2 + 0 + 0/ 6 or in other words the area is 13 and that's how you can find area in curve we just completed the whole process right here folks we have functions we find rectangles you use right end points or left or midpoints use a limit on them I've given you every step now right you have five steps I I hope that's clear for you keep in mind that on your homework on your homework this is often called C subk you can you can call it c subk as well that just means an actual value within your interval that's some solid number that you're plugging in is that it good afternoon hope you're doing well we're going to continue talking about how to find areas using these limits and basically by adding up rectangles however before we get on to another example I do want to discuss what it is we're actually doing what we're doing is we're figuring out something called net signed area we are actually not calculating total area right here we're calculating something called net signed area would you like me to explain the difference yes here's what net signed area says before every function we've had till right now figuring out the area has been completely above the x-axis you might not have realized that but we haven't had one that's below the x-axis here's what net signed area says if I have this curve and let's pretend that the horizontal is the x-axis how many areas do I have distinct areas there would be three between the the function and the x-axis there's area one area 2 and area three here's what net signed area says it says the area that's above the x-axis counts as positive area area below the x-axis counts as negative area that's just how this area Works says this would all be a positive area and a positive area but this would have a negative area now in order to figure out total area I'm going to show you how to do that in a couple more lessons but right now just know that when we're calculating area from one point to another it is including this as being positive this as being positive and this it would count as a negative area it would subtract from the two positive areas are are you following me on that so the area you you get with with with doing this method even if it doesn't even if you don't have a graph of it even you don't know what it looks like here's what it's doing it's saying the total area is the positive areas minus the negative area or take time sorry the POS the area above the x-axis and taking away the area below the x-axis that's what that actually means it's basically the difference between the areas above and below the x-axis the difference between the areas above cumulatively and areas below cumulatively of the x-axis is symmetry a factor not really you can't I guess it could be it's found exactly the same way so the the area formula I created with you guys remember the area formula I created with you guys hopefully you've been using that it's the limit with that sum that that doesn't change this is when I said area what I meant was net signed area I didn't mean total area well we'll talk about that later so when you're calcula area like this which is basically what we've been doing for the past couple days also for those of you who have been doing your homework do you realize that this is in the book represented as C subk you've seen that as well right it means the same thing right so I could use that interchangeably that is net signed area what we've been doing is net signed area let me show you an example of this so you can kind of get an illustration of what I'm talking about would you like to see that we're going to do one kind of quickly we're going to go through very fast because the the process doesn't change but I want to show you at least uh one time okay we're going to find the area of f ofx under f ofx equals what I say x - one on the interval 02 with left end points that's what we're going to do hey what's the first step I think I gave it to you first step number one Delta X okay let's find Delta X so I'm outline all the steps for you just like you did before so Delta X in our case Delta X is how do you find Delta X come on people help me out 2 - 0 Over N it should have an n in it 2 N that's always your first step you got to have that before you go any further because the next step uses Delta X the next step is you got to find C subk or XK dot whatever ever notation you prefer I don't care how you do it I've called it XK dot in the previous lessons uh the book will call it C subk would you like me use C subk so you kind of see that okay I'll use C subk if You' like so the next is find C subk left using left end points C subk says this a + K-1 Delta X that's what C subk would say for you didn't I give you those formulas last time yeah okay so you look up the correct end point whether it's whether it's a left or right or perhaps a midpoint and you use the appropriate formula you with me then you fill out everything that doesn't have a k the K is going to stay there's nothing you plug in for K you're going to use that because your summation is using k okay minus one Whatever U so in our case C subk is what's your a a is where you start what's your a folks come on plus what do I plug in for that K nothing you're going to use that later on because you're going to be basing your summation notation on your K right you'll have a formula for that later it has to have a K well not have to but it's most likely going to have a k K minus one now your Delta X this is why we did this Delta X is 2 N so C sub k z zero does nothing you have 2K minus one don't distribute Over N don't distribute and I'll tell you why later you're just going to have to reactor out anyway if you do distribute where your feel okay with this so far good deal basic basic right now uh what's step number three come on on Roll fun C sure or XK dot which is what we used before to show the arbitrary point I like the XK dot because it means arbitrary that's why I showed it to you initially but the C subk says the same thing it says uh can you find out using our arbitrary Point what the function is going to look like what is the function ladies and gentlemen no the function xus one so I'm supposed to take C sub K and plug it into that you with me that says F of 2 K -1 / n which means that I'm going to have well if our function is x -1 it says 2 K -1/ N - one would you or feel okay with that so far I guess you could have distributed we might do that now there's a couple ways we could do this problem uh if you'd like probably the easiest way we combine everything right now get one fraction out of it so what's the next step after that after we find our function do what no aha right now we have this this okay we've got our function the next step step number four is you're supposed to put this in your summation right 1 to n you're supposed to make that you're supposed to say okay I know my Delta X I can plug it in I now have my f c subk I can plug that in and then we'll take the summation try to work that on out and see what we get out of it n help you're okay with that one let's plug that in together what goes in place of the F of C what is your mumblings what are you saying function of C K very good yes the function of C sub K come on letter it's right there sure just like that parentheses parenthesis is good we need that yes you don't want to miss your Delta X that's important especially for us our Delta X is 2 n would you ra your hand feel okay with this so far so far yes everybody so you're okay that where we got the Delta X right b - A Over N that's just going to be 2 N you okay with the c subk that's XK dot the same thing that means you're going to use a formula there it's going to be either left right or mid we have left in this case that's why we use this formula remember the right would have no minus one the mid would have minus one2 and you do the same exact thing we figured that out by inserting our Delta X then we take this value our C subk to plug it into our function that's right here and we're going to get this minus one for our function of C subk that's why we have that right there that's where the minus one's coming from it's not magic it's because I have X that treat that's my treated my as my x minus one got it then we plug everything in we got our function of C subk oh that's here times our Delta X we got our Delta X from right there and now we're good to go what now well now you work with it now you do some algebra probably have to distribute that you do have to distribute this one so we're going to get stick with me here folks 4 kus1 over n^ 2 - 2/ n are you okay with that at this point you have well next one's not an option but the one after that you're going to have an option the next thing you do is you break up those two sums do you see how can break up the sums by subtraction that's always legal with subtraction and addition so here you'd go okay summation notation K = 1 to n this minus this are you still okay so far you sure at this point you do have options your options are this you could distribute the four you could distribute the four and then separate those fractions and make two more sums you could do that that's option number one that's a decent option option number two is notice how this and this are not based on K you can pull those out and then you could separate the K minus one you could do that as well just make sure that you have a bracket around the whole thing that way you don't miss anything about it are you seeing what I'm talking about here so that options up to you which what do you want to do do you want to distribute right now or would you rather pull this stuff out if you want to break it up why don't you try some of you who who feel like Distributing and then breaking it up go ahead and do that you pull this out yeah okay we could do that too that's probably the way I'll choose to do so I'm going to look at this one I'm going say all right well I know this is 4 over n^2 and right here I'm going to put a bracket around so I don't forget I can't forget that I'm going to group that to say yes that's sum of that whole thing still minus oh well wait wait a second how about that what can I pull out of the 2 over n say what what about the two two out two now can you combine the two in you pulled out four and two you'd Factor it it get pretty messy I would wouldn't recommend that okay because this is different you can't combine that right now can you make it that far though algebraically the next part is make your sums something you can do with this is not something you can do deal with right here but if you split that up notice how we're going to keep it inside the bracket you see why we're going to keep it inside the bracket because ultimately our answer is going to get multiplied by 4 n^2 yes so we're going to we're going to have that we'll have the summation of K of course K's going from 1 to n minus the summation of one from 1 to n it's in a bracket you have to have it mine is the same thing I haven't changed that at all but now's the good part now's the part where you actually get to do some nice stuff you ready to do some nice stuff with it we it's time to get rid of all those summations because we don't we don't like those those we have formulas for you ready to deal with the formulas for those you sure M real quick though how many people feel okay with with this so far feel just fine with it so you see where all this stuff is coming from that's great that's great okay now have you memorized or do you know the formula for sum of K [Music] sure all the mumbling hopefully made over two good job yeah I think I heard most of what you said that's that that is this minus it's still in a bracket what's this we talked about that only one time constant time n which would be what just n in this case minus two okay 2 over n times how much is this one n n yeah n that's why by the way it's in your in your notation it says sum of C is CN because you always pull the C out right the summation one is always just n that's why it's CN so this is going to be N I do it that way cuz it's kind of nice you can see what's going to happen with that you still all right let's keep going let's do some fancy math uh easy part I'll do this one for you I'll tell you what the n and the end here I get to cross those out cool right done that's nice what's going to happen with this whole garbage we distribute that if I distribute that back in there but I needed to I needed to factor it out to get my summation notation okay but now I need to distribute it back in if we had split this up we probably wouldn't have to distribute that back in so it's it's up to you what you want to do with that uh but notice how if we would have distributed here split our fractions then pulled things out of each individual sum there'd be no need for distribution later do you see the difference in that problem so it's it's six to one half dozen to other it really doesn't matter matter what you do you're going to have to factor and distribute in both cases so here we'll get we'll get what okay let me do this a couple steps because I'm thinking you're you're going too fast for me how about that does that work for you yes no I haven't I haven't simplified anything yet except for these two ends is that okay are you sure I'm getting nothing I need more than this guys I need yeses or NOS that's the only way I know how to teach I need M or not okay that doesn't work do you get it or not if you don't that's not a problem you just need to let me know now let's simplify some other stuff tell me something that simplifies here okay cool so the two and the four those simplify the n and one of those n's simplify what simplifies here is an N with the square part of that so I get 2 n + 1/ N - 4 n - 2 we're almost done almost done you ready for it now we'll distribute the two we'll get 2 n + 2 and I'm also going to break it up 2 n + 2 and then I split the fraction up 2 N / n + 2 N yes no just some basic algebra but I want to make sure you're really solid on this before you go any further are you really Sol on that mhm what's nice about this we're going to get that's going to be two got it man we're almost done why don't you tell me the next thing I'm going to have up here oh come on what's the next thing that happens you see something up here two positive2 and your oh so two and -2 oh I made a mistake why did you let me do that oh I was wondering what you were talking about okay what is this at anyway the twos are gone uh we have 2 N - 4n you okay with the 2 N - 4n right now what do you do when you have made it down that far you have step number five what are you supposed to do now a limit of the whole darn thing so right here we found the sum we know what that is now you take a limit as n goes to Infinity of whatever sum you had we've already worked this part down we you already have it this part is 2 N - 4 n i could you have it doesn't really matter we can yes absolutely yes you're right for sure I just didn't see it because I know what the answer is going to be are you okay getting that far then yes we have a -2 n yes yes now you take a limit as n goes to what this is very simple when when n goes to Infinity where does that go zero it's weird you mean the area is zero yes negative area here your you need to think about what this is this was a lot of work for something very very simple honestly it was you're going to see this if you didn't really picture what this graph is beforehand you will now uh this says Y intercept 1 the slope is one and you're going from 0 to two that's your picture yes it's just two triangles 0 to two why did our area go out to zero this is positive whatever this is negative but it's the same exact value only negative in fact it was two and -2 you know how I know that well you could or look here this is positive area this is subtrac the area this par that's going to give you a zero these ones go to zero because you're div you're divided by Infinity it goes to zero gone there's totally a simplified version no power R go through all the mess and power R never do you understand the reason why this is zero ladies and gentlemen do you see why the areas are both on the numerator and denominator of your whatever actually it's not two is it it's 1 * 1 over it's 1 12 I don't know why I get uh but the area here if you did the if you actually did the work base times height over two I think I said two I meant 1 12 it doesn't quite match up to that apparently that's one that's one so 1 * 1 is 1/ two base time side number two you get one half above you get one half below that's what makes it zero you okay with it yeah sounds cool shall we do one more yes the worst I can think of so far yeah there's worst ones on your homework know that but think it's so far here it is you'll get inspiration after you see our homework yeah you're inspired by terrible going to the next next semester's class probably harder they do yeah they do do they really that's no not really not anymore they used to though I kept seeing stupid mistakes you guys gotta be freaking kidding me I want to punch you more so make them harder harder I wish I could take this class the firster it's very easy in high school you know there can only be one there could be only one Highlander oh yeah I should just say go do it have fun but we'll do it together so you can see it but you need to be a participating you need you need to basically be able to tell me what to do because when you get this on your test and you will uh you'll need to know how to do it right and if it makes sense what I'm doing of course it does I'm the teacher I know what I'm doing most of the time uh so it's going to make I do it's going to make sense when I do it but when you go home you need to practice that's why when you skip your your homework or you skip pieces of your homework it kills you because you get to the test you got to realize there's only 10 12 problems on the test right we have like five to six homework assignments usually so that's one to two problems on the test that come from your homework so if you miss a homework you miss one to two problems or at least you haven't practiced them that's why your grades go down so you need to practice it even though it's hard practice it now we're going to go through every step I've given you five steps for reason so that you follow them step number one is what Delta Delta yall should find it right now Delta X is refreshingly easy always it's a subtraction over a number so in our case you get 1 - 0/ n 1 over n did you get 1 over n as well yes okay what's the next thing that you do find C okay go ahead and do that we're using right and points did you find c k already yes it should go pretty quick this is not one of those hard ones either you plug in a number for a you plug in nothing for K you plug in Delta X X zero K one did you get that too so you got K over did you get K Over N do you see why right end points are kind of nice sometimes to use because you don't have the K minus one you don't have the oneus one2 that's even nastier so right I like right end points first K Over N satisfied so far what's the next thing that you do function okay do [Applause] it find the function I'll give you a minute for that one by show hands how many people made it that far am I right oh good then you're all right that's that's fantastic if you made it that far and I made it that far we hopefully we both did right did you get that as well cool what would have made it worse what type of endo would have really made it worse left ones would have made it worse midp points would have made it worse too because you'd be cubing K minus one not horribly horribly bad but you'd have more things to deal with that's why this was such a pain because you had this mess right that mess kind of stunk it up a little bit not hard not hard just more work you also Dobe from right here well I'm saying if I had that okay okay that would have made it worse is we were talking about what would have made it worse than this a left end point or a midpoint would have made this problem a lot harder are you okay with that one so far what's the next step you do do the sum do the Sun I don't want to write up there until you at least have something on your paper so go for the s you probably should have a bracket if you don't have one put one on your paper get in the habit of doing that because you're not just multiplying this last little bit you're multiplying the whole thing by Delta X whatever the Delta X happens to be in our case it's k oh one over so geez shoot you know I looked right there I'm Sorry by the way uh I just meant to do this to test you you guys are oh yeah buy you're not buying that you always do darn it I'm so good at doing that though yeah I see it every time yeah okay one of R yeah my bad I was kind of looking at that wondering how are we going to deal with the K to the fourth but n sure we would have dealt it at some point anyway do you feel okay with it so far raise your hand feel just fine with it you have that on your paper exactly like that cool now what probably make it a lot prettier before you can split anything you have to deal with this multiplication distri you can't split this up right now it's being multiplied so you have to distribute that you have to think about this as K Cub Over N Cub So eventually you'll split it off you have to move this two to the top or take that completely out later I'd probably move it to the numerator right right now just to be able to deal with it a little bit easier so I'm going to multiply by 2 that's 2K n I'm going to multiply by 1/ n to both of those and I'm going to make that K Cub M Cub that's our next three steps is it okay if we had already done that step previously over here yeah did the two two and Decay and then cubed everything much earlier and just kept pairing it out that way so I've made things nicer inside now I'll distribute that one/ n and what we'll get is 2K over n^ 2us K Cub Over N 4th and that should be in a parentheses signifying that I'm taking the sum of that entire expression not just the first part not just second part the whole thing okay now what would you like to do now you split it up you can't pull out any case yet you can't unless you you factored you could do that but that's probably not the easiest way to go what we should do here is split these up into two different sums and then pull out all the constants are you following me or not you sure remember this this is easy cuz I'm doing it when you get home you need to follow the same steps why don't you go ahead and try to do the rest of this on your own what I'd like you to do is take out everything that doesn't have to do with a K in front of your summation use the appropriate formula that I've given you from before figure out that that closed form and then simplify it after you simplified as much as you can then take a limit I'll give you about two minutes to see if you can work on it I'll do about one step every 10 or 20 seconds or so just make sure you're on the right track so look up here at the board every once in a while and you'll start seeing the steps for this is you make it that far on your own simplifying the first one squaring everything inside the parentheses the second one multiplying by 1 n 4th you make it that far yes no is do second part did I mess the formula up I thought that formula right there I don't believe so unless my mind's completely flipped off out and i' I've lost flipped off my mind's flipped off it is flipped off today I don't know no I think I believe it's squared n * n+ 1 over2 quanti squared should be the formula I gave you if you have a cubed you might want to change it back it's not cubed satisfied so far some of you look lost algebraically are you okay I'm going to keep going how do you get four why did you get n+ one over four and not n plus one over n oh this one yeah I was testing you you passed okay that's two CU I saw that four and that's what I did yeah thank you I'm sorry about that guys my bad yeah good catch thank you that's why I ask you CU I do this stuff too is everything else right check out okay please notice something that's going to happen here the algebra we're subtracting the that entire last fraction right so when you subtract the entire last fraction and you split it up it's not going to be plus 2 n/ 4N s it's going to be minus 2 N 4N s you see that this will find necessity to distribute when you split that up it has to so you're going to get - 2 n/ 4 n^ 2 - 1 4 do you see why do you see why yes or no for instance then I can show it to you this way if you want uh 5 - 1 + 3/x like that would be 5 - 1x + 3x right like that that's what that means me so this would distribute to both of that's same thing we're just using it three times here okay let's simplify unless I've made some sort of error I think that's about what you get was anyone able to make it down that far on their own good good if not where did you make your mistake find out was it a sign was it simplification this is all about your algebra notice we basically stopped to doing the calculus after that part finding the formula and then this is all just some basic algebra now comes back in the calculus once you get this right we're going to take a limit that's the last thing we'll do so step number five write right here it's already nice and broken down for us that's what's great about this we didn't have to find a common denom and divide everything by the largest power of the denominator you can do it that way it's a little bit more concise this says all right the area not an approximation anymore the actual area because we're taking n to Infinity that says pack is many rectangles as is possible and then some into that area that means there's not going to be any error whatsoever you're gonna get what what what's this go to Z this one that's a constant what's this one go to what's this one go to this one this one how much that's what we're talking about so we don't have to rec combine all of our fractions heck no no why would you ever do that oh my gosh no I guess yes cuz I hate myself on the homework cuz you hate yourself on the homework cuz you want to waste time take your limit then if you have to do it combine them you don't have to this is so nice some a number over n that works out very nicely for you right so use it shoot why not why not do it that way under what circumstances have I can't think of one okay so don't do it well the only time you you would is like uh for some reason if you wanted to combine these and make a common not or if you didn't want to split this up you could do it here okay minus the limit of this divide all this by N2 and then you can do the same thing there that's fine I don't care how you do it I'm just showing you that you can split it up it's it comes out very nicely then you have less work to do on your actual limit the more you split up like this and have one term it comes out just piece of cake no work on the limit more work on the algebra or less work on the algebra more work on the limit either way you go you're going to get it right provided you know how to work with this appropriately the correct sign and you also know how to do your liit good you raise your have feel okay with getting the three4 there all right
