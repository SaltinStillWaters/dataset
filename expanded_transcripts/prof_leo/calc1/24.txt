Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 3.7:  Optimization; Max/Min Application Problems
we are going to tackle how to maximize and or well and or minimize some functions specifically some continuous functions so basically if we're maximizing or minimizing continuous functions we have really two scenarios we're going to talk about them over closed intervals closed intervals closed finite intervals or open Infinite intervals so basically it has this if I give you continuous function will it have an absolute maximum will it have an absolute minimum and how can you apply that to real life we're talking about cost if you're a business you probably want to find out the lowest cost right or you want to find out the maximum profit that's probably what you want to do right you would want to find the maximum cost and the minimum profit that would suck because then you're going to waste a lot of money and you're going to get fired probably uh or if you just guess you're not going to be making as much money you're be spending too much money if you just guess at things I think if we produce this amount then it's going to be good let's try well why don't you do the calculus and figure out exactly what you need to produce exactly how much is going to cost and minimize the cost maximize the profit and that's that's pretty much the idea does that make sense if you're making stuff you want and you're trying to like boxes are you going to make a a storage box that's this long and this wide and and that that deep would that be a good storage box not if you want to maximize the volume right with the same amount of surface space so if I say here's a here's a th000 square ft of cardboard makebe the best box you can we should be able to do that we should be able figure out the dimensions using some calculus and that's what we're talking about maximization problems well I'm going to relate this back to absolute Max and absolute men here's the idea if you have a closed interval closed interval looks like this with brackets if you have a closed interval with brackets do you for certain have an absolute Max absolutely do you have an absolute men so for a close interval because these have brackets you will certainly have Solutions there will be Solutions if it's a continuous function and there's a closed interval always how about open open intervals because remember absolute Max and absolute Min if you think back if you watch the video from a while back uh absolute Maxima and Minima must occur at one of two places must occur at relative Max or men for continuous functions relative Max or men or at end points do you remember talking about that if I take away the fact that it has end points well then it must occur at relative Maxes or mins which don't have to be could be but don't have to be the absolute Maxim in so while a Clos interval will definitely have an absolute Maxim in or will definitely have maximum and a minimum because we have end points this one might not have them because there's no end points are are you with me on this so might not have Solutions well we're going to jump right into it with an example we'll start off quite simply I I want to basically do some example to give you uh some vocabulary and how to how to do the problem let's say that I want you to build a region that's fenced in so basic a rectangular region so basically Wyoming or something I think it's pretty much a rectangle right well if you consider the Earth to be flat it would be a rectangle it's curv never mind it's a surface space but let's pretend the world's flat for Wyoming cuz have you been to Wyoming it pretty much is um not really they have mountains and stuff but let's just pretend it's flat and it's a rectangle I want you to fence it we're going to make this easier than that but basically you're fencing a rectangular region yeah have fence a rectangular region and maximize the area you have 100 ft of fencing available of course this is not Wyoming anymore okay but because Wyoming is very large we're just going to fence some regular area okay you have 100 ft of fence this by the way is called something specific for these applied problems it's called a constraint it says this is what you have to work with it's putting a limit on your area basically because if I said maximize the area you just go okay I'm going to make it as long as I can times as wide as I can that's maximizing but as soon as I say oh you only have 100t of fencing well that changes things doesn't it you have to have that statement that's called a constraint constraints can be given to you they can be implied in the problem they can be realistic constraints but somewhere in your in most of these problems you will have some sort of a constraint now one great thing to do with these applied problems they're all going to have something you can draw so try to draw a picture of them to get your mind wrapped around it we're talking about a rectangle here so we're probably going to want to draw a rectangle here so let's draw a rectangle here doesn't matter what you call the sides but call them something call this one maybe X and this one y bless you thank with me still what's this side good and this one's why because inherently we know about rectangles opposing sides are of equal value so we have that the next thing you do you come up with some sort of area that has to deal with what you're trying to maximize or minimize something you're trying to find the maximum or minimum of very much like with Rel related rates right you're trying to find an area that Inc incorporates everything here you're trying to find a formula uh sorry formula that incorporates everything here you're trying to find a formula that incorporates what you're trying to maximize with your figure so we want our formula and you need to list out any constraints that you have okay tell me something we've already drawn our picture let's come with a formula that has to do with with what we're trying to maximize what are we trying to maximize here ladies and gentlemen okay so if we're trying to maximize area you need to be able to come with the formula for the area what's the formula for area specifically for this what's the formula for our area X Y would give us the area of that rectangle true x * y now let's talk about our constraint what does the 100 ft of fence have to do with anything that has to be your what's that called the domain of the function oh kind of kind of kind of sort of perimeter perimeter we'll talk about domain in a minute okay but the 100 ft of fencing you know that goes around your figure right so that is your perimeter so right here our formula we're trying to maximize is the area you with me on that that's what it the question says but a formula that's inherent in our problem has to do with our constraint and it says well I know that if I add up all the sides it has to equal how much now add up all the sides how much do you get good if I add that up I add this one this one this one this one that's 2 X's plus 2 y's and you get another formula out of your constraint raise your hand feel okay with this so far okay very good now the question is what are we trying here's where you answer your question if you have two more than one formula what are you trying to do here are you trying to maximize your constraint or maximize your area your area so what you're going to do use your constraint solve for one variable and substitute it in to the formula that you're trying to maximize or minimize the reason is can you find a derivative of x and Y yeah you can with implicit however you're going to need to solve for y anyway to be able to do anything with it so solve this for y and substitute it in so we're going to solve our constraint for one variable I would choose y I don't know I like y so solve for y and then substitute that into your formula so you're going to solve the constraint for one variable and sub into your formula okay you get to choose which one you want to solve it for I'm going to choose to solve for y so I'm going to subtract 2x I'm going to divide by two and I'm going to get 50x or 50 yeah okay so from here yeah if I divide everything by two I'm going to get y = 50 - x so far so good what the does it says okay now that I have y = 50 - x let's take that let's put it here that changes our formula from two different variables into one variable and that says I can do something with Calculus with it all right you need that one variable for us so I'm going to get a = x and instead of Y I need I need parentheses do you see why I need parenthesis you sure hate us right now hate no Hate's a strong word but you need parentheses they're important if you give me this you know I'm going to have a cow right literally half I I used to live on a dairy I could half a cow if I wanted there's 6,000 of them you 6,000 cows there's only 45 of you 45 cows for each person a lot of cows so far so good make it easier before you do the next thing we're going to do you see right now we have this formula for area right what we're trying to do is maximize the area which is why we're working with the formula for area now what we learned here was that this really is a closed interval there's only so far I can make my X I can't make my X or my y like 3,000 ft right because I only have 100 to work with so I I'm actually dealing with some some domain restraints right there we'll talk about that a second but we know that wherever a maximum or a minimum occurs it's going to be at either an npoint which we'll talk about in a bit or it's going to be at a relative extreme point a relative Max like this how do you find relative Maxes what do you do with functions that's a function what do you do with functions to find relative Max you take a derivative because you know relative Maxes happen where the slope is zero right to find the slope you take a derivative so with your applied problems let's take a derivative of that now I wouldn't be so silly as to do a product rule here I'd probably distribute and get 50x - x^2 and then take a derivative but we're going to take a derivative because what a derivative is is our what's a derivative again slope and we want to know where the slope equals z because where the slope equals z gives us a critical point and that could potentially be our relative Max or men if it's a relative Max that means it could be our absolute max if it's not it will certainly occur at an end point but it's something we need to check so take our first derivative that would be U with respect to X in this case notice that if you had solved for X here and plugged in and had y's you'd have d a Dy you follow me on that show your notation appropriately this is with respect to the variable that you have X in our case you get 50 - 2x are you okay so far what's that give you again SL slope and what do we want to find with the slope where it equals z if it equals zero somewhere that's going to be possibly a change from increasing to decreasing might be decreasing increasing but it will give us the only point on our interval where that that change could possibly occur that's why we're going to check this with the end points later to determine whether it's a actual Max whether it's a minimum how much is X probably add 2x divide two probably 25 hopefully 25 25 I got the 25 I we will feel okay getting xal 25 now if x is 25 how much is y use your constraint to solve for that just plug in the 25 y's got to be 25 so if x is 25 we use this again but then you're going to have to check see here's what we did what we did is we found out that the only possible place where we have an absolute maximum other than the end points is right there would you agree with that that's the only place that we change from increasing decreasing or decreasing increasing that's the only relative even possible relative extreme that we have and what we know for before is that absolute Max which is what we're trying to do Max or Min absolute Max must occur at end points or at relative extrema our end points are well we'll talk about that we're going to check right here but our possible relative extrema is at X 25 although there are excuse me there are some end points here can you tell me what's the biggest thing we could make x wait 100 if you did 100 you'd have a one-sided fence not 99 75 oh no too big still 50 50 x could be 50 you have two x's right that's right so if x is one thing it has to be the other thing on other side if you do 75 you can't do 75 25 that doesn't make sense it's not a rectangle now you might be thinking well is 50 and 50 a rectangle technically yes kind of if you have 50 and 50 how much is y going to be that's going to be a rectangle is that going to maximize your area actually has zero area cuz it's 50 * 0 right that would be Z it'd be a line you get two just a fence next to a fence but you could do it right so the maximum that X could be like you were the stupid you may be a it's for skinny cows skinny cows coming from California okay so x x is 50 equals the maximum value you can make X because 50 + 50 equal 100 what's the least value you could make X zero CU then y would be 50 and 50 right that'd be a straight line other direction again your area would not be good but here's the point okay this is kind of a simplistic example but it says this it says if a maximum is going to occur it occurs here here or here it has to occur because this is a closed interval it's going to be here here or here so X is bound between here's our end points this says X is somewhere in the interval that's what that little element says somewhere in the interval of 0 to 50 inclusively including zero including 50 that's somewhere where X is if we have this interval which is our our inherent constraint in our problem then our absolute Max must be one of these three numbers we know it's either end points or or it's at a a relative extreme and that's the only place we could possibly have a relative extreme now have you feel okay with that so far all right so you're going to plug him in where are you going to plug those in first derivative is going to give you zero because that's where how you found that number it not the first derivative what gives you values people the original function in our case that's our original function or if you have the Y you can plug it in there that's okay but plug here and that's going to maybe be a little bit easier to do I would say for just X's if you plug in 50 check it out look it what's 50 - 50 your area is zero we talked about that that's straight line this way right plug in zero 50 - 0 is 50 times gives you that's the Y equals 50 and 50 that would give that's minimizing your area right there 0o and zero this one hopefully is maximized hopefully it gives us something plug in 25 this said the area is zero this said the area is zero this is the area is we knew it had to be one of those three this is the biggest one Argo it must be your absolute maximum so what do we say the absolute maximum is 625 Square ft when X = 25 basically what shape do you have sare you have a square yeah you have a square 25 25 25 25 cuz X and Y are both 25 so how you'd write it out um I really don't want to race any this but I'll write down here the maximum area is 625 Square ft be specific when x = 25 and Y = 25 feet do you feel okay with our example yes no we're going to go a little bit quicker now we're going to because we we understand the idea formula constraint put them together that's basically the idea let's talk about one that we we actually had before if you want to go back and refresh on the video I had this problem excuse me this problem but we didn't do anything with it do you remember the problem where I said I want you to take a piece of cardboard I want you to cut sections out of it I want you to make a box oh it came up better this time lot better do you see the Box yep that did my job if I make this or would I say 16 and 30 don't really matter let's do 16 and 30 this is 16 in this is 30 in and each of these Cuts is X so the problem from a long time ago was let's suppose I had this this box this piece of cardboard and I cut X's squares of X Out of each corner I could fold up the sides and it would make a box like that right an open box like that do you remember that problem do you recall if this is this side and it's not the scale of course but if this is this side what's the length of that is it still 30 30 - x is close but it's not 30 - x 30 - 2x yes cuz you have an X from each side you okay with that F how much is that size it's still 16 very good okay how much is the height of our box whatever the size of the corner is you cut out that's going to give you the height do you follow you're taking this this square right you're cutting out a square you're going to fold up this side fold up this side it's going to give you that box it's going to be a height of X show hands tell me feel okay with our picture now what we want to do in this problem I want us to find out the maximum the maximum volume that we can make this box so let's say you're working for UPS right say we got we get so much of this stuff we have so many pieces of cardboard left over there're 16x 30 I want you to take a stamping machine cut out X's fold them up takee the sides how many boxes can we make or sorry what what's the biggest size of a box we can make out of this and you go well I don't want to just waste product let me do the problem real quick so let's figure this out so we want to maximize the volume well I told you there's really two things we do after we draw a picture number one we draw a picture number two we got to find a formula we got to find any constraints that we have so let's work on a formula can you find a formula for volume because that's what we're trying to maximize say it again so basically all three dimensions times each other right in our case can you tell me more specifically what that will be for us that's important yeah you should have that and then what else I'll put the X out front is that okay with you so don't forget about it one dimension length time width time height was going to give you the volume you feel okay with the volume now let's look at a constraint it told you nothing else about this problem it just said I have this make me a box I told you nothing else however inherently in this problem there is a constraint in fact we talked about it the first time we had this if you watch the video you can see it There's a constraint here what's the constraint wait wait why not 16 why doesn't why can't X be smaller than 16 why is it eight because you have to take it from both side very good if you didn't hear she said you have to take it from both sides right so if I make an X cut here I have to be able to make the same X cut here right if I go more than eight I overlapped I don't have any more stuff to cut off so eight is the maximum cut I could make would it be a good idea to cut off eight if I cut eight and eight and eight and eight that's going to be the worst box ever it's going to be a really small piece of cardboard and you go and you're going to go dude seriously you're fired all right that would be silly you don't want to do that so you could do eight you could but you know it has to be less than that or equal to eight what's the smallest cut you could make what if you didn't make one you'd have the second worst box ever right the first worst box is you cut something off and fail to make a box that's the eight and eight you cut off eight you cut off eight that's gone cut off eight you cut off eight that's gone you basically have a 14 in by uh whatever that is 16 14 by 16 flat piece of cardboard if you don't make a cut at least you have a 16x 30 flat piece of C cardboard but it's still not going to hold anything but you could check it understand that that is my inherent constraint do you see it okay we have a formula it's a in terms of one variable that's great if we had two variables we would need another another constraint to work with it we have a constraint that's going to limit our our end results that we're going to check our end points there what do you do now you're trying to maximize right you know Maxima and Minima have to occur here here or somewhere in the somewhere in there right it's got to be in there but the places where it occur are the places where the slope is going to be zero right how do you find the slope take a derivative when all this fails take a derivative you going to take a derivative of this product rule no you're not going to do that why don't you distribute it out see what you get take a derivative set it equal to zero so that's volume I don't know if I did that right did I do that right I mess it up I did right oh sweet seriously good cuz I was guessing totally guessing no I'm just kidding I knew it um anyway so you distribute it you combine everything together hopefully you got that far did you get that far now take your first derivative make sure I'm right by the way I like being right that's awesome sorry that's V of X so V Prime of x is that yes no okay that's nasty what do you do with that set equals zero and prey you can factor out 12 right set equals Zer because that's going to give you the only places where you have a critical point critical point is the only places you have a relative Max relative Min so set this thing equal to zero there 12 factor out of it what do you do try six try six did six factor out of it you can do four do you do four you can't do six darn it hate that you can do four so four factors out of it you can still factor out the four though right if you don't want to do quadratic formula that suck how much is that divided by four 46 120 well you try to factor it or use quadratic formula do you remember the quadratic formula yeah xal oh we should watch mat C video I sing We Sing About It X bad 4 a 2 a did it nice brings back so many memories schol yeah first time I've ever heard that song really okay are you working it out have you already worked it out I have no idea those too big for me to do my head I don't know I don't know what it is I'm going to uh6 Total oh no I just I don't need this 21 2116 total no no 676 676 7 Dam it 676 six that's easy 6 what's the sare root of 676 26 126 26 26 126 very good 23 okay let's see you get what 23 plus orus 133 23 orus 13 everything by 72 over 6 and 20 over 6 12 and 10/3 is what you're telling me yes no feel okay with 12 and 10/3 took way too long OMG BFF TGI Fridays um tell me something about these these points it be 12 why can't it be 12 we can't make it X bigger as 12 so this one even though it says 12 you cannot do that the only one it could possibly be is 10/3 so let's think about this now realistically we already said and you could check it you check your end points in fact I'll I'll eras this I'll do it over here your end points are zero eight and only critical number you had was 10/3 if you make zero as your X cut you're going to get a volume of zero if you make eight as your X cut you're going to get a volume of zero are you with me still so far look at your volume function it says if you make let's see make a cut of 0 0 * anything is z you make a cut of 8 16 - 8 * 2 is is z that's time Z so you're going to get volume of zero the only one that can possibly work is 10/3 so what you would do I'm not going to spend the time to do this but you find out whatever has anyone done that the volume for that 10/3 if you do what you do is you plug in your 10/3 you find your volume whatever this is is your maximum so the maximum volume would be plug in 10/3 to your original volume function figure out what it is I'm not going to have you do that right now do it on your own time figure out what that volume is and that will be your maximum volume it occurs at a cut of 3 and A3 in you follow me on that 3 and A3 inches how we feel okay with our maximization so far you were try something a little bit more fun cuz when are you ever going to do this in real life maybe yeah I'm not a box cutter but I do build oil pipelines in the middle of the ocean so let's do an example like that okay okay wait really no wish that's a summer job seriously though any questions let before I erase it do you understand the idea you understand how to draw a picture come with a formula that relates that picture to what you're trying to maximize or minimize do your derivative it's all about the derivative set it equal to zero solve it come up with your constraint and check your end points that's absolute Maxim in that's exactly what we've done before in what 3 point I don't know what it was we've already done that you said you plug in your end points you plug in any critical numbers you had whichever biggest One Max smallest one Min no problem that's the idea 726 how much 726 726 anybody else get the same answer uh I did 726 this should be in cubic in you guys ever go to Santa Barbara she has oil pipelines out there sometimes they have pipe let's say you want to build one of those but you wanted to not have tankers go back and forth so what you're going to do is build that thing and then build an under thewater pipeline to land because you have a refinery right off the coast somewhere so here's what happened your refineries here at point B the oil you located is there oil if you were to go directly from the oil to shore we'll call that point a here's the idea here's what you know about the the situation pipe costs a whole much whole bunch more to put it in the Ocean than it does on land you got to have people go out there lay it right go under the water put the pipe together do all that stuff okay now we're going to make this kind of simplified it probably doesn't cost a dollar per kilometer but we're going to say it cost a dollar maybe it's like a a million dollars per kilometer or a billion I don't know how much it is but let's say that it costs twice as much for the underwater stuff as it does for the on land stuff you with me on that so the pipe costs $1 per kilm in the ocean and half of that on the lens so whatever it is you could substitute in different numbers and you get this right same exact idea okay on there if we want to minimize the [Applause] cost which I hope that you do right you want to build the worst pipeline for if you want to build the worst pipeline you go like this uh let's put the oil way over here and then down here and then over here that'd be stupid right we want to come with the most cost effective way to do this pipeline so if we want to minimize our cost what would you do would you go like this would you make your oil pipeline here and there would would you do that no I don't know it seems to me like that would be the least amount of ocean pipeline but the most possible land pipeline wouldn't it I don't know if it's going to be cost effective I have no idea uh I really don't know would you go straight from the oil to the oil stop you could that would be the the the fastest way right the least amount of pipe in general but this is the most expensive pipe you can lay right this would be less expensive so chance are we're going to come with some point that's intermediate that says well how can we do this maybe we take our oil and we pipe it to some onshore point and then lay the pipe from here to here does that make sense the way if you label it Point p and you say Well Point P very well could end up being at a right it might it could be here could be at point B it'll come up in the formula it' be at your end points all right so let's say if we want to minimize our cost how far should Point P be from point A oh my gosh I don't know no idea let's let's try think through this thing oh there's one more thing I need you to know doing your measurements that's 8 km okay so you know that and you know that your oil is 5 km off the shore those are things you know what we want to know is where's that point gun to be to make this the cheapest so we're going to basically make a in the in the ocean pipeline combined with the on the land pipeline see how far this is what what do I what am I asking here how far this has to be from there what do you want to call that the distance from here to here I call it some variable whatever it is just call it X now let's think critically about this if this area I'm sorry this uh this distance is X from a to P how far is the distance from P to B don't use y because then we have to come up with another formula to solve it try to base it on X that's the reason I gave you the eight x - 8 or 8 - x 8 if this distance is 8 if that was a two that would be a six right if that was a four that would be a four you're taking 8 minus that X so whatever that is do you feel okay with our picture so far do you understand the question the question is let's try to minimize our cost if we have to get oil from there to point B if we know that this is 8 km we know that it's 5 kmet off the shore let's find the best place to do that so that we don't spend a whole heck of a lot more money than we need to well here's the deal we need to come up with some formula that relates the cost of this to our problem so let's try to do that cost what do you need to know to find the cost of something let's see well we need know how far this pipe is don't we okay I'll give you the easy one how far is it from P to B would you agree that 8 - x in parenthesis uh would you agree that that is the amount of on land pipeline we're going to need do we need pipe from a to p no we're going to go from the ocean to P we need pipe from P to B you follow me on that that's the 8 - x 8- X how much is each and that's in kilm 8 kmus x km how much is each kilm of pipe on land dollar no it's not a dollar it's a half of a dollar so would you agree that if this is the amount of pipe one half of that remember this is dollars half a dollar times that amount is going to give us the amount of money it's going to cost to go from P to B how people feel okay with that so far okay very oh let's let's do that let's do oil to PE let's do this distance how do we do that distance that's a right right triangle that's why by the way we called that X right that's why so that we get a Pythagorean theorem triangle it's kind of nice you don't want to do with 8- X it's crazy so this is X that's five if this is X and that's five this is I'm GNA kind of do it a little real quickly for you this is the square root of x^2 + 5^ 2 do you follow me on that leg squ plus leg squ equal hypotenuse squ take the squ root of the hypotenuse and that's the distance from a to P I'm sorry from oil to P yes no leg squ plus leg squ squ so if our distance is I'll put it in Black so you see it the sare otk of x^2 + 25 which by the way you can't just take the square root of x s and the 25 right that's not just X+ 5 you can't do that it's s otk of x + 25 and you can't do anything with it would you agree that this is how far it is from the oil to point P okay so this is the distance from oil to point P this is the distance from point P to point B this is all the pipe that we're going to need right what's the cost of this pipe one do could you do it with different amounts of money of course you could the numbers get worse but this is the same idea how do I have the cost of this and the cost of that what do I need to put between them no not parentheses I need to add those costs let's try to think about the formula one time that we'll start working with this next time we're going to take our problem and break it down little by little we're trying to come up with a formula to minimize the thing that I'm asking you for here we had to minimize the cost so to find the cost out well you need to know how far your pipe is multiply that by the cost if this whole thing is 8 km and a to P is X then P to B is 8 - x that's the distance each of that those kilom cost half a dollar that's this portion of it to get from the oil to Point P which is probably some it's going to be some intermediary intermediary point we're going to find the distance using Pythagorean theorem that's the 5^2 plus X2 take a square root of it that's where we get that each of those kilom cost a dollar each if we have the cost for offshore plus the cost for onshore that's our total cost how many you feel okay with this so far all right we're going to continue working on a problem I'm going to kind of recap what we what we did last time just so you know so what we're doing is what're we're drilling for oil off of a of some Coast somewhere and we know where this oil is and we know where we want the oil to be and it's not directly out from the shore maybe this money this is too expensive to buy over here so we got to get the oil from here to our Oil Stop maybe this is our shipping yard or maybe it's our Refinery we want to pipe it directly to there you get the idea so we know one thing about it we know right now that it's 8 km from A to B we also knew that the oil happens to be 5 km off the shore and let me explain the idea once again what we're trying to do is we're trying to minimize the cost of our pipeline the pipeline costs a dollar at seed now of course it's going to be more than that real life but the principle stays the same and half a dollar on land so we had some options here we could have made the sea line as cheap as possible that would go directly to the shore right but then our land line would be as the longest possible maybe that's not going to minimize our cost we could have gone directly from the oil to our Oil Stop which says you don't do any land line but you have the most expensive sea line you can possibly have right so we're saying what if this is the case because we're not quite sure we don't know what's going to happen but most likely we'll have some sea line and we'll have some land line and that will probably minimize our cost so we asked the question how far does point B Point P have to be from point A in order to minimize our cost that's a l different problem well do we know how far Point P has to be from point A right now X so we're going to call it X we call it X because we don't know the distance and if you think about it we're going to have to figure out how far this is right that's going to be a Pythagorean theorem problem which I'm seeing in my head around I'm thinking you know what I don't want to deal with something very complicated here let's just make it an X so I'm going to pick X if that's X and we know the whole distance is 8 kilm then the distance from P to B is what it says this it says the distance from the the amount of pipe that we're going to have for our land is going to be 8 - x whatever X is we subtract that from 8 that's how much pipe we have to have in in the land you follow me on this but what we also need to know we've got to know the distance of pipe we're going to lay at C so from the oil to point P we got to know that I think I did this last time but I did it very quickly we've used the Pythagorean theorem it is a right triangle so it says leg squ plus leg squ equal the hypotenuse squar if that's true I'm going to erace my ocean here ocean if we do that then I know whatever this distance is is equal to X2 + 5 S it's a leg squ plus leg squ if I take a square root of it the reason why I take got to take a square root the hypotenuse squared equals that so to get the hypotenuse take a square root of both sides so our distance here is the square Ro TK of x^2 plus let's just change it to 25 you okay with this so far now before we work on the formula I don't think I did this last time let's talk about a constraint let's talk about a constraint on X what's the least amount of distance you could have for X remember X is the distance from a to P what's the the least amount you could have you probably would want negative right if you did negative you'd go this way would you want to go this way that'd be pretty stupid because you go let make our oil over here and then that'd be really silly right we want to probably go this way that way it's closer to our oil so zero is the least amount we could make X we could go directly from oil to shore right 90 gra directly right there that' be the shortest that that'd be probably the best uh way to go if that minimize our cost we're not going to go this way we go straight down so0 is the least we could have for X but it could be zero what's the greatest we could have for X yeah you're not going to do this you're go oh let's go way fast and come back that' be pretty stupid as well right you you maximize cost prob well maximize cost of your everywhere but you go way past and you come back that'd be silly so we could have eight you all agree that X has a minimum of zero and a maximum a well what that does for us that gives us some inherent constraints that gives us some end points what this says right here is that if we have end points which we do 0 and 8 and we find a critical number it one of those points is going to minimize our cost for us it's either going to be at 0 8 or somewhere in between there if if a critical number exists do you follow okay so at least we have our constraints down now let's talk about the formula here's how you come up with a formula for the cost I didn't start with this last time but I'd like to show this to you to find out your cost you really just have to identify the pieces of your puzzle the pieces of your picture in this case you right I to have some some pipe at C so the cost of the pipe at C plus the cost of the pipe on land well since we know how much it cost per kilometer let's just figure out the kilometers so the pipe on the land we just talked about this with the pipe on the land is from P to B that's our 8 - x so if we know that the distance of pipe is 8 - x and it costs a half a dollar per kilometer this is this is how many kilometers we're going to have of land pipe we're just going to take half of that and that's going to be the number of dollars we're going to spend for the pipe on the land you okay with this so far that's going to be added to the pipe at C now we just figured out how much pipe we have at C it's aunk x^2 + 25 that's how many kilometers of pipe we're going to have under the sea or or at the sea in the sea each of those kilometers cost a doll so if I multiply a dollar times each of those kilometers I'll have the total cost for the pipe at C and that's how you figure out the cost function in terms of X the distance that you're looking for orig if feel okay with that so far I think that's where we we actually left off last time now what do you want to do what do we want to do with this maybe before we take the derivative make it look a little bit better right probably distribute that half into that 8 - x because you don't want start doing with derivatives until it looks kind of pretty deal with that one up front that looks nasty so does not to do anything but it looks silly 1 * anything is anything so the < TK of x^2 + 25 plus this is going to give you 4 - x 2 or 12 x if you prefer still okaye so far now that's our cost function and that's what we're trying to minimize maybe do one more thing with that square root what would you change the square root into to the 1/2 not negative 1/2 right not -2 but you the 1/2 if that's the function we're trying to minimize here's what you know about Maxima and Minima absolute value or I'm sorry absolute maximum absolute minimum you know that they occur at end points or critical numbers we know that for a fact right it's only thing that happen with continuous functions and that's continuous on the interval so it's either going to be at end points or critical numbers we have our end points which we'll check in a while we don't have critical numbers how do you find critical numbers that's where the calculus comes in for maximizing things or minimizing things it says you find out where the critical numbers are those are the only places besides end points where you could possibly have an absolute Max or an absolute Min in our case do you follow me go ahead and take the first derivative there what type of rule do you need to apply to take the first derivative here General okay did you get that far what key piece of information have I left out so far the exponent exponent don't forget the exponent you're subtracting one right you're not subtracting 1/2 you're subtracting one so if I take 1/2 minus one I I need to be getting that negative one2 did you get that as well okay then derivative of the inside we know that because that is a general power rule how about the four zero how about this oh good okay so not another product rule anything crazy you just take the derivative of that little piece that's 12 now this is going to equal 12 x^2 + 25 to the -2 times derivative 2us 12 now I know I Get Crazy on You guys about parentheses I know I do should you have parentheses around this no no if this had all been in then yes you would have but you don't this is-2 at the very end you follow me on that in this case that says that this 1/2 and this two that is something that you can simplify out does that make sense I'll show you in two steps this will be 2x over 2 < TK x^2 + 25 true statement - 12 yes no and then the twos are gone so the first derivative of our cost function which we're trying to minimize in this case is X x^2 + 25- 12 that looks fairly nasty enough what are you supposed to do with that thing that's our first derivative what is the first derivative stand for slope okay what do we do with that can you explain why I know we talked about a lot can you explain why we have to set our first derivative equal to zero why do we do that your max going to be wherever the slope is zero very good so we know that maximum Absol what he said was absolute maximum absolute minimum have to be at one of a couple places first end points could happen but if they don't happen at end points they will happen where we change from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing in either case the slope will be zero at that point so if we set our slope equal to zero that will solve for the only points where we could possibly change from going up to going down or going down to going up does that make sense that's why we said equals zero so let's do that oh goodness uh what now cry give up go on spring break let's just leave no seriously what do you do no conjugate probably add one half why add one2 well you actually have something nice here kind of nice little bit nice not super nice a little bit nice do you see what you have here you have fraction equal to fraction right that's called a starts with a P runs with or proportion proportion proportion what do you do with proportions oh dear me yeah you press multiply that's fine that's great press multiply them go dot dot dot dot dot dot you're going to have 2X equal 1 time the < TK of 25 x^2 + 25 that looks a lot better why does it look a lot better you have a square root isolated get rid of a square root how do you do itare square both sides so let's Square both sides don't forget that when you square both sides you're not just squaring the X you're squaring the 2x do you follow me Square Square gone 4x^2 = x^2 + 25 nothing changes no distribution X the the square and the square root those are gone they're inverse oper they're inverse exponents in fact if you think about it it's actually 1/2 to the second power right you multiply exponents when they're being raised to each other that means 2 * 1 12 is 1 so it just disappears it's great what now solve for x so I would probably subtract the x s from both sides since there's not an X term this is nicer this is 3x2 equals 25 you with me there's no nasty factoring to be done nothing like that get rid of the three how do you get rid of the three when there's not an X term this is the way you deal with quadratic you just solve it for the X squ and take a square root of both sides if there was an X term you'd have to use quadratic formula or you'd have to factor it or complete the square but when there's no X term no just x to the first Power term this is nice divide 3 you get x2 = 25 over three get rid of the square sorry what does that again Square so Square both sides what do you need when you square root both sides yeah you you have to show that so you get the square < TK of 25 over 3 plus or minus of course that's going to be plus or minus 5 over < tk3 if you rationalize multiply by roo3 over root3 you know what rationalization is right you're going to get 53 over 3 tell me something about one of these numbers say again why why is the negative not an answer it's not in there it's not in there at all this is actually negative that would be this case that'd be going this way we don't want to go that way okay so we're not going to take the negative so our only critical Number 533 now do you automatically know that that's going to minimize our cost not really you do have to check it okay so what if we what if we did this derivative and that actually was not this it could very well be this couldn't it what if we did that we would have just maximized our cost now intuitively we probably think that this is going to be a minimum because we're we're kind of thinking this is really expensive this is the longest distance so it's probably somewhere in between there but you have to check I mean people have made some serious Mistakes by taking a derivative and not checking whether they had the minimum or the maximum with simple formulas like this you can think about it but Advanced formulas oh man you got to check the way you check is either with a second derivative right either that and that would test concavity for you and say oh okay take take that point in the second derivative uh if it's negative that's a maximum it's positive that's a minimum does that make sense because that will tell you concavity or you do the analysis that I showed you how to do you make your first derivative test you say increasing decreasing increasing and that's going to give you what type of Maximum you have or you check end points on these intervals so that's like three different ways you can check we know that all of our possible Max and mints have to occur here here or there that's it so if we plug in those three values one of them will give us a minimum so I'm going to go back over here we're going to check these points by the way when we're checking points like this are we using the first derivative are we using the original function where I'm checking abs like absolute Max and Min what am I checking the original one yeah because that's telling us actually the the cost the actual cost there so I'm looking here right there are we plugging in zero or we plugging in eight or one of them can you help me out with that Zer is nine so this is X a is 9.43 and this is our cost right so zero would give us a cost of $9 $9 now if this is a billion actually a billion instead of like one that's $9 billion I don't know how much it is how about eight what you say eight3 okay how about 53 over3 I don't know 53 3 is we have it written down how many you got 8.33 1 two 3 four yes yes and you all sure you're right I love it 8.33 did we find the minimum what is the minimum good okay the minimum the minimum isn't 53 over3 that's not what the minimum is the minimum cost is actually $833 the maximum cost would have been $943 right this nine but it's intermediate but it's definitely not the the minimum or the maximum so our minimum actually occurs when xal 533 how much is 5un over3 about 2 866 yeah so about 2.9 km so here's what this says if you're the one building this Pipeline and your boss says look I got to have you minimize the cost what you could do right that's kind of a realistic example if you had to actually do this you could do it with this right you easily do it all you need is the cost now that's not going to be a dollar but even if it was like $1.38 million per kilometer at se you can do it cost there you could do it you'd say okay boss whoever you are uh we're going to go from point A which is directly perpendicular to from the land to our oil you're going to go 2.9 km and that's where you're going to draw the line and you say you're going to make your oil line from there to there exactly from there to there make your land line from here to here have two people start working meet at the middle and that way you save the most money does that make sense we definitely don't just want to guess this right here if x is zero if x is zero you got n $9 doesn't seem like a whole lot of lot you're like oh that's only what 67 cents but if this is in billions that's $670 million if I did my math right it's a lot of money okay you you definitely don't want to have eight oh my gosh you did eight that's that's the worst the worst you could do is go directly from there to there that's the worst unless you couldn't buy all this land and then maybe you'd have to but that would be a different constraint how many people understand our example here today good we're going to do one more we're going to talk about um minimizing material so this is more of a geometric approach this I this had a little bit of geometry in it but it's only Pythagorean theorem this is actually kind of a a Economist or maybe a business approach this one's definitely going to be like um I don't want to say engineering because you're not doing any engineering uh but but dealing with more of a geometric figure okay so let's suppose that you're in the business of bottling Coca-Cola or some sort of cola and you want to come up with a can that holds the most amount of soda for the least amount of material right so when you see a can typically we design cans that that fit in your hand being they're easy to drink right but it's probably not the most honestly economical way that you could package something it's it's it's actually a little bit too long we want we'd have to have something more squat to save ourselves some material do you follow would you want to make a can that's like this round and this big drink my soda no probably not or unless you go to the Yard House you're probably not going to make a can that's this tall and that skinny right have you ever been to the Yard House yeah you know what I'm talking about that that beer that's this big it's a yard this big this big it' be like two yards but he go like that okay you're not going to do that if you want to say if you if you want to if you want to look cool then yeah of course but if you want to save money like with bottling you're not going to do that that'd be stupid so let's talk about we want to bottle 1,000 cubic cm not bottle I guess can we want a can 1,000 cubic cm how much is 1,000 cubic cm someone who's in science sciencey people is that a liter is it close to that is a liter right cubic centimeter is a milliliter is that true oh that's right we're doing right so we want to basically can a leader a or beer if you like beer a beer can I don't care make it excited to you we want to minimize the material needed to make that happen well you know what we better start with the picture just like always with these problems so let's start with a cold cam cool hey what are the dimensions of a can that you need to know what shape is a can so it's cylindrical what dimensions do you need R the height yeah is circular in nature if you're looking down the top of it so yeah definitely have to have something to do with the radius also have to do with the height for sure so let's uh let's go ahead and do this R is the radius H is the height and let's do this let's call S the surface area you follow because the surface area is the amount of aluminum or whatever you're going to make you can out of hopefully probably Al aluminum uh that you're going to need do you follow me on that so surface area would be the faces the top the bottom and the side of our cylinder there's also one more thing we have we have the V the volume now before we begin let me ask you something what are we trying to minimize here are we trying to minimize the volume are we trying to minimize the radius the height or the surface area surface that's the question is asking you it says minimize the material the material is the surface area not the volume the volume is actually constant do you see that that's the 1,000 that's not going to change we have to have it hold a liter full of soda because if it doesn't you're going to have in the in your Mills or your is it a mill a soda Mill we're get soda plant I don't know what they call it but they they they're going to fill full soda with a liter it's going either overflow or it's going to be way too too small in there so we want it to hold exactly a liter let talk about our formulas and we'll talk about any constraints we have let's do the formula first uh the formula if we're trying to figure out the the surface area for this thing note that what we really have have you ever thought about what a cylinder is have you ever cut a Pepsi can part I am cuz I'm I maybe you guys are interested to see what it actually looks like it really is just a rectangle with two circles on the top and bottom right so if you did this you take your rectangular piece of paper and you just fold it around and got this hold it around very well you got the cylinder and you just close it in with two circles you basically have a can follow so what this really looks like if I were to disassemble this and make the individual figures I've got the body of my cylinder I've got a circle and I've got a circle up and put the lids on that's that's your can so let's think about the surface area of this thing what's the distance from here to here r r is it the same r as this of course is this the same r as that it's a cylinder how far is it from here to here okay now now here's an interesting one this the weird one because we need to know that two right what's that circumference yeah that's the circumference of the circle it has to wrap around the circle right so whatever this is that's got to wrap all the way around it that's 2 pi r you okay with this so far welcome back to geometry geometry yeah actually some calculus is calculus and analytical geometry which this would probably take part of that uh but anyway do you see the figures that we have we get two of these Circle guys that are exactly the same we've got a rectangle that's 2 pi r long that's a weird way to think of a rectangle isn't it rectangle is 2 pi r long and it's h high so let's think of the formula for a surface area it's got to include two tops plus one let's call it the body do you follow that two tops two * now the top what's the we're talking about area right the area of these figures because surface area is what what we need here so what's the area of one of the tops R that's a circle yeah p r s so would you agree that the two tops together are 2 * the PK R 2 PK R squ gives you an area of a circle we have two of those circles therefore we have 2 * the p r squ yes add to it the the area of the body remember this is surface area surface area here what's the area of our our rectangle how do you find the area of a rectangle uh okay so 2i R * the H is exactly right feel okay with this so far you sure how many people do feel just fine with that it takes some work to really think about that doesn't it and of course I can't give you an example for every one that you're going to have but the idea of going through is the same draw a picture come with a formula come with some constraints now we're done with a formula that looks great to me almost great we we have too many variables we only we can only have one variable for this but we're going to have to use a constraint to make that work so the constraint what is the constraint sure something has to do with 1,00 cubic cenm what has to do with th000 Cub CM not the surface area the surface area is the material that we need we know nothing about the surface area Okay notice that you can make the surface area an infinite number of possibilities and still come up with a liter of col up like I said you could have you could have this as your can which holds a liter right that would be stupid but you could do it you could have this as your can which holds a liter but we want something that's going to minimize the surface area but still hold a liter the constraint is holds a liter holds 1,000 cubic cm you follow me so we need to come up with a volume we we also need that volume to equal 1,000 cubic cm does anyone know off the top of their head the volume of a cylinder it's not hard to figure out if you think about it P R pi r squ times the height circles stacked up on top of each other yeah very good and we said the volume had to be what now so if our volume is pqu which is the volume of the cylinder then we have 1,000k r^ 2 in do you feel okay with the surface area yes do you feel okay with the volume Y which one are we trying to minimize again the the volume or the surface area surface area so this is not what we're going to take a derivative of we're going to use this as our tool we're going to use this to solve for a variable plug it into here and take the derivative of this one because this right here is the thing that's going to give us our Max or men you right what variable do you want to solve for you want to solve for r or you want to solve for h h h most definitely H that's much easier to solve for if you solve for R you taking square roots plugging those things in over there they'd be kind of nasty right so probably solve for the h how do you solve this for H so if we do that we get the surface area that we're trying to minimize 2 pi r 2 we like that 2i R * H but H is now 1,00 overk R 2 feel right with this so far do you see why we need that substitution otherwise we're not going to be able to take a derivative uh at least not without using implicit and that'll be very difficult because we don't have a rate of change and implicit is not it's not with respect to time at all right so we can't use that stuff you're thinking why don't we do that it's not with respect to time this is not changing okay this is we want to figure out the minimum surface area here it's not a related rates of problem at all so here well we had to change it to one variable we only know how to take derivatives with one variable so we have the s = 2i r 2 plus what's this going to give you great 2000 I see that Pi's gone over R still all right probably do one more thing what are we going to have to do next what's the the next ideative it's a derivative now our constraint didn't come up with any end points you see that we didn't have any we can make the dimensions any way we want so we're really going to have to have to take a derivative to find out the maximum in here if if we have one so we're going to go ahead and take a derivative but before we take a derivative you might want to move what yeah shoot let's take our derivative well that's going to do is giv us our slope we know that absolute maximum and minimum if they're going to occur here they're going to occur at a critical number where we're we're changing from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing what' you getus 2000 what r r to the l two okay good I like what Michael say said put it over R squ maybe a little bit easier to think about right what are you going to do with that now that's your first R what do you do let's do that what now for got solve for R somehow probably a good way to go about it multiply both sides by r s need oh no no I'm sorry you know what I left I left out a step um I added that I did it all in my head I'm sorry it made sense to me okay so set it equal to zero add that over that way you have different sides of nothing you really do at this point maybe now multiply both sides by R 2 that way you're going to have R cub and maybe divide both sides by four Pi do you see what I'm talking about so that ultimately you're going to get you're going to get this multiply both sides by R 2 you get the r Cub divide by 4 pi and you get 2 4 Pi simplify a little bit what's 2,000 / 4 so then R Cub 500 Pi I'm not really interested in r how do you get rid of the cube take a cube of both sides that's great great idea if you're looking for an exact answer it's the cube root of 500 over Pi now if you work at pepsicola and they say what radius do we need and you go cube of 500 over Pi seriously can you please tell me what radius I need here and you're going to go say what now 23 really can you try it one more time that's 5.42 500 ID Pi take a cube root of that you're going to get the 5.4 5.42 what what is it not cubic that would be a volume this is a distance notice notice what you did you took a cube root right took a cube root that has cubic centimeters that would be centimet not inches oh goodness made that inch that's a huge can pull it it's like rers that's bigger than that 5.42 CM divide that by 2.54 and you get the inches right so you can figure that out if you really wanted to but that would be 5.42 CM roughly can you tell me how you would find your height out it's already Sol for H you plug it in believe you're going to get 10.8 you try that he's Tau this less before 10. 10.8 what 10. no 10 isn't it like 10.84 10.83 yeah it's it's twice the radius no it's exactly twice the radius is interesting think about it what this is weird but what maximizes volume of a c of a a rectangular prism prism if it's a cube right that's the least amount of surface area maximum amount of volume a cylinder if you had it the height as twice the radius think about what that says the radius is this distance that means it would be the height times the height that would basically be kind of a cylindrical version of the cube did you see that that's interesting kind of weird you can prove that it is twice the the the height is twice the radius if you do that what I want to do is more more calculus we have no way of verifying that this is actually a minimum or maximum right now right you're just guessing what if you accidentally minimize you didn't what if you what if you maximize the sary this is minimized but how you do it just go ahead take another derivative here that's going to be 4 Pi 6,000 over RB did you follow me yes no are you with me that that's a second derivative what does second derivative give you okay so plug in the r that you have now remember we're not worried about the actual number we're whe worried about whether this is positive or negative so think about this if I plug in 5.42 it will give me a concavity true it will either tell me concave up or concave down it won't be in most likely it won't be in inflection point um so if this is 5.42 5.42 cu is I don't care but it's positive 6,000 over a positive is a positive add things together this doesn't change right 4 Pi is positive positive plus a positive is a POS would you agree that at Ral 5.42 this is concave what is it because this is greater than zero so if we're concave up if we're concave up and this is the point where we change uh increas and decreasing or decreas which we actually didn't check that would have to be this point right that have to be that point so is that an absolute minimum for us for this range yes yeah that's a minimum we just minimized the surface area and you proved it the other way you prove this is you put this on your first derivative and you check two points one to the left and one to the right you check like um something like five and six and you say oh it's decreasing then it's increasing that's got to be a minimum that's other way you can check it how people feel okay with our good okay yeah my bad this actually should be a 4,000 not a 6,000 as previously on the video um I accidentally multiply by a three instead of a two so the -2 * the -2000 that's what's giving you the 4,000
