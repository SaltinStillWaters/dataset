Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 1.4:  Continuity of Functions
continuity here's the layman's term definition of continuity a function is continuous if it has no holes breaks or ASM tootes that's pretty much it if you can graph it by not picking your pencil off the paper you would say it's continuous so that that's what we're talking about so um continuity says curves continuous if it doesn't have any holes or breaks or Asm tootes now would you like me to give you a more precise definition than that holes brakes and astes yes that's understandable right though hopefully it doesn't have any holes in it it doesn't have a gap and it doesn't have any ASM tootes in it that if you don't have those things then it's continuous everywhere if you do have those things it' be continuous most places just not at those specific points here's what continuity is mathematically though so more specifically a function is continuous if three things happen first oh sorry you know what and let me say uh at a point I need to add that on there otherwise it's not going to really make a lot of sense so continuous at a point C if so continuous at Point C if firstly I hope this makes sense to you firstly if the function is defined at that point this has to exist how can you have continuity if the point doesn't exist does that make sense to you so it's it we' say it's continuous at some point C if you can plug in C and you get out a point that's what that says in English so if F of C is defined you plug in C you get out a point that's what that means number two number two the limit has to exist at that point so that means that the function is from the both from both sides around Point C remember Point C is like your input right around Point C the function is going no matter what to the same spot does that make sense it can't go like this that wouldn't be continuous because you have that jump you with me so the limit has to exist and around that point C so not only does c have to be fine have to Define the limit of FX as X approaches C must exist and thirdly this thing has to equal this thing so f a function f is continuous at Point a or at Point C if three things happen firstly the point exists what this means again last time is if you plug in C you get something out secondly the limit exists that means the function is going to the same place from left to right as you approach C thirdly where you approach is this point that's what that says where you approach is that point so it means the function's going to a point the point exists and it's right between where the the functions okay that's that's what that says if that happens what that means is you're going along a function you to a point you fill in the point you keep on going make sense so there's no hole there there's no ASM toote um and that that also works for ASM tootes right even the limit existed in Infinity there's no point at Infinity saying you would have a break you can't make that little jump let me give you some pictorial examples on on what this looks like you ready for it so let's try to apply this the question I'm going ask you to to this over here where I told you about continuity so number one uh does the point exist at xal C is there a point there so already we fail number one that right there says you're not going to be continuous because you fail number one uh is number two satisfied though does the limit exist yes it's going to the same value from left to right so limit's there but when you ask this question is the limit equal to the function value no because it's there's a hole it's not even there so there is no point number one fails and therefore number three fails this is not continuous so we'd say it's not continuous wait all over the place is it not continuous all over the place at C is it continuous here absolutely actually most of this function is continuous it's just that little Point that's not continuous what this is called when you have a hole remember talking about holes it's called a removable discontinuity so this is not continuous at C and we call it a removable discontinuity what that basically says is you have a hole a removable discontinuity is a discontinuity that you could fill in with a single point let's try another one let's check our three Necessities for our limit to for our function to be continuous at a point C firstly is number one satisfied do we have a point at C yes yes we do is number two satisfied does a limit exist no limit exist says we're going to the same spot it means it has to look like this together does it look like that it looks like this right that's a problem so does this side meet up with this side if it doesn't then the limit doesn't exist so is number two satisfied no if number two is not satisfied number three can't possibly be satisfied because this is non-existent so this fails continuity so we'd say yeah this is not continuous at C for sure it's not continuous uh but is it a removable discontinuity or not no even if I put another point up there it's not going to make a difference right not going to be able to continue my function with one single point this one I could just put it right there you you're good to go it's like a fill in the hole but here you can't do that this is not removable this is like a jump continuity you're jumping from point to point or from one part of the function to another jumpity or I don't know what if they call it a jump continuity book it might but that's what you're you're doing is you're jumping so we'll say that's a jump discontinuity this one's removable discontinuity how about this one let's check our three statements number one is the function defined at Point C is the function defined at Point C really defined you can plug in C and get a point no no what if I did this I said okay there is the function defined at Point C yes yes it is now there is a point you plug in C you get that specific point you with me does the limit ex so number one is satisfied is number two satisfied does the limit exist are you going to the same spot from left to right going to Infinity yes limit exists so number one is satisfied and number two is satisfied would you agree with that this is why we need number three is number three satisfied does the limit equal the value of the function the limit equals infinity the value of the function equals this right here are those the same thing so number three fails so we've had a case where number one fails we're number two fails and now we're number three fails so you see those those those examples yes this is called an infinite discontinuity so we'll say this is at infinity or infinite hey what about this one what if I put a point if I if I put a point up here but it didn't close in the circle would that be continuous at that point no it would still jump that's still removable discontinuity though if I redefine the point so if I say okay you know what I'm just going to move this point from here to here redefine it that we'd say that's still a removable discontinuity how many people understand the different terms that we we have here so basically we have three different uh kinds of discontinuities those that have asmp tootes those that are are jumps and those that are holes we mostly deal with these two this one would be like a pie wise function we we are mostly over here when we're dealing with rational functions uh that's usually we have stuff we can cross out what we have that so we can cross uh where we get rid of the the problem in our limit and stuff that we can't cross out where we do a sign analysis test I've showed you both of those things before do you remember them all right shall we check let's check some functions to see if we can tell whether they're continuous or not are there any questions about our our Necessities for continuity here or these graphs over here okay yes when you said that when you had the point on the first one sure uh below the hole yeah and you said you could move it up to the hole in this we'd have to well not move it up to the hole we're redefining we're saying this would be a piecewise function right now or some very special function we redefine this in some way so that this is no longer here but it fits in that hole that's called the removal discontinuity we've removed this point and placed it in the hole basically we've re defined it somehow but keep in mind you are redefining your function just a little bit okay so we're going to ask are these following functions continuous at x = 2 [Applause] oops let's see so first one how about f ofx is that continuous at xals 2 basically can you is it defined at xal 2 is what you would check first is it defined at xal 2 can you plug in two and get something out so that would fail this is not continuous in fact if you remember we I think we've had this problem one very very similar to it what this is by the way uh can you determine whether that's a whole or ASM toote could you figure that out why is it a hole it does yeah this is X+ 2x - 2 so your function is really x + 2 do you see where the X plus 2 is coming from use your difference of squares cross out your x - 2 you're going to get x + 2 that's really what this function is it well at least that's what it looks like is x + 2 only when I plug in two so if I cross those out I'd say well yes FX = x + 2 but I hope you remember what I told you about domain domain has to be from the original function not your brand new function remember what we talked about that so X can't be defined a two we tried that up here it didn't work what this says is if I were able to plug in two if if I were able to plug in two how much would I get out of it four four now am I able to plug in two so what that says is if I were able to plug in two and I got out four I have a ho at 2 comma 4 can you make that jump you okay with that idea that says all right normally I would be this function but I know I can't plug in two that means I can't get out the number four I can't get out that value just to re force a concept would this be continuous at xal 1 how about xal 5 how about any other point besides two absolutely we're just talking about two right now now let's move over to the next function and these look confusing but here's all this says this says for everywhere except two you're now this thing we we have that here but now at two I have a three so let's check the continuity now is number one satisf is the function uh is the function defined at my point xal 2 absolutely it's right here that's that's the definition uh is does the limit exist Does the limit exist yes the limit exists the limit exists but now this point is three so when I go over two it says I'm at three that's what this one is right now so it says is the is the function defined at the point absolutely does the limit exist for my function around that point yes it does is the limit equal to the function value so is this one continuous no no everywhere else yes but not here so no no that be a jump or this would be a removable discontinuity I'm going to show you why right now okay so firstly we try to point right we have this function and we have this hole in it so if I cover that up this is my original f ofx true I tried to plug in a point did I make it fit right no it doesn't fit right let's try the next one h of X says okay now it looks almost identical to G of X except instead of having it xal 2 to find at 3 we have x = 2 defined at four tell me does the four fill in the hole yes so by making a piecewise function and Def finding just one single point we go oh well how about this is the function defined at that point yes it is does the limit exist at that point yes it does is the function equal to the Limit yes that means all three qualifications for having continuity of that point therefore we say yes that's a removable discontinuity means you you identify one point that fills in the hole okay if a function is continuous at each point between a certain interval like a B we can say it is continuous on the interval a so let's say if f is continuous at every point between a and b then f is continuous on a the open interval if F's continuous at every point that means like like over here between this range of numbers it's continuous at every single point right there's no jumps there's no holes there's no ASM tootes it is continuous we'd say it's it's continuous on the open interval the question I have is what about the end points and we're going to look at that right now so what would happen because right now this is open right it's not including the A and the B how can we determine whether or not to include those end points with brackets or or whether we can't and we'll look at that just Bri so F's continuous every Point okay we have f is continuous on the interval a but what about the end points and let's say this is our function hey would you say this function is continuous between A and B without including the end points for sure at every single point there there's nothing wrong with it now would you say it's continuous at the point B yeah the point's there right the point's there now we don't have have here here's a weird thing we don't have a full-on limit because we don't even have one side however the one-sided limit from the left goes to the same value that the point B is defined at does that make sense to you so it's going to the point and the point exists you with me how about the left hand side does the limit I'm sorry is it continuous at the point a at the point a the limit exists from the right sure the point exists but is the limit equal to the point then no this would be kind of like a jump right if I if I had this going this way that would be like a jump continuity you have that that point that's not there uh now it's that doesn't have that other side so we'd say this is continuous on how would we write that if it's continuous from A to B But it includes B and not a how how do I write that one bracket one parentheses sure so this is continuous on I know it goes from A to B again Does it include the B the B the B yes because the points there the limits there equals the same thing how do I show that is that the bracket or the parenthesis that's the bracket that says I include the point B now it can't include the point a because the limit exists from one side uhhuh the point is there sure but it's not the same in general here's what you have I'll give you more math mathematical definition of this in general here's what has to happen if it's it has to be continuous from the left at Point C or continuous from the right at Point C so for continuity from the left you'd have the limit as X approaches C from the left of f ofx pass to equal half of C that's very very similar to the third qualification for continuity that we just had only this time it's a one-side limit so basically we're just checking one side limits and making sure they they go to the the point that is defined and that the point is actually defined this is like the situation we have at point B okay the limit from the left exists the function at C in this case that's B okay the limit at the uh the function at the point exists and they are equal this is like the situation for point [Music] B like point B for being continuous to the other end point from the right at Point C well it's just opposite limit you have to have the limit from the right hand side the function has to be defined at that point and it's got to be the same this is like f of a the limit has to exist it does the point has to be defined it is but they would have to be identical so this is like the the point a situation in our case it's not continuous at the point a would you like to see an example on how to prove this with a closed interval okay I'll I'll show you how to do this it's a three-part it's not hard okay it's just three-part proof what we're going to do is we're going to prove continuity for an open interval which is relatively easy we're going to prove continuity for the left and the right intervals which are both relatively easy so we have basically three limits to do we we've got a pro continuity in the middle then Pro continuity at the end points so I'll write the question on the board and then we'll we'll go for that so I want to prove that this function is continous this on -4 to 4 inclusive Clos interval this again involves three parts the first step we've got to check the open interval got to check the open interval the next step is going to be check the right end point the next step is going to be check the left end point so I'll write these out and we we'll start here next time so the right end point would be pos4 from the left the left end point would be -4 from the right you going from the right on that we'll figure out how to do this next time I'll show you each little piece of this and we'll determine that it is in fact continuous from4 to 4 inclusively all right so hopefully you remember from last time we were working on this problem we want to prove that that particular function is continuous on a closed interval now in order to to figure out if a function is continuous on a closed interval we have to basically check three things we've got to check first the open interval to see if there's any holes or Asm tootes on that open interval the end points a little different though because when we check continuity we're really checking limits right right so we're checking limits and at an end point a fullon limit does not exist because there is no function coming from the left or or maybe the right hand side at a certain case so what we do at our end points is we check a one side limit so what that means is that sure we can check the limit on an open interval just fine because there's always a point to the right that means that we can always find the limit of that however when we talk about end points we've got to check oneid limits and just see if they they match up now it's not a hard thing so so don't think it's going to be super super hard it's just you have to do in three points to actually prove it right on that I'll show you how to do it you'll see it it's not really a hard hard thing to do uh first thing we're going to do is check the open interval -44 so we're going to check this thing to say that that okay at least we know we're continuous from this point to this point but not inclusively then we'll have to check the end point4 and we'll check the end point positive4 if we're going to check I want you to understand the notation here if we're going to check -4 understand that4 we're going to have to be coming from the right to check that do you understand that CU from the left nothing exists over here so we have to be coming from the right does that make sense for positive 4 that's over here we're going to have to be coming from the left that's where this from the left and from the right are coming from there is nothing to check over here it's from the left hand side there's we're saying the function we don't care about the other side of that do you understand the notation for our limits all right so let's do the open interval I'll show you how to do this it's really just a a very very basic Point uh proof here's how you start out what we want to prove is that the limit of f ofx equals F of C as X approaches C that's what we want if we can show that then we' prove that the limit exists the function exists and they equal each other that will prove the whole thing that that will be the three cases for continuity or the three points for continuity the limit exists the function exists and they equal each other you with me on that so let's do that what we're going to do is start here and try to work away to there so the limit as X approaches C of f ofx is really the same thing as the limit as X approaches C of the < TK of 16 - x^2 are you okay with that so far now given that c is some point between -4 and 4 given that c is some point between -4 and 4 can we plug in C and be okay what do you think let's say C was five would that be okay you'd have a negative inside your square root right that would be a problem but because C is between -4 and 4 are we going to have a negative inside of our square root okay so what we can say is that if C's between 4 and 4 for any c then this is possible here's where you make the jump if there's not going to be any issues in your specified open interval open domain then you can make the jump and say okay we can actually evaluate that limit at any point C do you believe me if I gave you any point between -4 and 4 could you plug it in and be okay absolutely here's what that says it says if Mr Leonard gives me any point I can plug it in and be okay where did the C come from it's not a trick question where the C come from yeah where's X approaching and you know for fact that C's between these numbers right that's what I'm I'm telling you here and you just told me that no matter what I gave you between there IE C no matter what I gave you you could plug it in right that's what you're saying here you're saying the limit is okay to evaluate because this is between those numbers I have no problem now check this out is this not F of C isn't that just F evaluated at C you've just proved it we've just proved that the limit of f of x as X C equals F of C we proved that that's checked for that that's all you got to do just make sure you take that plug in the C and see that it's exactly the same you okay with that one so far I hope so it's not you might think well that's kind of trivial it's really not trivial I mean we're we're actually thinking whether this Point's in there sure we're thinking whether it's going to have any problems it doesn't therefore we can take any c plug it in and that is f of C that's what we're trying to prove we're trying to get to this point so that does it for us now as far as the one side limits go as far as that goes if we're going to the right oh sorry from the right to4 we're getting really really really close to4 would it be okay if I just plugged in4 is what 16 4 s is that okay can you get a zero inside of the square root is that acceptable then yeah that that's a one side limit that's going to exist as well so this well this is going to equal zero that's equal zero you're going to plug well I I can show you extra step one you said it's okay to even evaluate that at four it exists the limit is going to exist one-sidedly from from the right that's the same thing as saying oh well that's 16 of negative sorry minus -42 that equals 0 which equals F of -4 because you're just plugging it in that's also saying the limit as X approaches a certain number in this case an end point is equal to the function's value at that point that's another check we can do exactly the same thing for four to the right if you plug in positive4 is that going to have an issue over here no that means that as we get closer and closer to positive4 this function is getting closer and closer to zero true so we can plug that that the one side limit is going to exist it says it's going to that value so this would be well < TK 16 - 4^ 2 which is zero which is exactly F of 4 that's what you're trying to prove you're trying to prove that I can plug in any number that's what that says and it equals the function at that value says I can plug in the end point look it this is what this says I can plug in the end point and it gives me f of when I plug in the end point that's all I'm saying I can plug in the end point and it gives me f of when I can plug in the end point what this says in general is okay the limits exist in all cases one-sidedly and in general and the limits equal the functions at every single value if that happens you're continuous the whole way through not just on the open interval but now on the closed interval because you included end points and that's how you check it did that make sense to you were you able to follow that it might seem a little confused why why did we do this well you kind of have to do it that way you have to check a one- side limit because you can't technically do this for the whole thing because you don't have um you don't have a limit at every single point a fullon limit from both sides at every point you have it here but you don't have it here that's the difference that's why you have to check the ends now a couple properties about limits that we're going to discuss were there any questions on that by the way as my back is turned to you so I can't see you raise your hand any questions seriously all right then a couple properties let's say that we got two functions f and g and both are continuous um at a certain point if f and g are continuous at a certain point point then all of the following statements are true firstly if f and g are both continuous f+ G must also be continuous F minus G must also be continuous f * G is continuous at that point at that specific point so s continuous and G is continuous at a certain point then we can do f plus g f minus G and F * G and they're all continuous at that exact same point does that make sense to you where it wouldn't be the case is let's say that F was continuous but g wasn't continuous at a certain point if you add them well then G's still not continuous there right no matter what you do so that wouldn't work the other one is well you probably we figured out but F over G now I'll say this F overg is continuous at C unless what happens G sure G of C actually G of c g of because we're talking about at the point C right if G of C equals zero if the if C uh when you when you take the limit uh of G and as you're approaching C if that goes to zero well then you're dividing by zero and you can't have that so it is continuous at C unless G of C equals z and then you'd have a problem if it does because we're going to see this in just a moment if G of C does equal zero what does that tell you about your your function firstly is it continuous secondly there are two oh I hope you I hope you remember this there were two cases when you divided by zero there was two cases of what you could have name one AO or ASM tote so if G ofc does equal zero there is a discontinuity at C there's discontinuity at C of course we're speaking just of this though okay F would be continuous and G would be continuous F over G there would be discontinuity at C for f over G for that U division of those two functions are you guys okay with that that all these are okay except for this one and if this is the case if G of C does equal zero then we have a discontinuity and that's either a whole or an asmt you remember that I'm going to actually Define that for you later and give you the the notes on that we've just kind of spoken about it I wanted to preview it so that way when you got here it's like oh yeah that's easy talk about that so it's going to be very easy in just a moment you're like yes I get this because we already talked about it but before I do that I do have to talk about one more thing it's going to be kind of interesting to you Scott so just a recap um it wasn't on this right no oh good CU this is if zero if it's zero over zero and it's an asmt no no we're going to talk about that right now okay well not right now we're going to talk about about that in uh three and a half minutes roughly not roughly exactly okay do you remember that if a function is continuous at any point C I hope you remember because we just talked about it if a function is continuous at C here's what we know the limit of the function as X approaches C equals not c c f of C yes does that look familiar to you that was the definition of of continuity right there it said this exists this exists and they equal each other remember that that was number three so this is our defition of continuity if we're continuous at any point C then that has to take place but I want to refresh your memory on something do you remember what could happen for a pol a polom when we first introduced limus I did this I I gave you the properties I work through a specific polom and I say hey can we do this for every polinomial like yeah that's awesome like yeah I know right and you're like yeah that's cool do you remember you remember let me even make it easier make it a c for any any point do you remember what you can do to find the limit of a polinomial does it involve a lot of work just plug it in you just plug it in which means in this case if I'm trying to find the limit of a polinomial so P of X is a poly nomial you just plug it in so what would the limit of a polinomial be as X approaches C what would it be the havec very good oops this is interesting I've just proved something for you in kind of a simple way it's kind of nice do you see that this looks a whole lot like that this was the definition of continuity right this we know we could do for any polinomial true what this says is that every polom is continuous everywhere this is always the case so we just prove that every polom is always continuous isn't that interesting every poal that means everything like uh 3x^2 - 2x + 4 guarantee it's it's continuous it's polinomial as long as it doesn't have square roots because that's not a polinomial negative exponents because that's not a polinomial uh fractional exponents because those are again those are Roots right it's not a polinomial as long just has those those positive exponents to it and there's no fractions it's continuous that's what a polinomial is this says that every polinomial is continuous that's kind of cool so what this says is any polom is continuous anywhere that's very cool big statement every polinomial is contous everywhere if we combine this idea with this idea check it out combine this idea every polinomial is continuous with this idea of this is always going to be continuous provided that g is not zero what that means is that every rational function will be continuous everywhere except where the denominator is equal to zero because a rational function is a polom over polinomial do you buy into that so it says pols are always continuous rational functions are always continuous unless the denominator equals zero that's what these two statements say together so a rational function which is like P of X over Q ofx where these are both pols is continuous everywhere except continues everywhere except where the denominator could be equal to zero in other words where this happens at that point you're going to have a discontinuity that's what we said right if the denominator is equal to zero you will have a discontinuity at that point what I've already told you is that that point will either be a whole or an ASM toote remember that that's the two things we could have so we we're starting to put everything together polins always continuous we just proved it with our limit rational functions always continuous except where this happens because we can know we know that we can take look at that two continuous functions if it's rational that means they're both continuous because it's a polinomial of a polinomial that satisfies that they're both continuous everywhere if you take it this will also be continuous unless the denominator is zero and that's all I'm saying here is except for the denominator equals zero at that point you will have a discontinuity either a ho or an AS asot for that's typically this is 95% of the time what happens holes and asmp tootes now we've we've seen a case where this didn't work okay we already saw that where we had Z over zero if you have Z over Z you can typically Factor well you will always be able to factor uh T well typically unless you're doing like trig function function but if you are dealing with rational okay let's just stick with rational for right now if you have this and it's rational you will be able to factor it you will be able to cross something out that will happen here if it's a rational function I'm not saying square roots I'm not saying uh weird exponents I'm saying polinomial over polinomial you understand the difference there that will happen now does it always take care of every problem no we already saw that that didn't but it's a good place to start if you have this and you cross it out that's typically a hole all right that's typically what happens if you cross it out and you still have this where you have a number over zero a number over zero that says you can't cross it out you're going to have an ASM toote there that's typically what happens here some expression over zero you with me on that one no you said c over Conant that would be the constant some constant oh just any okay some constant because when you evaluate the limit right you plug in a number for it yeah if you have a number over zero it's probably an ASM toote 95% okay every time I don't know 95% that's what happens would you like to try a couple examples yes I'll appr you MTH class have you understood everything we talk about so far think so examples tell us really lost or not I'm thinking probably not what we're going to do with this problem is I want to find any discontinuities tell me what you know about discontinuities with a rational function like this one tell me what you know about discontinuities where do they occurin when the what equals zero the numerator or denominator denominator equals zero so how are we going to find discontinuities for rational functions ex the bottom sure set equal Z that's going to involve some fact absolutely essentially all you're doing is finding domain remember finding domain what we had problems with domain we already really covered this when you cover domain you basically cover where your function is not continuous we're just doing it for real now talking about continuity so you've already basically done that if you set your denominator not equal to zero and solve it down you're going to find out those points that you cannot have so uh what however you choose to do that you need to find your discontinuity so if we set our denominator equal to zero what that's going to tell you is where you are not continuous at the points at which you are not continuous how about that it's better English better English can you factor that jeez I sure hope so really do did you get two and3 as well now I want you to go one step further I want you to identify whether those things are holes whether those things are ASM tootes and here's the way you can do that Factor both the numerator and denominator as much as you can right or plug in why don't you plug in the number uh plug in plug in one of those numbers and see what you get you can do it that way too but if you factor as much as you can what you're going to get is x + 2 x - 2 all over x + 3 x - 2 you with me on that one okay now you need to get both disc all the discontinuities first before you start Crossing stuff out are you ever going to be able to cross out a discontinuity and just eliminate the discontinuity we learned that from domain right you can't ever just cross out a domain issue and then say my domain's fine no you can't do that right you still have to write it down so first write down where you don't where your discontinuities are so discontinuities at x = 3 sorry3 and x = 2 this will tell you which is which that will tell you which is which uh which one can you cross out the two or the3 two if you can cross it out what does that tell you about the discontinuity at xal 2 that's a hole if you can cross it out that means the function goes like this and then it just it misses that one point and continues so this thing that's how you find it out if you crossed out the discontinuity you can't ever get rid of it but if you're able to factor it out that's a whole tell me something you're completely factored right can you cross out the x + 3 no at all so what does it tell you about the the discontinuity that occurs right there that's an ASM toote and that's how you determine it no it's not hard it's factoring and Crossing stuff out what you cross out it's called the whole what you don't cross out is called an ASM toote at least for rational functions that's the way it works I'm not going to give you another example because I think that's pretty straightforward is that pretty straightforward yeah awesome uh let's go ahead let's prove something here real quick let's prove that the absolute value of x is continuous everywhere now can you picture the absolute value of x in your head is it continuous everywhere do you ever pick your pencil up no then it's continuous everywhere that's what graphically it means let's figure out how to prove that it's going to be similar to um one of some of our one side limits we've already worked with is absolute value of x continuous everywhere and you go let's see looks like this yep done no we can't do that there's Pro why that'd be awesome here's a pro with some some limits okay what we want to prove for cond that was pretty funny I like that is that the the limit exists at every point that the limit equals the function value at every point and that even at that weird place where it comes together that that exists so here's how we're going to Define it all right we're going to define absolute value of x in in an interesting way we're going to say that absolute value of x you already know this one it's X and it's negative X in fact I think we could probably do that to but this will make it even more interesting for X is bigger than zero for X is less than zero let's make it zero for x equals z the reason why the reason why that this looks funny to you and why I don't have an equality here is because do you remember what we ran into with limits as far as checking the end points you remember we ran into Li there is no limit at an end point you have to check the end points themselves right so we would run into this situation anyway if I had an equal sign that would dictate an actual end point you follow me on that so what I'm saying is that that's basically an open interval we can check that with our knowledge of pols and and continuity no problem same thing with this one that we'll have to check with one-sided limits so here's what we know is this a polom yeah sure it's the most simple polom well besides a constant that's like the most simple polinomial you can have right just X are pols continuous everywhere then this is continuous everywhere it's a polom what that means is hey is this a polinomial sure that means it's continuous now this is that is well technically polinomial right that's that's just a one but it's one single point this is the point zero so when you get zero it gives you zero that's the where you come together on your your absolute value what we need to check is only this we need to check that the one-sided limit of this one equals z and the one side limit of this one equals zero that's what we can check if we can prove that then we know that that's continuous everywhere the limit of this equals z the limit of this equals z the function is defined at zero therefore all three pieces come together do you see what we're trying to do here if you don't then I need to know yes some people are just looking yes or no okay sometimes I say I get I get during the headlights yes I'm looking at you sometimes I wonder if I have a lazy eye and it's like I'm looking you're think is he look I had a teacher with a lazy eye once one my say it'd be like this like looking at you and then be like yeah yeah I get it and then she would switch it yeah that was crating she had fun with it though she really did she had fun with it good lady okay or man I'm not naming names I just had a teacher once whatever all right so uh let's go ahead and do this we're going to check this the limit as X approaches zero from the right look at look what we're doing X is positive right so from the right for X from the left forx and we'll see what each of these things are so from from the right hand side where does X go from the right hand side as you approach zero it goes to zero it's a polom you can plug it in it's going to zero where does Negative X go as you approach Zero from the left does it also go to zero goes a z that checks it right there it says that the limit the one side limit exists this limit clearly exists as continuous this limit is exists it says it's going to the point that is also defined that says the limits exist the point exists and they all equal each other that means that you're continuous everywhere and that's how you prove it okay we got to move on for a little bit what right now we're going to talk about is something to do with compositions and how we can use compositions up very much to our benefit in functions now stick with me here we're kind of pro stuff today if you haven't noticed let's say that there's a certain function that as X approaches some number we'll call it C the limit definitely exists and we'll call it l and let's also say there's another function f F and it's continuous at L well then check this out we're going to find out right now what happens when we compose G on to F or F of G and rul so what happens if we take the limit as X approaches C of f of G of x a composition you guys have seen compositions like that before yeah well this is kind of interesting just check check this out for a minute would you agree that if the limit exists if the limit exists then the limit of G of X as X approaches C is equal to the Limit yes but it's also equal to G of C right so then as we're plugging in C this is this is G of C but that's also equal to the limit so this equals so that's the same thing as F of L Reon I I had the extra limit in there I don't need that uh so if x approaches C then G of X approaches L you you with me on that want I had the extra limit I didn't need it uh if if G of X approaches L and F is continuous at L then we know if f is continuous we can just plug that number in this is going to be equal to F of L now the cool thing is we'll make a substitution right here and we'll say all right well then we can do F of how much is L equal to not just G of x g the limit of G of x as x c what that proves to you is you can separate limits by composition so this says look at that this is a composition of f of G ofx we can pull the F outside of the outside of limit we can take the limit of the G of X and then apply the function that's really interesting yeah F has to be continuous to L because when you compose that you're actually not plugging C into F you're pluging L into F does that make sense you're plugging C into G the the limit of G as X approach C gives you L you're taking that L you pluging into F since f is continuous at L you can make this jump to say if I plug in the C that's going to go to L if I plug in the L right here that's going to go to F of L because it's continuous you with me on that one since that happens we can make that jump and say oh but wait L is equal to the limit of G of X as X approaches C and that proves our composition for say we can separate limits by composition so this says right here we can separate limits by composition let me give you a quick example of how we can do this how we can use it talk about maybe one more thing for today so quick example let's say we have a limit as X approaches 4 of the absolute value 10 - 3x2 here's basically what this says we can do do you understand how this really is a composition of one function and the absolute value function do you guys see that what it says is that you can treat this because we don't we haven't really defined uh limits of absolute value we haven't really talked about that we've had to do one- side limits for things like this so far so if we haven't really talked about it there's something that we actually can do here this says well well wait if that's a composition then this means since we've proved absolute value of x is this is why we had to do it why you're like why didn't we use it here we've already proved absolute value of x is continuous everywhere you with me and for this function to work for this for this uh composition work F had to be continuous at every at a point well it's continuous at all points therefore we can do the composition do you see the difference there we couldn't use it here because that would be circular but we had to prove it once we proved it now we can use it for absolute value say oh well well wait that's a composition of a function that's continuous everywhere I can pull that outside if you remember uh I hope you do you remember you remember remember well I actually did that with cosine before remember me doing that with cosine the reason why we could do it is because cosine is continuous everywhere and now I've proved it for compositions we used it earlier but I've proved it now that we can in fact do that so we say take the limit of this and then take the absolute value and that will work just fine for you you can separate limits by composition what's the limit of 10 - 3x^2 as we approach 4 don't all speak at once 38 38 no 38 38 wait inside so this says you'll have the absolute value of - 38 because the limit of 10 - 3x^2 it's polinomial you plug in the number you get -38 then we take the absolute value of -38 we get and that's our answer so limit would be 38 a couple notes before we go um if two functions are continuous everywhere their composition will be continuous everywhere so absolute value be considered two functions absolute value with any anything inside it can be considered a composition two functions are continuous everywhere their composition is continuous everywhere it's for this reason if this always works if it's always continuous and that's always continuous and you can close them any anywh you want it's still going to be continuous one last thing about inverses we haven't spoken about them yet we will just briefly if f is continuous on its domain then F inverse will be continuous on its domain but remember that with inverses the domain of an inverse is the range of your original function so if f is continuous on its domain F inverse the inverse of f will also be continuous on its respective domain but keep in mind that the domain of f inverse is the range of your original function you switch X and Y right so the range becomes domain domain becomes range so if f is continuous on its domain F inverse will also be continuous on its respective domain but that is the range of your original function the range of f okay in the last minute that we have let me give you one quick example let's just say F ofx is X cubed uh is X cubed a polinomial that means it's continuous everywhere so it's continuous on the entire ire domain entire real number system so it's a polom it's continuous on negative Infinity to Infinity it's R what's its range what's its range z Oh not just that all real it also goes from negative Infinity to Infinity yeah all real numbers so if we found the inverse do you remember how to find the inverse yeah you well you make y = x Cub you switch your variables X = Y Cub you solve for your y the cubot of x = y and therefore F inverse of X = the cube root of x here's Cube here's what I know about this already I I don't I I know that for a fact because this is the inverse of this polinomial I don't have to do any more work with it I guarantee you that that's continuous on the range of my original function so because the range of my function was negative Infinity to Infinity not the domain not really concerned about that that's a polom everywhere but my range is netive infinity to Infinity what this says is that this must be continuous from negative Infinity to Infinity continuous everywhere if the range is everything the inverse function has a domain of everything so it's continuous because of the range negative Infinity to Infinity well good afternoon welcome back we're going to continue talking just a little bit about some limits uh one application of of these of well and continuity one application of continuity we're going to talk about today is something called the intermediate value theorem now here's the idea let's say that I gave you some continuous function so so it's it's definitely a function f ofx and I say this function is defined between a and b or let's just put some end points on it A to B can you tell me how high is this point it would be certainly y but let's not make it in terms of Y let's make it in terms of f how high would that point be F of a is a good St well that that that'd be what how high it would be so if this is a how how you figure the height out is you plug that into your function right in other words F of a cool how high is this point F all right let's follow the pattern there so F of a f of B very good that's our gives us our Heights now here's the question firstly let me say that f is certainly continuous do you see that f is continuous on the interval AB so f ofx is continuous in fact since it has those end points we can say it's continuous on the Clos interval as well here's my question let's suppose that I picked some random Point some arbitrary point between F of a some arbitrary value between F of a and F of B let maybe like here and I'll call it K so let's say that K is between F of a and F of B here's my question if I find the the input that gives me this output if I can find the input that gives me that output will it be between A and B that's the question if f is continuous here's what it says it says if you give me any point any value between F of a and F of B something in here I can guarantee you that the input that would give me that value lies between a and b and here's how we say this is the inter intermediate value theorem it says uh for any value k for any value K there's at least one point at least one value between A and B that will give you that the function of that value gives you K so in other words um if K is between F of a and F of B then there's at least one x value at least there could be more if you if you don't have a one to one function you could have several there's at least one number let me call it C okay at least one number we'll call it C such that F of C will give you k oh you know what I need to add one little part here uh there's at least one number c where C is between that's kind of a key point where C is between a and b and F of Cal K you want to hear it in plain English because that's kind of mathy right says well say K's between F of a and F of B then there's at least one number c where she is between a and b and F of C equals K now that makes perfect sense to me but here's what it says in English for you if you're like okay I don't understand this here's what it says if you give me any if your if your function's continuous that means there's no holes there's no asmt there's no jumps you get you get me it's a smooth curve uh if if your if you give me an output between these numbers my input will be between these numbers so here's my input and my output right for those those respective values here's my input and my output says you give me an output anywhere in this range the input must be somewhere between this range and there's going to be at least one such that this input gives you that output could you pick a different point sure you can pick any one of these points but no matter what that output is going to be mapped to at least one input at least one now if you did a curve like this where you where you had that you could have more than one right one two three however many you wanted uh you could definitely do that if it's continuous it'll have at least one though how people understand theidea of that and that's called the intermediate value theorem do you want to see kind of a cool application for this sure I'm excited about it hope you're excited about it you want to see good here's a cool appro uh application you can actually approximate Roots you know what roots are right where functions cross the x-axis you can approximate that with this idea here's the the plan let's say that I have this this certain function um it looks like that though well of course this height is f of B and that Heights F of a here's the idea using the intermediate value theorem you know for a fact for a fact that this was true right if I give you some specific value here you can find me an input in this range such that that gives me that output are you with me on that you can give me any specific output that you want to and I can find you the input that's in this range you understand that here's what it says for this it says let's suppose that you know that F of a is positive and F of B is negative so in other words the signs are different if the signs are different then what you know for sure is that it crosses the x-axis right in other words it says that if I say find me the point of zero that's an intermediate value right there right it's between those values if say find me the the input that gives me zero we we need to or we know for sure that that actually exists if our signs are different then of course we cross the x- axis right and according to the intermediate value theorem it says well you're continuous right your signs are are different so if we're going from positive to negative according to our our interval of outputs then Zero's got to be between those because we went for positive to negative so I can I can say with certainty according to the intermediate value theorem that there is going to be an input such that F of that input will give me an output of zero let let me write some of that out for you so that you have that it says that if your signs are different F of a and F of B have different signs if you ever thought about two things having different signs then you know zero will be between those two numbers true I say uh negative anything and positive anything you know that zero is between them yes if zero is between them that means you you can apply the intermediate value the if zero is between them then you must have a certain input that will give you zero that's applied uh using inter intermediate value theorem applied to this case so so says if the signs are different there must be at least one root on that closed interval that's all this says then that's all that says it just a very specific case where your signs are different you know zeros between them you can say for any output you can give me a specific input on that on that uh domain on that interval would you like to see it in in application how you would actually do this now of course we have calculators right you just go oh let me use my zero button for my graphing and it will do it very very fast well let's say that all calculators broke isn't that interesting idea what if they all broke which they're not going to but if they did you could you could now do it here's the example I'll give you this function I'll just explain very quickly uh the idea you'd find some some point on this graph I know for for sure that I don't really know exactly how this graph looks but I know for sure it's continuous everywhere can you explain expl to me why this is continuous everywhere very good so this is definitely going to be continuous on any closed interval so I know this graph looks something like that all right I know for sure it goes forever well here's the deal I'd plug in some numbers at some point and what I would find is that when I plugged in one and when I plugged in two they had different signs for instance F of two was up here F of one was down here that means that somewhere between 1 and two according to the intermediate value theorem as used for approximating roots I know that I'm going to have some number that gives me a zero there does that make sense to you I know it's going to be within that range because well my signs are different so here's how you go about doing that you'd make yourself up a table XY and what you'd do is You' have every every value between 1 and two according to like a tenth or something so like 1.1 1.0 and 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 and so on and what this is very timec consuming okay you're not going to do this all the time you're going to use your your calculator of course but this is how you would do it I'm just giving you the how am I expecting you to do this all the time no heck no but this is how it would work according to our our theorem over here what you do is You' take all these numbers and you would plug them into that function you're going to get a negative a negative a negative but somewhere it's going to change to a positive are you with me it's saying like here it's negative here's negative here but somewhere somewhere over here it's going to change to a positive and I think if I've done this right it's between 1.3 and 1.4 so this would be negative negative negative negative positive positive positive right here well you've just narrowed the range right now you know that the root has to be between 1 .3 and 1.4 do you see why we use the same idea we just can't made smaller so you take that and you go okay let's try this again XY and youd start now with 1.30 1.31 1.32 and you'd continue that and then you'd find out which one of those is negative and and where the breakoff is to where it becomes positive do you see how you can get very accurate with this you can get to however many decimal places you want already I know it's going to be 1.3 something and then I would do this one I find out it's 1.3 something I could find out all those numbers as much as I want as accurate as I want to be and that's one way you can actually set up computer program to do that for you program a calculator that would that would do that for you might take a little bit of time but it's possible how many people understood the idea of of applying that all right good deal so just a little kind of nice something we can use there
