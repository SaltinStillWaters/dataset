Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 3.2:  A BRIEF Discussion of Rolle's Theorem and Mean-Value Theorem.
now I'm going to give you a rundown of rolls theorem in about a minute y we're not going to really be covering a whole bunch of section 3.2 uh it's a very cool it's cool it's a good idea but I can tell you the idea in about a minute so here it is rules the says if your function crosses the xais and then crosses the xaxis again so like that and it's continuous between those points so it could do anything but if it crosses here and it crosses here and you know it's continuous between them tell me something that absolutely has to be certain about your slope between these two points well it's going to have a maximum sure it will have a maximum but tell me something between this interval about the slope not the not ABS care absolute maximum we're over that past that tell me what the slope will be equal to at at least one point between here and here zero it must be because you're coming up and you're coming down right somewhere at least one point you will have a zero slope does that make sense that's what R's theorem says hey by the way I'm going to draw a corollary right now what's the slope of the x-axis and that's the line that these two points cross right I'm going to show you the the mean value theorem the mean value theorem says take two points and draw a secant AB would you agree that that secant line is going to have a slope okay tell me something something between these two points if this is continuous actually let me make it stronger if it's differentiable actually has to be differentiable because otherwise that eliminate sharp points okay so it's got to be differentiable if that's differentiable that's true if this is differentiable what has to happen at some point along this curve with a slope Zer has to be not zero parallel what was it has to be parallel good parall what do you know about parallel lines okay so would you agree that somewhere from here to here this will have the same slope as this now make the jump do you see that this is exactly the same thing as this that's a special case what's the slope of this line somewhere along there it's going to have a zero slope you get it what's the slope of this line I don't care but somewhere along here it's going to have a slope of that exact secant value that's the rules theorem and the mean value the so it's just a concept uh well you can verify it but yes it's just a concept if f ofx is differentiable more than continuity differentiable on AB frime of X will equal zero for some point on a that must be true and that's a fancy way of saying what I just said uh you know what this takes a little bit more work to write it simply but would you understand that the slope of this would be b f of B well the point is b f of B and the point is a f of a then the slope is Y2 - y1 over X2 - X1 are you okay with that that that is actually the slope Y2 - y1 or X2 - X1 then if f ofx is differentiable on AB the first Dera will equal that slope at some point okay that's rolles theorem and mean value theorem if you're required to check these which I think some of your homework says that uh what you would do is this this this is it for mean value theorem you find the first derivative you set it equal to zero you're going to get an x value right all you need to do is verify that the x is between A and B it will be if it's continuous it will be for this one this is a little bit more tricky you have to find the slope between the two points you get me find the slope this is the slope between two points take your first dtive watch carefully take your first R and set it equal to the slope you get me set it equal to the slope and solve for x it's not zero it's slope and then verify that whatever point you get is between your and that's all that says it's a ver verification process basically so all in all in plain English this says if F ofx crosses the x-axis and it's it's differentiable at some point you will have a horizontal tangent all says if f ofx is continuous at some point the slope of your function will equal the slope of your secant between two points if it's if it's differentiable between those two points that that's all it says or fueld okay with your roles in me value sweet love that now
