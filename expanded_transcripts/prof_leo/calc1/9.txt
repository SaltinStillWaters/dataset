Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 2.2:  Techniques of Differentiation (Finding Derivatives of Functions Easily)
techniques of differentiation we're going to start off nice and simple I want to talk about the derivative of any horizontal line for I have to start there and then we'll move on from that okay so what happens if I try to find the slope of a constant so for instance uh slope of a constant when you graph a constant what do you get do you get a horizontal or a vertical line which one if you graph a constant y equals 5 what do you get it's not vertical right that would be x equals a horizontal line at whatever your constant happens to be so that's a constant line tell me something supposing I've drawn this perfectly what's the slope of my line there sure because we know the slope of any horizontal line would be zero right so and the slope of a constant is in fact Zer it's not rising or falling all right cool uh well wait a second though what does d deriv stand for SL curve in our case our curve is a horizontal line it's still considered a curve even though ironically it doesn't C all right uh still though if derivative means slope you believe me that derivative means slope right if derivative means slope of a function and the slope of our function is always zero no matter what then the derivative of a constant I've been completely General about this constant I don't know what it is could be negative positive whatever what's the derivative of a constant basically it's asking this question don't forget what a derivative means der mean slope what's the slope of a constant line zero zero sure what's the slope of a horizontal line zero the derivative of any constant is zero no matter what that's kind of nice do you believe that do you buy into the reasoning why horizontal lines have no slope right or they have a slope of zero I should say they have a slope of zero therefore the derivative of a horizontal line must give you zero derivative is slope slope horizontal lines are zero uh constants give you horizontal line so the derivative of the constant is zero that's kind of nice so in English this says the derivative of a constant is zero okay basic examples just to make sure that you get it uh right okay we'll get there in a minute what's the derivative of what's the derivative of three three is a constant what's the derivative of a constant no work at all that's fantastic I love no more limit right if you have a constant the derivative is is just zero that's that's easier what's the derivative of derivative of Nea 1 everybody what is that no thought at all derivative of constant is zero what's a derivative of Pi is Pi a constant Pi is just a number it is 3.14159 and forever whatever that is but it doesn't matter that it doesn't end it's still a constant number isn't it doesn't change the derivative of any Conant is zero so this is zero how people feel okay with the derivative of a constant is zero good that's kind of nice right we we didn't even have to use limits over there unfortunately for us when we come up with something that does have a variable in it there was a formula that we were able to use we knew that the first derivative or I'll use just so you get familiar with it the derivative of f with respect to X that's what that is was what what did it start with the formula if to find a derivative oh before that limit limit need a limit love it okay that's how you find the derivative true we we've practiced a lot of time on this this will one of the examples we got to do is this one I want you to see what happens with this okay so we're going to work this through right now I've asked you to find f plus h I'm sorry uh f of x plus h first and f of x find them independently then we plug them in and we figure out what this is is going to be what is f of x plus h what's that going to give us in this case very good it's just a composition we're just substituting that in have you gotten pretty good at that so far just don't separate X Plus H you'll be fine f ofx is just X cubed so we know our first derivative is going to be limit H goes to Zer x + HB - x Cub all over H still all right so far what do I do now yeah we gone through this a lot now it's basically just alge you distribute you combine some like terms hopefully you're able to factor an H out and your whole goal here is to cross H's out true that's your whole whole goal so in our case we'd go all right well this is limit H goes to zero we've got X Cub + 3x^2 H + 3x h^ 2us I'm sorry plus h Cub - x Cub I did that kind of fast but you would just distribute that all out x + H * x + H * x + H distribute combined like terms and I guarantee that's what you're going to get right there if you want to learn a quicker way to do that you come and see me I'll show you Pascal's triangle and how to do binomial expansion it's not hard so far so good does everything except for the h terms cross out in that case that's just this one and this one so we get limit H goes to zero 3x^2 H + 3x h^2 + H Cub over H what would I do now to finish off this problem perfect you're still with me right we done work like this before just some some algebra cross the H's out uh let the H go to zero because now you've gotten rid of that denominator and what are you going to get out of this whole beautiful thing 3x2 right beautiful what did I just find formula of the slope yeah so this gives the slope of this function this S curve at any point right if I had to give you a point like uh 1 one or I give you a point like 28 you could plug in the two or the the x value you could evaluate it find me the actual slope and find me the equation tangent line of that specific point could you not I hope you're like yes I can do that right now that that's where you should be at this point here's the thing this is going to be from someone who hasn't taken calculus before I want an answer do you see because I know some of you have so those of you don't love me that much but those of you who have not had calculus before you're going to love me you're love me does this suck yes this sucks I want you to think is there a way that you can go from here to Here Without garbage do you see a pattern do you see the pattern on someone who hasn't had the calculus before some where's this where's this number go coefficient what happens to this number Dr by one so from this to this all that happened was this number went out into the front right and one got taken away from that number you believe me guess what works all the time all the time do you ever have to do this again that been useful why do you think I teach you this one before I teach you this one cuz you would ever do this yeah you don't have to this is the the formula for derivative what we're going to learn now are shortcuts this hor is there even a formula when you can just do that because this is what we're doing this is the slope and this is the only way that you can let this the points the distance between them go to zero this is it this right here is a shortcut that works every time that so what's the actual calculus this is the actual calculus that's it right this is the stuff that works the limit is the fundamental of the of the calculus that's how you let it happen now techniques of differentiation says great we understand that what's the way we can put this in practice and actually do the derivatives all the time this stuff right because here's the thing you going to want to do that that has to be a 30 you want to do that no no I don't either cuz but the the thing that's going to happen is it's a polinomial right it's a very basic polinomial and what's going to happen is if you do by expansion every single term in here think about this you can think about it every term in here is going to have an H except for the very first one true the very first one is not and you're subtracting exactly that function from it so that's going to be gone everything else has an H the very next term will have only a single H that's binomial expansion when you factor that H out it you'll be only left with this thing binomial expansion says how you get this is that goes there and that becomes one less that's why this works that is the the power rule for derivatives so what's calculus this is calculus what's the easy way to do it that's the easy way to do it you have to know this because that's what we're what this class is all about all right you're finding slopes and that's how you do it in practical application though you just kind of cheat a little bit you ready to learn how to cheat yes that's what I love calcul I love cheating it's not cheating everyone does this if everyone does it it makes it okay that's not true by really really so if everybody jumps off the bridge please do it we have a shortage of food I mean it would I'm just kidding you on on YouTube or where don't jump off Bridges that's sarcasm hurts sometimes it does you just hope that sarcasm inves you okay if n is in integer this works we're going to find it later there's no qualifications on end it can be anything but for right now any integer works for us this is a true statement the derivative of Any X to any power is equal to notice DDX stands for derivative that's how I'm going to be writing most derivatives in here because it's very nice notationally to to write it this way uh it's hard to write it with the F Prime to to do this um I I don't like that I like this way to say I'm taking the derivative of whatever's in there do you understand it says take the derivative of this what you get out of that is what happens to the the well it wasn't a 30 anymore was was three what happens to the three what's is a symbol that represents the three here what's the N going to do you just pull that n up front the X doesn't change but what happens to the variable sure you subtract one from it that's n minus one [Music] do you love me told you you love me maybe not not yet you're going to so can you do we've actually done that G and before if you remember we've done it twice we've done it the Long Way both of limits can you do that derivative what's the derivative of x that's what this question asks derivative of X2 what do you do what happens to the two again it fits this format so two goes here x to the how much one because you're going to do 2 minus one now I'm rarely going to show you that math we're just going to assume you can subtract one on your own and get 2x to the first Power just 2x hey that's kind of cool cuz you've just found the slope of that curve in less than two seconds without doing any limits or anything like that right so I could actually this question and now the same exact question I gave you on your test and you could do it in like a minute maybe less because I say find me the equation of the tangent line through this curve at the point 2 comma 4 can you do it yeah at 2 comma four here's your slope right plug in two you get a slope of four now you have a point and you have a slope it's very quick very very nice so on the test are you ever going to tell us to do that yeah probably once to make sure you can do it yeah but after that no it takes way too long especially for for things like this I mean honestly that's just ridiculous even though it's very simple that's ridiculous when it comes to this stuff you don't want to expand that you don't want to do that I'm guessing a whole lot of you are probably not going to come to me for binomial expansion anymore since we don't have to do those for crazy big numbers can you take the derivative of x to the 5th how much is it to the good we bring down the five x to the subtract one from that exponent you get 2 4th power that's the derivative very nice very quick if you did it this way would it work out yes absolutely just going to take you a whole long time here's one you definitely don't want to do DDS of s 15th notice one thing on the notation do you know notice how this has to change with the variable that I have so it's not DDX anymore it's DDS derivative with respect to S and then I'll give you the variable so s to 15 uh what's this one sure very quick very very fast now there are a couple things that we we should be able to do as well what would happen if I gave you did the shiny just wear off a calculus did it make it less cool somehow that it's easier or did it make it like is so not bad it's going to get worse I mean it's it's going to get worse this is the com before the storm yeah this is like the eye of the hurricane all right you made it through the outskirts and now you're like ah it's sunny I like this little Mist maybe to cool you off and then I'll pound you again later but for right now take a breath can you do with negatives yeah of course yes absolutely you can what do you do with the the negative what's it what's it going to become what's the derivative of x to the by the way this is showing work all right you don't have to show me any more work than this what's the derivative of x to the -3rd what happens to the3 so you still have to do that3 x to the wait wait not -2 -3 minus 1 yeah that's -4 so this is -3 x^4 you be surprised how many people mess that up all right watch your signs very carefully if you're subtracting make sure you actually are subtracting um we'll do do we do a couple more how about this do you want us to write it like that or move the exponent to the denominator oh you can do this as well generally generally I'll tell you if I've given it to you this way leave it this way that's fine if I've given it to you as the other way give it to me the other way okay that's the general rule if you want to write like this all the time that's fine as well how about that one what's that going to be -2 comes down great P to the what okay you know what I'm going to move this one over there so you see it better this is kind of an important one actually what about DDX 1X is it 1X uh sorry 1 what do you do with that is it one over one you just take the derivative of x can you do that move Theon in front of X which is one up to the top so we have to move this so that it fits that format you with me right now it doesn't so somehow you got to change it to make it fit that if we do that sure now it becomes a NE 1 now you can take the derivative because it fits our X to n format we'll bring down the1 x to the what two or -2 you're subtracting one from it -2 and then because I gave it this way change it back we're going to have -1 over x^2 that's the derivative you okay with this so far by the way what's the derivative of just X One some people said X some people said one one what's the exponent right now it is one right so what would happen here is You' bring down the one you'd have x to the 1 - one wouldn't you what's x to the 1 - one Z so you'd have one * x to the 0 what's x to the 0 so this is 1 * 1 or 1 the derivative of x is one in fact if you think about this think think for a second understand that's the most basic of all linear equations yes what what where we have a non horizontal it's x to the first Power what's the slope of this line derivative means slope doesn't it so the Der would also be one that's you can show it with the general power rule now how do you'll feel okay with so far all right another little thing we can do it's kind of cool this opens up a whole lot of doors for us so another note if you ever have a constant times a function that could be anything in there what we can do with derivatives is take that constant and move it out in front of our derivative it doesn't apply to it so this is the same thing as C * the derivative of FX if C is a constant so for make sure you know that c is a constant number it doesn't change as like 3 or -2 or Pi but if we haven't being multiplied by that function we can pull outside I can see a couple examples of this how about a derivative of 5x to the 4th power do I have a constant in there being multiplied by a function yeah 5 is be multiplied X to 4th remember we we kind of want to make it fit that thing right because that's that's the only thing we know right now so that's about it so you know you can make this five times the derivative of X to 4 we can take that constant number and multiply it by the the derivative of the function itself so what's the derivative of x to the 4th power please don't forget about the five but then you have 4X sure 2 the thir power now you can do the five * the four how much you going to get3 yeah sure now look practically can you get 20x 3r from here yeah absolutely you bring down the four you multiply it times the five you're going to get the 20 right are you following me on that I haven't out outpaced you yet all right cool if you bring down the four which you know you're going to be doing multiply it by the constant term you're going to get the 20 and then subtract one from the four you're still going to get 20 x to the 3 power how about the derivative ofx to the 7th power what do you think what can we do do we have a constant in there yes so we could pull that constant out that negative then take the derivative of x 7th can you take the derivative of x 7th all of you should be able to at this point right so we could do that but basically I'm showing this to let you know that if we can pull the constant outside of it you can just multiply it by the exponent so in our case right here can you tell me the answer with just doing negative this the derivative ofx to 7th what are we going to get sure you know that's a constant you'll be multiplying it later1 that's ative 1 * POS 7 is -7 x to 6 power you're done that's your derivative there how about let's do one L one the derivative of pi/ x^2 Pi x^2 what do you think is it pi over 2x pi over 2x can you do that can you do pi over 2x that doesn't fit right that doesn't fit the the power rule that I gave you just a minute ago it doesn't fit that what would you have to do to the x s before you can do that stuff just what you did here same thing you did that you got to make it this format otherwise you can't touch it so right here we got to say all right well I know that this is the same thing as DDX pix to the2 are you with me on that or no move your negative move your exponents up make them negative that way you can use that power rule that I showed you otherwise you can't do it this in no way is equal to 2x you can't just can't do that now what what's next what do you think P out we could pull out the pi if you wanted to or you could leave it in there if you wanted to it doesn't really matter if you pull out the pi you'll have Pi * DDX of x -2 now can you take the derivative of x to the -2 yeah now it fits right now you can do it you can pull down the -2 take one away from the that exponent you're going to get the -2X to -3 and then multiply by the pi by the way stop for a second you know how I told you the derivative of a constant is always zero a lot of people ask later well wait wait a second if the derivative of a constant is always zero why don't we get a zero here why don't we do that well that's actually connected to something with a variable right if you have a constant by itself like the derivative of Pi that was Zero however because we have a a constant being connected to that that variable we can pull that outside by multiplication so basically just hangs around and says no it's not zero uh I will show you that yes a derivative of the constant it is zero uh but if you did that you'd have to show something called the product rule here I'll talk about that in the next section but for right now you go okay well wait a derivative of a constant by itself yes zero as soon as you connect it to a variable that now is just a constant being multiplied by that variable you can pull it out front you can use that rule that I showed you then take the derivative of the function and multiply it back does that make sense otherwise all of your derivatives would end up being zero and that would say the slope of everything is zero that's not true so here you have the pi time well you all told me it was -2 x to -3 we bring it down we subtract one and if you really wanted to kind of pretty this thing up a little bit you'd make it -2 piun overx Cub you see how to get to the -2 pix Cub Nodge your head if you can feel right okay and that's our der could You' have got there directly from from here sure sure you bring down that -2 that's the -2 * 5 x to3 you can do that by the way a couple nice little little rules for us just like we could do with limits you see when we're finding derivatives we're actually finding limits right with limits you can pull constants out with limits you can separate by addition and subtraction true do the same thing here if you have the derivative of a couple functions being added or subtracted that's the same thing as a derivative of the first function plus or minus use in subtraction the derivative of the second function you ready to see how we can apply this to some problems okay now now check this out by the way this should be like a booya MO for you like yes oh I got this no more limits bam done cuz if you had to do oh my gosh if you had to do this problem with limits see y'all next week I'll go home for for four days and you can just work on that well it would take you a week but it'd be pretty difficult wouldn't it because remember what you'd have to do to find the derivative you'd have X Plus H and X plus h in here and subtract that whole thing you'd have to find some common denominators because you have this uh this negative exponent you have some pretty nasty work to do on this thing very nasty work however using what we now know about derivatives if we can break all this stuff up into individual functions being added or subtracted take the derivative of each one and put them back together we're good to go I mean that's not bad at all so can I separate these two things yes okay let's go slowly through this I really want you to get this yeah you can you can separate addition subtraction so this is the same thing as the derivative of 3x 9th minus the derivative of x to3 are you okay on that step tell me one thing you could do with this is that legal to do can you pull the constant out yes we could do that the constant doesn't become a zero it's connected by that variable could you just take the derivative the way it is okay let's let's try that what's the derivative of 3x to the 9th everybody what is it 2 good bring it down you're multiplying that 3 * 9 gives you the 27 x to the 8 sure we're subtracting one from the exponent then I have my minus sign what's the derivative of this one okay it's going to be ultimately yes you're right but since I have this minus sign right here what's the derivative of just that piece x what good I'm subtracting one remember that's in parenthesis because I'm subtracting that whole derivative there minus a negative becomes a is that look okay to you hey quick question could you get their direct ly from here M sure what's the Dera of 3x 9th it is 27 x 8us the derivative of 3x to the -3 * a negative gives you a POS 3 x to4 can you get that on your own as well sure you can what I'm letting you do here is I'm I'm showing you sure you can do this it's legal therefore what that allows you to do in your Calculus is take derivatives term by term that's what allows you to do so do you need to split this up for me no no you're not going to do that what you're going to do is look at this go okay Mr Leonard said by this this rule split up by addition subtraction that I can split them up that means I can take derivatives term by term since I could pull the constant out that means I'm just multiplying it so do I need to show that no you don't it's just saying it's legal to do that means that when I look at this I go okay I know that constant's going to end up being multiplied by the derivative of x 9th the derivative of x 9th is 9x 8 when I mul the 3 * 9 that's how I'm getting the 27 this says okay minus but I'm going to have a negative there or if you consider this as one term-1 * -3 that's going to give you the posi3 then the that x^ the4 comes in the fact that I can take this derivative by itself term by term how many people feel okay with our example so far good okay cool would you like to see one more how about two more sure we'll do uh we'll do two more I'll show you an application of it uh we'll talk about higher order derivatives and that'll be our day I know higher order derivativ sound much worse but they're not they're you'll like them promise I'm going a little bit beyond this section for re I want to show you that this work this is actually true have we fit our format yet have we fit that no what's wrong square roots are problemss square roots are problems because they don't have a exponent can you make them have an exponent yes what is the exponent power over root it's always power over root so the root is two the power is one that means X to the 1/2 power so if this becomes a derivative with respect to the variable x 4 - 3 x^ 12 this is a last time I'll show you how to break it up you could break this up as a derivative of four minus the D minus well I'll even do this for you 3 times the derivative of x to the2 do you see how that's legal to split that up we can split it by subtraction we can move constant out in front of it this is a very easy derivative derivative to take what's the derivative of a constant number notice the difference here this is not connected by a variable right this is just the derivative of the constant itself I pull that out even if I were to do this and say well wait a second Mr lar did you say I could pull the constant out in front didn't I tell you that you still have a one in there right what's the derivative of one one's still a constant four time 0 is still zero right the variable affects your problem that's what it does derivative of a constant gives you just zero so this is zero don't forget that's a minus notice that are you okay by the way getting from here to here separating them and pulling the three out at the same time you'd have that three times let's do the derivative of a fractional exponent it works exactly the same way as any other power rule so can you bring down the 1/2 so bring that down first 12 x to x to the O can you subtract one from 12a 1/2 yeah2 minus one so our derivative is -3 X 12 fun could you maybe get that directly from here could you get that what happens to the four zero because it's being it's four minus something with a variable so that's a constant term all by itself the derivative of a constant term all by itself is zero yes minus oh that's our negative 12 * 3 is 3 x^ 1/2 - 1 is - 1/2 can you make it a little prettier mhm if you make it a little prettier here's how it look the3 would be on your numerator your denominator would have a two from that this negative exponent would go down to the denominator and it's also a square root that's how that thing would look negative exponent bottom 12 square root show hands tell me if you okay with what we talked about so far you can do this with any polinomial anything with a an integer in it or and now you know fractional exponents you can do this for pretty much darn near anything it's broken up into terms so that means when you get a problem that looks like this and I say okay 5 x 7th - 3x 4th 2x Cub + x - 1 notice the notation I'm going to use here if I say find dydx and my notation might change for the type of function I have this is defined as y equals so I have find the derivative of y with respect to its variable of x that's what that says in English okay can you find the D to that could you have done it with limits yes you could have would it have taken you probably a weekend yeah yeah you'd hate me you maybe somebody hated me on some of your homework you were doing oh I don't like you Mr Leonard but now you love me right forgiven almost almost forgiven can you take the derivative real quick yeah sure take it term by term do you need to split it up no I've showing you rules to say that you can split it up which means you can take a derivative term by term through addition subtraction do it now the next question asks one of the fundamental principles of calculus one of them and it's it's so far as far as applications go if you can answer that question you're going to have a good foothold about the the ideas of calculus so first you make sure you can actually find a derivative here I look at this I'd say okay I bring down my exponent I'm going to have by the way dydx it says the derivative of y with respect to X is and then you put your derivative 35 x to 6 did you get that then I'm going to get -2 x 3r yes then I'm going to get + 6 x squ don't forget about the squ don't forget the exponents can't you can't lose those uh oh how about the X why one because because I said so because Mr said well you can do it by this this you can do it by the rule or you can think that is just a linear function right Dera of linear function has to be the constant term which is in front of it which happens to be a one in this case that's going to be one if that had been 3x that would be a three what happens to the one this one that's a constant that's gone out of your problem how made it that far yes no yes good all right cool now the next one asks this can you can you take this idea and apply it at what points does y = x - 3x + 4 have horizontal tangent lines tell me something about a line that is horizontal what do you know about a line that is horizontal slope is how much okay the slope is zero you're all right horizontal tangent lines have slopes that are zero you follow what will give you the slope we know derivative means slope right so the idea is can you find the derivative and see where equals zero because if you can find the derivative and see where equals z you will have the points at which you have horizontal tangent lines this you you will find out uh that we're going to use this in graphing for find out the points of relative Max and relative men you ever heard of those things before we'll be able to do that very quickly we'll be able to optimize uh word problems maximization minimization cost functions all sorts of things with this idea find a derivative set equal to zero that's going to give you the points that you get a horizontal tangent we're going to talk about this next time all right so one question that we can conquer according with our our derivatives and the idea that a derivative is a what's a derivative again good glad you're awake today for Tuesday congratulations that's awesome uh we can conquer the idea of can we find out where functions will have horizontal tangent lines firstly what do you know about a line that is horizontal something about its slope slope would be zero for a horizontal line true so we were trying to look for lines that are horizontal to our original function how do you find the slope of the original function a derivative would give you slope yeah absolutely so if we found the derivative of our original function and we found out where that was equal to a slope of zero then we're going to be able to find the points where we have a horizontal tangent line here's how you would do that number one take your derivative of your function go ahead and do that now so do dydx or Y Prime if you'd like take your derivative come on we got this last time take your derivative derivatives now should be oh man this should be really quick shoot if we had to do the limit for this derivative that' take forever right it wouldn't be that great but now we can do it in literally like 5 Seconds like literally 5 Seconds crazy uh what's the derivative for y = XB - 3x + 4 what is that great because I told you you can take it term by term 3x^2 absolutely minus how much what happens to the four that's a constant Dera constants gives you zero if it's not attached to a variable did you get 3x^2 minus 3 okay what does this give you again formula for SL so this right here is your slope of that curve that's the slope of that curve what I want to know is where this curve has tangent lines which are horizontal what we found out earlier is that the slope of the tangent line is the slope of the curve at the point does that make sense so if this is the slope of the curve at any point and we want that slope to be zero can you set that equal to zero so if you set this the idea is we want it to be horizontal right horizontal means a slope of zero so basically we want a slope a slope of zero zero means horizontal can you do that for any slope you were looking for say if you want the slope where equals two absolutely so if I want a slope of one i' have it equal to one probably be harder to solve in this particular case but you can do it yeah this is a formula for slope so set it equal to whatever we want now the idea is we're typically going to pick horizontal because interesting things happen when you have a slope equal to zero that that that really does haveen inter some things for instance this at this point up at the top notice positive slope positive slope positive slope negative slope negative slope negative slope do you see that therefore at the top it has to have a slope of zero that would be a change from increase and to decrease and that would give you a relative maximum sometimes an absolute maximum of your function so interesting things happen there curves are optimized normally when you have some sort of a slope equal to zero so this is going to be the most common question I'm going to ask of you as far as relate the slope to some number it's typically typically going to be zero you follow the idea now can you solve that hey that's just some basic algebra so if we solved it how might you solve it you could you could do factor three difference of squares you're going to get one and negative 1 do you see it or if you added three divided by three and took a square root you'd still have one and negative 1 do you see it either way so either way because when you take a square root you have plus and minus I have like the factoring version sure we get x^2 - 1 = 0 that's 3 x + 1 x -1 x + 1 = 0 x - 1 = 0 therefore x = 1 x = POS 1 hey do something for me real quick just verify this for your own edification here for your own knowledge uh take those plug it into that take these and plug it into that and see what you get okay just so you see what happens here take a ne1 and plug it in how much do you get you get zero take one and plug it in how much you get so would you agree that these are the points where your slope is going to equal zero these are the points where you're going to have a horizontal tangent these are the actually not the points I misspoke these are the X values can you now find the points at which you will have a horizontal tangent the points these are your X values how do you find points to this one no that gives you slopes that would give you points so the points would be at all right well let's see here if x = -1 and x = 1 if I plug in -1 and I plug in one these two points will have horizontal tangent lines plug in 1 how much do you get out of that six okay plug in positive one how much do you get out of that those right there are the two points where you will have horizontal tangent lines nowhere else that's it I can say for certain nowhere else because we have found the function for the slope we said equal to zero and we solved it and these are the only two points that existed that's it how many people understood the idea of a horizontal tangent it's kind of interesting right cool you know last thing in our section really is we can also talk about higher derivatives we've been taking first derivatives this whole time which means you take the derivative of the function and that's it right now we're going to I'm going to tell you that you can take a second derivative and a third derivative and as many as you want to take so we're going to look at higher derivatives I do need to tell you the notation though how we say how we write out a first and a second and a third and a fourth so here's a first derivative second derivative we'll talk about a third and you can go further and further and further however many want derivatives you want to take our notation for a first derivative was typically this frime of X you remember that one right or we'd have uh y Prime you can write y prime or dydx those are the main three we stick with those normally actually in this class we'll be sticking with this one and that one typically is where we where we like to go you with that so far that should be like old school stuff well not old school it's all new for you but like from uh the previous section so we have that second derivatives say this you take your first derivative then you take a derivative of that so for instance could you take a derivative of this yeah it'd be pretty easy you'd get how much you get 6X very good that would be called a second derivative second derivatives are notated this way so this is the frime of x you'd say F double Prime of x if I took another derivative I'd have F triple prime of X and you just keep on writing little Dash marks uh some people i' I've seen put a little four up there for fourth derivative we rarely get to a fourth derivative but you could uh but you keep on writing those little Dash marks this is called the the Newtonian method of of writing um derivatives that you see there was these two guys uh Isaac Newton and Sir Godfrey libes who invented calculus about the same time one of them was English I think Newton was English wasn't he and then uh libes was German and of course back then the nations want to say well we invented calculus this is ours and so they kind of stuck with their own notation and and uh this this right here is the Newton's way of doing it he used little dots and this is the libid way of doing it and we still have that notation to this day so this comes from the the German guy and this comes from the English guy uh how they notated it and we still use that and each of them have their advantages um this one I'll show you some advantages to this later on why it's kind of nice why I do it this way uh first because my German Heritage you know but no I'm just kidding uh because we actually can do some pretty cool things with this type of notation I'll show you that especially when we get to like differential equations things like that all right um now y Prime you'd still stick with the Y double Prime y triple prime and so on uh the dydx does this a little bit different it says okay this is a first derivative of y with respect to X okay one time this says take a second derivative of y with respect to X both times that's how I think of it so you have a little two saying that's a second derivative this is a third derivative with respect to X every time so we keep on putting on another number that's a little bit more concise than those those little Dash marks I like that a little bit better looks better you can see it more that way also if you're going through and you just oh lost one well that would suck right because you don't know but it's hard to screw up a two and a three well maybe not maybe not that hard but harder than messing up a dash Mark are you guys okay with the the derivative notation first second third what I'd like to do now just for fun can you find all of the higher derivatives of this can you find all the higher derivatives there so start with the first derivative find the first derivative then find the second one then the third one then the fourth one then the fifth one then the sixth one and see what happens okay I want you keep going did you find him are you still working on it you still working on it keep going if not well let's start up here first derivative can you please tell me what the first derivative is on this 20 x Cub you got that one right okay then I I heard 27 X2 yes - 10 x what I do oh 27 I actually cubed it my bad I was on this one shoot I guess 3 * 3 is n that's that's good to know yeah uh and lastly what else do we have yeah my bad what happens with 347 what here's what's interesting too what if I did made this 34755 would this derivative change no so that constant really has no effect on your derivative we're talking about the slope right so all this is is really a shift upward or downward so if we're just shifting the whole function up or down doesn't affect the slope of the function say oh now it's way up here now it's way down here so that really doesn't affect it which is interesting okay uh next up second derivative we just take the derivative again so we're going to do what's 28 * 3 what x^2 minus 18x you got that one right minus 10 what happens to the N9 it's a constant it goes away now what okay then we take the derivative again and yeah we're going to get 168 and again that that constant goes away 168 well let's do the fifth derivative what's theth what's the derivative of 168 what's the sixth derivative what's the seventh derivative what's every derivative after that this is going to happen for every polom you see at some point no matter what you start with if it's a polom you'll be able to take a derivative and what happens every time is the the the order of the polinomial decreases by one so 4 3 2 1 0 and then a constant that's going to happen with pols now does it happen all the time think about something that's not a polinomial I'll give you an example if you need one how about that it's going toas well decreasing because we subtract one but it becomes more and more and more negative right this derivative would the derivative of that would give you -2 x^ the3 right then you get POS 6 x^4 and then so on and so on and so on and so and so that actually that that exponent keeps on getting small more and more and more negative so this won't cycle out to zero eventually it's not a polinomial so be careful on it you're not always going to go to zero but you can find more more and more derivatives on this how people feel okay with our higher order derivatives so it's basically just take a derivative and then take it again and again and again that's what this is asking you to do so where would we be the correct place to stop at 168 or when it reaches zero zero this is all the higher derivatives because every other derivative is going to be zero so zero counts as a derivative absolutely yeah this we've taken one 2 3 4 but then you can take this again and get something different right you could get five but then as soon as you take it six it's not doing you can take them as many times as you want you're just going to get the trivial answer answer of zero after that yes what if it was 1x2 that is 1x2 when you get to zero no no uh the derivative of this is in no way 1/ 2x at all you're breaking the rules here there's only one rule that we have the one rule that we have is is it must fit this format folks it must fit this format if it doesn't fit that format you can't do it that's it you need to be able to break it down in such a way that it does fit this format all we can do is separate by addition subtraction and pull out constants so in order to make it fit this format we can't just say oh derivative of X2 is 2x that would be awesome but no it doesn't work that way instead you have to say oh this is the derivative of x to the two that fits that format do you see the difference there you have to make it fit that so you have to pull that negative that exponent up and make it a negative that way you can work with your power rule does that clarify your question okay so we can't just take derivatives of parts of like quotients can't take it at parts of products we're going to talk about those things in just a little while but you can't just do that you with me on this I see one more example might be good for you guys to see this one could you take the derivative of all those things okay could you take the derivative of this thing go your head yes you can yes you can can you take a derivative Al together no not the way it is right now let me show you a couple things about this problem number one well you probably are going to want to make this x 5 - 2x - 3 all over 3 X to the2 do you see what we did there you okay with that that's okay that's great that's fine but here's what you cannot do this is going to go back to your previous problem what you can't do folks you can't do this I I wish you could but you can't you can't go oh you know what this is 5 x 4 - 2x over 3 x to the 1 half do you see what I did I took derivative derivative derivative derivative can you do that no no you can't they're they're connected they're and they're in a quo we're going to find out later you can't do that you can't do that one if you want to write that down cross it out if you wrote it down cross it out you can't just take it piece by piece if they're connected you have to be able to separate them completely and take a derivative uh by term by term you can't do that here you see you can't separate this and have its own derivative minus its own derivative minus its own derivative and then have it over another derivative that's something we can't do we can't do that so what we would have to oh give another option what could I do whenever I have some expression over one single term what could I do I can't move that up I don't want to do that what can I do when I whenever I have one uh several expression several terms over one single Factor SPL up what no split it up over the let's split it up so sometimes these these daunting looking uh derivatives that you need to do what would happen if I did split this up as X 5th over this - 2x over this 3 over that let's see what happens there then maybe we'll make it fit into our our scenario that we can work with firstly are you okay that this doesn't work as a matter of fact you can't just take all these pieces if we have a quotient or a product or something crazy the only time we ever found out that that did work was this look when I had a polinomial yes that works cuz I can separate by addition subtraction that's what makes that work I didn't tell you you can separate by division because you can't I didn't tell you you can separate by multiplication because you can't unless you have the constant that comes out it's only that's the only thing so you can't separate by division you can't do that only thing you can separate is addition subtraction you follow me on this so when I when I translate this into 3x^ the2 we got have something better than this this this over that work well we could do is potentially split these up into three different fractions so for instance why don't we try to make it X 5th over 3x/ 12us 2 X over 3x2 - 3 over 3x2 and then we'll try to simplify each of those fractions to make them fit in our power rule and then take the derivative are you guys all right with what we're doing so far we're trying to make it fit into this we have to make it fit there if we can't make it fit there we can't take the derivative right now can you combine those X to 5th and x to the 1/2 how you combine those okay what happens when you have common bases that are being divided do you add exponents subtract exponents multiply exponents or divide exponents let me let me break it down even easier for you okay watch no just watch can you simplify that yeah please goodness say yes please say yes Mr Leonard I know how I'm I'm supposed to be in this class yay how do you simplify this what is it what is it you subtract what subract your exponents because when you divide exponents you have four of them here you have three of them there you cross out three of them you have one of them left right that's subtracting exponents you go oh yes this is completely gone that becomes an X what happens to the two go on top stay on the bottom so you would have X over 2 true or you could get 12 x do you follow okay so you know whenever you have common bases you subtract exponents this is not a hard concept you've seen this since your algebra beginning algebra days beginning algebra days so can you combine these the answer is what how do you combine those how how' you combine those subtract what subtract your exponents what's five minus a half how much you going to get four and a half give it to me as improper fraction N9 nine halves really all right I Didn't Do It In My Head yeah n half I need you to be able to get there that's not calculus okay that's algebra this right here I mean people have said before you take calculus to finally fail algebra don't let that be you know your algebra if you know your algebra this is a piece of cake I mean really honestly calculus is easy if you know your algebra promise and trigonometry if you don't yeah it's going to hold you back a lot uh are you okay on firstly going from here to here secondly going from here to in them up and now thirdly do you see how to get from the X 5th over x/2 into 1/3 x 9s we subtracting those two exponents do that in calculate if you want to 5us half you're can get four and a half or N9 halfes minus let's look at those numbers that's going to give me 2/3 x over X to 1/2 gives you what please 122 good because you subtract 1 -2 and get X to2 minus oh what's that become this is supposed to be a new video you have that old school ringtone on come on man give me some 50 Cent or that's even old too what's new uh I'm on the edge of glory give me that one next time okay all right thanks what happens to the threes they become a one what happens to the X to the 1/2 what are you going to have to do with that in order to make it fit that what do you do can you leave it like this and take a derivative no that would be the scenario that would be that scenario what do you have to do to that one2 so we're going to have to move that to the numerator and make it a negative one2 do you follow me you're constantly trying to make it just look like that that's what you need so 1/ X2 no X to the2 yes yes show hands how people feel okay with this so far simple algebra good all right simp you passed simple algebra very good hey now that why this is still why I haven't even done do you notice I haven't even done calculus yet no calculus yet this is basic this is algebra now can you do the calculus can you take a derivative why don't you carefully right now take me that derivative go and do that carefully take derivative I'd rather have the go slowly on it by the way I I want the correct answer slowly rather than the wrong answer quickly that would be stupid was that lady goooo by the way that lady yeah is that not right perfect so Dy DX or Y Prime if you'd like note how each of these now fits into our format here the constants we could pull them out we're just taking a derivative of x to 9 derivative of X2 of x 12 let's do that piece by piece I'm going to show you every step okay right now so you see where it's coming from I'll have the 1/3 times the 9 halves you see where the 9 halves is coming from ladies and gentlemen okay I'm going to have x to the I need to do 9 halves minus 1 that's going to give me seven halves did you get seven halves as well perfect seven halves get one next up I'm going to have minus minus 2/3 2/3 times what folks okay what2 because that's my exponent that I'm bringing down so I leave my constant alone I'm multiplying by my exponent and then I'm going to take x to the 12 minus one gives you what lastly I have minus minus what now okay NE one2 okay great so - one2 I'm going to put that in parentheses saying hey I'm a negative watch out I have a negative there so minus is minus negative that's our Negative X to the okay x to the what am I going to get 3 cuz I 1 and half 3es right we use improper fractions here cuz they're easier to deal with so -2 minus 1 gives you3 you got that one show hands how people feel okay getting that far on our problem let's make it a little bit prettier simplify some fractions that's one that's two there's the third one in the most basic sense that's your derivative no problem what is that what did I just find what is that that we found oh come on what is it what's the dtive slope of a curve the slope of this curve this weird curve at any point it's kind of neat that we're able to find that right we have no curve looks like we're able to find the slope of that at any point we have a function for it now if you do want to make this a little bit nicer looking you can translate these back into Roots if you really so desire um you could do well I probably wouldn't change that one at all unless you want to do it square root of x to the 7th that's what that means so if you really are forced to do it here's how you would change it back into roots for me most of the time that's going to be fine but if you're forced to plug numbers in you want to see what's actually going on here so this would be 3 < TK X 7th over 2 minus since that's a negative it will be on the denominator of fraction 3 < TK X since that's a negative exponent it will be on the denominator of a fraction along with that two a sare root of x Cub that's the way you would write that without any negative exponents associated with them for yourass most of the time we're going to be okay on that however typically if they get root form you want to make it back into root form so in that case that would be maybe what you see in the back of your book or or uh or some other context how many people feel okay with our example up here so can we do this term by term by term by term can we do that no we cannot separate division we can't do that what we can do is separate our fraction firsthand firstly then simplify each of those and and then take a derivative that's something we can do and that it's not too bad deal deal with a lot of fractions here but I mean that's some algebra we should be okay with our fractions are there any questions before we move on at all do you like these derivative business can you imagine taking the limit of that of X Plus H good thing we had that seriously I'm the only words you know how
