Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 3.1:  Increasing/Decreasing and Concavity of Functions
half more than more than halfway done really chapter zero chapter one chapter two right three four and part of five so cool chapter three specifically 3.1 today we're going to talk about increasing decreasing and concavity we're going to try to get all those things accomplished in in the time that we have let me give you an example a graphic example of increasing and decreasing just so you understand kind of the idea of what's going on let's suppose that we have this function just like that and let's say I break this up and this is this is that what I'd like to find out is where this is increasing and where this is decreasing and more specifically what the slope is doing at those on those intervals and that's kind of important for us so the first question is is this can you give me increasing means going up decreasing means going down as we're going from left to right we read our graphs left to right so can you give me an interval on which this function let's assume it's a function on which this function is increased SE going up certainly from A to B do you see how from A to B we are we're rising from A to B the function is climbing from A to B for sure we're going to use open intervals because at B something special happens at B it's no longer increasing we'll talk about that later how about another interval do you have another interval where we're increasing c c to D works good because from here to here we're growing up growing up this function is getting so old so fast how about from D onward what's happening there is it increasing is it decreasing okay constant very good uh any function any areas intervals that are decreasing for sure B to C D onward is pretty boring d onward is just a constant the slope is zero it's going to stay zero forever what I do want to talk about are the slopes of the increasing and the decreasing intervals what's happening to that function on those intervals let's look at a to B what would you say would the slope be for this point and I don't I don't mean like oh this is about 3 over one or 5 over one I don't care about that what I really care about is whether it's positive or negative so is a slope here positive or negative how about how about here how about here hey how about at B that's why B's not included right so from a all the way to B would you say that we have a positive slope do you understand that when I have a positive slope that means that my function is actually climbing do you see that look look again from from C to D let's look at C at C at c0 but just past C is that positive still positive positive posi it's still positive all the way up until the point D you follow me on this when we say we're increasing what that means for us as far as a derivative and the relationship that we're building this class that means that your slope is positive so increasing will happen if your slope is positive there's no way you can draw a positive slope and not be going upwards are you with me on that if you draw a positive slope you're going upwards true even if it's just at that moment you're going upwards for that moment so increasing inter will have a positive slope that should imply something it should imply that a decreasing interval will have a negative slope let's look at our decreasing interval there's only one of them it's a slope negative for our entire decreasing interval let's check it out use your hand or your pencil if you want to here's our decreased interval here it's at zero right at B but as we go past that is that negative negative even when it get down to here it's it is still negative but then it's becoming still negative but less negative until we get down to that point at this point look what happens what's going to happen when we change from decreasing to increasing what happens to our slope as we change from decreasing to increasing our slope goes from negative to zer to positive does that make sense to you from increasing to decreasing we go from positive to negative and we're going to incorporate all this stuff in into our graphing of functions in just a little while so right here we need to know that a decreasing interval will have a slope which is negative definitely negative slope I'm going to write out what I just talked about so this is nothing else than what I've just described this implies a couple things it implies it implies that if R what wait what will slope again how do we find slope and calcul this what gives us a slope if our derivative is greater than zero if our derivative is greater than zero that means our slope is positive is our function increasing or decreasing if our if frime of X is greater than zero on an interval a then my function is increasing on that interval you can see it from our examples this is definitely increasing right our slope is positive at every single point from A to B positive every one of those slopes at every single point is going to be positive that's all this says this says in English here it is in English for you if the slope the slope right if the slope's positive you're increasing that's all it says you guys understand that idea if the slope's positive you're increasing if the slope is negative then f ofx is decreasing on the interval you still okay so far in English again what this says is if your slope remember first of a slope if your slope's negative you're decreasing that's all it says the last case is if frime of x if you're derivative equals zero so your slope is zero what that says is that well if your slope's zero you're constant at that point or on the interval so for instance right here at B our slope is zero right that means we have a we're not increasing we're not decreasing we're constant right there that means a horizontal line true constant means a slope being constant means horizontal line so if we have our frime x equal Z we're we're talking about a constant line right there uh that means for us a change typically typically that's a change from increasing to decreasing or from decreasing to increasing or that we're constant that's what we're talking about what's very cool is that we don't need a graph to do this with just a function if we know how to find the derivative you can give me the intervals of increasing and decreasing we're just going to be having the set equal to zero and do what's called the sign analysis I'll teach you how to do that as we go on the next sections the last thing we need to talk about in in increase decrease in concavity is well of course concavity concavity is the direction of the curvature of your line or the description of the curvature might be a better I'll say Direction but or basically it's how the slope is changing now you're going to hope I'm going to try to match this up for you right now you know this uh first derivative means the slope correct how the slope is changing that's a rate of change of the slope should be a what type of derivative second derivative first Der gives you slope second derivative gives you how the slope is changing a rate of change of the slope and so when we're talking about concavity you're going to find out just second concavity has to do with the second derivative first derivative gives you increasing and decreasing concavity gives you the way that you are curved the direction of curvature that's the second derivative so basically it's how how a curve is increasing and decreasing let me give you an example about why this might kind of be important for you would you agree that to get from this point to this point and be continuous that you are going to be increasing on this okay and let let's just pretend that we we're not going to go up and down let's go from here to here and not go back down again so we we'll definitely overall be increasing from from here to here right is there more than one way to get from here to here well and still be increasing sure you can probably think of it I mean I'm going to be kind of simplistic about this you could be straight right but that's not fun you could do that couldn't you but you could also do that those have different curvatures here's one type of curvature here's another type of curvature here's one that's increasing at an increasing rate do you see what I'm talking about it's starting to go up and it's going up faster and faster and faster here's one that's increasing at a decreasing rate it's going up but it's going up slower slower slower slower and finally gets there right increasing at increasing rate the slope look at the slope of this here's my slope right my slope is positive for every point do you understand but my slope is positive here but it's even higher and higher and higher and higher my slope is actually increasing do you see what I'm saying the slope is increasing here this is increasing but the slope is actually decreasing the slope is going downward what that does is gives us the curvature notice really positive but the end not so much positive what it does is gives us how are our curvish shaped that that's basically it so concavity is the curvature of our our graph and right now I really just need to get to be familiar with concavity what's concave up and what's concave down so we'll talk about that for a little bit and hopefully get on to how to find these out from just functions this function is increasing everywhere true or false definitely true it's always going up is it going up at the same rate No in fact you'll notice this this is going up at an increasing rate oh wait and then that something happens doesn't it and then we we're we're level it looks like we're even for a while and then we start increasing but at a decreasing rate until we get to the top see what I'm talking about this is our two different types of concavity we have one region of this is going to be called concave up if the curve is increasing at an increasing rate that's this way this is going to be concave up your slope is positive your slope is increasing actually all we need is really the slope is increasing the slope is increasing that's going to give you a concave up concave up concave up you okay with that yeah wasn't concave well what I'm saying is concave up doesn't have to be increasing or decreasing as far as the function is concerned but the slope must be increasing I know this is going to be kind of weird for you wub your head around but this is a completely concave up shape right here would it hold water yeah concave up will hold water also how do you feel when you're happy when you're up when you're feeling up like you smile you're feeling concave up happy concave up is going to hold water it's going to be upper facing now if you're confused this to Mr Leonard why did you say that the slope is increasing the slope is increasing here watch what's the SL here very negative what's the SL here a little less negative we're not talking about the function we're talking about the slope of the function for concavity what's the what's the slope here very negative less negative less negative less negative less negative zero positive more positive more positive the slope is actually increasing the entire way through do you see the difference it's difficult to think about because I haven't graphed the slope I've graphed the function but we're talking about the slope and how the slope is changing for concavity there's the distinction so this is definitely concave up that's concave up what it says is it opens upward it's how people describe it it opens upward or it would hold water that's probably the worst one here's what it actually means in mathem matics if you're concave up it means your slope is increasing the function is not necessarily increasing we see that this is actually decreasing but the slope is increasing do you see the distinction there between increasing and concavity the slope is increasing on that that interval that's what concave but means you okay with this so far okay what's concave down look like feeling down down concave down Fry face it's your umbrella water slides right off it opens downward would not hold water but really what it means is that your slope is decreasing your slope is whether your function is increasing or not doesn't matter for concavity concavity says how's the slope changing slope changing for concave down means it's decreasing slope is decreasing notice look at how's this curve go yes the curve itself does this watch on the board here real quick notice the distinction the curve itself is increasing and then decreasing yes but the slope does the same thing the whole time the slope is very positive less and less and less and less and less and less zero negative more more more negative more negative it's always decreasing through the whole entire curve you see what I'm talking about there's a change there's a difference between increasing and decreasing as far as a slope is concerned there's a difference between increasing and decreasing of a function and the slope how that changes on function now here can you tell me where my intervals are for increasing and where my intervals are for decreasing stop me uh when I for for my slope stop me when I change from concave up to concave down uh what do I start with from let's start this way what do I start with here concave up or down and oh you missed it let's try that again no I'm just kidding and yeah somewhere somewhere in here now exactly where I don't know CU I don't know the function itself but it's going to be somewhere right about I would say there right about there we change we change from holding water to being an umbrella from being concave up to concave down from the slope increasing increasing increasing slope dies off decreases decreases decreases do you see what I'm talking about there that changes from concave up to concave down this would be up concave up concave down this point where you change concavity is called an inflection point inflection point or point of inflection that's your inflection point well we can going to continue talking about increase and decreasing concavity and how that relates to our first and second derivatives what we found out last time is that the first derivative is going to give you increasing or decreasing because if the slope is positive you're increasing if the slope is negative you're decreasing we also found about found out about the way the curve is shaped so basically how we're increasing or how we're decreasing is also important and what that was called was concavity can you tell me which one of these is concave up the left or the right so this was the concave up and this was the concave down and here's what we determine the second derivative which is the way the slope is changing if the slope is increasing or the slope is decreasing will tell you whether we're increasing uh at an increasing rate or increasing decreasing rate or decreasing increasing rate or decreasing at an increasing rate so basically how we're shaped so here's what we say if the second derivative is positive what that means is the slope is increasing if the slope is increasing that means we're going to be concave up notice what the slope is doing the slope is increasing does that make sense so if our second derivative is positive the second derivative says the slope is increased remember the second derivative is the rate of change of our slope you with me on this the first derivative was the slope the second derivative is the rate of the change of the slope basically if your slope is increasing or decreasing so says the slope's increasing that's going to give us a concave up so this means concave up if our if our second derivative is negative that means our the rate of change of our slope how our slope is changing that means it's negative that means it is that the slope is actually decreasing the slope is decreasing slope is positive slope becomes zero SL is negative that gives a concave down shape I did explain all that last time right okay good what would happen if the second derivative equals zero well right now we have question mark about that but here's what we're going to fill this out as if the second derivative equals z that means the rate of change of the slope is constant that means we don't know what's going on right there but it could possibly be where it changes from concave up to concave down or concave down to concave up do you remember what that point was called this is a possible inflection point there's cases where it's not but it's possibly an inflection point or pip pip let me review just a couple things with you uh let's give a couple graphs here do you have any inflection points on this graph yes could you tell me where it's concave up and where it's concave down what am I starting off with concave up or concave down concave notice how concavity really doesn't have much to do well it does have to do with increasing and decreasing but you can be concave up even though you're decreasing and increasing do you see what I'm talking about here we start decreasing then we increase however we're concave up the whole time well the concavity has to do with the the slope the way the slope is changing if the slope is increasing that means we're concave up so we're concave up tell me where to stop being concave up right in here somewhere in there yeah for sure somewhere in there we're we stop being concave up and we start being concave down we start being able to hold water and and have something that doesn't hold water where do we stop being concaved down somewhere in here it looks like about right there to me and then we're concave up for the rest of our our curve those two points those are called our inflection points so right here this is how this would relate to this this information these are inflection points let's look at the concave up it says the second derivative should be positive the second derivative says the slope should be increasing is the slope increasing here not the function not the function the slope is the slope increasing here sure until it gets to that point guess what happens at that point it starts it stops increasing and it starts decreasing in other way in other words our slope hits a peak and starts falling back down that's what that says now our slope is decreasing decreasing decreasing decreasing decreas till it hits that point and then starts increasing again at those inflection points that's what's going to happen is where your second der equals zero how people have an okay understanding of our concavity and inflection points I'll get more specific on how you actually find those later okay would you be able to give me intervals of increasing decreasing concavity and any inflection points that occur would you be able to do that for me yeah can you tell me where we're increas let's write that out increasing decreasing concave up concave down and any inflection points where are we increasing give me an interval where we're increasing the function needs to be going up from left to right where are we increasing so all the way from the start of our graph which I mean this goes way down but it could start ultimately from negative Infinity it increases all the way up it's going up until we reach x equals what z x doesn't equal three get I'm not talking about talking about that I'm talking about where do the function stop increasing where does it stop stop going up on the X axxis where does it stop okay so when I say from negative Infinity here's what I don't mean some of you who are a little bit shoddy on your graphing negative Infinity doesn't mean I start down here that's not what negative Infinity on the x axis means xaxis is this way right says from negative Infinity I'm increasing all the way till I get to this point which is zero do you see what I'm talking about the function is going up I don't care where the function stops but on on the x axis right there it's increasing from negative Infinity to Z to zero are you okay with that so not not the height of the function where it's increasing on the x- axxis does it pick up again and start increasing where at x equals what two so from two to where Infinity from two to Infinity on the x- axis would be another interval of increasing are you okay with the negative Infinity to zero and then the two to Infinity now your have you are feel okay with that okay so we're not talking about this way we're talking about what the function is doing as we're going along the x-axis give me decreasing how many intervals do we have that are decreasing one from where to where Z to two yeah if if we're not understanding this what some people say is from 3 tog3 is that our period of of decreasing no no that would be the range that we're decreasing from here to here but what I'm talking about is the function is decreasing on the X inter interval from 0 to two do you see what I'm talking about there yeah or no are there questions about that you guys dead today see a lot of that seems kind of intuitive not to say negative 1 to zero increasing or at that point where it crosses the X xais first time on the left right here yeah but we're still increasing from here as well so it slowly will eventually go we always read from left to right so we're saying when we start this function at negative Infinity cuz it never ends when we start this function it's automatically starting to go up and it keeps going up and keeps look at as I'm going like timeline right keeps going up keeps going up keeps going up keeps going up going up going up going up going stops going down going down going down going down going down going down stops going up going up going up going up going up going up forever forever do you see what I'm talking about have I have I droll you into a state where you're almost sleeping now yes good I'm glad glad that's you sleep hey me too all you have to do is sit there think about me come on selfish people 0 to2 is decreasing if you need more help on that you come and see me uh how about concave up you need to be able to determine concave up to concave down am I concave up here no concave up con how about here concave this is concave up this is right here where did it start right there ah concave up concave up forever concave up from one to Infinity concave down let's start that remember it has to go in order of a number line where do we start being concave down remember you're talking about the x axis the x-axis where do you start being concave down up till what point one the this is all concave down until you get to here right xais says to 1 is there an inflection point if you change concavity you have an inflection point uh what is it that one Z does it change concavity here does it change concavity here no x equals 1 or the 1 Z I know the notation kind of sucks because we don't have different notation for intervals versus points that's an interval that says from 0 to two non-inclusive from 1 to infinity non-inclusive infinity to one non-inclusive that's a point 1 to zero okay that's actual specific point I know our notation is horrible because points intervals look the same for some numbers but that this is a point those were all intervals we you feel okay with our intervals of increasing decreasing ify stick with it we we'll talk about one more you'll get practice on it on your homework as well absolutely um how about this let's see if if you kind of really understand what you're what you're doing here by the way were there any questions on that before um I move on I saw some people who weren't really quite grasping the whole why we have why we have these numbers but you have to think that this is all on the x-axis you're not talking about the heights of the actual function you're talking about where it's increasing decreasing so you're not you're never going to have a three you're not going to have a three you're talking it's going increasing until x equals z then it stops increasing it's decreasing from 0 to two that starts increasing again from two to infinity and that's what we're talking about and that's how you determine those intervals does that make a little bit more sense hopefully uh now at each point here's what I want to do I want to determine whether our first derivative or and second derivative are positive or negative that's what I want to do here so let's take a look at it let's look at Point a I'll help you out with point a and then the rest of them I want you to do on your own just practice it on point a I want you to look at our first derivative the first Der means slope the first derivative says whether I'm increasing or decreasing remember that first derivative says increasing or decreasing if the first derivative is positive I'm increasing going up the first Dera is negative I'm decreasing going down so let's look it very carefully very slowly let's think about the first derivative at a is my function climbing or falling at the point a is that increasing or decreasing decreasing so should this be positive or negative the first derivative will be negative there definitely negative it says that my slope is negative my slope's less than zero that means I'm decreasing do you follow me now let's think about the second derivative at the point a the second derivative says whether my slope is changing positively or negatively is if my slope is increasing or my slope is decreasing so think about this is my slope getting gradually bigger or getting gradually smaller so then my slope is increasing do you follow me my slope is increasing also that means I should be concave up my concave up right there for concave up is that positive or negative the second derivative will be positive it says my slope is increasing my second derivative should be positive do the rest do B and C for all right so let's go for it at point B if I'm looking at point B my function's increasing my slope is positive so this should be positive at point B oh that's almost at the cut off but it's still the slope is still little bit increasing right there so at point B we're still increasing this should also be positive did you get both of those positive yeah it's increasing and it's concave up that's how you can view that as well Point C at Point C my function is decreasing my slope is negative that means my slope is negative that's certainly true and also my slope is getting gradually less and less and less so my slope is decreasing as well if my slope is decreasing that's also negative concave down as well how people got both those right good for you if not notice where your mistake was was the first derivative or second derivative first derivative is increasing decreasing second derivative is concavity decreasing concave up decreasing concave up increasing concave up increasing concave up decreasing concave down decreasing concave down that's the same exact uh language or same exact idea that we just talked about now the next thing we're going to we're going to start getting into is relative extrema and how that relates to graphing pols so let's look a little bit about what relative extrema mean it's not it's not here's what a relative extrem here's what relative extrema means it means a relative Max or relative men you heard that before just to refresh your memory a relative Max is basically the idea of a high point on an interval it doesn't have to be the highest point on the graph just has to be the high point on a little interval so not the peak but it is a peak it is a peak it's a peak for an interval not the absolute not the absolute Max necessarily but it is for an interval the high point here's a better definition a relative Max happens when a function changes from increasing to decreasing that should make sense to us right from increasing to look at from increasing to decreasing we should have a peak that's a relative Max it doesn't have to be the highest point on the graph but that's the definition for relative Max so the high point that's kind of old old definition is not very mathematical this is where a function changes from increasing to decreasing you know what relative Min has basically the opposite definition right there a relative Min is going to be a low point in an interval other in other words it's going to be where you change from decreasing to increasing that should make sense right if you go from decreasing increas you're going to have a little Valley a low point so dot dot dot where the function changes from decreasing to increasing very quick examples for you just so you have a little look at this would you be able to find me my relative extreme of here relative extreme it happens where you are changing from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing so stop me when I get to relative extrema okay here no no because we're not changing from increasing decreasing okay you have that's part of our definition so we're going to start here no where do I get one what is this relative Rel Max very good relative Max is it the absolute Max is it the highest my function goes that would be right that would be how about let's keep going what else here that's a relative men relative men uh keep going this one yep that's another relative Max and then there that's another relative Min and then how about this one yeah even though it's an absolute Max which we'll talk about later it still be a relative Max no problem we have three relative Maxes we have two relative men in this problem do you understand the idea of a relative Max relative men changing from increasing to decreasing for Maxes that gives us a peak decreasing and increasing for men relative men that gives us a value my question is this if this is a change from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing that has to do with the slope doesn't it if the slope is positive we're increasing right the slope is negative we're decreasing true well what happens at a change from increasing to decreasing what does a slope automatically have to do if we're going from increasing to decreasing at some point between a plus slope and a minus slope you have to hit what number you have to hit a zero so what's happening to the slope as I'm getting to a relative Max as I'm getting to relative min max Min ma what's happening to the slope at those points positive increasing zero negative decreasing zero increasing zero decreasing zero so everywhere where we get a slope of zero we're going to have a possible relative Max relative men what we call those are critical numbers so what's happening to the slope at a relative Max REM in the slope is zero so at all these points note the slope is zero for the relative natural the point at which a curve has a horizontal tangent or in other words a slope is zero is called a critical number or critical point that's a little definition for it's called the critical number okay okay well let's think about this for a second all right if your critical number is a place where your slope equals zero do you understand the definition firstly of the critical number critical number is a place where your slope equals zero are they always relative Maxes remains no they're not you can have other things that happen so for instance this curve do you have a point where the slope is zero yeah but this is not changing from increasing to decreasing it goes from increasing to nothing to increasing again just a different concavity do you see it so that could give you a relative maximum it doesn't have to that's the idea of a critical number it's just a place where your slope is zero so if we're trying to find out where all of our slopes are zero for a function can you explain to me maybe the process of doing that let's pretend I give you a function I say I want you to find the critical numbers what might you have to do to find the critical numbers thetive set equal to Z so the derivative gives you slope true if I take the derivative and I set it equal to zero I'm going to find out all the places where my all the critical numbers where my slope equals zero did you follow me on that that's going to give me all my potential relative Maxis and in that's the idea so to find your critical numbers we're going to take the first derivative and set it equal to zero take first derivative set it equal to zero you okay with that as well one more side note um if you get a fraction typically all you have to do is solve for Zer to set the numerator equal to zero right for this process what we're going to learn is that for both the first second derivative I'm going to give you a first and second derivative test in a little while like probably a week uh but when you get there you also have to check the points where the denominator equals zero as well so if you get a denominator you must set that equal to zero as well that gives you undefined points for your slope you need those right you need any undefined points for your slope it's important so little note if you have a denominator set the denominator equal to zero as [Applause] well that could give you any undefined points for your slope which would be a big deal you can change from increase and decrease undefined points let me prove that to you increaseing truth decreasing yes slope is undefined you're going to change from increasing decreasing at that point even though it's not differentiable that gives you a point of change of increasing decreasing do you see what I'm talking about so denominator in the first in the first dtive you said it equal yes okay the denominator of the original function will just tell you where you're undefined a lot of times that will match up okay where you're undefined the function is where you will be undefined for your slope most of the time that happens but occasionally you get some weird stuff that happens so you need to do both can we do an example to finally get away from all this Theory stuff and really get into an example can we do that please are you guys ready for it yeah all right let's go ahead let's find the critical numbers this find the critical numbers of that thing what are we going to have to do to find the critical numbers well critical numbers involve slope right it asks where's a slope equals zero so find the slope function right now that means take a derivative go ahead take a derivative derivative should be pretty easy what's the derivative of this thing man I'm a nice guy don't you see I'm a nice guy I'm a nice guy that's nice that's nice why why is that nice what are you going to have to do that just gives you the slope right because you just found the derivative derivative means slope our critical numbers occur where our slope equals what set equal to zero solve it that's going to give you the X values where your slope equals zero can you solve that yeah that's like piece of cake to solve what are you going to do that's woman ask guy you have options really square root with a plus and minus that's going to give you plus and minus one factor out three different squares plus and minus one either way you can do that two ways okay so in either case here x = 1 x = 1 are those my points for my relative Max and relative Min those are my X values of my potential points for relative Max relative men are the in this case yes this is going to be a relative Max and a relative men uh this one should go Max men okay that's what that should be now we're going to talk all about that later right now I'm just asking to find critical numbers I'll show you how to determine that at a later time are you all right with that are these always giving you relative Max and relative Min the answer is no no they're not I've given you one example of that already this right here is going to show up as a critical number is it automatically a relative Max or relative Min no no there's some cases where it's not okay so you really do have to check on those I'll show you how to check on them later but they're not automatically relative Max or relative men we're going to switch gears just a little bit we're going to move from relative maximum in to Absolute Maxim in now what's absolute mean yeah absolute value would be like posit always positive but absolute means it's the most high or the most low relative you're noticing this we can have lots of relative Maxes right think about a sign curve oh my gosh there's relative Maxes all over that thing those all happen to be the absolute Max for a sign curve but they're all relative Maxes as well for the absolute Max it says what's the highest number you attain if any relative absolute Max and absolute Min means what's the highest or lowest value attained throughout the whole so we'll talk about that uh we'll talk about how to determine it it's not bad so don't don't let it scare you so when we talk about the absolute Max what we mean is the highest point on an interval overall the highest point that happens on that interval well then that would mean the absolute men means the lowest point on an interval as well not one of the low points the lowest that's what absolute how that differentiates from the relative relative could be well there's a few low points absolute minimum means the lowest absolute Max mean the highest is that on an interval or on the function on an interval now the interval could be from negative Infinity to Infinity uh but a lot of graphs don't have an absolute Max on NE into Infinity um in fact lots of polinomial don't so we talk about on intervals as well so some graphs don't have absolute Max or min on this interval for instance just think of a an X Cub okay what's the highest point that attains so it can you say the number does it reach a peak ever do you know how much Infinity is so I do [Music] how I don't no it's Infinity it never reaches an ending point does it it doesn't reach a highest point it keeps going and going and going and going does it ever have a low point the lowest point no this doesn't have an absolute Max or an absolute Min how about this one does that have an absolute Max Max no does it ever reach the highest point no it's Infinity does it have a absolute Min that's right there at 0 that does have one but you'll see some curves don't have the absolute Max in on infity Infinity some do most don't every polinomial doesn't have it has one of the other because polinomial go to Infinity somewhere or another right they they're never horizontally ASM totic so you're always going to get one so we we like to distinguish between everywhere and then certain intervals so an absolute Max is going to be the highest point on an interval that you say it is and the absolute me is going to be the lowest point on an interval that is defined for you or that that you say it is do you follow that that logic there okay okay so even though some graphs don't have an absolute Max or absolute Min on this let me make a little suggestion to you I'm going to suggest that every curve in the world has an absolute Max and an absolute Min on a closed interval would you agree with that on a closed interval so if I say from 3 to two there's going to be a highest point there's going to be a lowest point as long as the function is continuous yes we don't want this idea that would not but as long as it's continuous that's going to happen so this not so much but every function has absolute Max and men if the function continuous on any closed curve I swear you practi is hard front of your mirr on any closed interval open interval not necessarily we'll talk about that in a bit but closed interval absolutely yes okay here's let me let me talk about one little piece of information you kind of need to know uh every continuous function what that means is the function doesn't have to be continuous for the entire space of human existence what it has to or X existence I guess whatever but it has to be continuous on that that closed interval does that make sense to you it's got to be continuous here if it's continuous there it will certainly have an absolute Max a highest point and absolute man a lowest point do you follow me on that if it's continuous for this part it'll be there now where might it exist where might that happen well there's only a set number of points if you think about it if you think about it that's a closed curve true closed curve with my closed interval where could the absolute Maxes and mins possibly occur well they're either going to occur at a relative point where I'm switching from decreasing to increasing or increasing and decreasing it's going to happen either there or it's going to happen at the end point there's only two cases it's either switching from going up to going down that gives us a low point or high point or it's at the end where I would continue to go up but I just chop it off and I go no you stop there haha ha and then it has to occur there does that make sense to you so it's either got to be at an end point or at a relative uh Max or in that means a critical number so what's going to happen for your your absolute Max or in for any closed interval it must take place you should be W it must take place at either a critical number or an end point this will occur at either a critical number or the end point can you raise your hand if you understand that logic that it's going to be one of those two places either going to be where a function changes from going up to going down going down to going up or one of the stopping points of our interval do you follow me on that it's got to be one of those places which means there's only a a few points you need to check when you're find an absolute Max in you're going to be checking your critical numbers by plugging them into your function but you're also going to check your end points we'll do some examples in that in just a second and whatever's the highest one that's your absolute Max whatever's your lowest one that's your absolute Min that's it that's all we're going to have to do this implies one more thing though kind of like a corollary what if I don't have it closed what if I have this what have it open think about this for a second this is an interesting case okay check it out not check out my racing check out what I'm going to write after a race check it out I can race really good if this is closed and the points are included can you all see that the absolute minimum for this interval is right there that happens at actually a relative Min where we change from decreas to increasing the absolute maximum is not this point because there's a point higher it actually occurs at the end point you follow me but now watch what happens if I say aha that would be this case by the way where you're closed what happens if I say no no longer do you have those points now this and that where they're not included that's this case that's this case do you still have an absolute minimum yes that point is the same do you have an absolute maximum it's not here anymore is it do you have an absolute maximum think about the question does this ever stop getting closer let's say this level is three okay let's just pretend that's a three does it ever get to three no does it get to 2.9 does it 2.99 2999 299999 2999999999 can you keep doing that forever and ever and ever so do you ever reach an absolute Max no no no you don't because you can keep getting closer and closer to three between any two points you can find an infinite number of points right between 2999 however much you want to go and three there's an infinite number of of points that you could attain so there is no absolute maximum here what this says is that if you listen carefully if you've got a closed interval you are going to have an absolute Max and an absolute Min if it's closed understand if it's open that means the absolute Max and men must happen if they occur at a relative point at a critical number that's where they have to occur if they don't occur there then they don't exist at all Clos intervals you got both open intervals if they were to occur they would happen at your critical numbers if they don't then they don't exist if they occur if they occur they do so at critical numbers because there are no end points take away the end points here and they have to happen in critical numbers let me do one thing for you okay let's fill out let's say that this is no no longer just open let's say this one is closed does it change the fact that we have an absolute Min but we don't have an absolute Max let's say that I open this one back up and I close that one does that change the problem that now has an absolute Max and that's the idea you're GNA be dealing with those type of intervals on your homework where you're going to be finding your critical numbers no problem if they're closed intervals you check your end points if they're not closed intervals you check your end points but they don't have you check your end points you would still check this you'd say how high does that reach how high does that reach if it reaches close to three if I were to plug it in if it reaches close to three well then that is bigger than this point right that means there is no absolute Max that means that yeah I'd get really close to that number it's bigger than this one but I never get there therefore there is no absolute maximum um so for instance if I asked you this question find the absolute Max between the interval of -1 to 4 and I ask it to you this way if it's this way they're both closed in you follow me absolute Min is here absolute Max is there if I ask it to you this way absolute Min is here absolute Max is there if I ask it to you this way looks like that absolute Min is here absolute Max is up doesn't exist why not because you'd say well if it were to exist it would occur either here at a critical number or here at an end point however I don't have an end point so all you have to do is this this is what you would do you would take this number even though it's not an end point you'd plug it in you plug it into your function and you say is this value bigger than this value function wise because you're not going to have a graph you're going to do this all with your functions you plug it in if this number when you plug it in is bigger than this critical number that the height of that then you can't possibly have an absolute Max because this one's going higher than that that's what you're talking about if you do this nothing changes same same so if you were to go on with the function to the right and come back down and then put like the open interval would you like right here yeah you'd have an absolute Max okay well what we say we do a couple examples here we'll start remember that clock's a little fast so we time so to find your absolute Max and Min you find your critical points and you evaluate them critical [Music] numbers and you evaluate your end points let me give you an example um so that I can I can really flesh this thing out for you and that will end our day make everything nice and clear tell me the first thing you do we're going to do it very quickly what do you do do it that's your D did you get the same derivative oh good my derivative hats on taking right today what do you do with that derivative folks you're setting equal zero because you want to find the place where the slope is equal to zero right that's your critical numbers that's the only places where you could possibly go from up to down to down to up so set it equal to zero and factor and solve what are you going to factor out of that you're going to get x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 you're going to continue to factor you're going to get x - 3 you're going to get x - 2 = 0 you're going to get x = 3 and x = 2 I factored that very fast but I mean that should be kind of no stuff are you guys okay on getting the three and the two are you sure so here's what you check these things right here are called your critical numbers they are the only potential for going from increasing decreasing decreasing increasing your relative Max and men so what you check you check for sure your critical numbers x = 3 x = 2 xal and x what numbers are going to go here and here one and five very good one and five why where am I getting the one and the five sure so one five where do I evaluate those the original the derivative is just going to give you zeros here it's going to give you something worthless for those two we plug into original function because the original function gives you Heights do you understand the original function gives you Heights we want to find out what's the highest and what's the lowest would you take those numbers people on the uh right side my right side you people plug in the first two you people plug in last two make it quick cuz we're out of time as soon as you get them just yell them out to me for the one and the two and for the three and the five you guys have it easy they are I can't do my head I probably be the one if I really thought about it but I want to 37 no wait no way off 15 23 this gives you a height of 23 true this gives you what now 28 28 like it okay uh what else what's the three three and the five come on three and five five I think it's 55 the five is 55 maybe not 55 okay 55 what's the 27 for this one 27 27 27 perfect this is this is perfect numbers for us here is the explanation of absolute Max and absolute men you need to watch carefully this is going to put everything together in your heads right now okay what's the largest number that is attained 55 that is now your absolute Max your absolute Max is not five your absolute Max is 55 it occurs at xal 5 does that make sense to you the absolute Max is 55 it occurs at xal 5 that's the end point do you see the end how the end point comes into play for us so this goes up and then stops that was a picture I drawn earlier what's the minimum value that's obained did they occur critical points or points for this one and points sometimes it'll be critical points let me make one more thing very clear to you and then we'll stop for today what if I had given you this that listen you do exactly the same thing exactly only when you plug this number in and you get the 55 can you actually get to the 55 that you are gone with the max that's how that would disappear this only have an absolute Min in this case if I did this you you'd have nothing no absolute Max no absolute men how people understood today okay we'll do one more example this next time and then we'll continue okay so right now we're in the business of finding absolute Max and absolute men and what we discovered from last time is that well let's see what what you know about this is this going to have an absolute Max and Min for sure why would you say that if it's if it's continuous that's closed so the absolute Max in if this is continuous on the interval will either be between will be between that open interval or at an end point so those closed end points dictate if that's a continuous function that we will have an absolute Max and Min if I have them open do we necessarily have to have an absolute Max and Min no not necessarily it could go way higher than a relative Max relative men so and and never actually get to that point what's our idea of how to find an absolute Max or men what do we do first that's like if you don't know just say derivative and 90% of the time you're right because in calculus the answer's derivative in calculus 2 the answer is integral so if you're falling asleep you're like Mr Leonard says what's this you go derivative 90% of the time you going be right okay in math 4B it's integral yeah you're right that that's that's most of the class so yeah it's a derivative but why oh good very good okay so what we're doing here is realizing that absolute maximums have to occur at either a relative Max or relative Min or an end point to find relative Max or relative Min that's kind of hard to do right there uh to find that you find where the slope is zero changing from increase and decrease and that would give you those Peaks and valleys we evaluate all of the critical numbers and the end points and that will tell us the highest and lowest find me the first derivative please okay first derivative if you do this first derivative says you take down the 4/3 you're going to get 24 over 3 or you simply as you go either way you get eight x to the good minus perfect very good how many people were able to find that good for you all right now what do we do with that good because that is my slope I want to find out where I have a horizontal tangent that's the potential places where I could be switching from increasing decreasing or decreasing increasing potential places we'll check that so here we're going to go ahead set this equal to zero and solve for x how no not that one no factor factor yes Factor but which one the smaller one the smaller exponent is what you factor okay you wouldn't try to factor out x to the 5th out of that would you try fact fact the smaller one and a lot of times it's going to help you so if I factor out x^ the -23 remember that factoring means divide right factor means divide distribution means multiply so factor means divide we're taking our first term sorry divided by the term we are factoring out what happens when you have common bases being divided you are subtracting exponents so do this math in your head 1/3 minus 2/3 you're actually adding 2/3 there you're going to get x to the 1 power do you see what I'm talking about you're going to get x to the so this right here gives you 8 x reason is cuz you have 1/3 -2 2/3 that's 3 over three that's going to be 8X minus well this one's easy X to 2/3 we pull the whole thing out we get one is that a lot easier to solve yeah oh heck yeah yeah this is this you'd be stuck on that if you couldn't factor I mean you stuck but here we now know that we have two factors being multiplied together that gives us zero the zero product property says that either this one is zero or this one don't forget about that one by the way or this one is zero that means xal 0 or x = 1/8 what are those numbers called that we just found what are those critical points critical points or critical numbers I think your book might use critical numbers critical points or critical numbers that's what those say those are where you have potential of having a a horizontal slope or I'm sorry you do have horizontal slope potential of having uh relative Max or relative Min are you okay on finding that the basic algebra if you need help on that you come and see me I'll show you how to factor out negative exponents that should be in from your math C classes or your intermediate algebra classes um now what do we do after that PL into theun these two and what else end points so do that so here's here our X values we're plugging in we're doing- 1 because that's an end point we're going to do zero because that was a critical number we're going to do 1 18 because hey that was a critical number and we're going to do one because that's another end point whichever one of these values is biggest that's your absolute Max whatever one of these values is smallest that's your absolute Min and these the places where they occur I think I made that point last time go ahead and plug those in for me and find out what you get for oh how nice was was I that I gave you eight huh works out so nice cube roots oh you love me now don't you no in M the far okay you will let me get down here little bit see one would you get nine tell you what I'll I'll do this one for you guys just cuz I'm nice guy three 16 what's 16 * 6 9 so 90 I do that wrong 96 96 wait for the whole thing oh no no you you have to subtract six I believe someone tell me what that is you shouldn't be looking at me blankly right now you should have a calculator and you should be working on it don't look at me blankly come on if I can do that in your head you have all calculators you should be able to whip that out oh you know I did I did it wrong it's it's uh I was wrong with that I did with eight not one 616 okay so somehow we got to be able to get those things which is the largest number that we attain that is your absolute Max the absolute Max is not negative 1 okay that's just a place where on the x- axis where you get it so this is your absolute Max it occurs at xal 1 what's your minimum that's the one yeah absolute men n occurs at xal 18 so let's do a couple more questions here okay let's say that I did uh this do I still have an absolute Max yes yeah absolutely yeah that's that end point right I didn't get rid of that end point do I have an absolute Min yes min is that an end point then I still have it that's fine absolute Max no no that's off the table right now so the negative one's gone okay no absolute Max uh absolute Min yes yes that's still there okay so are you starting to see how the end points play a factor in in what you're doing here now let's try one more I want to find the absolute Max and Min on that that function my question is can I check this can I check it on that close interval 0 to one why or why not so if I plug in zero I would get a zero right on the gometer that's not a good thing if I plug in one I'll also get a zero on the geometer you see what I'm saying so on this interval I I I'm not going to have any end points because those are ASM tootes at that at that spot so I'm not going to have any so I can't check this can I check this no no I can only check the open interval so okay well how do we do that well when we doing something like this it's not like you can plug in one and zero right like the polinomial you could just plug the in and see if they're getting bigger or getting smaller you can't do that here so what we're going to have to do is find first the critical numbers that's what we do all the time you with me you find critical numbers you set it equals zero you set the derivative equals z that's fine but then we're going to have to take some one-sided limits we're going to have to find the limit of this thing as we're going towards Zero from the right and the limit of this thing as we're going to towards one to the left that's going to give us where our function is tending now stop for a second just think critically about this you know that there's going to be an ASM toote here and here right so this function is either going to be going way up high or way down low and then way up high or way down low so somewhere we're not going to have an absolute Max or Min or both we don't know we just need the limit to tell us where it's going it could be going like this right in that case we'll have an absolute Min but not an absolute Max could be going like this in that case we'll have The Backs but not men could be going like this or like this in which case we're going to have nothing you follow so we're going to do that now let's go ahead and let's do that before we do the derivative because if it's like this we're done that' be kind of nice right can we do the limits first so limit as X approaches zero X approaches one um zero are we going to be going from the left or from the right to get to Zero from the from the right 0 one you're to get to one you're coming from the yeah now let's do the limit is there anything anything to factor well yes yes there is you can Factor on X is there anything to simplify that X so what you need here is a sign analysis remember the sign analysis that we talked about so if you're talking about sign analysis from zero to one oh you know what we might need a derivative actually because it's going to give us a separating point there um you can plug in a number really close to zero and see what it's doing a really number really close to one but I do want you to check this out let's find the derivative and find our critical numbers and see how it plays A Part here as well it might oh it might not play a part no you know what I doubt it plug in a number between 0o and one would you agree that those are the only places where we actually have a problem so at zero one so anywhere between there between 0 and one our signs are all going to be the same true so we're going to be either all positive or all negative that's going to be interesting so we're probably going to be in one of these situations all up or all down we don't have a separating Point here to critical number won't give us one actually that's just for a slow misspoke earlier um like 5 seconds ago keep track of that the only time that happens kidding anyway uh since we don't have a break between there and that is our interval these are all going to be either negative numbers or all going to be positive numbers I'm guessing since once you when you square fractions they get smaller that this is probably all going to be negative is that true so I plugged in a number between here since these are ASM tootes and we got negative the whole way across true whether you plug in 0.1 or 9999 you're going to get all negative numbers that means our ASM tootes look like this I can guarantee you right now that we're not going to have what minimum we're not going to have an absolute men why not because it goes to NE Infinity for sure even if one side went to NE Infinity it still wouldn't have an absolute minimum you okay which one will we have why it comes it's going to come up and it's going to go back down that says on a continuous function which this one is in that interval that's continuous in that interval that says I will have an absolute Max there how do we find it that's where the first derivative comes in so right do you understand this this said coming from zero coming to Zero from the right gave you negative Infinity coming to one from the left gave you negative infinity negative Infinity is way smaller than any number you can find so that's there that means there's no absolute minimum that's going to the same place no absolute min minimum they don't have to go to the same place okay they go to positive Infinity but this just says that in both cases you're not going to have an absolute minimum do you follow if this one had magically gone to positive Infinity we'd have neither if they' both gone to positive Infinity we would't have an absolute Max but we would have a Min you with me on that the logic there so find these first that might be a great way to do it eliminate some of the your your problem or eliminate uh some of your choices we are not going to have an absolute men now I want you to find the first stative there's a couple options you can move that thing up top and make it negative one you can do a quotient rule for hopefully you're able to find about the same thing by the way some of you your your negatives are are nasty all right some of you are ruining some of your problems based on your negatives especially Distributing your negatives on your implicit differentiation so when you get that homework back I it's already graded I've looked at it but this is too much to pass around in one day there's a lot of it uh so when you look at that check out your I've circled your negatives so you're just not Distributing negatives be careful on that stuff like here if you don't have that parenthesis you put a negative up front without Distributing you're going to be wrong on that plus one do you see what I'm talking about you're be wrong there so here this is Ely -2x + 1 x^2 - x 2 so hands how many people able to find that derivative if you did the quotient rule you'll get the same thing you just have to distribute okay and you'll get -2X plus one did anyone do it that way po rule you got the same thing perfect what do we do with our first derivative in order so that we find our critical numbers what do you set it equal to so do that set it equal to zero now even though that looks really really nasty think about something just think where could this possibly be equal to zero it's not where the denominator equals z because that that's going to give you undefined points in fact that's just going to be zero and one again isn't it so the only place it could possibly be equal zero is where the numerator equals Zer so when you're solving rational equations like this is which you've done before you just have to set the numerator equal to zero and that in this case is very easy which by the way you remember when I had you do all the Distribution on quotient ruling like oh my gosh do we really have to do that can we just leave it in parentheses no because you have to solve it right so you're going to have to distribute it anyway so you may as well do that you're going to get 2 -2x + 1 = 0 subtract 1 divide 92 x is 12 show hands how people feel okay on getting X is2 this row are you guys okay on this all right hey x = 12 is that in our interval yes you should check that right you should probably check that uh so that's in our interval that means within our interval we are certainly as as I magically predicted we're going to have some sort of a critical number there because we were down here we're down here it's got to reach a Peak at some point at least one Peak how do you find that Peak plug it in do I need to check my end points no do I have any end points no we've already done that work first we know that our end point points we not have any it's going to keep going down forever so all you got to do with this since you know it's going down forever you know for certain that is going to be an absolute Max it's continuous this is negative Infinity that's negative Infinity it has to go up it has to come down since it is continuous so you just plug in 1/2 whatever value that is that's an absolute Max what'd you get anybody else get ne 1/4 yes you plug it into well not your derivative right that would just give you slope plug it into here so is the absolute Max 1/2 or is absolute Max 1/44 wait a second it's actually it's on the bottom thanks Scott because I I was just taking whatever I was pluging it into good it's all right reciprocated you're going to get4 forg the absolute is the absolute max4 or 1/2 it's -4 it occurs at X = one2 so at start x = 12 that's your absolute maximum for that function can you do it yes how many people feel okay with what we just talked about so our ideas are if you don't if you have one of these weird functions man and you can't plug in the end points you're going to if you can't plug those in if it's not a polinomial and you literally can't plug it in do your sign analysis you know they're going to be ASM tootes right we've talked about that you know they're going to be ASM toes they're either going to do this this or this right they're gonna do one of those things like dance moves anyway that's what's that's what it's going to be it's going to do this or this or this I'm so awesome on the dance board by the way so cool not really not at all I'll do my calculus dance um so you you know you're going to eliminate some of your choices here so there won't be minimums and maximums in some cases then you find your derivative then you know what you have after that okay if if you get a minus and a plus then you're done yeah you don't even have to do the you're done those are nice problems those won't happen very often but those are nice problems most time you're going to get this or that otherwise problem is kind of stupid right anyway do you have a good feeling about absolute maximum if you have end points you check end points and critical numbers if you don't have end points you check critical numbers and you do one side limits of side analysis and that's that's the basic goal
