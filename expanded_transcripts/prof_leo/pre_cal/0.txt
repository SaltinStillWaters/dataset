Transcript for: Intro to Precalculus (Precalculus - College Algebra 1)
hey everybody welcome to the professor Leonard series on precalculus so since this is the first video I want to let you know what's gonna happen in this series so you know what to expect and you know how to progress through it so what precalculus is in most courses is kind of a combination of two classes we combined College Algebra and we combine trigonometry and both of those are incredibly incredibly important to your study in calculus a lot of teachers self included kind of say you take calculus to finally fail algebra essay than a joking matter because by the time you get there you should know your stuff you'll be fine with it but really there's some truth to that that people kind of make it through algebra don't really retain it sorry to make it through trigonometry but don't retain it and then calculus is very difficult when that happens so what I'm going to intend to do in this this series is to teach you college algebra and trigonometry so pre calculus in such a way that it sticks with you in such a way that you could transition right to calculus one and have a very very good chance of success so that's that's my goal for this so what you're gonna see in the video titles is you're gonna see the topic that we're covering you're gonna see precalculus which is the whole course in one kind of main idea a group together and then you can see whether this is a college algebra or a trigonometry concept in the filming we're gonna film college algebra first so all of the videos up until about 2/3 of the way through precalculus is going to be college algebra then we'll transition to trigonometry so it'll be a very clear kind of stop and start of those two subjects you need both you need both the college algebra and the trigonometry to be successful in calculus so whether you're taking precalculus or you're just taking college algebra or you're just taking trigonometry these will work for you as I'm going through it I want to kind of almost warn you that I'm not going to take a lot of background information for granted so when you see me review you're going to get a lot of that through this so I'm going to be explaining concepts that perhaps you should know but I'm not going to take for granted the fact that you do and so I'm going to be explaining what a function in its most basic form because these fundamental concepts as you're moving forward are extremely important to get perfectly right there can be no misconceptions with this stuff as we're moving forward otherwise you're you're sort of building information on a false premise and so if you build all this knowledge on something that's not really sturdy it's gonna collapse eventually so I'm gonna make sure that our foundation is super solid as we go through at this point you should have some beginning algebra you should have intermediate algebra sort of down I will be refreshing that that's what I was just talking about about kind of reviewing materials to go through but other than that you guys would be fine it's gonna be super fun it's gonna be a great course I just want to explain to you a little bit about how it's going so when you step into this college ultra first trigonometry those two things make up precalculus and absolutely necessary for success in calculus ones so I hope you enjoy the videos I'm enjoying making them and so we'll see you soon you
