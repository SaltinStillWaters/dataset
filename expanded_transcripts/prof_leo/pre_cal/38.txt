Transcript for: Graphing Rational Functions with Transformations (Precalculus - College Algebra 39)
hey there everybody welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about some rational functions as they relate to transformations the main thing i want you to get out of this video is the interplay between two new functions and their vertical asymptotes or each vertical asymptote that these these functions have the oddness and the evenness of multiplicity what that looks like this is a great video that gives us kind of a a stepping stone onto graphing rational functions because these two graphs are going to help us really deal with how a function kind of interplays with a vertical asymptote when we get to rational functions and we deal with those vertical asymptotes as a whole so we're going to study two new functions we're going to look at their asymptotes there's a horizontal and a vertical we'll deal with some key points we're going to try and do some transformations but as we go through this remember what i want you to get out of it i want you to see how the the function interplays with the vertical asymptote that's what i'm trying to get you to see here so let's take a look at the first first two functions we have two functions f of x equals one over x and then f of x equals one over x squared this first function is called the reciprocal function sometimes they're both rational functions but this has a special name called the reciprocal function so if you ever ask for that that's what they're referring to and we're going to go ahead and graph them the first thing i want to do is what we practiced last time dealing with a vertical asymptote you know this that the first thing we do in graphing is look at the domain so let's take a look at the domain of one over x and right off the bat we see that if x equals zero we have a pretty serious problem you remember this that we'd factored this it's already factored it set every factor on the denominator that's just x equal to zero and that defines our domain so we'd say okay we cannot allow x to equal zero so at x equals zero we have something that's not allowed either a hole or a vertical asymptote that's the way in which we can't allow x to equal zero so we're going to say it that's kind of what we're doing so we'd set x equals zero and say that's a problem that creates this domain issue for us and that defines a graph issue so we look at x we say hey at x equals zero that factors uh that factor is causing a problem for us so let's see if we can cancel the factor out if we can then that's a whole if we can't then that is a vertical asymptote and we say well we can't cancel out x there's no way to do that so at x equals zero we have what is called a vertical asymptote it's going to abbreviate va for vertical asymptote and then we notice that the power of x is 1. that gives us an odd multiplicity vertical asymptote and as we studied in the last video we know that odd vertical asymptotes behave like this or like this depend on some signs so this is odd here's what i want you to associate with odd vertical asymptotes that the odd means opposite so odd or opposite infinity so if you can remember that odd multiplicity for vertical asymptotes means opposite infinities that's kind of the same idea for odd x-intercepts that was opposite sides that's why they had to cross here we have opposite infinities you don't cross anything with them because they're it's not continuous but they go to opposite infinities and we talked about why that was in that video so here's what we know about this we know right now that at x equals 0 we have a vertical asymptote we're going to show that with a vertical dotted line and so what that sort of is is like a force field this graph cannot touch that and but it's going to interact with it it's going to come up to it and either go up or down depending on some signs we're going to figure this this out in a minute but it cannot cross it that's why this this function is not continuous across the entire x-axis it is on its domain because the domain excludes x equals zero but not on the entire x-axis let's go ahead and do the two of the things we need for transformations number one i'm just going to tell you right now that this thing has a horizontal asymptote we're going to study this in the very next video like when you would get a horizontal asymptote i'm going to show you right now that end behavior can give you a horizontal asymptote this horizontal line that your function actually can cross but ultimately at the end behavior is going to tend to to that value and so this horizontal asymptote is at y equals zero horizontal remember y equals a value vertical as x equals horizontal is y equals and this is going to be zero how i know that is because if you let x increase without bound or decrease without bound so in other words it's this idea of a limit a limit is take x and let it approach never really get there but approach some value get really really really really really really close to or get closer and closer and closer to some value if we let x increase to like positive infinity and one stays the same well then one divided by a number that's really really really really really really really big is very very very very very very very close to zero does it ever equal zero no it doesn't and that's the idea of a limit in as simple as i can make it for you let's let x go to negative infinity well one divided by something that's really really really really big in absolute value but negative is still going to be close to zero but sort of a negative approaching of zero so this graph has that horizontal asymptote at y equals 0. we're going to show that with another dotted line and so we know this has two asymptotes it has a vertical it's got a horizontal at x equals 0 and y equals 0 respectively now we're going to talk about some key points so the key points here are well really just found by trying to plug in some values now we know we can't evaluate zero why not well that's a domain restriction but we can evaluate at x equals one and x equals negative one and you remember that key points are really important for our transformations we're gonna use them here too and they're really just trying to plug in one zero and negative one if we can't plug in zero we just plug in one negative one so let's evaluate let's put in 1. 1 divided by 1 is 1. so we're going to have this key point of 1 1. and likewise if we evaluate for negative 1 1 divided by negative one is negative one so we have negative one negative one and you might have kind of guessed by the exponent that multiplicity was one and so we might assume that this is an odd function well our key points bear that out and the way that our signs interact also bear that out so even an oddness is usually just power functions of polynomials but when we take a look at this this at least that's where you get the name from this is an odd function and so we do have the symmetry about the origin so if you take this picture and rotate 180 degrees you're getting the same picture what that means is that when we graph this we have to interact appropriately with our asymptotes and still make it through our key points so here's how this function absolutely has to to look and if you think about it if you plug in positive values you're going to get positive values you're going to be in this first quadrant if you plug in negative values of x you're going to be getting out negative values you're going to be in the third quadrant so how this function looks it's about like that it gives you a very very good look at what nearly every well not near i can't say nearly every asymptote looks like but all odd asymptotes are going to have this sort of relationship either this or if that was negative it would reflect notice how the signs would reflect if you had a negative here negative 1 over x then positives would give you negatives negatives would give you positives it would reflect this image so this right here is how every single odd vertical asymptote multiplicity one or three or five or odd is going to look odd means opposite infinities it's a very good practicing tool for us when we get to graphing rationals understand that a odd vertical asymptote is going to look like that odd means opposite infinity so keep that in the back of your head now let's move on to the next one we're going to do the same thing but but pretty quick so we're going to do kind of likewise what we did over here we're going to take our domain and say all right let's look at our function and it's completely factored all right how we deal with domain is we take every factor in the denominator and we set it equal to zero well there's only one factor there's x it happens to be repeated but there's only one factor so we say hey if we take that factor and set it equal to zero we are going to have a domain issue x can't equal 0. now we look back at that that x can you cancel out the factor that's giving you the domain problem if you can you have a hole if you can't you have a vertical asymptote well we can't so we define our domain and using the domain and the fact that we cannot cancel any factors helps us to find to define what happens at that value of x for which this function is not defined so at x equals 0 we have a problem this says you can't allow x equals you can't allow x equals zero and now we're saying how you can't allow it are you not allowing it by it being a whole just a missing point or are you not allowing it by a vertical asymptote and for the same reason we had over here we are going to have a vertical asymptote however the multiplicity matters multiplicity of a vertical asymptote will tell you how it behaves so when we look at that go hey that's a that's a multiplicity 2 for the factor that gave us a domain problem for the factor that caused a vertical asymptote that multiplicity 2 is even well an even vertical asymptote does something different than an odd vertical asymptote odd has opposite infinities even has this idea of symmetry across this vertical line it has this idea of same infinities either both up or both down so when we take a look at that all right well we know we have a vertical asymptote we're going to do the same thing we're going to draw that vertical line at x equals zero so that's x equals zero just like this one was this also has a horizontal asymptote for the limit ideas but i want you to look at it if i start plugging in really really really really big positive numbers by the way i'm trying to preface our next our next video on horizontal asymptotes here just to get your your brain kind of rolling on it if i start plugging in really really big values of x i'm going to get really really really little numbers and a fraction so one divided by like a billion is close to zero a billion's not even close to infinity so like one divided by a billion squared oh my gosh that's like super close to zero one divided by a trillion squared that's even closer to zero so as i go this way for a long way this function is going to get super close to zero even faster than this one did now let's plug in some negative numbers if i plug in negative numbers but wait a minute i'm squaring them if you take a negative number and you square it you end up still getting a positive well that's true so if i take really negative numbers like negative a billion and i square it i'd still get one over a billion squared it's going to be a perfectly symmetrical graph man i need you to see that i need to see that this graph has symmetry across the y-axis y because that's a vertical asymptote because if i plug in positives and negatives x squared takes the same value for those if i plug in one or negative one negative a billion or positive a billion i'm going to get the same exact values out it's a mirror image so this models perfectly how an even vertical asymptote works it's going to say well well yeah i mean if it's symmetrical you have to be going to the same infinity if this is opposite you have to go into different infinities the signs would be different here so we know that this is going to look like this if this is positive or if i put a negative in front i get all negative values so no matter what if i plug in any number here right now is the way it is i'm getting all positives if i put a negative in front of that and i square it and then make everything negative i get all negative values so we know what that's going to look like this also has a horizontal asymptote for the same reasons that one did um and i just explained that so as we go to positive and negative infinity a limit idea says what's the value of the function approaching what's it getting to as your x gets to this value so as our x gets a negative infinity this function is getting close to zero as x gets a positive infinity this function is getting close to zero it's doing the same thing on both sides it has that symmetry now we're going to do our key points so key points work the same way as this did if i plug in 1 hey 1 divided by 1 squared is still 1. we can't evaluate zero we have already talked about why it's not even defined there but we can evaluate negative one if i evaluate negative one negative one squared is one one divided by one is positive one and we get the same look for even functions that we got for odd functions here we have that if now i hope you remember this for every odd function we had the key points of 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 negative 1. now we're missing the 0 0 because of the domain restriction but we have the same key points as 1 1 and negative 1 negative 1. for even we always got 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 positive 1. well we're missing 0 0 again for domain restriction but we have the same key points at least these two key points is every other even function giving us that symmetry across that vertical line which i want you to see as an asymptote now we're going to go ahead and evaluate so or sorry how to graph it so when we graph it we have to behave with both our vertical and horizontal asymptote it's going to be a little bit more dynamic of a graph than this it's going to get smaller quicker about like that kind of mess up that side but you should get the feel for it so before we move on to transformations i just want to make sure that you see what i'm trying to get you to see number one that these functions model what an odd vertical asymptote and an even vertical asymptote will look like all of the time yes you can reflect this yes you can reflect this so even vertical asymptote will always look like this or like this depend on sign issues odds will always look like this like this depending on sign issues they all look like that and i need you to know that so we're going to practice that right now i'm going to show you the transformations we're going to be transforming with our shifting remember up down left right reflecting uh using our key points we're going to be doing that that's why we get our key points here but i always i'm going to be referring to hey take a look at your vertical asymptote and see how this is relating so that's what we're going to do all right let's get started so we have f of x equals one over x squared plus three how we deal with transformations even on rational functions is to based on some sort of a basic graph shape and these two are now in our library of functions we have the reciprocal function and 1 over x squared we know odd variable asymptote and we know even that's basically what that's doing for us so this is based on this sort of x squared one over x squared idea we should kind of know that we're either doing this or doing this depending on what sign we're given since that's positive we're probably gonna do this we have this even vertical asymptote but we have this plus three what we learned a long time ago and if you wanna refresh your memory go back and watch transformations video that plus three is a vertical shift anything after the function outside of parentheses after like the function's been dealt with uh plus or minus plus means up and minus means down so that's a vertical shift up three units this uh would does not have a vertical sorry a horizontal shift left or right that would happen in parentheses like that one so all this plus three is doing the same hey take this function shift it up three spots and that's about it so if it doesn't shift left or right but it does shift up what that does to our function it takes our asymptotes and it moves those as well well wait a minute that means that's a really nice way to graph and this is why i taught you the transformations that i did a long time ago is because it's modeled right here perfectly so what that plus three does it says well wait a minute if i had a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero like i did here but i'm shifting up three units let's just imagine that my horizontal asymptote is going to be shifted up three and you know what it is gonna be shifted at three well hang on is it what about our vertical asymptote are we shifting that left to right and the answer is no that x squared there's there's nothing being added or subtracted inside parentheses before we square it so i'm not shifting my vertical asymptote at all so he looked at we said okay this is going to be this type of a graph i'm shifting it up three i've moved my horizontal asymptote up three i didn't have to move my vertical asymptote at all and now i just need to put in my key points and i can graph this so my key points are usually 1 1 and negative 1 1. why well because it's even we already figured out this is an even function and it has the same key points as every even function that's an odd function all of these are going to have the key points like that odd function unless you start manipulating them like reflecting them or multiplying by some sort of a constant coefficient so let's go ahead and plot that here's one one and negative one positive one but we're going to plot it in relation to where we shifted this horizontal and vertical asymptote we don't want to go down here and put one one that's not going to work because we shifted everything up you're going to put this at 1 1 and negative 1 1 in relation to like your new x y axis i know this doesn't exist here like this is not your actual x-axis this is your horizontal asymptote we did shift that so that's what that is use your key points in relation to that just wherever your horizontal asymptote is that's where your key points fit so 1 1 and negative 1 1 in relation to that that uh that horizontal asymptote the real points are 1 4 and negative 1 4. that's true also i want to make this this mention if you want to be a little bit more accurate with this do things like find the y-intercept now we can't here because x is equal to zero it gives us this domain problem so we can't do that uh but what we could do is plug in something like one-half uh negative one-half or plug in one-half and use symmetry if i plug in one-half one-half squared is one-fourth but one divided by one-fourth is four four plus three is seven so if i plug in one-half i get seven now remember this is even function it has to be symmetrical across that vertical asymptote i'm going to start saying that very specifically that it's symmetrical across your vertical asymptote because as we shift you're going to lose that thought of symmetrical across the y because we're shifting that asymptote but it will be symmetrical across the vertical asymptote so if i plug in negative one half i would have to get the same value that gives us a little bit better of a graph we know that we have to behave with our asymptotes and we get an x one over x squared graph just shifted up three units and that's a very solid graph for very minimal work that's what i would expect for you to do is be able to look at this and think oh that's one of x squared that's going to look like this or like this oh that's a vertical shift up three great that's not reflected because it's positive i'm not changing my my key points at all i'm going to shift use my key points and then i'm going to graph now let's take a look at the vertical asymptote to make sure that it models what we thought it would model so if i take a look at this domain wise and i look at hey let's look at our denominator our denominator is uh just as a factor of x if i set that equal to zero that defines a domain problem for me so i look at my my factor can i cross out the x or the x squared no i can't so at x equals zero i have a vertical asymptote and the multiplicity is even that gives us the symmetry that's exactly we said here and that's why this picture looks that way here's our vertical asymptote x equals zero here's the evenness of it it's going to the same infinity and that's what i want you to know let's move on to the next example okay so we got g of x equals one over x minus one squared minus 2. the first thing that we want to do if we're going to do this transformation wise is we're going to identify our shifts so that minus 2. notice how here's our function it's based on this power 2. man i need to see that this is like based on the one over x squared it's just it has a shift and another shift we always want to deal with the vertical shift first because this gives us just an easier way to identify what the horizontal line is frankly so i'm going to look at that go okay that minus 2 that is a vertical shift down 2 units after the function we identify that as a vertical shift down what that does for us let that move your asymptotes so here's our negative 2. that's going to give us our horizontal asymptote at y equals negative 2 now so we just shifted it down two spots now what's the minus 1 do anything in parentheses including here even though it looks weird anything in parentheses is a horizontal shift in your function and so here we have that minus one the problem is is that it's opposite so minus one is a shift to the right not a shift to the left i know we kind of want it to be but we studied that in transformations we identified why that was so that -1 is a shift to the right one unit well now what that does it says hey if you had a vertical asymptote at y equals zero but this entire function is shifted to the right it's going to shift that vertical asymptote to the right as well it's not going to change the fact that it's even it's just going to move it and so we've moved this horizontal asymptote down to sure that we'll function shift it down to and right one should the whole function shift to the right one and now from there because your key points interact specifically with your asymptotes we're going to plot our key points but we're going to do it in relation to where this stuff ended up so we're going to plot our key points of 1 1 and negative 1 1 it's an even function it has to be that it's even in relation only to that vertical asymptote though notice how it's not an even function anymore so like in relation to the y-axis it's not going to be symmetrical about the y-axis but it is going to have symmetry across your vertical asymptote by showing it by doing it this way you're actually showing the axis of symmetry automatically so again down to move your horizontal asymptote uh left right one move your vertical asymptote you've shown axis of symmetry you will have symmetry about that vertical line but no longer the y axis and now we're going to plot it so we're going to use the same scale but plot our key points from our of our new horizontal and vertical asymptote that's from here that's 1 1 and negative 1 1. if we wanted to be a little bit more specific on where things happen we might want to plug in some other values like you could plug in one half or uh one and a half if you wanted to use some symmetry there you could plug in the value like three you could plug in a value like negative one and get a more specific curve out of it now since we know the shape of this we can we can sketch it pretty accurately we know that because this is even we have these key points you've already shown your key points this graph has to look like this has to interact with their asymptotes in a certain way every even asymptote vertical asymptote will look like that or reflected and going downward now let's take a look at our our vertical asymptotes specifically from a domain standpoint make sure that it matches and we're really good to go so how we would deal with domain is you would take the factor on the denominator after everything's factored set all the factors on the denominator equal to zero you're using the zero product property in a way that says if your denominator equals zero you got a problem well every factor can make that happen so x minus one equals zero says at x equals one you have a problem that is your domain you can allow any value on the x-axis except for one well now use that and what the factor well sorry what the function says about the factor to define what happens at one do you have a whole or a vertical asymptote so we look back and say hey x equals one is a problem that's why it's excluded from our domain comes from a factor of x minus one so can you cancel out x minus one uh no so that means it's a vertical asymptote so we're using the factor to define what's happening at this exclusion so you can't allow one so at x equals one you have some sort of a domain problem a discontinuity either it's a hole or a vertical asymptote well at x equals one we know that that's going to be a vertical asymptote due to the fact you can't cancel out the factor but we also know that the factor has a multiplicity 2 that is giving us an even and even vertical asymptote even vertical asymptotes have to have at least a symmetry of infinity along that vertical asymptote that's going to be both go to positive infinity or both good and negative so we know for sure that this fits our model so we have even hey you're going to positive infinity from as x approaches 1 from the left and the right so as we get there from the left we're going yeah we're getting closer and closer from the right yep we're getting closer closer but it's positive and i want you to look at this just think through and this is how we sort of start talking about limits think through if you plugged in numbers that were real real close to one but positive stick with me here don't lose focus if i get really close to one from the positive values so i'm talking about like one point zero zero zero zero one one point zero zero zero zero one minus one is point zero zero zero zero one if i square that it's even smaller point like point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one one divided by that value is huge take it on your calculator if you want one divided by point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one is really really really big now subtract two from it you still get something that's freaking huge so as i get closer to one from the right hand side i'm getting epically large values do the same thing from the left hand side plug in something like 0.9999999999 0.99999999 minus 1 is point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one but negative well square it oh wait squaring negative numbers gives us something that's positive one divided by that really small positive number is going to do the same exact thing as the right hand side did it's gonna give you epically large numbers even if you subtract 2. so that's why this looks the way it does is when we're getting close to a value that's giving us 0 on a denominator think about this really focus here use your critical thinking if i'm getting close to a value on the x-axis that's giving me zero then just to the left and right is going to be really close to zero but i'm dividing by that number any constant divided by something that's approaching zero not zero itself you can't divide by zero but something approaching zero really close to it is going to give me very very very large numbers one divided by something super close to zero is still going to be super big try to calculate a few times if you want take one divide by like point zero one divide by point zero zero zero one divide by points and put as many zeros you can and then a little one and you're going to see those those numbers get really large that's why this looks that way we explored a little bit when we talked about vertical asymptote in last video but now that you're seeing it you should it should be kind of gelling on why this is looking the way that it is why they're going to the same infinity because you're squaring both a negative and a positive number and getting the same output we're going to come back with two more examples we'll deal with one of these and one of these again and then we'll be done all right let's go ahead and start the next example so let's take a look at h of x equals negative 2 over x plus 3 squared minus 4. first thing i want you to notice is what the function is based on so this is based on that 1 over x squared idea it's just been shifted around a lot and then reflected and the outputs have been multiplied by 2. that's what we should have learned when we got into transformations a whole bunch of videos ago we're just applying it here and taking a look at how this relates to a vertical asymptote so i'm going to start the same way i'm going to start by saying that right there says we have a shift down 4. so let's go ahead and do that let's move our horizontal asymptote down 4. next we say well what's that do inside of parentheses in your function with your variable when it's right next to the variable in parentheses what you have is some sort of a horizontal shift plus means left and minus means right so this is a shift left three units well that also shifts our vertical asymptote we're going to have symmetry here for sure but it's around the vertical asymptote and now we're going to identify our key points so how this function the one over x squared function works it's based on an even function so it's based on the fact that we have to have negative 1 1 and positive 1 1 as key points however if you remember the coefficient of your of the parenthetical expression of your factored function in this case that's factored and this is this x is your coefficient that negative 2 that factor it acts as a factor it is a multiplier of your output so basically what happens is you plug in a value add 3 to it that's going to shift left you'd square it and then you'd multiply that by negative 2 before subtracting 4 so that that that product that negative 2 what that does is that affects your output so we multiply that output by negative two including the output of our key points so that's going to shift that well it's going to transform a little bit it's going to stretch that and reflect it so we'd get okay take the negative two multiply your outputs not your inputs just your outputs and that gives us sort of a manipulated key point here so what have we done we've shifted down four yeah move your horizontal axis uh sorry horizontal asymptote we've shifted left three yeah move your vertical asymptote we had key points but we know that negative two affects the output so let's multiply that we're still going to get symmetry we still have an even base function it's not even as far as related to the y-axis anymore but it is related to your axis of symmetry or your vertical asymptote they're the same thing when you deal with these these transformed rational functions based on just a a sort of a power function for rationals so when we do this we're going to say all right let's use the same scale and plot 1 negative 2 and negative 1 negative 2 from here so here's 1 negative 2 1 2 and negative 1 negative 2 1 2. this is going to give us that look now remember we have to interplay with our asymptotes so we know that we still have a vertical asymptote there is no way that we're going to be able to do this up here and still maintain our horizontal asymptote so we're going to have to come up and go down so this is decreasing and then increasing as we go from left to right it still has to be symmetrical about that vertical asymptote now this function is a little bit off because i didn't check for the y intercept so if we wanted to we could do stuff like that so if we wanted to plug in zero zero is always going to give us a y-intercept is it going to be a y-intercept on this no no no this is the axis of symmetry this is our vertical asymptote if you plug in zero you will get the y-intercept so let's let's try that plug in 0 and add 3 you're going to get 3. 3 squared's 9 negative 2 divided by 9 is negative 2 9. minus 4 is negative 4 and 2 9. so i have this a little off it looks like i went right through negative five it really should be a bit higher missed it again and then we could use that symmetry to do the same thing over here so we'd say this is one two three units away from the y axis go over one two three away and you'd have to go through negative four and two nights as well now let's take a look at the vertical asymptote from the nature of a domain standpoint make sure it matches and then we're gonna be good to go so if we had to do this by just studying the domain what we would do is we we'd look at our factored function which we have and we'd set the factors on the denominator equal to zero by the zero product property checking for domain issues you go well there's only one factor yeah it's x plus three so when we've discovered our domain say yeah you cannot allow x to equal negative three we haven't there's nothing on x equals negative three some students get confused and say well i thought you couldn't intersect the y-axis well you can if you start shifting these these um rational functions around you certainly can it's just that if your domain says x cannot equal zero and you shift it well where you shift to 2 x kind of cannot equal that value we shifted left 3 units that's why we cannot allow x equals negative 3. how we can't allow it is look at your factor if you can't cancel it it's a vertical asymptote so at x equals three we have a vertical asymptote the multiplicity of which is two that means it's even that means it has to go to the same infinity either both oops positive or both negative that's a must and so here we're going to both negative infinity as we approach negative 3 from the left and right if you want to go through that that's sort of um not really a proof but an exploration of why it does that do it do it right now take something like negative zero zero zero 3.000 one uh negative three point zero zero zero zero one plus three is negative point zero zero zero zero one squared is positive but very small negative two divided by a very very small positive number is a very very large negative number and the same thing would happen if you plugged in negative 2.99 2.99999 plus 3 is 0.0001 squared is even smaller negative 2 divided by a very small positive number negative divided by a very small positive is going to give you a very large negative number that's why they approach the same infinity if you didn't catch that think through it a couple more times before you continue trust me it's important if you understand that idea all right let's look at our last example we got g of x equals negative one over x plus one and then plus two some students have a hard time seeing what that is related to well what i'm going to show you is that when you deal with the reciprocal function and the transformed versions of it it really helps to show factors on your denominator so when we factor this you go well 1 you can't factor or even negative 1 if you think about that you can't factor and x plus 1 is already its own factor well wait a minute if x plus 1 is already factored enough let's just call that a factor and then it's a lot easier to see what's going on oh there's my parentheses there's my power one so this is based on the reciprocal function of one over x it just happens to be shifted how is it shifted you should think through that right now how is that shifted what's the plus two do what's the plus one in parentheses do well the plus two shifts up two units that also shifts our horizontal asymptote that plus one shifts left one well that also shifts our vertical asymptote do we have key points yes of course but remember this is now based on an odd function there is no even power there anymore this is based on odd functions this is one over x so the key points for one over x or any odd function are one one and negative one negative one that's what we would normally graph however just like we had in that example that negative 2 affected our outputs this negative 1 is also going to affect our outputs you know that that's a reflection so instead of doing this this graph is going to do this it's still gonna have opposite infinity so we know one over x does but we're going to have to reflect it so this negative one actually changes our key points a bit we're going to get 1 comma negative 1 and negative 1 comma positive 1. it's reflected that and we're going to graph that in relation to our sort of new x y axis or if you want to think about this way our asymptotes these are related to our asymptotes so we know that we're going to get 1 negative 1 in relation to where these asymptotes cross so based on that scale here's 1 negative 1 and here's negative 1 positive 1. so one negative one one negative one and one negative one positive negative one positive one this gives us that sort of opposite signs for an odd it's going to yield opposite infinities we are still going to have symmetry but it's no longer symmetric about the y-axis sorry the origin the original origin it's symmetric about the new origin now this is not really the origin of the graph but this is where we shifted to so we do have symmetry but it's about that point no longer that point because we shifted now let's think about what this would have to do in order to obey our asymptotes and still hit these key points we have to look like this and we are sketching if you want to be a little bit better about it we plug in some values like um negative one-half we do something like that we plug in maybe negative one and a half if you want to plug in something like negative two well it's not negative two we already have that point but something like uh one or negative three you could do that you can still use symmetry here as well so if you wanted to you could plug in something like one and so let's see let's do that so if i plug in one i would get one plus one is two uh negative one over two is negative one half plus two is positive one and a half so i know that this has a point at one comma here's one and a half right about there well what that means is that if i if i take this symmetry please watch carefully where's the symmetry happen across the y or across the axis of symmetry and it's got to be the axis of symmetry that vertical asymptote this is one two units away from the axis of symmetry if i go two units away on the other side one two and then i take this as all right this was half a unit below the horizontal asymptote at this value i need to be half a unit above the vertical asymptote and that's it right right there then we can use the symmetry remember how how odds work you do opposite values equals opposite values so if i was two units away from the axis of symmetry and i have an odd function one's below and one's above the same exact sort of spacing if you will on that horizontal asymptote so we can do that use uh use symmetry as well and get a fairly good looking graph for at least minimal work now let's take a look at the domain make sure that actually works domain would say from a factored function in this case a rational we're going to take every single factor on the denominator that has a variable and set it equal to zero that's going to define what we can't have in our domain you can't allow negative one we haven't uh so how can't you have it can you cancel the factor no if you can't then you have a vertical asymptote and in this case the multiplicity is odd ah means opposite infinities in one of those ways depending on the sign of the function which we talked about so this is model perfect this says hey at x equals negative one we can't allow it how can you allow it sort of like a force field this vertical asymptote you can't touch that how it's going to interact is it's going to give you opposite infinities now focus on the why why is it doing this if we start plugging in some values that are getting really close to negative one this is called a limit so as we're approaching from the left and from the right what is happening from the right hand side as we get closer to negative one from the right hand side this is like negative point nine nine nine nine nine nine focus on this if i plug in negative 0.99999999 negative 0.999999999 plus 1 is positive positive .00001 to the first power that's still positive 0.000001 but a negative constant any constant really divided by a super small number is going to be an epically large negative number and that's an octave one but an absolute value is really big it's just negative so a negative divided by a really small positive is very very negative that's negative infinity even when you add 2 it's still going to be approaching negative infinity that's why this graph has to do this now focus on the other side stick with me if i go from the left this is from the left hand side if i plug in something getting really close to negative 1 like negative zero zero zero 1.000000 zero for a whole long time and a little one and i add one what's going to happen negative one point zero zero zero zero one plus one is still negative point zero zero zero zero one now i take the first power oh my gosh it's still negative but wait negative to 1 divided by a negative really small number negative divided by negative is a positive but it's going to be huge a huge positive number so as i'm coming this way i'm starting to get really really really really really big numbers and i add 2 it's even bigger that's going to explode to positive infinity this is why these have opposite infinities odds always do this because they have opposite signs for values that are on opposite sides of a vertical asymptote that's why evens are different than that evens have the same sign for opposite sides of a vertical asymptote i hope that makes sense i hope now you have a very good connection between the transformations and these rational functions and seeing what a vertical asymptote will do it's a hugely important thing because we're going to be graphing these we're not going to do specifically with key points but we're going to be using the fact that odds do this or this and evens do this or this and now hopefully you have a better understanding of why so next time we'll talk about horizontal asymptotes we'll talk about oblique asymptotes and then we'll start getting into graphing rationals hope you're doing well
