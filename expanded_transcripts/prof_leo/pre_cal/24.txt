Transcript for: Solving Quadratic Inequalities (Precalculus - College Algebra 25)
hey there in this video i'm going to teach you about quadratic inequalities what they are what they do what they represent and how to solve them it's pretty quick there's not a whole lot to understanding more than what you already know but the reason why we're covering this video is because later on we're going to talk about rational inequalities and we're going to mirror exactly what we're doing here in that video so what a quadratic inequality is quadratic in quadratics are these functions that when you graph them it gives you a parabola inequalities are these things that say hey there's an interval for which we are above greater than or below less than some other value or function and so what a quadratic inequality does is put those ideas together let's take a look at our first example so in this example we've got x squared minus 3x minus 10 is less than or equal to zero what this means and this will give you a huge step up on how to solve this what this means is consider what this is that's a parabola x squared minus 3x minus 10 is an upward opening parabola zero is a constant in fact this horizontal straight line at y equals zero well that's the x axis so practically speaking this says this take this upward opening parabola and find out where it is below less than the x-axis y equals zero or an output of zero that's all that this is so really what we're asking here all these problems that we do in quadratic inequalities practically asks once we change them into where's the parabola below or above zero that that's all that this is about so we're going to be setting these on one side greater than or equal to less than or equal to greater than or less than zero figuring out where if if at all these things cross the x-axis which is zero and then figuring out where we're above or below depending on the inequality that we're given that's a rundown so here's the things that we need to know how to do number one get everything on one side get zero on the other side number two be able to factor or some other way find x-intercepts now why well if we want to know where we are above or below the x-axis we're going to figure out where we cross the x-axis so that we can determine where we're above and or below it that's really the whole idea and so what we're going to be doing is getting everything on one side factoring it most likely finding our x-intercepts but that's not what the question asks the question doesn't say find x-intercepts we're not solving that we're solving inequalities so determining the interval that satisfies this or above or below it so in this case it says hey you got a parabola figure out where we are below the x-axis so we're going to draw something for that we're going to say hey let's say that this is our number line or really just think of this as the x-axis the x-axis is a number line what we want to know is if this is an upward opening parabola where we cross and then come back up over the x-axis that's really the whole idea so what we're going to do out of this is we're going to take a little side step we're going to find our x-intercepts this is not solving your inequality all it's doing is figuring out where you cross the x-axis and then understanding the problem as we let you solve the inequality so we're going to take this off to the side and solve for x intercepts the only reason why we're doing it is so that we can determine where we're crossing if at all the x axis to determine where we are above it or below it keep in mind too that when we're solving for these quadratic inequalities quadratics are all parabolas so what we're going to do is we're always going to have this alternating truth statement true false true or false to false because by the nature of probably it just says one thing it just makes this this u so where we're not above the x-axis we're below it and then back above it that's the whole idea we're upside down down the road we probably were below above and then below so in some way shape or form we're going to factor this and we understand that x plus 5 x minus 5 equals 0 and x plus 2 equals 0 and that says that x equals five and x equals negative two you know that's been a long time talking about what this actually means what we've done here is we found where this function this parabola equals zero we found where it crosses the x-axis if this is a parabola and this is the height of the x-axis y equals zero the output of zero the x-axis then we're finding by setting an equal where this crosses this right here does not solve this problem it just tells you that this parabola is in fact going to cross the x-axis where well if you put it in order at x equals negative 2 and then x equals 5. now listen the only thing we have to do is realize what this does whether it's upward opening or downward opening we already know it's a parabola so there are one of two ways to solve this problem it's neither way is hard both of them work very well i prefer the graphing way because it mimics what we're going to do later so if you understand that that's a parabola and that's the x axis and we're looking for the interval below it well we just found out where the parabola crosses the x-axis we know that it's upper opening so i don't really care exactly what it looks like we know that this parabola is really going to do this that's the the super superimposition of a parabola on our x-axis i don't care about the y-intercept i really don't care about any of that stuff all i care about is the interval that solves our inequality so what this asks is where is this parabola below less than less than zero um less than the x-axis below the x-axis so from left to right is our parabola below the x-axis on this interval no no for this interval from negative infinity until negative 2 our parabola is above that so that's not satisfying our inequality between negative 2 and 5 is our parabola below the x axis yeah that's exactly what you're looking for after 5 is our parabola below the x axis no it's above the x axis until x equals infinity remember with intervals we're always going on the x axis when we're talking about inputs and that's what we're talking about so we graph it and say hey you know what our parabola is less than or equal to zero from negative two to five we're gonna talk about brackets and parentheses in just a second but that is what this question has here's parabola upward opening here's zero where is it less than that where is it below the x-axis well from here to here on that interval of the x-axis now depending on whether you have an equals sign or just a straight-up strict inequality we use brackets or parenthesis to represent that so when we say hey we want to be less than or equal to the x-axis it includes the values that are actually on the x-axis so negative 2 and 5 itself had we had just a less than symbol we wouldn't be using those that values would say we want to be strictly less than strictly below but not on the x-axis in that case if i had given you just this less than we use parentheses here and here what that would represent is that you're below the x-axis on the interval from negative two to five but not including those values as it is what i've given you says we're below the x-axis from negative two to five sure but we want to include those because of that equal sign we say yep those are on the x that's the interval for which this parabola is below or on the x-axis that's pretty much it that is what this is talking about the last thing i want to tell you is that there is another way to do this if you don't don't like the graphing method personally i do it works really well for rational inequalities a little bit later but if you don't like that there is another way to do this but you have to understand something about parabolas parabolas always alternate by the fact that they are an even function here they're going to be on your because of the axis of symmetry always separates our x-intercepts evenly like perfect symmetry on that because of that fact and they're even function and they're symmetrical about an axis of symmetry you will always get the true the same truth statement for intervals that are opposite what i mean by that is that in interval here and here they're both going to be either above or below the x-axis there's no way parabolas do weird stuff they only have one turning point one sort of vertex where we come down go up or go up come down that's all they ever do because of that and because of their symmetry you will always always have an alternating truth to them so we are either going to have intervals that are true false true or false true false that's all they can ever do now what what i mean by the true false true false true false is plug in a number plug in any number that you want i pick an easy one like zero say well where is zero on my interval zero is right here and if we plug in 0 into our inequality we're going to get either a true or a false statement out of that now judging from that one number on that interval we're going to get that either all of these values between negative 2 and 5 are true or all of them are false why because probably continuous functions and you found where you cross the x-axis there are no other crossing points you don't come back up here magically and hit the x-axis and come down we found the only two x-intercepts ever for this parabola so when we plug in a value on an interval and we get that it's true or false we can use it to represent the entire interval so i plug in zero and go hell now negative 10 is less than zero that's a true statement that means that every value in here is going to create a true statement from here to here that's going to be true all of those values give you an output that is less than zero these two values give you something that's equal to zero that's why we included them so between here and here you have values that are equal then all less than zero and then equal to zero again and therefore we include that entire interval you can do that so if you don't like the graphing part just plug in a number and you get okay uh hey that's a true statement cool then understanding something about parabolas says where i'm not below the x-axis i'm above it where i'm at above above the x axis i'm below it and so where we have this we go hey that was true because we're less than zero therefore because of the fact this is a parabola that is going to be a false interval and so it's the other side those will always match up i said that again axis of symmetry creates a symmetrical function for us because x-intercepts are also symmetrical about that that acts symmetry then our truth statements false false or true true are also going to be symmetrical what that means is that hey we're not below that means we're above here we have to be above the x-axis here and that fails what we're talking about we want values that are less than zero below the x-axis all of these values if i were to plug them in are going to be positive numbers stuff that's above the x so those are the two ways that we really go about solving quadratic inequalities so what's the rundown these are all parabolas they're always upward opening or downward opening we find the x-intercepts all right are they going to have x-intercepts not necessarily but if they do the parabola is either above and below than above or below above and below and for that reason we have alternating truth all the time either true false true or false true false depending on what inequality we're dealing with that's it okay let's move on to the next example so we're looking at 2x squared minus 5x plus 3. before we go any further i want to take a look at what this really is that right there is a parabola it's fairly narrow but it is upward opening this right here is a line it's got a y intercept of 3 and a slope of 5. so it's a fairly steep line here's what this asks it says given your parabola and given your mind and let's suppose they cross which they do where is your parabola below the line that's all this stuff is talking about you can look at it here's going to be an x value here's going to be an x value where is our parabola below the line between these two that that's that's where it is so we're going to translate this problem a little bit you could have talked about where is it above the line and that would be this interval and this interval where the parabola would be above the line we're always talking about x values but that's what this picture is now we can cheat this just a little bit instead of talking about the parabola and a line we can get everything on one side in order first or positive and zero on the side and translate our problem just a bit instead of talking about a parabola being below a line if we subtract the 5x and subtract the 3 and get 0 on one side we can translate this problem to well we're not talking about a parabola and a line anymore as far as having a diagonal line we'd be talking about a parabola and the x axis and the values of x are going to be the same where this parabola crosses the the this line or where the parabola we're about to get across the x-axis are going to be the same values so we sort of um kind of trick the problem a little bit so let's do it let's get everything on one side let's get it in order let's get the first term positive this sounds pretty familiar this is still a parabola hey it's still upward opening and there's a zero right here so what this says is if i draw an x axis if this is an upward opening parabola and let's suppose that it crosses the x-axis there are going to be two numbers where this parabola crosses once and then comes back up if it crosses it comes back up and crosses again what we're going to do is we're going to find these numbers how we're going to factor it factoring does not solve this problem it gives you the x-intercepts so that you can interpret it and solve the interval for which your parabola is now below 0 below the x-axis it's going to be this interval do you see it do you see how our parabola is above in this interval below in this interval and above we're not asking for a build we're saying where's this upward opening parabola below okay underneath the x-axis this is zero that's the same exact thing as saying where's this parabola below that line that's all we're doing let's go ahead and factor this so at this point as long as we know how to factor i really don't care what method you use me personally i do a negative five and a negative six uh think about this as negative six and positive one hey let's see that adds negative five that multiplies negative six so we have that right i would probably divide by my a and at this point you can be done if you simplify this and say that's negative three over one and you change your signs you've already found your x-intercepts we know that this is going to intersect our x-axis at positive three and negative one-half now if you want to go ahead and do the whole zero product property factor this all the way out that's totally fine but again that that's not the idea here the idea here is you are only finding these values so you know where to put this on your x-axis so i would say that this is negative one-half and positive three that's all reason at four these do not solve that problem they just tell you where your parabola crosses and that's it now we interpret it okay how do i interpret it look here and imagine that this is a parabola we have sort of an image of that it doesn't cross our x-axis it does here here now find out where this does this to that where this parabola is less than zero um in this interval no that's false on this interval is a parabola less than zero yes so from negative one half to three so we use interval notation here that's pretty standard you don't have to you can do an inequality notation if you really want to so we could do negative one half less than x less than three but interval notation is fairly standard now let's let's also determine whether we need parentheses or brackets here because we say strictly less than we don't want to include the values that are on the x-axis that would be less than or equal to so i don't want to include negative one-half because that is saying where this parabola actually intersects the x-axis so i'm going to dis-include that how we disinclude a value but include everything past it is with parentheses and the same thing with 3. so what this says is this parabola is strictly below the x-axis just past x equals negative one half and just before x equals three just excluding those individual points that's why we don't have a bracket now the other way pick zero take zero find out where zero is there's only one time you can't do that and it's if you don't have a constant so because one of your x-intercepts will be zero in that case you can't plug in zero otherwise find out where zero is it's somewhere in this interval so pick zero and plug it into your inequality negative three is less than zero that's a true statement that says that everything on this interval is true there's nothing in here that's going to give you a value that's greater than zero why because parabolas are continuous functions you found the two places where they cross the x-axis heads equal zero so we're either above or below zero and because we don't have any other x-intercepts we can't change the the sign on anything in this interval they will all be positive or all be negative every value between negative one half and three is a negative output for this parabola that means that they're all below zero this parabola is below the x-axis that's a true true interval and that's exactly where we get this thing we say hey this interval is true this satisfies my equality let's write the interval and then we do this again now because we have parabolas yes you can assume they alternate because parabolas are again continuous functions and once we cross the x-axis we don't come back again every value from here on out when i input it into my parabola is going to be positive that's above the x-axis and that does not satisfy what that is so the interesting thing is that this interval that says where this parabola is below the x-axis is the same interval where this parabola is below that line we just got everything on one side so that factoring worked very nice for us i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing the nature of parabola or it's figuring out where it crosses something and then determine where we're above or below there's two ways to solve it one is just graphically understanding the graph it's a parabola it's pretty easy to understand or excuse me plugging in a value and alternating our truth let me use a word of caution here when we get to rational inequalities i'm going to show you this again i'm going to say that it's possible to determine where we alternate and where we don't by what's called multiplicity so we're going to reference that um or the evenness and oddness of vertical asymptotes we haven't talked about that yet but i'll reference that again so we're going to be thinking of graphs and doing practically the same thing uh it's kind of it's kind of fun actually other than that that's about it we're going to do two more cases uh the last question i often get is why why don't you have any negatives what where's your downward opening parabolas where are those at it doesn't really matter and the reason why it doesn't matter is because if you had a downward opening parabola you could change the signs get everything on one side first term positive and even though it wouldn't be downward opening your inequality would also be different so asking where a downward opening parabola is above the x-axis is the same thing as asking where an upward opening parabola is below and your inequality would bear that out so if you follow the technique and everything on one side in order first turn positive and zero on one side we'll still get the correct interval and give us a slightly different picture but it doesn't matter if we're just looking at the interval now giving the original picture correct understand what's going on yes that is important but maybe i could show you one right now so suppose that we had that that's our first example of everything flipped over flipped around so negatives instead of uh i'm sorry negative x squared plus 3x plus 10 greater than or equal to zero so if i said hey i want to get everything on one side and reverse term positive yeah that's not it's not positive what is that that's a downward opening parabola what's that we're asking where it's above the x-axis so this picture would be a downward open parabola above the x-axis could you still find out where it crossed the x-axis yes but we'd factor negative or we'd change all our signs the thing about inequalities though is that if you factor a negative and you change all your signs if you divide by a negative in order to get this this negative away let's say then when you divide by negative one it changes your inequality do you remember that when you divide by negative you flip your inequality and what i'm trying to show you here is that regardless of how we approach this problem the interval is going to be the same we just made that problem out of that one so even though that's an upward opening parabola and sorry that's a downward parabola and that's an upward and we have this this zero one's greater than zero one's less than zero this sort of proves to you that a downward opening parabola above the x-axis is going to have the same interval as the upward opening parabola below the x-axis you'd solve it practically the same same way if we wanted to stick with this version and say hey this is uh this is still let's see x equals negative two x equals positive five if we wanted to stick with this inequality that would be downward opening parabola but you'd be looking above you'd say hey on what interval is this downward parabola above the x-axis from negative two to five or like we did before if you want to consider it this way on what interval is this parabola below the x-axis it's the same interval these would this would be true for the downward opening this interval would be true for the upward opening i hope that makes sense um like that there's there's two ways to really look at this you'll find the same interval they would have the same truth the main thing here is that if you are going to divide by a negative though you do have to change that inequality that's a big deal another way to do it would be to add x squared subtract 3x and subtract 10. but you can see this asks the same question where is zero above our parabola or where is our parabola below the zero that's the same exact thing as a solid problem drawing so that's what i'm going to leave you at the the main point here is that if you want you can always make your parabola have a positive first term and you'll find the same interval of truth the picture will be a little different so if that bothers you maybe try the interval instead of doing doing the picture but the the process bears itself out so just mind your pictures be careful on what you're drawing understand the concept of what's going on and you'll be just fine let's move on to the next couple problems all right last two let's look at what's going on and then see if we can solve these inequalities number one that's a weird looking inequality maybe we should distribute this to get a better picture of what's going on so x squared plus x always it's a parabola and we're asking where is it above this horizontal line at 20 so what this says is here's this horizontal line that's a constant we're going to have a parabola that's upward opening and asking where is this above that 20. so if this is a height of 20 and we have this upward opening parabola we're figuring out on what interval is this above it is it above between the crossings or outside of the cross seams if you want to call it that and you say oh that's outside we should get kind of an awkward interval something where for a really long way we're above 20 then we're not and then we are again this alternating truth statement now how we're going to solve this problem is we're going to shift this parabola down 20. we're going to subtract 20 from both sides and this is going to translate to instead of thinking about a parabola below a height of 20 we think of a different parabola below a height of zero in other words where this upward opening parabola would be below or sorry above the x-axis that's what we're thinking of i mentioned something in the last example could you have considered this to be a negative a downward opening parabola you you you could have we can just change all of our signs if you want to and this would have the same truth as negative x squared minus x is less than negative 20. by multiplying everything by negative 1 yes you have to change your inequality but this would be a downward opening parabola this would say where's your downward opening parabola below negative 20 that's what that would do so i would say uh between this interval oh hey it's the same exact interval and this interval that's what's going on there so back to this because we're seeing out where this is above our x-axis we're going to be thinking you know what hopefully it crosses if it does excellent we can find our two x-intercepts so we can find that this is upward opening parabola take a picture of it put it on that graph and figure out where we're above so if we know that x squared plus x minus 20 is factorable this is x plus 5 and x minus 4. we can do it a number of ways it doesn't really matter how we do it as long as we can factor correctly then x would equal negative 5 and x equal positive 4. this does not solve this it simply tells you because it's a parabola where you cross the x-axis now we're going to take our picture that's an upward opening parabola we're going to graph it we're going to now understand the problem the problem says i want you to find me the interval where your parabola is above the x-axis where is your parabola above the x-axis here's the two the only two points in the world where we're on the x-axis every place else we're either above it or below it that's a huge interval that's all of this to negative infinity and all this to positive infinity how we write that interval we write from the left to the right the correct interval we're above the x-axis until we get to negative 5. and then we're below the x-axis we're going to dis-include this interval we don't want that and then we're above again from four to infinity these are the two intervals where we are above the x-axis on that parabola that's what we want that's what this translates to now do we include endpoints well because that's not an equal sign this says i don't want you to include where we're actually on the x-axis i want you to dis-include these two values we use parentheses for that we use parentheses for for infinities all the time so no matter what and then we put a union saying it's this interval sort of combined with or this interval those are the two intervals that are going to create true values for this inequality and that's what we're talking about two intervals were parabolas above the x-axis had that been an equals the only change here would be that you would include brackets on your negative five and your four it's all that would change not your infinities the other way if we want to understand that parabolas alternate truth take your zero plug in your zero here if i do that for my inequality zero plus zero minus 20 greater than zero that's a lie that's not true that's false that says this is a false interval nothing in this interval is going to have a value that's greater than zero they're all going to be negative you can see it well because these are parabolas then our outside intervals outside of those x-intercepts those would be true negative infinity negative 5 and then 4 2 infinity again that's the way that we solve these taking a look at the last one this is kind of a weird problem um this has a parabola to it so this looks like a parabola this is let's see a line with a fairly steep slope and this asks where is this parabola below the line we can translate that we can translate that to where is this different parabola below the x-axis it's the same idea it's going to give you the same interval it's just kind of manipulating the shapes a little bit instead of parabola line you have different parabola and the x-axis but we're going to get the same thing we did something very similar to uh with this with the intercept idea like how we find where where functions intersect is by setting them equal and then sort of considering a different problem but we get the same intercepts that's what we're doing here so when we look at that you go wait a minute that doesn't look super factorable so 4x squared that's parabolas upward opening minus 6x plus 9 to be negative 6 and 36. i'm not seeing how to get negatives add to negative 6 and multiply to positive 36. so what do you do when you can't factor well you either complete the square or you do quadratic formula you go okay all right well quadratic formula is going to be kind of nasty if you had to do it you could certainly find approximations couldn't you and you could figure out where you're above or below depending on those approximations it's not super relevant what numbers are here as long as you're able to find those numbers i guess it is relevant you want the right numbers for your your interval but what i mean is that you don't use them to solve your uh the inequalities fall as far as true false true we can understand a picture of the graph to get the true false true or false true false here we'd say all right well i don't even have x-intercepts yet so let's do let's do the um the quadratic formula we know the quadratic formula says that we can do x equals negative b plus or minus b squared minus 4ac all divided by i'm going to get a 4 there all divided by 2 times a now i would typically do my b's then my a's and then my c i don't care about this i care about that right now because here's what's going to happen what's going to happen is that inside my radical we have 36 minus 4 times 36 with a 144 all over b i hope that's 144. uh 36 that's 72 so 2 minus 2 is 1 4. all right what's going to happen there well we got 36 minus 144 that's a big fat negative what's a big fat negative meaning and discriminant we got to know the big fat negatives and discriminants mean that you don't have any x-intercepts so wait a second how can you have an upward opening parabola without x-intercepts it has to look like this here's what this says picture this visualize this that's your x-axis this is an upward opening parabola we're asking where is this upper opening parabola less than zero but we just found out this upward open parabola has no x-intercepts this discriminant is negative it's going to give you an i it says that you do not cross the x-axis are you seeing why i spent so much time talking about what you were doing when you're factoring or squared method or quadratic formula or completing the square you're finding x-intercepts and so if we find that our imaginary numbers here cause a complex solution which says you don't have them then this upward open parabola has to be like that if it does not have x-intercepts and its upper opening it's floating above the x-axis so answer the question where is this parabola below the x-axis it's not there's no solution here there is no no interval where this parabola is ever below zero there are no values you can plug in there to give me a negative number no real numbers at all that's what that's doing so do you i hope that you're seeing that picturing this picturing the parabola picturing the less than zero what the x-intercept represents is very helpful now could you have done it by just plugging in a number yeah if there's no x-intercepts you find that out and you go well plug in plug in zero uh four times zero minus six times zero plus nine is less than zero says nine is less than zero that's false that says wait false what interval is false the whole thing because we don't have any x-intercepts there's no place where our sign changes there's no place where we're above the below than above anymore it would have the same truth for the whole interval here we had three intervals here we had three all the other places we had three this has one interval because we didn't cut it up we have no we have no x intercepts at all we didn't cut that that interval at all and so this whole thing will have the same truth it's either all going to be true or all going to be false that's the two ways we can approach it imagine your graph imagine your x-axis x-axis we have no x-intercepts you're an upper-open parabola floating above you can also do the same thing you can change all your signs and downward opening parabola floating below so if you change negative plus minus and switch this to a greater than it'd say where would your downward opening probably be above the x-axis and you wouldn't be it'd still give you false for everything it'd still say there's no interval for which you are positive you're all you would always be negative that's what's going on now what would happen if we change the inequality without changing the signs we said hey imagine uh imagine this greater than greater than is 9 always greater than 0. is this parabola always above the x-axis yeah if we change the inequality then this asks where is this parabola which is upward opening above the x-axis and it doesn't have any x-intercepts still there's still nothing there you should be quadratic formula you still see there's no x-intercepts you still say hey that's a parabola it's upward opening above the x-axis there is no place where this parabola isn't above the x-axis this would be true for the entire interval in fact since we don't break up the interval at all this would be from negative infinity to infinity or all real numbers so depending on how that sign is we either have the inequalities we either have no solution floating above asking where to blow or infinite solutions floating above asking where it's above that's the idea i hope that it made this make sense i hope you understand the picture of the parabolas getting that your your your number line is just the x-axis it's the easiest way to picture that you can do other ways you can find x-intercepts and do the true false true thing plug in some values for your intervals that's great i used to teach that way a long time ago but
