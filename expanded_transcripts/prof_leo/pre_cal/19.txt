Transcript for: Proving the Quadratic Formula - Twice (Precalculus - College Algebra 20)
hey welcome to another video so in this video I'm going to give you a quick a Leonard version of quick proof of the quadratic formula so well I've really been hurt hearing me say over the past few videos is that there's really three techniques we actually use to solve quadratics we use the square root method we use factoring and then we use the quadratic formula so why are there four techniques the completing the square we rarely rarely use that why well number one what the completing the square does is it gives you what the square root method is based on so when you're when you're doing the square root method a lot of times it's based on someone who's already done the completing the square idea so is it valuable absolutely the quadratic formula does not work without that completing the square idea behind it but the problem is is that as you learn man we just did an over our video on completing the square because it's sometimes teachers even me make you learn completing the square because it is valuable later like with lots of functions we do completing the square on even though we're not sewing for x-intercepts so is it that you've learned yes is it valuable to have like always in the front of your mind when you're doing quadratics no no it's not so here's the process I want you to go through when you are solving quadratic equations for X intercepts number one get on one side in order first you're positive C equals zero and see if the square root method works if it doesn't try factoring if it doesn't pretty much get completely squared less it's one of the really really easy ones and then you didn't go to quadratic formula why is because what the completing the square does if we do it on a general function of general quadratic ax squared plus BX plus C in this this general form standard form and we do completing the square it's going to give us a formula and that's what we're do today so I'm going to show you where the quadratic formula comes from in terms of completing the square so that we never really have to do completing square again unless unless you're forced to by it by some specific thing that's saying you gotta do it so here's what it works on a walk through it and then we'll have this very nice formula will practice in another video so this is let's suppose if we wanted to find x-intercepts so what does the quadratic formula work well with it works with quadratics and it does exactly one thing and find it finds x-intercepts zeros or roots wherever they exist whether they're imaginary whether they're one solution so samesies twice or whether they are there's two real solutions so two actual x-intercepts so it works all the time so factor doesn't work this is your best friend completing the square was a little bit too slow so here's how we go about doing it we're gonna do complete the square exactly the same way i taught you my last videos so how that work is we look at this is said hey is the square root method gonna work no no it's not because i can isolate a power to but with x's other places that's a problem it's factoring gonna work maybe but we know that factor doesn't work all the time there's no general way to factor besides this we're gonna make factory work how does how happen completing the square forces of factory to work for you do you remember that it forces that to happen and so we're gonna force factor to happen it's called completing the square what we did with that is we grouped our X terms and we held off our constant term and we're gonna do the same exact thing the next thing we did we said you know what we really want this shortcut to work with our a being one so that when we develop the factory it's very easy to see what what we need to have in order to make the factory work for that reason we factor out our a so we factor under a factory means divide so x squared divided by x squared DX divided by a is B over ax well you notice if we distribute that that's ax squared that's let's see the over a times a is BX and then we have this the spot where what happens in that spot well what we notice less not last video is that we really need this to be factorable if this is gonna factor and if we need to keep this as three terms this would be my middle term so that's my middle term bigger if that's my middle term we understood that man if I want this to be a perfect square trinomial factor or something that's the same factor times the same factors so they can get it power to I would need exactly the same numbers here now remember these numbers have to add in this one they have to add to my middle term so these numbers have to be the same and they have to add to that number it's going to be exactly half of whatever the value is so it's half of B over a how do you find half of a fraction is you either divide the numerator by 2 or you multiply the denominator by two now we don't know what B is so I'm not going to divide the numerator by 2 I'm going to multiply the denominator remember the multiplication and division are multiplication is that is divisible by reciprocal and division is multiplication that reciprocal is it's the same same concept that you kind of do this different place so we would have B over instead of dividing the numerator I'm going to multiply the denominator by B over 2a hey B over 2a plus B over 2 a is 2 B over 2a that's gonna be B over a the twos are going to cancel so well now we're very close so we have this is a trinomial it's just missing a piece I want this two factors of perfect square something times itself so X plus something and X plus that same thing so they get in perfect square that would complete the square giving you this ability to do a completely a.m. for men so in order for that happen oh I gotta have this seed actually work so how these work is a times C one time that's wife everyday one times whatever is missing has to go here but whatever it was here needs to be the multiplication of these two pieces we understood that from factory that these two pieces need to add to this and multiply to this we're creating the C so that that will happen so let's multiply it if we know that this needs to be the product of these two numbers then this needs to be B squared over 4a squared do these add to B over a yes do these multiply to B squared over 4a squared yes it's just that that's that's missing here that's what we're gonna put in there by the way if you didn't watch the last video the reason why we need this number to be one is because these two values multiplied to a times C well we're trying to find the C so this wasn't one we'd have to define out whatever that number is and basically that's what the factor does at the very beginning anyhow so we divide it out so we don't have to do it later so we're gonna say yeah hey because that's one one time C is this number since we have one divided by one this is our C we're gonna add it right here now there's a couple things that we can do with this a right now we could divide here and here and here or we could leave it here divide it really doesn't matter I'm gonna leave it because that's the technique I showed you in the last video I'm gonna leave it but there is a little issue you see we added B squared over 4a squared and we're gonna have to undo that where we added it to we added it inside this expression and when we went in last video was that because this is multiplied by some number we have to this with the distribution so whatever this a is I would multiply this a times B squared over 4a squared and undo whatever we get so eight times B squared over 4a squared is B squared over 4a so notice I added B squared over 4a squared but this would automatically be distributed that a would cancel out one of those A's so I'm gonna undo that this says you add it really you added this value B squared over 4a I'm gonna undo that whatever we do in an equation we need to undo somewhere either on opposite sides which we couldn't have done or in the same side the only reason why I'm choosing the same side it's because that's what I showed you in the last video because that models better what you do later mathematics would be complete the square inside a function itself without having to set an equal to zero so it looks a little weird why is that not a power - why not because you really didn't add this you added after you distribute you had to be squared over 4a that's what we're undoing we just have a couple more things to do number one thing we're going to combine our like terms here so these are both constants notice they're all constants all our X's are sugar or you can combine that in order to combine it you need a common denominator so we've got an a we've got an x squared B over a X B squared over 4a squared which we know exactly what that's going to factor as that's going to be X plus B over 2a and another X plus B over 2a minus B squared over 4a plus plus C but we also want that seed to have a common denominator with 4 a so instead of just C we're going to give it a common ometer 4ac over 4a remember that if you have an LCD at for a and this is a do not one you can multiply both the numerator by whatever this is the LCD is for eight and now that we have a common denominator working start solving for 4x so or into a couple things right now number one we know that this is going to factor because we made it work we made this out of this factorization so we know it's going to factor as X plus B over 2a squared we know that we're gonna have an a out front still we're also going to put this stuff on the other side of our equation so we're going to add a squared over 4a we're gonna subtract 4ac over 4a so we've shown that this was factorable we just we just factor right now we know that this completes this factorization therefore we get X minus the plus this and X plus this we have X plus B over 2a squared we kept our a we added B squared for a table size we subtracted for IC over 4a m both sides and now we're ready we're almost done we're going to divide by a in just a moment first we're gonna get that expression on the right-hand side of our equation on one fraction so B squared minus 4ac divided by four days there's only two more thing three more things we're going to do number one we need to take square root but you cannot do it with that a being there we have to divide both sides by a when we divide by a on the left hand side divided by a we're just going to get X plus and B over 2a on the right hand side when you divide both sides by a dividing by a is the same thing as multiplying by one over a in other words you multiply your denominator you're going to get 4a squared we're so close now we're gonna take a square root on both sides with the plus and minus so square root both sides with a plus and minus we've been doing this for a long time now we have X plus B over 2a on the right-hand side we get a plus and minus but notice how the denominator is a perfect square so our numerator we're going to leave this as b squared minus 4ac no problem denominator square root of 4 is 2 square root of H squared that's a square inside of the square root that's a then we're going to subtract B over 2a from both sides and by the nature of having a really really convenient common denominator we need to make this one fraction and so we get this negative B sine floats up plus or minus sine floats over square root of b squared minus 4ac numerators on the numerator no problem all over remember to keep their denominators the same and then subtract the fractions all over 2a that right there's a quadratic formula and if you've never seen it before way probably has seen it somewhere this is a proof of where it comes one way to do the proof of where this comes from by completing the square I might give you an optional proof in just a minute just to show you a different way to look at it because sometimes the / H screws people up here so I'll give you a different way to look items in just a minute but what that does that does the same thing as the screw method the same thing as factoring and the same thing is completing the square because it is completed square it's just done it once and for all by leaving these as general coefficients and constants you find a formula that's a formula to find x-intercepts that's all it does just find x-intercepts if they happen and finds imaginary numbers if they don't have a negative inside your square root this piece called the discriminant would give you an eye that says you have imaginary or complex zeros and not real zeros so anyway we'll practice actually using that next time we'll talk about the discriminate what you would get out of that I'll come right back with an alternate proof of a race to outright that start with okay so if you're interested here's a slightly more traditional way just to show the quadratic formula from completing the square what it does it's some of the same the only thing that happens here is we divide by a right away to get rid of it and we have a fraction from the very beginning and then we complete the square sort of the same way and so what that would look like if you divide everything by a well then that becomes x squared plus B over a X plus C over a you notice I'm separating that real quick equals zero and that gives us a fresh start which take-it-or-leave-it that's just the way that we have to have that and then we complete the square with the same exact thing so we have our B over a we know that our B over two a and B over two a TS oh it's going to be given to us if we multiply that that's B squared over 4a squared this is what needs to happen to factor is it a perfect square trinomial but we're missing that piece and so that is what would get added that's what we get added here but you can see because we divided by the a there's no distribution now one times B squared over 4a squared is exactly what you'd subtract and that's the reason why some people prefer this method is because a little bit easier to see that also you can get a common denominator pretty quickly you don't have to mess around with it at all so this is factorable as X plus B over 2a squared we know that spectable because we send out we added this constant so that it would factor is that then finding a common denominator we know that we want for a squared so that's 4ac find the LCD 4ac over 4a squared and then we get everything on one side besides that perfect square and you can kind of see it come together after this if we add B squared over 4a squared plus 4ac over the same fraction we're going to get that exact same fraction taking a square root with a plus and minus we get this X plus B over 2a on the right hand side we get this plus or minus square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a because we did the same exact thing and that's it's the same from here so we subtract B over 2a we put it on one fraction due to that really nice common denominator and we're done that's a quadratic formula just slightly different way dividing by a first sometimes it's a little bit cleaner but I gave you the first way because that mimics exactly what we did in the previous videos so I hope that makes sense I hope you explained where the quadratic form that comes from and how what is used for so next time we show how it how it's used and exactly how to fill that thing out knead it properly see you for the next video you
