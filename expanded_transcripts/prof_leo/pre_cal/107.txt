Transcript for: Simple Harmonic Motion in Trig (Precalculus - Trigonometry 35)
welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about something called simple harmonic motion we're taking a side step away from triangles and going back to the functions sine and cosine really what their graphs are so we'll talk about what simple harmonic motion is i'll tell you how to create a function from information and how to get information about this harmonic motion from a function and that's pretty about much about it i will not be talking about damped harmonic motion we really haven't talked about e to a negative exponent in a while that would be involved so i want to get you rolling on what simple harmonic motion is in this video so what what does it mean simple harmonic motion is vibratory motion that does not lessen over time so you start a process and it continues going up and down or back and forth forever without lessening now oftentimes damped harmonic motion is a little more realistic where you let something go and it does this and then eventually gets to its its resting position this would be the case where you do this and it keeps on going forever and ever and ever what i'd like you to know about simple harmonic motion is that it can be modeled with what are called sinusoidal functions either the sine or the cosine functions without manipulating them or without multiplying by some other function and bounding them with with an upper and lower curve so simple harmonic motion is doesn't change over time and it can be modeled with sine or cosine functions so let's talk about what these these things are that i've written on the board this letter d stands for displacement or the the amount of distance between its resting position and where it is at over a period of time now there's two functions we can deal with to do this cosine and sine and we're familiar with them pretty much that hey that omega affects the period that t is time so over over a length of time what this is doing where it's at over a length of time and omega it relates to our period so when we deal with this yeah dia's displacement from rest the absolute value of a is our amplitude how far it gets in total away from your resting position this is usually where you push it to pull it to or where you hit it to from rest the period why is it two pi why is it two pi over omega oh man hopefully you remember that sine and cosine have a natural period of two pi we can divide that by whatever number is in front of our variable and it will shrink or grow that that period and then our frequency is how many oscillations happen per time interval it's really just the reciprocal of your period one other couple of things i want you to know before before we move on uh we'll get to this when we start building our functions if you are starting from a position that is away from your rest you will use the cosine function if you are starting your motion at rest you will use the sine function i want you to see why this is what the sine function is either positive sine so a is positive or negative sign a is negative so if your position is at rest when you start use the sign because sine starts at the origin starts at zero zero starts at a resting position of you're not away from your period your place of rest uh cosine is different cosine starts either positive amplitude or negative amplitude whatever that is so if you're starting away from your resting position like you've pulled down something let it go or you've pushed up something let it go if your displacement your position is starting away from your resting position use cosine that's because it's modeled better as positive cosine or negative cosine if you're starting at rest start with continuous sign so positive sign or negative sign we'll also use this idea to say from our functions what's happening where are we starting is our motion going down from start or coming up from start going up from start or going down with start and so we'll be able to determine that by understanding what our trig functions look like so we're going to get right into it let's say that you have a sign hanging down from some sort of spring and you pull it way down well actually it's only 7 inches you pull it way down seven inches and let it go what's gonna happen well if you pulled that down remember you pull it down and you're starting its displacement from down below where it wants to rest what model fits that best does this fit it are you starting below where it wants to rest no are you starting below where it wants to rest no are you starting below where it wants to rest yes so this is going to be a negative cosine function when we get done with it so we're going to pull down this sign and then we're just going to let it go i'm just going to do this forever theoretically in this model simple harmonic motion let's say you count it and it takes four seconds to return to where you let it go so you pulled it down remember it hasn't started its own natural motion until you let it go so you did this it hasn't started simple harmonic motion you're just holding it you're holding it and then then you let it go at that moment t equals 0 starts so you go up right there you have released this from below its resting position it's going to want to go up and you start counting one two three four and it gets down to exactly where you released it took four seconds to get there it's a really slow spring and let's figure out if we can determine everything about this problem and build a function from it firstly what's what's the amplitude how far away from its resting position is this ever going to make it well it's going to be seven inches you tip it down seven inches and let it go our amplitude itself the absolute value would be seven but i want you to think of where you also did where you also moved this this object this sign did you move it up positive seven did you pull it down negative seven in our case we pulled this down seven inches that's negative seven we'll also think of the period and use that to find our omega the thing that's going to go next to one of our functions inside our variable inside our parentheses next to our variable so our period is 2 pi over omega however we know what our period is our period is 4 seconds so if we read through this and say yeah we pulled it down 7 inches that's negative 7. your displacement is negative 7 when you start and then you let it go it takes four seconds to oscillate all the way up and all the way down from where you you let it go then our period is four seconds let's set this equal to four seconds in doing that what we can do is solve for omega so multiply both sides by omega divided by 4 or remember you can interchange these two things and simplify we're going to get pi over 2. what about our frequency the frequency is how many oscillations per time unit so how many oscillations per second now think about this if it takes four full seconds to go from where you released it back to where you released it how many oscillations per second does it have not even one actually one-fourth here's what happens your frequency is always going to be the reciprocal of your period so if your period is four seconds your frequency is one fourth of an oscillation per second and now we're actually ready to build our displacement formula our displacements can be modeled on where you pulled it to and what's happening when you release it if you are starting so you pull it down and start that position at that non-resting position if you are pulling this away from rest and letting it go or pushing it up away from rest and letting it go use cosine so we've already determined how far we're pulling it that's negative seven we've already determined that it's not starting from its resting position it's starting away from that actually it's starting from you pull it down use the negative seven cosine is use this when you start away from rest so cosine we have solved for our omega that's pi over 2 and our time unit is t that's our variable that right there is exactly how this this function would be modeled so so we would model this with a function negative seven cosine pi over two t and i needed to make sense to you i need to understand that cosine starts away from zero cosine starts away from rest so this was hanging there you pulled it down you're moving it away from its rest down seven units its amplitude is seven positive seven yes but where you moved it's negative seven this would this would look like a negative cosine function you pulled it down what's going to happen what's its motion immediately it's going to start going up so if you see a negative 7 cosine a negative something cosine its initial motion is going to go up why because you pulled it down and you let it go it's going to start climbing upward it's going to reach a peak it's come right back to where you released it that time period is your period how many oscillations fit in that is your frequency you can use your period to solve for omega and that is the coefficient of your variable remember that that is what has adjusted your period for you we're just kind of going in reverse so that's really the the idea on going through this is number one see what's happening with it are you starting from rest you sign are you starting away from rest use cosine are you pushing it up positive cosine pulling it down negative cosine because it fits the model are you shooting it up from rest positive sign are you shooting it down from rest negative side then all we really have to do is find our omega from a period how long it's taking you to return to your starting position so let's go ahead we'll start a couple more examples and go through this but this is the idea we're trying to really model what's happening in our physical simple harmonic motion to a mathematical model this this function of sine or cosine let's try another one so let's suppose this is the case you have this amplitude of 4 and you know that it's going to take pi over two seconds to return to where you in this case pushed up four feet and let go so this is all very important information firstly this is simple harmonic motion and this is where we're going to imply with this situation that if our amplitude is four we either pushed up four units or pulled it down four units we shot it up from rest four units or we shot it down from rest from rest four units in our case it says you push this up four feet and you let it go which model best fits that well starting from rest would be a sign issue starting not at rest displacement away from zero at rest is a cosine issue in fact we can look at this right here and say if your displacement at time zero is not equal to zero use cosine if your displacement is zero at time zero use sine in our case our displacement is four when we are at time zero why is that because you're pushing it up holding it there and then letting it go when you immediately let it go where is it at it's at positive 4. our displacement is 4 when we let it go this means that your displacement is away from its resting position you are using cosine here so if we push this up and let it go then our a i know our amplitude absolute value of a is 4 but our a is also positive 4. our period well our period is pi over 2 pi over two seconds but also remember that um our period is is equal to two pi over omega which means our omega our coefficient of our variable is if we reverse that if if our period is 2 pi over omega then our omega is 2 pi over our period because we know our period we can make a little substitution here omega is going to be 2 pi over pi over two so we're just substituting saying if period equals two pi over omega then omega equals two pi over period we know our period just substitute it in our case our pi's are gonna cancel we're gonna get two divided by one half that's four omega is just four if you wanted to figure out your frequency if you were ever asked for that because your period is pi over two your frequency would be two over pi there would be two over pi oscillations per second that's how you'd find frequency um it's not asked for right now but well you could find it maybe two over pi oscillations per second so less than one oscillation per second so now we're ready to figure out our displacement function displacement is find your a now if your amplitude's given and you know that it's four in our case you need to know whether this is pulled up or pushed down to start this one was pushed up so we know that this is positive four units away from its rest use that number so this is before we know that we're starting away from rest so use cosine we've taken some time to figure out our omega that's a coefficient of a variable that's 4 t and that's really it that that right there would give you the model of displacement now you can check your work if you know that if displacement is 4 at time equals 0 plug in 0. 4 times 0 is 0 cosine of 0 is 1 4 times 1 is 4. so this actually gives me my initial position based on my starting time of 0. that's a good way to check your work so if you had accidentally had a negative here you plugged in zero you'd get negative four wait a minute i know i'm at positive four when i start that's a problem what if you'd chosen sign well then four times zero would be zero sine of zero is actually zero zero times four would be zero you go oh this is starting at rest not where i want it to this is why we choose sine for starting at rest and cosine for starting away from rest because sine of zero is zero you have to start at rest cosine of zero is one you have to start at your amplitude that's why that works so in our case this would be you're pushing something up and letting it go where's its initial motion is it climbing or is it falling think about this positive cosine functions fall immediately that's what would happen if you push something up and let it go it's going to fall if you pull something down let it go it's going to climb on a spring or something so this right here this initial motion is falling it's going down what if you were to pull this down and let it go well then our initial position would be negative it'd still be cosine but it'd be negative 4 cosine 4t if you had pulled this down for feet or something and let it go i hope that's making sense you i hope you're seeing the a little bit more the modeling of cosine away from rest the idea of if i pull it up and let it go it's this model and it's going to go down first if i pull it down and let it go it's this small it's going to go up first let's go ahead and try a couple more okay i lied i wanted to change something on the previous problem let's suppose that instead of pushing this up or pulling this down this is at rest and it's moving up so imagine this imagine uh you have like a ball on a string and you just you just hit or a spring i should say and you just you hit it so here's the ball you just hit it upward what's going to happen it's going to start at rest you hit it it's immediately going to go up and then come down and go up again so let's say that it takes pi over two seconds to go up and come down and go back up to hit this resting position it's going to continue let's imagine that it still hits up to four feet up so our amplitude is still four feet our period is still pi over two but it's starting at rest and moving upward which model now fits that these are both not starting at rest this is starting from a displacement away from that these are both starting at rest but which one starts with the motion up positive sign or negative sign well positive sign does positive sign would be this case you have the ball hanging there you hit it it's going to start at rest and go upward then it's going to come back down and go upward again so when we're taking a look at that we're always going to use sine for starting at rest at time 0. because sine of 0 gives you 0 it's going to zero out that and start from your resting position so we still have the amplitude of four sure we actually still have a a positive four because we're dealing with a positive sine function our displacement though is zero at time zero where at time zero be right as you hit it its initial position is at rest it's at zero so our our period would still be the same our omega would still be the same but we're using a different function we'd use moving up means we're having a positive sine function we do have 4 positive 4 though sine of 4t think about the model here if you plug in 0 4 times 0 0 sine of 0 0 4 times 0 is 0. at time 0 you are at rest now you hit it what's happening it's going up why do we know that it's positive and so it would be climbing this match is moving up what if i would have had a negative in front well if i would have had a negative this would be a negative sine function that's the purple one that would say hey i'm going down oh that's not moving up that would be a problem which model would this fit this would fit a model of you're at rest and you hit it downward that would be initial motion down it would be negative it would follow that and that would work if that word was down i hope that makes more sense now i hope that you're seeing the interplay between cosine away from rest sine starts at rest because cosine of 0 is 1 but sine of 0 is 0. it puts it at the resting position all right we're going to take a look at four functions really quickly just to get a feel for how these look based on the function so we have a displacement function here the displacement of this object equals 5 sine of 3t i just want to get in your head what this would look like and what this is doing just simply by reading the function so let's start here can we see what the the motion is what type of emotion is whether we have damped harmonic motion or simple now we haven't talked about damped harmonic motion but damp would decrease with time it would have an actual decaying exponential um e to a negative exponent so this doesn't have that this is going to continue oscillating over and over and over just like sine and cosine both do so this is simple harmonic motion there's nothing in that that's lessening the function over time how about the maximum displacement this is also your amplitude how far does this get away from its resting position well that is always that number in absolute value so that would be five five units away from its natural resting position before it started taking motion how about the time for one oscillation what that's asking for is the period how long does it take to go from where you're starting it either away from rest or at rest back to where this whole situation started well that is a period how long does it take to create one oscillation um our period is always two pi over omega or it's it's uh it's the amount of time that it takes if it's given to you so because we have that we have that three our period is two pi over 3. remember that we can adjust our period by dividing by the number in front of our our variable in our case that is 3. so period is always 2 pi for sine and cosine pi for tangent and and cotangent we have to worry about that here but for sine and cosine it's 2 pi that's the period divided by whatever that number is this is shrinking that period or or compressing that so our time for one oscillation is two pi over three seconds how about your frequency frequency is always the reciprocal of your period so if we have two pi over three seconds to create a full period it'll be three over two pi oscillations per second how about your displacement at time zero like what would you do there you can either read the function or just plug in zero so if you just plug in zero uh three times zero plug in zero for t that's time zero plug in zero for t three times zero is zero sine of zero is also zero five times zero is zero your displacement is is zero that means that this position is at rest when the situation starts you could also look at the function this is a positive sine function okay what's a positive sine function that's this guy right here positive sine functions are like this black one that goes up comes down goes back up but where's the start it starts at zero it starts at rest now this answers the next question though what's its initial motion at time zero when it starts what does a positive sine function do does it climb does it go up does it fall does it go down in our case a positive sine function climbs so its initial motion is upward or climbing i hope it makes sense i hope you can now read the function and see like yeah this this is not going to change over time uh his displacement is its amplitude it's five away from rest uh our period is pretty easy we've studied period before frequency is the reciprocal of that it's its position is at rest when this starts because its displacement is zero and then its initial motion is modeled on whatever function that's given you so sine functions start at rest and either move up for positive or down for negative cosine functions start away from rest and either move down for positive or up for negative so let's come back with with three more we'll go through very quickly do basically the same thing okay so we've got another one we got d is negative three sine one half t let's go ahead and answer all these questions let's assume everything is in meters like like we will for the next couple examples firstly do we still have simple harmonic motion yeah there's nothing that says otherwise sine functions continue on forever and ever unless we just truncate them or alter them with some other function that binds them in some way that balance them how about our maximum displacement our maximum displacement is how far away from breath does this ever get that absolute value of your very first coefficient the absolute value of negative three will tell you that that's your amplitude your maximum displacement would be 3. your period or the time for one oscillation is always the period of your function divided by omega the number in front of your variable so in our case that's 2 pi divided oops did some math in my head there 2 pi divided by one-half if we multiply by the reciprocal we end up getting four pi so our our period the amount of time that it takes for one oscillation is four pi seconds our frequency is the reciprocal of that so one over four pi this would be one over four pi oscillations per second what about our displacement at time zero just plug in zero if i plug in zero one half times zero is zero sine of zero is zero zero times anything including negative three is still zero so this displacement is zero at time zero it is at rest when the situation starts you can see it from the function also if this is a negative sine function both positive and negative sine functions start at rest so this would tell you your displacement is zero at time zero and lastly the initial motion this is where you have to think about it think about what negative sine functions do negative sine functions go down when they start so this is like someone hit something downward this would be going down at the start so it's initial motion is downward not upward it's kind of nice for sine because positive means upward and negative means downward cosine's opposite though positive cosine functions start down at the beginning and go up for negatives at the beginning let's try one a little different let's work on a cosine function so so our displacement is negative 2 cosine of 2t is it still harmonic simple harmonic motion yeah cosine functions do the same thing as sine functions in that they repeat forever at the same maximum amplitude so we still have a simple harmonic case what is the maximum displacement that's still a that's still an amplitude question so we look at the the very first number this number in front of cosine or sine and we take the absolute value the maximum distance away from rest here is 2. now because the period for cosine is the same as the period for sine 2 pi we can find the period the same exact way take 2 pi and divide by the number in front of your variable that omega that 2. so if i simplify we're going to get pi so it takes pi seconds for this to complete it's one full oscillation these are typically in terms of seconds if not you'd have a different time unit but it would be whatever that period is time units to create one oscillation frequency is the reciprocal so it'd be one over pi oscillations per second how about its displacement at times zero two ways to do it either just plug in zero and that's fine two times zero is zero cosine of zero is one one times negative two is negative two this starts at negative two units or negative two meters below rest at time zero so mathematically displacement is negative two that means the tune is down what that means verbally is this starts two units or two meters in this case if we're using meters below its resting position right when you start so someone held this down and let it go held it down two minutes two meters and let it go um it's initial motion well now you could have answered this question by looking at the graph and we could do that so here's cosine what would have a display what would our negative cosine look like a negative cosine is like the purple one it starts down here and goes up would that have told you that your displacement is two units below rest yeah two meters below rest now how about initial motion think about this if this is a negative cosine graph like we have its initial motion would be upward so when you pull something down and let it go its first inclination of motion would be up not down up this is where some students get confused they think negative always means down it does it with cosine a negative graph would start climbing upward immediately i hope it's making sense i hope you understand the negative cosine starts upward i hope you're seeing the differences between sine and cosine cosine functions start away from rest at their initial position last one and then we're done how about d our displacement function equals six plus two cosine pi over two t oh my goodness is it still simple harmonic motion yes because that's what cosine does what in the world is a six the sixes initial starting position above zero but it's still its resting position it's like um it's like you're saying hey i'm holding this this ball six feet of or six meters above the ground now from there it's just holding there on a spring now hit it what's gonna happen it's gonna start at six meters but then from that position it'll climb it'll go below it'll come back up but it's in its like resting position is not at zero that would be like at the ground anyway so maybe this is a little more realistic we have this thing that's hanging six meters above the ground from there we're going to swing it back and forth so some sort of simple harmonic motion is still simple harmonic motion what's its maximum displacement from rest not eight why because six is its resting position from there it will climb two or go down two that's fine but it's only changing two units two meters from its resting position so its maximum displacement from rest is still two that's why the amplitude has nothing to do with a vertical shift our amplitude is from where it is how much does it go up and how much does it go down is at six has nothing to do with a vertical shift that is a vertical shift um it's just the absolute value of the coefficient of your function so it would just be absolute value two it's just two that's how much it's changing total from its rest at six meters how about the time for one oscillation still a period question so our period is still two pi because that's cosine divided by pi over two in our case which would still give you four so this is still four seconds per oscillation or the reciprocal of that is one-fourth of an oscillation per second that's our frequency how about our displacement at time zero now before we do this this is displacement from rest not total above the ground idea that would be a different question what would its total be from a height of zero and you'd say okay plug in zero and you would get eight pi over two times zero is zero cosine zero is one one times two is two two plus six is eight that would be total height if you're going displacement from rest then you stop here and you don't have the six because its rest is at six so displacement from rest at type zero is 2 still and lastly what's its initial motion think about what cosine does a positive cosine function even if you shift up six units so like two cosine pi over two t plus six would be shifted up six units it's still a positive cosine function it still looks mostly like this it might shift up but its initial motion would be downward positive cosines cosine functions from their starting position initially drop they do not climb so this would be down i hope i've given you a good introduction into simple harmonic motion um like i said we're not going to be covering damp harmonic motion in this video but for simple harmonic i hope that now you understand the interplay between sine and cosine and the functions that you get i hope you understand the initial motion and the displacement from this this resting position and where you start up or down depending on whether you're talking about sine or cosine so hopefully you enjoyed the video i hope it made sense to you and i'll see you for another video
