Transcript for: Graphing Quadratic Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 24)
hi welcome to another video in this video with something very basic we're going to talk about the properties and graphs of quadratic functions how do you kind of cope with this vertex form versus maybe just graphing the the vertex and X intercepts and y intercepts that they work together just one time through to make sure that you're seeing it this is a little more advanced and like an intermediate algebra class because our none of these are gonna be factorable for us very easily so we need to find X intercepts through quadratic formula but basically just making sure you're ready to move on and grab some polynomials which is pretty much a next thing that we're going to be starting so here's the way that we go and graph quadratic functions I need you to know a couple things about it number one any quadratic which is a polynomial of a second degree so power to polynomial this is the way they're all gonna look they are all going to be parabolas if your a is greater than zero they're gonna be what we call upper opening if your a the first coefficient of your x squared term is negative you're gonna get a downward-opening prevalence where they always look if a is an absolute value larger than one we get a vertical stretch either way or if it's absolute value less than one we get a vertical compression I'll make the graph look more narrow or more wide respectively depend on whether you a an absolute value is greater than 1 or less than 1 so we're gonna be practicing that just kind of looking through these then we need to know how to find the y-intercept and the x-intercepts and if we want to put this into vertex form or you're asked for it how to do that with completing the square so this is the process of going through graphing quadratics we first determine whether this is going to be an upward-opening or down over the parabola just like what we talked about then we find the y-intercept and the reason why we do those two first the upward opening or downward opening give us a great way to check our work later and in combination with the y-intercept which every parabola has we can determine if we need x-intercepts so let me make that very clear to you every parabola is going to open either upward or downward every parabola is going to have a y-intercept we're going to determine those two things every parabola has this vertex where you change from decreasing to increasing or increasing to decreasing we're gonna find that what they don't always have our x-intercepts if you have an upward-opening parabola with the vertex above the x-axis or a downward-opening parabola with a vertex below the x-axis and so we always go through a parabola in the following thought process number one is an upward or downward opening maybe we determine whether it's narrow or wide depending with a bit of vertical or a stretch or compression then we determine the vertex and the y-intercept we're gonna use the axis of symmetry if used the y-intercept to give us maybe a free point and then if we need to we determine x-intercepts if not we're done and so we're going to go through them we're going to talk about these how we find the y-intercept by just plugging in 0 to our exit value of the function for x equals 0 it's always going to be your C we'll talk about that we'll talk about how when you find x-intercepts this is exactly why we've been practicing last few videos we set our function equal to 0 and we use factoring whatever method to complete the square or quadratic formula here it's pretty much all gonna be quadratic formula if we need to and then well we will find the vertex one of two ways either by completing the square which I'm going to show you again or by using this vertex formula which is so much nicer use so this is pretty much what we're gonna do I'm going to show you the order in which we go through it and that's gonna be just about it we have maybe four examples I'm going to show you going backwards if I give you a vertex and a y-intercept help me make something in standard form so let's take a look at our first first function it's clearly a quadratic it's got that power to there's three terms there in order looks really nice here's the order which we graph parabolas number one you have a choice to make either you're going to do completing the square or you're going to find the vertex first then the y-intercept of emanate x-intercepts in that order you graph them again the reason why I don't I don't want to hold you in suspense this order works because every parabola is going to have a vertex and every parabola is going to eventually cross the y axis but not every parabola make it has to cross the x axis so we do this in order to stay on ourselves work if we find a parabola that has a vertex above the x-axis and we know it's upward opening or they'll have to worry about the next intercepts or likewise if we have them below we don't worry about the next intercepts and so we go on that certain order to make certain we're not wasting our time to find x-intercepts that aren't even there so let's go through together we know that's a parabola we determine that because that 2 is positive and because that too is an absolute value greater than 1 this is going to be an upward-opening parabola and that's going to be a little bit more vertically stretched so so a little narrower what we're going to do first is find the vertex by this vertex formula so vertex formula says if you can identify your a and your B and your C which we should be really good at because of the quadratic formula the vertex formula is going to give us that vertex now here's how to find it it looks really familiar because from the quadratic formula if you remember many may watch that proof video again this part was the piece that was here before chicken square root now why is that important because that's the only piece of the necks in it and this right here is in parentheses and this means if I looked at like a function this would be like a shift left that's what that would be as far as our function is concerned and this if I move another side would be a shift up or down that's what that's giving to you so where the vertex formula comes from is this idea that this a left hence the negative and when we find out what that value is that becomes the x-coordinate of our vertex how to find the y-coordinate is once you find this x-coordinate or about to do we plug it into our function that's what this stands for so going to our vertex of says hey identify your a B and C a it's 2 and B is 8 and C is 5 our vertex formula says take your negative B all over 2 times a whatever your a is in this case our a is to we're going to simplify that and then whatever value we find we're going to plug it into our function that's how points work including the vertex every parabola has a vertex we use the formula to find the x-coordinate and then just like every ordered pair ever we plug in the X or evaluate that X we out the output so we got the Y value the Y ordered the f of X the same thing is to kind of Y so this really blank for just a second negative 8 over 4 is negative 2 and then we evaluate negative 2 in our function so we know right now that our vertex is going to be negative 2 comma something along that negative 2 x value some output we have to plug in that negative 2 in order to find the output so negative 2 squared is 4 4 times 2 well that gives us 8 8 plus let's see 8 times negative 2 is negative 16 that would be negative 8 and plus 5 would be negative 3 so we evaluate this as negative 2 and then we get out negative 3 that is where our vertex is now we're gonna plot that we're gonna plug that as we go so negative 2 comma negative 3 is this ordered pair negative 2 negative 3 right about there that's our vertex now think about this this is an upward-opening parabola so if you are asked to find the minimum of this problem which you're going to be able to ask to do on some of the word problems you get what's the minimum of this dysfunction if this is an upward-opening problem and this is the vertex then your minimum right now you're done your minimum value of this function is negative 3 it's not negative 2 that's the x value where it happens your native the negative 3 is the minimum height that this function attains that's the idea that having a vertex being the maximum for a downward-opening or minimum for an upper opening so again we've now we said hey this is a parabola we know it's gonna be upward opening your vertex is going to be the minimum value on that function on the graph that function the height that has chains minimum values no you three we know we can find a y-intercept an x-intercept and a vertex by using some of these techniques we've learned already y-intercepts really the x-intercept we're using one of those techniques we learned about solving quadratics and the vertex has a formula we just use negative B divided by 2a we figure that out we plug it into our function we get an ordered pair that represents your vertex your y-intercept should be really quick the liner stepped occurs where you plug in zero to your X so if we plug in zero that's going to zero and that's mu zero can you see that if you evaluate your function for zero you are only going to be left with the C value if your functions in standard form means it looks like this that if you plug in zero these things are gone you're just gonna get your C value and that's what happens should take about five seconds to find this at most so we know that our y-intercept is zero comma 5 we're going to plot that next and now we're going to determine something you see I gave you an order of steps so that we can identify whether or not we need to find x-intercepts or not so right here because you know that's up or opening because we have a vertex because we know where our y-intercept is are we gonna have to cross this x axis in this parabola so here's our vertex we know it's upward-opening yeah we're going to have to cross this somewhere probably somewhere between here and here of course because it's got to be symmetrical we're gonna have to cross that that right there tells you whether you need to continue to find x-intercepts or not and I had our vertex been above the x-axis and we were still upward-opening we don't have to do this next step so to make it very clear when you're graphing parabolas we always find the vertex matter what we always find the y-intercept no matter what we always use the y-intercept for a free point I'm gonna show you in just a second but then sometimes we find x-intercepts if we have two vertex is below the x and upper opening yes vertex above the X and downloading yes but not if we're above and upward or below in downward I hope that makes sense to you so here we're going to find in just a minute but before we do that I need you to understand that every parabola is symmetrical and and because it's symmetrical we have this thing called an axis of symmetry and it's always going to go through your vertex so our graph is going to be the severe image across that does line what that means is this if you have any point on one side of that axis of symmetry you can mirror that image on the other side being equal to sin front of it so because this five is let's say two units away from the axis of symmetry this is negative two comma five is where that would this point right here is because this y intercept is two units away we can go two units away the other side at negative four or five and put a point so we know that that's symmetrical here's two units away from the axis of symmetry the other side of that extra symmetry is going to create for us at another point this is very very helpful in your graphing you get a point for free that's really nice we can always do that with our y-intercept provided that active symmetry isn't on the y axis so we're always going to rotate the graph of vertex no problem we're gonna graph the y intercept great we're going to use the axis of symmetry that always goes through your vertex to give ourselves a mirror image from where the y intercept is and then if we need to we're gonna find X intercepts so how we find x intercept is always say that your phone should be equal to zero and then trying to factor or try the square root method trying something here in the square methods not gonna work we can't get a power to by itself with the contains all of our X's and have a constant other side that that's not happening could we do the completing the square yeah we can't and I'm gonna do that in a minute to show you that we can solve it that way people generally think it's a little more work and unnecessary but I want I'm gonna practice it to show you that it does work if you're asked to be vertex form that's what you have to do instead if we can't factor let's see 8 and 8 multiply to 10 then that's not going to happen so man we got his quadratic formula and that's gonna happen at this level where you can't factor to get x-intercepts there's no way but you know that they exist so when you said this function equal to zero nothing else works you don't want to complete the square do the quadratic formula so identify your a and your being your see what you've already done now we understand that our X would be equal to make it be plus or minus this will be squared minus 4 times a times C we've done this before all over 2 times a and say hey our 8 is be our a is 2 and our C is 5 and we end up getting this I'm going pretty quickly here we want to make sure that we're not making any mistakes ironic cuz I forgot something and it's 64 minus 40 that's 24 all over 4 so negative 8 we got a 64 we have minus 40 that's going to be 64 minus 4 is 24 all over 4 what this ends up being it's something that is an exact as solution I mean we know they have x-intercept there's no ice here we know across an X but it's very hard to graph and so we're going to approximate it and we're gonna say all right once we take this negative 8 plus the square root of 24 over 4 negative 8 minus the square root of 24 over 4 notice I'm not doing I'm not spending a whole lot of time simplifying this by factoring out that square root of 4 and simplifying with a before I don't care because all I'm trying to do here is approximate my x-intercepts I'm trying to get a number that I can actually graph and so that's what we're gonna do so after taking a break and and work on this under calculator or whatever I got that our x-intercepts are about so I'm gonna change this to about equal to negative three point two two and negative 0.77 let's see if that kind of copes with what we got here negative three point two two they need one negative two negative three point two two and then negative point seven seven negative point seven negative 0.77 here's what we want to check because we have this nature of symmetry for every parabola in fact we use it to get a free point for a y-intercept we want to make sure there are X values our x-intercepts are also symmetrical on this graph so the same distance from the axis of symmetry on both sides and this is one reason why this is a little bit off is because they're rounding error that's that's the idea so man once we have that those five points are what we need to make a really solid graph for a parabola we have determined that every parabola has a vertex find it first use the formula use this one that I'm giving you find the x-value plug it in for the y-value plot it then find your y-intercept plot it use the axe symmetry to give you a free point plot it determine if you need x-intercepts you're gonna be crossing the x-axis you gotta find them sometimes that means when you set this equal to zero but it's not factorable we're using the quadratic formula plug in this into our calculator they need to eight plus square root of 24 and then divide by four they need to make minus square root 24 then divide by four getting two values plotting I'm on our x-axis and double-checking they're the same distance from axis entry after that we have something that we can graph with a nice smooth flowing curve make the symmetric as possible and that's about as good as I can do by hand be honest with you I hope that makes sense the idea that parabolas are these these shapes we get Burton for quadratics they're all going to make that hope make sense that if you're a is positive we're upward opening and negative we're downward opening and then we have a vertical stretch or compression this one is stretched a little bit you can see it's a little more narrow than normal I hope you understand that every parabola has a vertex we're going to find it first if it's below the x-axis an upward opening you're also going to have x-intercepts so we've got to keep that in mind it's above the X and downward-opening again you're gonna have X intercepts so we're going to keep that in mind every problem has a y-intercept they're easy to find we just plug in 0 we get our 0 comma see X intercepts might take some work here because they're not always factorable quadratic formulas going to give us an exact representation for x-intercepts but to graph them we might have to approximate it that's got to be there before you any further now one more thing that we can do if you if you're asked to put this in vertex form or if you just want to double check to make sure that you get this right I mean I wouldn't let me trust this but if you have to we can always complete the square to verify our vertex this is called vertex form because of the nature of the quadrant of the completely square putting this in the form of being able to use transformations need to shifting up-down left-right this is also the reason why tot completing the square root way that I did the way that we didn't work on both sides of our equation so I want you to understand that when you complete the square on a function like this what you're doing is putting this in what's called a vertex form so we're gonna do it we don't need to set this equal to 0 because I taught you the way we did so let's go through it one time on this example and one time on that example to make sure that we have this down though we're not going to touch it again for a real long time so what completing the square does it says hey I need my a to be one I'm gonna factor out my a from these two terms I'm not gonna touch last trip in fact I'm gonna kind of ignore it not forget it but ignore it I'm going to leave myself a space right here and I'm going to complete this I want to add something here that makes this a perfect square or we're doing basically is understanding that when we complete this square we need a word you have a messy number we need a number that two numbers add to this middle one and two numbers multiply to this last number we're going to be adding this number in here we also wanted to be a perfect square so we want these two numbers to be the same so we think what two numbers are the same that add before it's got to be two and two those are the only two numbers in the world that add up to four and are the same number so what number are we missing well we're missing the number that these two would have to multiply by we're missing a four if I add that four it completes this Factory and it says this will eventually factor as X plus 2 times X plus 2 or X plus 2 squared that's what's gonna happen there that completes this factoring the only problem is what we've done is we've added 4 inside a parentheses but more than that something that has a 2 as a factor that's being multiplied by it so in adding that floor it wasn't there before we added it on there and adding that 4 we really increase this function by 8 distribute the 2 you're increasing the function like 8 we have to undo that we added 8 and then we subtracted 8 to make up for it on the same side of our function that's why I taught this to you the convinced where to you this way because we don't have a zero we don't have another side of your equation to compensate for that we're all working on one side of the function here if we combine some like terms this is minus 3 the 2 stays right up front and so our function says hey if you wanted to put this in vertex form here's what this says oh man I hope you remember transition this is pretty cool this this is a parabola how I can tell all its power to what's gonna happen here you're going to shift down 3 wait a minute down 3 1 2 3 you're going to shift left 2 never have everything excited but this is up so we want so the insides has left to right but plus to be left to left - oh wait we see your axis entry that's pretty neat we know that this is going to be narrow in fact if we use our key points these are things we've covered already and we understand that I take these key points and multiply the outputs the outputs of them by 2 that's 1 comma 2 that's 0 comma 0 that's negative 1 comma negative 2 I'm sorry negative 1 comma and positive 2 so from here this would be 1 comma 2 there should be a point there ok then it's negative 1 comma 2 there sheet a point there there is oh my gosh that's symmetrical that's what our key points would have done by by doing this whole transformations idea doing the vertex form if we wanted to find X intercepts you could set this equal to 0 you can add 3/2 take square root and then subtract 2 and if we look at that as well if we let's say we add - yeah / - sure take squared plus - and subtract - if you evaluate them in their calculator you're going to be the same set X intercepts is this if we wanted to simplify this a little bit and we got to find a common denominator it's gonna not be great but we could certainly have done it this would be they get to plus or minus root of 6 over 2 if we rationalize the denominator this right here if we simplify negative 8 plus or minus 2 root 6 hey that's a square root of 4 times 6 all over 4 and we simplify 2 goes into 8 four times into 2 one time into 4 2 times and that's negative 4 plus or minus square root of 6 over 2 so why do they look different this is written as two fractions so if I separate this negative 4 over 2 plus or minus square root of 6 over 2 this is negative 2 plus or minus square root of 6 over 2 it's the same exact thing it's representing the same exact x-intercepts if you want to find the y-intercept you'd have to plug in 0 or go back to your original and say it's still going to be 0 5 my idea here is just to tell you this stuff all works together so whether you want to do the vertex form and complete the square no problem you can still use key points you can find x-intercepts you can find a y-intercept you can find the vertex very easily this is down 3 left to this says down 3 left to that's exactly the same thing you talked about the same vertex the the minimum height is still negative 3 the maximum height is infinity this goes on forever we can find x-intercepts either way we find a wider step either way it's really up to you know which way you most people prefer most people for this one because you don't have to touch completing the square because this gets really difficult if I didn't give you easy numbers I can't be easy ones here I give you an 8 which was divisible by 2 and then created a 4 which you can separate it divide that by 2 very nicely so that's not the case this becomes a fairly challenging we saw that when I taught you how to complete the square so anyway I hope that I've made sense to you on this example is the longest one we're gonna go through later on the rest of them we're gonna do basically this I'm going to very quickly complete the square to verify the vertex and just practice that a little bit and then that's it so at this point meaning understand vertex comes first everyone ever every parabolas got it we gotta find it the whiner step comes second every parabolas got it we got to find it but if you use it across from the axis of symmetry to find our symmetrical point then if we're gonna cross the X then we find out intercepts so we're going to come back and go on another example just a second okay let's continue so we're looking at G of X we get negative 2x squared minus 4x plus 2 the first thing we got to notice is well what's its shape its shape is it's got a power to that's the largest power it's a polynomial type function this is going to be a parabola now is it going to be upper opening or downward opening because that's an order it's really 90 easy to identify that this is negative 2 and for the x squared so you make it a downward opening and fairly narrow parabola it's going to be this vertical stretch because the absolute value or a is more than 1 so that's a little bit stretched out here's what we're going to practice we're going to go through and find the vertex first then our y-intercept that our x-intercepts if we have two then I'll show you the vertex form if you need to find that and we'll just make sure that they're giving us the same thing so let's start with vertex because every prabal in the world has a vertex this formally comes in really handy our formula for the vertex is we're gonna find based on our ABC maybe negative 2 and negative 4 and C be positive 2 we're gonna find negative B all over 2 times 8 kind of real careful with science I often times we use the parentheses here to represent the sign and to represent the the fact that we need to have that negative and it maintains operation so negative B is negative negative 4 all over 2 times a that's 2 times negative 2 we can't repeat those negatives we're gonna simplify it so negative negative or the opposite negative 4 that's positive forward but we're dividing by negative 4 that's negative 1 now to find the Y value we're going to take that negative 1 we're gonna evaluate it but right back in G of X to find the y coordinate so when we plug in negative 1 let's see negative 1 squared is 1 times negative 2 that's negative 2 minus 4 times negative 1 so negative 2 plus 4 well that's 2 plus 2 is 4 and we're going to take that vertex and we're going to plot it right now so negative 1 comma 4 negative 1 comma 4 right about there and we're going to determine something right now because this vertex is above the x-axis and because it's downward-opening in our heads right now we're thinking I am going to have to find x-intercepts or at least an approximation for them so I'm probably going to be factoring I'm undoing quadratic form because my vertex is above the x-axis that's down over means the parabola is gonna cross it we've got to find that one tell me don't is what if this is an upper opening a man that we're golden we don't have a fine X intercepts at all the other thing we're going to talk about right now is the maximum because this is a downward-opening parabola that vertex represents the maximum height of your parabola of this function so if you were asked say this this is a picture of a ball going up and coming down which it's not well that's how would you find the maximum height well you'd find the vertex so you don't even do any an establish your question just find the vertex the maximum height of a downward-opening parabola happens that your vertex so you've maximum height before it occurs at x equals negative 1 but your maximum height would be 4 that's the highest value that this function attains the highest Y value that you get is 4 of us all right so we know that we know that every probe is going to Y intercepts so we take like two seconds to say if I evaluate for x equals 0 my Y value is going to be 2 and I'm going to plug that right now before I forget I'm going to make sure that because I have that axis of symmetry that always goes right through my vertex I'm going to use that y-intercept to give myself a symmetrical point so I know that APIs to this value of 2 I'm at 0 comma 2 there I know that's one unit this is negative one one unit away from axis symmetry if I go one more unit at the same height but on the opposite side of the axis symmetry I met do the fact that this is an even function well based on the XM tree it's a symmetric function about that so we found the vertex no problem we know we're gonna have x-intercepts you're gonna find right now we find our minor seventh we use X's symmetry we know this time we're opening and now because of that we know this is gonna cross the x-axis so we're gonna do two things we're going to use we're gonna set this function equal to zero and find the x-intercepts and then we're going to determine whether approximation is accurate in equal distance from that axis of symmetry so we set this equal to zero you know we can't forget that we can do nice things like if that's not equal to zero we can try to factor and at least set it up for factoring because it also helps our quadratic formula by having smaller numbers or at least less negative numbers so let me my bad is don't forget that when you're when you're finding x-intercepts it doesn't care if your first term is positive or negative it doesn't care about the signs of it if you reflect this function don't do it now or don't do it over over here like before but if you do it now your x-intercepts won't change and so what we would do so we'd factor this let's factor out negative two that at least gives us something nicer to look at for factory now when we think about it looks like it should be factorable but we can't add the positive two and multiply the negative one that's best I can happen for us and so our best choice here because factory is not going to work I really don't want to do completing the square right now the quadratic formula is pretty much it are eight would be one our B is 2 and our C's negative one so x equals negative b plus or minus you've got a square root B squared minus 4 ay C all over 2a then we fill it out B comes first a comes second C comes last I know that we'd have x equals negative two plus or minus square root of 8 all over 2 can you simplify it yeah you sure can do you have to it depends if you're asked for an exact answer then yes you want to simplify this as the square root of 4 times 2 so 2 or 2 and then we can simplify by factoring or understanding the reason why factor works and simplifying all 3 of these coefficients or constants as the case may be and you get negative 1 plus square root 2 and negative 1 minus square root 2 that's almost easy enough for us to approximate our head if you know the square root of 2 is 1 point 4 1 so if we do that well we go ok negative 1 plus 1 point 4 1 is approximately 0.4 1 and negative 1 minus 1 point 4 1 is negative 2.41 that's what we're going to put on our x-axis as close as we can so let's see negative 1 negative 2.41 needed 1 negative 2.41 and then 0.4 one that's positive man that looks about right that's 1.4 11.40 one on each side of the axis symmetry so I know that we're symmetrical that's probably a really good indication you got this right and now we're going to graph our parabola using those five points as symmetric as possible using the vertex y-intercept second with axis symmetry free point and then your next well your x intercepts if you have them now I didn't promise you those gonna do completing the square just to make sure that we have that right if you have to do vertex formula here's a little bit would do so for our G of X remember we don't have two sides to work on and so that's why I showed you how to complete the square the way that I did because if you don't have that other side you can't compensate with what you're adding for or subtracting on another side there's not one you'd have to do the same side so rather than teach two different ways I choose to teach you the way that I do that we have one way that works all the time what we have to do here is separate our first two terms and our constant and a very far back we don't want to lose it with one ignore per second and we're going to divide out or factor out negative 2 it's going to change your signs we're going to complete this so that is factorable we're missing a number right now just think about what you would have to put here to make the factory actually work it's got to be a 1 so I want this to work as far as being a perfect square trinomial it would be missing a 1 or make that happen I'm thinking hey I got added to what never started to they are the same one what do those have to what does this have to be for those two multiplied to it it would have to be one that's the value of missing the problem is this by excuse me by taking and two by adding that one you are distribute this by adding that one inside of something that has a factor in front of it you're technically subtracting 2 negative 2 times 1 is negative 2 you've actually subtracted 2 from the value of this function you're going to undo that so because you added 1 inside of a parenthesis which has this factor in front of it you add 1 here and distribute that to what you really did is you subtract it to you from that function you've got to add 2 to undo that so what I tell students is distribute and then undo whatever that distribution tells me so this distribution says negative 2 we want to add 2 we want to undo that that means that our function is we know that that's gonna factors right here you can believe this so that one factor as X plus 1 squared we've got this negative 2 in the main this plus for this says you're probably should be shifted up 4 1 2 3 4 should be shifted left one number inside plus means left that's where vertex is it's why this is called vertex form because you can easily find your vertex I'm thinking about shifting up for that's a y-value left that's an x-value that's what's called griffix form we know it's a parabola we know as downward-opening we could have used key points this would be 1 comma negative 2 from here 1 negative 2 and 1 negative 1 negative 2 we get the exact same ones that we got before the drawback is this is a little harder to find x-intercepts from you have said equals 0 subtract 4 divide by name to take a square root and then subtract 1 and approximately but so we did the same thing so that's the idea behind going through this one of those two ways either refining vertex then y intercept the next ourselves if necessary or we're finding the completely square process with vertex form can't do the same idea I hope that made this make sense I hope that you see this completing the square is something that's not SuperDuper scary but something that is giving you the same stuff as this you see one of the problems is in teaching is that we think these are all like not meshed together I need you to understand that whether you're doing this or this you're finding the same thing completing the square gives you the vertex vertex formula gives you the vertex y-intercept you can still find a plugin through you to answer you - or plug in 0 here you get two x-intercepts well I would say that this way it's easier because you have the quadratic formula or you complete the square which is where the quadratic formula comes from anyway so I'm telling you you're doing the same thing it's just a different way to get there so on the next couple examples we're not going to go through the whole vertex form this is only if you need it or if you just really enjoy doing I don't want to practice it so at this point we need to be very comfortable with vertex finding that with the y-intercept using that and then finding x-intercepts of quadratic formula and approximating our calculators so I'll be right back with a couple more examples ok let's go ahead and finish up our last two examples of graphing just to make sure that we understand in the process that we don't always have to find X intercepts they don't show you one way to go backwards so you give a vertex Y in R so we can show you how to get a function like that from it so number one f of X negative 4x squared minus 4x minus 1 we should all know at this point but that's a parabola and the VAT is a downward-opening and really narrow parabola really because that negative force you to stretch this thing out absolute value negative four is four that's a bigger one it's going to be very narrow also what we have is this negative which says that it's downward opening now we're going to go through we're not going to complete the square we're going to do this the vertex wider second then maybe X inertia play if we can so with our vertex we gotta be really good identifying a B and C and also I want to make sure you understand this you've seen me change some signs from time to time that only works when you have this set equal to zero to find X intercepts we can't go and change signs now before finding the vertex in a Watership that's why we do the X intercepts last otherwise we start making these signs change and then we have a different opening parabola that's not okay the only reason why we can change sites with X intercepts is if you reflect a function about the x axis change the signs the x-intercepts themselves don't change because they're on the thing that you're reflecting about they can't change signs because their sign lists that will put a zero for those x-intercepts so we don't change signs until we get to here so for our vertex review all right our a has to be negative for our B is negative four and our C is negative one that's the numbers that we gotta use to find the vertex so we're gonna do negative negative 4 2 times negative 4 we're gonna leave that open for just a second so that we understand we're going to evaluate our function for that x value in order to find our output or our Y value or y-coordinate so that's positive 4 that's negative 8 that's negative 1/2 which gets kind of awkward when you start evaluating functions for fractions I'd recommend your calculator just take it use your fraction button cell P we don't we don't make a simple error but you probably can do that in your head but double check your work at least with a counter because it's really awkward to put that vertex down here and then use a y-intercept that's that's correct with the vertex it's not it's not going to look very good using the unity of that sprout so with negative 1/2 negative 1/2 squared is positive 1/4 times negative 4 well that's negative 1 and then we have this negative 4 times negative 1/2 well that's positive 2 so negative 1 plus 2 months when it's 0 plugging 0 well that's weird the worlds that mean well we know that's a vertex and every parabola has got a vertex let's plot the vertex remember it's a vertex at negative 1/2 0 negative 1/2 0 is right there that's negative 1/2 comma 0 now think about this this is the vertex which means it's the highest point of a downward-opening parabola if this is the highest point can this parabola ever cross the x-axis again not only can we know this because if you have a vertex that sing on the that x axis you have found the only x-intercept it's a double root and if we had gone down to x-intercepts and solve this from equal to 0 we're gonna find negative 1/2 twice if you want to try and try it try factoring it try to do whatever you want it's gonna work it's gonna factor but you get protein and then if you would want so that right there that that vertex is you don't have to do x-intercepts right now you found me all the x-intercept that you ever gonna have for this function what you do have to do is find your liner so if we evaluate 0 we're going to get negative 1 I know that 0 negative 1 is there a y-intercept notice how narrow that makes it if that's our vertex and that's our next point that's a really really narrow parabola now what we do with it well we know that the axis of symmetry goes right through the vertex so find a 1/2 unit away from my axis symmetry here I can go 1/2 unit on the other side and find a symmetrical point this is what we would use to graph our parabola now do we have to continue you have to find the x-intercepts no it's relevant you've already found it so that's what news you order every parabola has a vertex sometimes you're gonna find x-intercept here every Club is going to wander sit use it to find a symmetrical point but if you only if we understand what this looks like a downward-opening parabola it matches that it's narrow if they were opening there's not going to be any additional externships don't wish your time the only thing that might make this a little better is to go one more unit outside of what you have what I mean by that is you might want to plug in a value like negative two or here's zero plug in value like one if I plugged in one and I plugged in negative two I have two additional points that would be symmetrical or filling in one and you symmetry that's fine too but that would give me a better shape of this thing so I hope that makes sense to you for me I mean this isn't clear enough that we know that's pretty narrow but you might want to go ahead and plug in two more points here either or one more point you cemetry so we're gonna do this again that's good of a parabola as we came out of it and if you want to see the x-intercepts if you plug this and are set this equal to zero and you changed all your signs because we can now this is equal to zero so x intercepts if you reflect x-intercepts they don't do anything this is it we get positive 4x squared plus 4x plus 1 this factors actually but you've divided by your a and you'd say oh my x-intercepts are remember this change your sign negative 1/2 and negative 1/2 you have an X here so they get 1/2 that's exactly what we found and there's only one it's a repeated root it's a double root multiplicity 2 says your functions bouncing off the x-axis that is what I want you to understand I hope I've explained it well enough that you do understand that so we're going to go on to the last example as far as graphing concerns to be very quick and then we'll talk about what I told you going backwards all right so let's take a look at G of X we have 3x squared plus 2x plus 5 in your head right now I need you to be thinking that's a parabola I need you understand that it's upward-opening because we have that positive three and it's fairly narrow because it's not as narrow as this one was but it's a little bit more narrow than the two lesser of the form we're going to go ahead and find the two things of this graph is going to have its gonna have a vertex I'll do it's gonna have a y-intercept because they all do but this is not going to have any x-intercepts now I want to show you how to deal with it so for our vertex if we identify our eight which you should maybe try right now our a is three and our B is two and RC is five so we put negative B that's negative 2 all over 2 times a is 2 times 3 that gives us negative 1/3 which is kind of awkward now if we evaluate that that's the only way we find points in functions is to evaluate them or understand the function which we're learning about right now so we evaluate for negative 1/3 and negative 1/3 squared that's 1/9 and then a third of that goes 3 times that is 130 in okay well then 2 times native them Thursday 2/3 1/3 minus 2/3 well that's negative 1/3 plus 5 is 4 and 2/3 and so you do that or you use your calculator any in the same thing you might get an improper fraction that's fine too let's see fourteen thirds would be okay now can we graph that can we plot it sure it's a little awkward but what our vertex occurs is let's say this is negative one the negative one-third comma 4 and 2/3 from 1 2 3 4 2/3 negative 1/3 probably right about the air come of it just might grab a little bit more because of this oh maybe not it's gonna be kind of awkward that's where our vertex is now think you just you still hopefully set in your head but this is upward opening its upward opening and your vertex is way up here is this ever going to cross your next axis ever no this this is there are none if you wanted to use the quadratic formula follow me I hope this makes sense what's your discriminant going to be to be positive negative or zero if this doesn't have any x-intercepts your discriminant would have to be negative this would be two complex solutions here saying you are not crossing the x-axis that's what's going to happen if you try to find x-intercepts so we're not going to you says that we're doing something practical we're actually graphing this so we don't have any x-intercepts writing and trying to find them because we understand this is upward-opening vertex it's above the x-axis in fact our y-intercept which is zero zero zero comma five is right here now this is kind of awkward because we don't have a lot of room to notice the curve of this graph so if you used to act as a symmetry which is fine this is 1/3 of a unit from remember this is negative 1/3 that's 1/3 of a unit away from the the y axis the y axis third of the way where that that y-intercept is is 1/3 of a unit away from the access symmetry if we go another third of a unit so like at negative 2/3 we plot another point use our symmetry and use our knowledge of the fact that this is going to be quite narrow to give ourselves that upward-opening probably no we're gonna get what would make this better is to use some values outside of your y-intercept so i would use something like negative one and maybe positive one and they're not going to give you some magical points here because they're not spread evenly from that negative 2/3 negative 1/3 but it would be a little bit better than nothing so plug in a couple points here to get that that nice look to your graph that's where I'm going to leave you I'm gonna leave you just wouldn't understand what the vertex does that you need at first lime sub second and then you might not even have to do x-intercepts and how to deal with that so I hope that that's made sense I'll come back with one more very quick example okay so sometimes you're asked to find a function given some information like in this case you got a vertex and you have a lighter sentence that's fine with function table we're going to do that with me by understanding how your functions work in what's called a vertex form which I've talked a lot about in this video in the first two examples so what we're gonna do here is twofold because we have one two three missing parts three missing dice and one two three missing or three given values we're gonna use those to fill this function l here's the way that we do it number one take your vertex and fill out what your vertex would do as far as your shifting is concerned think shipping think transformations think that if I have a x coordinate of 1 that's a shift right 1 and this minus 5b is shift down 5 this is shift right one down 5 represent that first then what we do is use the fact that a y-intercept of negative 3 is 0 comma negative 3 that's a point that's gotta be a point so I'll be used points and everything we've done so far use that point to fill out what your date's gonna what you ate is going to be and so I'm going to show you how to do that right now so if you have a vertex of 1 negative 5 you go l-listen that that one that really means that we have a ship left 1 and we have a ship down 5 then instead of having X plus h and this plus K I know that this function is gonna be something like this a I don't know yet but I know a ship left I'm sorry I shipped right I said like a shift right one is X minus one that represents a shift to the right of one unit since this this vertex says I should write 1 and down five that right one is a minus ones you remember that remember that everything said but this is obviously what you see so this is a minus one this would be a shift to the right one representing that that value they shift down five is a down five we know that this would be a shift down five K L so that means this would be a shift right one and that's what that means this is why it's called the vertex form because it models your vertex perfectly in your transformations of course the issue is that I need to find what that a is well your first step is done the first step is use your vertex to fill out what you can by understanding the transformations that are taking place to get to obtain that vertex shift right minus one chip down minus five now we use this point that's given to you here's what this says your input is zero and it gives you an output of negative three well since your variable three inputs is X and your variable for your outputs is f of X plug in your point don't plug in for a this says your input is zero so replace the X with zero your output is negative 30 replace the f of X with negative three this is what this is saying to you and saying if you plug in zero you should get out an output of negative three hey I plugged in 0 I should get an output of negative three and now that we have that filled out there's only one thing that we can do is solve for your a so by doing that negative 1 squared is 1 1 times a is a if I add 5 then a is to come right back up here and just put that in there and you've completed your function that still has a vertex of let's see bright one down five that's here this would still have a y-intercept of 0 three plugins or if you want to 0 minus 1 that's negative 1 squared is 1 1 times 2 is 2 minus 5 is negative 3 so I know that that actually works for the information that's given to me that's how they go from given a point like a vertex and a y-intercept of how to find the function for a mat if you need to distribute it you can certainly do that so you distribute this X minus 1 squared first and then distribute your two and then combine like terms and then you get a function in standard form rather than in vertex form which either way you go there very graphical you certainly graph that this one you thought use the vertex while you go we have the vertex use the X intercepts from let's see the factor bowl looks like it now you figure it out if you expectable or not maybe four maybe six not seeing it there so but you could do it if you had to anyway I hope it makes sense I hope I've explained that well on for you guys to understand it and I'll see you for the next video you
