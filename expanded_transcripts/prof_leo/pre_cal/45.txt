Transcript for: Inequalities with Polynomial Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 46)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about inequalities as they relate to polynomials and the next video is inequalities as it relates to rational functions but before we begin this i really need you to have watched the last video when we talked about inequalities from a graphical perspective i need you to understand what it means when a function is less than zero when a function is greater than equal to zero and finding x the interval on x-axis which causes that i need you to really grasp that you see what we're going to do here is we are going to think of these as functions it is a function but i need that mental picture to be in your head because i'm going to teach you two approaches the first one is going to be graphically just like we did in the last video we're going to get a picture just like that makes it very very nice and then i'll teach you kind of a a different way to go where you can just plug in some values and check the inequality to see whether it's true or false so we're going to talk about that as we go but again you got you really got to watch that video you got to get down this idea of a function relating to zero and the x ax the x-intercept uh interval that we we get from sorry the x-axis interval that we get from that so let's take a look at it if we consider this this polynomial as a factored version of some function oh man do you see it do you see that this is a function it's just asking where on the x-axis is this function less than zero in the previous video it's doing this it's asking that question right there on what interval of the x-axis is this function giving you negative outputs not even x-intercepts just strictly negative outputs or the graph will be below the x-axis not even equal to it so what that's going to do is ask to do the following things and basically all of this stuff firstly find x-intercepts that's really nice and it's factored already identify what those x-intercepts are are they crossings are they bouncings and then get a mental picture of that if we can do that it's really easy to identify where the graph is below that x-axis and that's what this is asking you to do so if we're if we don't just fall into the zone of this inequality i do this and this if we fall into the zone of hey that's a function you guys are so smart at it you guys know that you're watching videos staying hanging with me here it's gonna be easy so we just understand that's a function it's asking where's the function less than zero no problem identify your x-intercepts why well x-intercepts are where the graph has the opportunity to cross or bounce to be above and then below or below above and above or vice versa we can go below and above it can cross or can bounce there those are the opportunities where the function has to change from above to below it creates the kind of the boundaries of our intervals and so we asked the question if this function is below zero on part of the x-axis let's find out where that is x-intercepts are a big part of that because they're they're where you can cross or not cross bounds so we say all right let's do the same thing we can do it for a while one x-intercept would occur at five and another because this is factored by the zero product property would occur at negative 2. so we're going to put that on that number line remember a number line like this is just the x-axis but we're also going to put a little bit more about this we're going to do two extra things when we think about this graphically this is going to do two things for you number one it's going to help you really solidify graphing in your head and number two it's going to give you a very very very nice picture of what's going on so you don't make mistakes we're going to put down what these x-intercepts actually are are they bounces are they crosses so this came from this factor which has a multiplicity 2 we should know right now that that creates a bounce for us or a touch we sometimes call it this factor has a power one which means that we are going to have a cross here if we can just get our end behavior ah man do you remember your end behavior and behavior says we would get an x to the second power times an x to the first power if we distributed that's x to the third that's an odd so here's how this has to look we don't have to be super accurate about it but here's how this has to look we have a cross and a bounce this must look like this odd says we start here we end here remember odds look like that or something along those lines so if our odd has to look like this because it's a positive odd we have to start here we've got to cross come back down bounce that models are odd that models are crossed that models are bounced and now we get a very very clear picture of where this function is below zero below the x-axis it's just like the last video only we're doing the graph now so that's why that video is there that's why a lot of textbooks introduce inequalities with those graphs but a lot of times that connection is not made we can do the same graph and so we just think about it okay hey where is this on what portion of x-axis is my graph below the x from negative infinity to negative 2 no problem not including the negative 2 because that is an x-intercept but we're not including x-intercepts here we want strictly negative outputs above above above above above up and then continues to be above above above no problem this is only one interval from made in fade to negative two where this function is below the x-axis i'm going to change this slightly just a minute and i need you to see it what if this had been equal if that had been equal hopefully in your head right now you'd say yeah you know what if that was less than or equal it would include all the negative outputs but it would also include the x-intercept that would include that negative 2 but it would also include one other point and i need you to see it i need to see that this would be below below below below below equal above above above above and equal it would include a single solitary value of x that would allow this function to be on the x-axis and that would be at x equals 5. how do we show that we put a union and we put the individual value of x that's allowing this function to equal x and that's what we're e equal to zero which is on the x-axis so we're allowing that and you put a curly bracket let's say we show an individual value of x that's causing this to be true and that that's that's it so we see that in the next example which i want you to try on your own actually after we factor it together and then and then we'll kind of understand how to how to deal with that so this is really about all there is to it what we're going to be doing is we're going to think of this as a function as above or below the x-axis or on the x-axis drop a very very quick picture of it and then just consider what it's asking you to do there is another way to do this i'm going to show it to you right now before we move on to the next example the other way that we can do this is we can sort of test values and see if they're true or false in our original inequality honestly it takes a little i think that takes a little bit more time because you're very good at graphing you understand this stuff which makes it quick plug-in values can be a little slow but there are some shortcuts which i can show you um the one thing that i do need to make sure that you understand is that with quadratic inequalities you always got an alternating truth it was always true false true or false true false for if you had two x intercepts it was always that case that doesn't happen anymore because we have this whole bounce idea uh what happens is we can have the same truth statement we're gonna talk about that right now and then we'll go into the next next example so here's the idea if you want to test values rather than graph it's perfectly acceptable any instructor i know would accept that just be very careful with it here's what testing values would do for you so we'd say hey you know what i'm going to test a value in each of these intervals and see if it's just true or false according to my original inequality so remember we've we've got that i'm going to erase that i'm actually going to erase our graph for a second so we would evaluate numbers like 6 that's somewhere in this interval 0 that's somewhere in this interval and maybe like negative 3 that's somewhere in this interval and we'd evaluate that in our original inequality right here in the function so we take a number like 6 and say okay if i evaluate 6 i'm going to get 6 minus 5 that's 1 1 squared is 1 times 8 6 2 is 8. 1 times 8 is positive 8. it is not less than 0. well that's a false statement and what that means is that every single input in here is going to give something that is a false statement according to our inequality something that's positive actually and so we're just going to put a big fat f i'm also going to show you how to cheat at this in just a second if you evaluate for zero okay zero zero minus five is negative five and 85 squared is 25. all right zero plus two is um let's see two 25 times two is i really don't care about what it is but it's positive it's positive 50. let me look at this yeah it looks like positive 50 is not less than zero so this is also another interval for which every single input is giving you a positive output and not something less than zero how do we know every input in there does that how do we know that these are the only two x-intercepts that exist otherwise if you factor different these are the only two that exist and because polynomials are continuous they don't have any asymptotes they don't have any holes in them well you have to be all above here because there's no way to drop below the x-axis on a polynomial without crossing it you can't do it now with rational functions you can because of the whole vertical asymptote idea but those will be on our x-axis and so we'll be able to see that and i'm going to give you some some tools for how to how to find that as well so we go all right well i know every input here has to give me a positive output well those aren't below 0. so this is false and lastly we plug in negative 3 that's going to be negative 8 squared 64 times negative 1 well that's negative 64. and so negative 64 is for sure less than zero oh what that means that's true that means that every single input in this interval is giving me a true statement or something negative and so once we've outlined whether our intervals are causing something that's true for inequality or false we just take the true segments and we say hey the only true interval here that's works in my inequality is negative infinity to negative two one drawback is that i've seen just a ton of students accidentally make their their interval from to negative three the value you plug in that's not what's happening this whole graph will be below the x-axis from negative infinity to negative two that was just your testing point your testing value to represent every input on that interval so we'd say negative into negative two not including the negative 2 because we're not really cared about those x intercepts and that's exactly what we had at first like that like that so we're saying we want everything that gives negative inputs not including that zero not x-intercepts so the way to cheat at it this is kind of cool you do the same exact thing you do x-intercepts bounces crosses you write them down and here's the deal because of the way that graphs interact with a bounce or with a cross you can sort of cheat at this plug in the easiest number that you can think of plug in zero if you can't plug in zero plug in something next to zero putting something as easy as you can so we plug in zero and we go okay if i plug in 0 i get something that is false we've already done it and then think think about what bounce means think about what cross means bounce means that you come down and you have the same output sign as you had before you bounced so if you were positive you remain positive if you're negative you remain negative what that means is that if this interval is false then if you bounce you're still going to get a false keep the same truth statement on both sides of your balance false false or true true that will always be the case for you on a bouncing x intercept hopefully that makes sense to you bounce maintains the same sign and so if one's false is false if one's true the other is true crosses don't crosses change sign so if crosses change sign then one of your intervals would be true and then they're false one would be positive one would be negative or one would be positive would be negative like this but somehow that's how crosses work for for our x-intercepts is we change from a positive to a negative or a negative to a positive so this is false then this will be true your truth should change on opposite sides of an x a crossing x intercept same for bounces different for crosses so if i were to do this really quickly honestly i'd probably graph it because it's that's quick um but if i had to plug in a value i'd plug in something really easy figure out whether it's true or false and then what i would do is identify bounces crosses same truth for bounces opposite truth for crosses that's all you really got to do the other one thing i would tell you though is this is a great way to check your work to understand that bounce has the same truth and cross has opposite that's a great way to check your work even if you do the graphing that's all i really want to say about it what you should do now is pause the video and try that example on your own factor it first and then see what you get so of course we're going to get to it now if we factor this and we think about this as the question where is my function greater than or equal to zero or in other words on what portion of the x-axis is my graph above the x or positive outputs or equal to the x x-intercepts that's all we're talking about so how that starts is find your x-intercepts that means we had a factor that also means we're identifying the x-intercepts we're also going to say what they are whether they're cross or bounce at those x-intercepts why because we know that relates to our truth that relates to our graph so we have said this is actually where the function's above the x-axis or on it we found the x-intercepts because that signifies where our graph is above or below that separates our boundary sort where our graph is above or below the x-axis now we're saying because this factor had an even power and even multiplicity that's a balance because this factor had an odd power that's across due to our multiplicity let's put them in order on our x-axis on the number line we know that's a bounce we know that's a cross i'm going to show you the second technique i showed you on this example first here just so you get um that i'm not trying to sway you on which one to do i really don't care what i would do on this problem if i was not going to graph it is i would think hey what's the easiest number i can think of to plug in and where does that fit i can think of to plug in like one if i plug in one that's pretty easy here you can do it anywhere you really want i'm just gonna see whether that's true or false so if i plug in one let's see one cube is one minus four times one one minus four that's negative three is negative three greater than zero no no that's false so what that signifies is that everywhere between zero and four as that's the representation representative of those inputs it's going to give me something that's negative less than zero that's not what we're looking for so this interval is all inputs that give me something that's not true for my my inequality now let's be smart about it if that's false and this bounces this interval is also false a bounce does this and this or this and this it doesn't really matter how it's going if you're going to use this technique all that really matters is this interval's false this was a bounce so that interval is also false they have to have the same sign on opposite sides of a balance if that's false and this is a cross that's true you have to have opposite signs on different sides of the cross so this interval is false this one has to have the opposite sign and it's therefore true so it appears the only true interval is from 4 to positive infinity because that's this number line that's the x-axis we have to be very very careful though oh and i hope that you see it i really do this is also asking you for function values that are equal to zero function values that are on the x-axis those are x-intercepts so when you do this and you identify that's an x-intercept so is that one this equal is including those x-intercepts even the zero so even though that's false and false it's bouncing here isn't it so somehow it's bouncing there that means it's on the x-axis that's allowed that's something we collect and keep with this therefore we have to include that zero as well that is an x-intercept and that's included in being above or on the x-axis outputs that are positive or zero includes x-intercepts and that's one of them so we have to include that i hope that makes sense to you now the graphical approach to it if we did this a little bit differently and said hey there's a bounce there's a cross i do the same exact thing here i write everything exactly the same i know that my leading term is x cubed x cubed has an end behavior that looks like that so what this says is if my end behavior is a standard cubic it's going to come up this is bounce go down somehow come back up and cross at x equals four and then we can actually get a better picture of it where is my function above or on the x-axis above uh on this interval on here and here and that's exactly the same interval notation that we would get so i hope that's making sense um in just a minute we're going to do two more you should be fairly decent with it at this point what i'm going to do is put them on the board and ask you to kind of pause the video and do it on your own i'm going to go right through it all right we're going to get to it so there's just two more again pause this video and try these the one thing you need to know before you pause it hopefully every positive you already one thing you know before you pause it is while this is a cubic and asking whether where it's greater than a lie it looks like this where is this cubic above this line uh here and here and according to the x interval x axis it's asking on what portion this is the english part of it on what portion of the x-axis are the inputs making these outputs more than these outputs or equal to it where the intersect or whether where this cubic is above that linear that's what it's looking like this is a picture of that but this is very hard to do the way that it's written like that we'd have to do a lot of other things that are much harder than doing a very simple manipulation so the simple manipulation is what this problem translates to where a cubic has outputs greater than a linear or again the translation is where are where are the inputs giving you outputs here that are more than this where is the function above the line where's the cubic above the line that translates to this if you get everything on one side in order first term positive and zero on the other side that translates to a different question with the same interval of the x-axis and that's the way we get away with this remember that what this question is asking you isn't um it's asking you where is where is the interval that causes this function to be more than this one or where's interval of inputs where this function is more than zero it's a slightly different question it translates this graph into this graph so where this function is above the line is where a different function is above the x-axis different look but the same interval of the x-axis that's kind of neat making a little shift in our idea that changes the look of our picture but getting the same interval of inputs that are causing both of these to be true they will have the same solution set both of them are asking the same question in a slightly different way one saying what's the set of inputs that makes this output greater than this one this one's saying what's the interval of inputs in making this output greater than zero it's going to be the same interval so set everything on one side greater than or equal to zero or just manipulate so you have zero on one side of inequality and now what it wants to do is factor completely find your x intercepts and see if you can determine uh what our true and false intervals are so we're going to do that right now the first thing we've got to do is factor and find our x-intercepts because that's where we change from above above to below zero our signs can change there so we factor out our gcf of x and then this factors is pretty nice this is x plus three and x minus one and we have three x intercepts we've got x equals zero x equals negative three and x equals one so we said our functions are sorry factors equal to zero we solve them not too bad we got zero we get negative three we got positive one all of them are crosses so that's a power one power one power 1. all of them are crosses all we got to do is put them in order understand a bit about our end behavior and then go for it so our end behavior is a cubic function right here this is really what we're doing this is the x-axis this is your cubic we're asking where what are the intervals that's causing the outputs of my function to be greater than zero or in other words where's the function above the x-axis or on it if we know it's a cubic then this has to have this odd end behavior we know that so we're going to be down here cross cross cross and up here oh that makes sense that's a picture of my graphing hopefully you can tell why i like this technique for you guys because it's it's really going to kind of solidify the graph in your head as you go through it that's the one way to accomplish this and just do the intervals where the graphs above and equal to the x axis the other way would be to plug in a value i'd probably plug in 2. 2 seems like it's going to be the easiest one to plug in for me so here's the second technique and i'll show you the graphing technique if i were to evaluate 2 evaluating 2. plug into here or plug it in here because that has the zero on it that's what we need to know so plug in two and we go right uh probably here would be okay two times five times one plug it in two not one is gonna give us zero we'll plug in two two five and one that's going to give us ten is ten greater than zero yes that's great so that says that every input from one to infinity is going to give us a positive output and that's exactly what we are asking for so true how about this one opposite truths across from crosses opposite truths on different sides of crosses so this is a false and then another cross true another cross false guarantee the truth is going to look like that so there are two working intervals here one is from negative three to zero the other one is from one to infinity we never include infinities you got to give me a parenthesis but we are going to include these values because we know they're x-intercepts that's why we put crosses here we know they're x-intercepts and we're asking for x-intercepts so we're going to include those that is the the solution said that's the interval for which this cubic is above the x-axis and also where this cubic is above that linear that's interesting same interval same inputs and that's all we're looking for what are the inputs that cause this to be true what are the inputs that cause these outputs to be above or equal to those elements there they are they're right there graphically similar but down a little bit different so we're going to get the same truth but you're going to get a picture of it rather than just the true false true uh which one's better whichever will make sense to you whichever one you think is easier because we understand the end behavior and we understand the crosses here we can say where we are above zero above the x axis or on it is from negative three to zero including that because those are x and then from 1 to infinity including the 1 because that's again an x-intercept we get the same exact solution okay last one seemingly simple sort of problem let's think about what this means what this is asking you is where is this powerful function greater than one well this is the x-axis so really the picture of it is here's x equals one or sorry y equals one where is this power 4 above it that's really all the same on what portion of the x axis is my degree 4 x to the fourth power greater than 1. so above this horizontal line of y equals one we can translate that and it's a literal transformation check this out if we subtract one that changes this question to where is x to the fourth minus one greater than zero now why does that work this is a really nice one for us to see if you take x to the fourth power and subtract one from it what's that do well we gotta be thinking that's a vertical shift right so that's the same question as if i took this whole thing and shifted it down one unit everything would shift the same exact graph is as is it's answering the question for where this function is greater than zero is where that non-shifted function is greater than one it's the same thing you just take this and shift it down you get the same interval on the x-axis i kind of missed it there but it would answer the same exact interval and so we're going to show it this way because this is easy to factor and this one's really hard to kind of kind of do algebraically so we're going to factor this we're going to put our x-intercepts on the x-axis we'll figure out where we're above that x-axis and that will answer this interval for us so the factored version of this it's got a difference of squares it's got it twice so we can factor as x squared minus one and x squared plus one we can't factor x squared plus any other number it's not possible to do it's called an irreducible quadratic across the real number system and since that's what we're dealing with we can't factor anymore but this difference of squares we can so what do you do with this one you actually do nothing it's not going to do anything for you as far as x-intercepts because you can't solve it in the real number system it can't cross the x-axis or it's not creating any additional crossings these two do though since we know that we're gonna cross hey that's a power one that's a power one that's multiplicity one that's odd that means that we're crossing those x-intercepts there's only two of them so we have a cross and we have a cross hopefully we understand that if this is a power form this is just that power 4 power function and even shifted down one unit it is going to cross the x axis that's what's happening here across those two locations we also should understand that if that's a powerful it's got end behavior if we have crossings it's going to look something like that it has to cross and then cross it actually has symmetry on it so it shouldn't come as a surprise that our truth has to be the same here and here it does it does have that symmetry we also know that truth should alternate here oh man that should be that should be just right in your head that this should alternate should be true false true or false true false depend on what we're asking here and since we're asking where is this function greater than zero where is it greater than zero that's greater than zero from negative a to negative one and then again from one to infinity do we use brackets or parentheses well since we don't have the equal sign we are not asking for x-intercepts we're asking for strictly what inputs are giving positive outputs where's the graph above the x not equal to it that's negative infinity to negative 1 and then from 1 to infinity those are the two intervals that cause these outputs to be positive or above the x-axis that's where this graph is going to be above 0. that's where this graph is going to be above one if you unshift it the same interval works it's kind of neat if you wanted to plug in a value of course we could plug in zero zero is really nice uh zero to four power zero minus one well that's negative 1 is negative 1 greater than 0 no it's not crossing say that you have opposite truth and we get the same intervals negative infinity to negative 1 1 to infinity but use parentheses because we're not asking for x-intercepts here's what i hope i hope number one's made sense i hope i've made a connection between graphing and these inequalities that we're doing that's what i intended to do sometimes we treat inequalities if i had just taught you to plug in a value we would not be seeing the connection of the graphs with this and i want you to see that i want you to have that that knowledge because you're it's there like it's right there it will really help you with this idea if you understand the crossing versus bouncing and why those truths have to be different well that's important that's why we studied multiplicity and all that and now put it in conjunction with these inequalities so i hope i've made sense for you really really get this stuff because in the next video we're going to deal with inequalities with rationals and we play a lot of these same concepts so i'll see you for that video and i hope you're all doing good
