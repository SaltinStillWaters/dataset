Transcript for: Finding a Horizontal Asymptote of a Rational Function (Precalculus - College Algebra 40)
hi welcome to another video so in this video we're going to discover how to determine if a rational function has a horizontal asymptote that's about it uh the next video will study oblique or slant asymptotes then we'll talk about end behavior we'll just kind of practice finding all the asymptotes and wholes of the function and then we're going to put this thing all together and graph would be the longest video in this uh this series so in this video when we talk about a horizontal asymptote it's very similar to a vertical asymptote that we we discovered vertical asymptotes like a force field and you cannot touch it with a with the function it will not touch horizontal asymptotes are not of course vertical they're horizontal and there are some different qualities so here's how to determine if or when you have a horizontal asymptote of a rational function so here's what we're going to do we're going to look at our function and we're going to look at the rational part as a polynomial over a polynomial that's what defines a rational function anyhow we're going to look at the leading term of the numerator and the leading term of the denominator if you remember the leading term is the term of the largest exponent in a polynomial so basically you want your rational function in order of both polynomials and order and then we take a look at basically the first two terms and we look at the degree remember the degree is the power of your leading term of a polynomial if the degree of the denominator the bottom of your function is larger than the degree of the numerator you are going to have a horizontal asymptote at zero y equals zero just like this right on the x-axis no matter what if the degree of the denominator equals the degree of the numerator you're going to have a horizontal asymptote at whatever the leading coefficients say whatever the ratio is we're going to practice that now this is a really easy way to remember what to do as we go through it i'm going to explain why this actually works because a lot of times students get this they try to memorize it they get it all screwed up so i'm going to explain to you why this is the way it is so we're going to be looking at degree of denominator degree of numerator those are both polynomials we're going to consider the two cases that we can have for greater than or equal to so a horizontal asymptote will exist if the degree of the denominator is greater than or equal to the degree of the numerator we're just kind of determine which is which if the degree of the denominator is bigger than the numerator then you're going to have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero if the degree of the denominator is equal to the degree of the numerator we're going to have a horizontal asymptote at y equals the leading coefficients so that's basically what i intend for you to learn in this video learn that what we're doing is putting polynomials in order on numerator denominator looking at the degrees so the first terms your leading terms basically just saying hey end behavior is determined by leading terms that's our second note right here and then looking at the degree and saying all right what what's going on here if the degree of the denominator is bigger than or equal to the numerator you're going to have a horizontal asymptote we're just defining which one it is if the bottom degree the denominator degree is larger than the numerator it's going to be at 0 on the x-axis y equals 0 on the x-axis if it's if it's equal so if the degree of the denominator equals the degree of the numerator you're going to have it at whatever the leading coefficients say we'll use that ratio we'll talk about why we'll talk about limits a little bit the two notes i really need you to know i mentioned this just a minute ago we'll do number two first end behavior is always determined by leading terms well that's true for rational functions as well except that on a rational function you have two polynomials one in the numerator and one of the denominators so you basically have two leading terms and that determines the end behavior of rational functions as well as we move on this video really could be a lot longer if i included every possible end behavior but i'm breaking it up i'm breaking up these videos as horizontal asymptotes oblique or slant asymptotes and then this end behavior where those don't exist that is all types of end behavior functions a horizontal asymptote is an end behavior so as you go to the end of your function what's happening is it tending to one y value well that would be a horizontal asymptote as we go to the ends of our function are we tending to be along a diagonal line well that would be oblique or a slant asymptote or as we go to the ends of our function are we tending to be like a parabola or maybe a cubic well that's also end behavior it's all one idea we're just kind of categorizing two specific types so here's what i want in your head right now i want that end behavior or rational functions can be basically one of three things number one you could have a horizontal asymptote in either of these cases number two you could have a slant asymptote that's a diagonal if the degree of the numerator is one larger than the denominator that's what's going to happen or you could have it where you don't have that case where the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator in that case you're just going to get straight up end behavior like a cubic or quadratic they're all end behaviors but you fall into one of those three cases let me make this very clear you will never have both a horizontal asymptote and a slant asymptote it can't happen it's either horizontal or slant or neither and you have some other end behavior so keep it in your head for the next few videos so let's go back to this end behavior is always determined by leading terms i'm gonna fill this one out in just a second well let's look at f of x f of x is four x cubed minus seven x plus one over seven x to the fifth plus two x cubed minus three the leading terms are the terms of the biggest power so the largest exponent in a polynomial if you put them in order they're always first so when we look at our leading terms leading term of the numerator is four x cubed and leading term of the denominator is 7x to the fifth now here's what we learned we learned that end behavior is basically modeled by that well for this bottom polynomial it's basically modeled by that so for our function itself our function's end behavior is going to look approximately like 4x to the third over 7x to the fifth now i want you to think about this for a second if you just think about this and do this it's going to work this is a nice shortcut on how to determine number one if you're going to have a horizontal asymptote and number two which type it's going to be so we can do that really quick we can literally go hey the the degree of the numerator is three the degree of the denominator is five so let's go through it is the degree of the denominator greater than or equal to the degree of the numerator yes it is this is five that is bigger than or equal to three okay very good now classified so number one we know we're going to have a horizontal asymptote now classify it is the degree of the denominator strictly greater than numerator or are they equal let's see 5 is not equal to 3 so we know that the denominator is larger than the numerator as far as its degree so 5 is bigger than 3. what that says is that we are going to have a horizontal asymptote at y 0. so along the x-axis as we go to infinities that's kind of a weird concept it's called a limit as x gets closer to negative infinity and positive infinity this graph is going to get to zero either let's see probably like this because it's like a 1 over x sort probably like this this is going to tend to be really really really close to zero as we go to infinity that's what's going to happen so we're going to identify that right now we're going to say all right there is a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero on both sides so as we get to positive infinity and negative infinity on the x-axis this graph is going to approach the x-axis y equals 0 is the x-axis getting really close to that now we're going to graph that as we move forward we're going to see what that looks like but in our head we know that's going to happen now i want to show you why so that's kind of a shortcut on how you do it you oh yeah look at degree gray is it bigger than cool y equals zero is it equal all right y equals the leading coefficients we'll talk about that now why is that well if you think about end behavior as being the leading terms notice what you can do here we took a leading term of 4x cubed over 7x to the fifth we said yeah our end here is going to look about like that well let's simplify that if we simplify that right now we would simplify and get x to the second power that's 4 over seven x squared and then we do a little bit of imagining um you think you think critically you think if this is how our function is going to behave as we get really really big and really really small on the x-axis so really positive and really negative this is how it's gonna be it's gonna follow this for sure positively and we can simplify it to make it easier to think about now the reason why we simplify it's really difficult to think about x getting very large in both a numerator and a denominator when they both have variables that's very difficult so with our leading terms really focus here with our leading terms we should always be able to simplify so that either our numerator or our denominator x's disappear that is always the case now here's why that's the case we have we have leading terms which are always power functions power functions always have one variable raised to an exponent if we have one of those in the numerator and one of those on the denominator and you're in the same variable you can always simplify them so taking your rational function and your leading terms of both polynomials putting them in a ratio you can always simplify them so do it and then think about it this is much easier to think about think about what's going to happen when you really think stop do not fast forward this video really think about this when you take x and make it very very large positively or i know it's kind of oxymoronical but very very large negatively think about that what's going to happen to the 4 if i start taking x and putting in really big values for x what's going to happen to the 4 nothing the 4 is going to stay the same what's going to happen to 7x squared as x gets close to like a billion a trillion like way more than that well close to infinity is what we would say positive infinity four divided by a number that's enormous like really really large four divided by a billion i mean that's all already really small imagine this imagine taking four dollars and dividing it amongst a billion people are those people gonna get a lot of money no they're gonna get hardly nothing they'll get basically nothing you don't have like a a monetary value for that we don't even have stuff that small okay now a billion's not even close to infinity not even remotely close so take four and divide it by a billion billions what's that value going to get close to not equal that's not what limits are about limits are about what's your function getting close to as x gets to this value close to it what's your function getting close to well as x gets close to infinity this function is getting really close to zero oh that makes sense as x gets close to positive infinity our function gets close to zero as x gets really really really big man if you understand this limits and calculus could be a breeze as x gets really really really big this gets bigger and bigger and bigger 4c is the same that's why we simplified it so you can see that 4c is the same this gets huge 4 divided divided by huge is close to 0. it's not zero it will never equal zero it's never going to intersect that x-axis it can't i hope you listen to that it can't ever equal zero four divided by huge numbers are never actually equal to zero but getting so close that you couldn't even slip a piece of paper in between them like it's that close this is going to what we call approach 0. it's going to get super close so as to tell no difference but there is a difference so as x approaches positive infinity our function is approaching zero it's never gonna equal there but it's approaching that's what the arrow is signifies is this word approaching what about negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity does that do the same thing well let's think about it uh four would say the same remember that that's why we simplify so you can see that four acts as a constant here and this denominator is what is growing larger and larger that's why we get the zero so the denominator grows larger and larger imagine negative fig plug in like negative a billion okay then square it oh that's positive a billion four divided by seven times a positive billion squared or whatever that is uh that is that's also really close to zero so as x approaches negative infinity we're taking and squaring that number aren't we so uh let's see four divided by another huge positive number is going to be close to zero in calculus we go a little bit further we define these as limits we talked about taking the limit as x approaches positive and negative infinity seeing what the signs do this will also tell you in which way your function is approaching zero is approaching zero positively it's approaching zero negatively in this case we're approaching zero positively on both of these cases but we talked about that a little bit later when we started getting into graphene you really won't even need it the way i'm going to teach you but in calculus it's kind of important to know so this is the basis behind why in the world we get a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero i know i'm going very deep into this and i know that most textbooks go just do this yes but when you get to calculus you're going to want to know why this is this is the why when you take a leading term divided by a leading term you can always simplify it that simplified leading term the ratio of leading terms is going to tell you your end behavior so all we're really doing is we're saying okay what's happening as x is getting really big and really really really big positively and negatively we use that sort of terminology what's happening when x is getting really positively big are really negatively big well that's called end behavior that's at the end of our graph in this case 4 stays the same this gets enormous 4 divided by enormous is close to zero approaching zero that's the idea of an asymptote it's really really really close but does not ever touch it that's what we're doing that's why this is here hopefully you can see it now hope you can see that well yeah every time the degree of the denominator is bigger than the numerator what am i going to get i'm going to get constant over variable that's what i'm going to get if the degree of the denominator is larger than the numerator then i will always be able to simplify this power function it will always give me a constant over a variable if the degree of the denominator is larger than the numerator that needs to make sense to you try to even change it if you want to if we change this to a 4 well then i would just get x to the first power does this still hold true yes yes it does it approaches zero more slowly but four would stay the same x would get really large four divided by really large is close to zero as x gets really large positively the function gets close to zero a constant divided by something approaching zero or sorry infinity is going to get close to zero like this now what about as x approaches negative infinity seven of four divided by 7 times something really really really out there large negatively that's still going to be close to 0 4 divided by like negative a trillion or something or negative 7 trillion whatever you want to say 4 divided by that is super close to 0 but it's approaching it negatively so this graph looks like positive close to 0 and negative close to 0. it's sort of doing two different things oh my gosh that seems like an odd vertical asymptote kind of flipped on its side wait a second that's odd what same stuff do you remember this one like five seconds ago i said it probably looks like this why because that looks like one over x squared or something very similar to it the end behavior is modeled by that so i'm studying this stuff because it's really quite interesting that that happens so back to here this will also still approach zero you'll still have a horizontal asymptote at y zero for sure without a double so i hope that makes sense i hope that you understand that we're taking leading terms we're simplifying and we're just thinking we're just using our critical thinking hats and saying what's happening as x is getting big positively or big negatively are we getting close to zero are we getting close to a number and it will bear out and if you understand your end behavior it's going to bear out it's going to actually be modeled a lot by the reciprocal function this um this one over x sort of thing or the one over x squared a lot of times or reflected if you have um negatives in fact i want to talk about that right now what if this were a negative would that change this no it would not so negative four divided by something really large is still close to zero uh no matter whether you have positive or negative this is still going to be a horizontal asymptote y equals zero now your graph will change of course it will be reflected so so think about this man i hope that you're thinking with me here if i took x to positive infinity just plug in something's huge negative 4 divided by something really really really big positively is going to be close to zero but it is going to be negative a negative divided by a positive even if it's a huge number it's close to zero but it is negative this this is going to go to a horizontal asymptote this way from like from the negative side of the x-axis remember this is the x-axis y equals zero is the x so we're getting there from the negative side now divide a negative by something getting really big negatively like negative 7 trillion negative four divided by negative seven trillion negative divided by negative is a positive it's still close to zero but it's going to get there from the positive side of the x-axis if that makes sense you are going to be a rock star when we get to graphing rational functions and we need to calculus because we do the same exact thing and the idea of a limit that's one of the fundamental concepts in calculus one is just getting your head wrapped around what a limit is that's it a limit means what is the function doing what's the value of the function approaching as we get closer and closer and closer to some x value that's basically what it means all right now the other thing that i need you to know is that because end behavior is as x gets really large and really small we actually can cross a horizontal asymptote we can do all sorts of stuff between a um a limited number of x values but as we get closer to infinity that stops happening and then our end behavior takes over so this is different than a vertical asymptote i need you to really get this in a vertical asymptote that value is completely undefined you can never touch that's like m c hammer doo doo doo doo doo doo can't touch this like never but a horizontal asymptote is different you can cross a horizontal asymptote horizontal asymptotes take kind of effect after you get outside of a certain range of values and i can't tell you exactly what that's going to be it just happens as x is approaching positive and negative infinity so think way out there so keep this in mind you can cross a horizontal asymptote that is absolutely possible i will show you an example where that happens kind of difficult to deal with actually but i will show you that you can't cross a vertical you can cross a horizontal all right let's get on to our last example here so we got g of x equals eight x to the third minus two x plus three all over uh two x cubed plus x squared minus seven x plus five and we're just talking about horizontal asymptotes right now we're not even talking about vertical we're not talking x intercepts just whether or not we're dealing with a horizontal asymptote and here's the class that falls in a horizontal asymptote falls into a class of what is called end behavior what's happening is a function is going left and right forever so positive infinity and negative infinity we talked about it in polynomials we knew that odd was like this and even was like this we're going to deal with quite the same thing only now we have these other two we have like a 1 over x it's going to look like this one over x squares like this or reflected one over x or x squared we can one over x cubed would look a little different than that so we can have those things as far as end behavior it's just going to bear that out a little bit um so what we do here is we take a look at our leading terms so when we look at our leading terms of polynomials in this case we have 8x to the third and 2x to the third those are our leading terms respectively just the first two because they should be in order now we want to come over here let's let's make sure this actually works so are we going to have a horizontal asymptote here well all we've got to do is really look at our degree so the degrees are 3 on the numerator and 3 on the denominator just right there and those happen to be the same so big thing through it is the degree of the denominator greater than or equal to the degree of the numerator yes yes it is they're actually equal but yes they're greater than or equal and so we know right now that we are going to have a horizontal asymptote for sure that is going to be the case now let's qualify what type that is is are we going to have a horizontal asymptote at y equals 0 well that only happens if the degree of the denominator is strictly bigger than the numerator and it's not they're equal okay they're equal what's that mean degree of the denominator equals degree of the numerator then we're going to have a horizontal asymptote at y equals and this might be a little confusing but the fraction of leading coefficients wait a second the leading coefficients come from the leading terms okay so let's walk through our end behavior our end behavior says g of x should look a lot like that it should be modeled by that at the ends of the functions it'll appear to be this the leading coefficients are just the numbers in front of your leading terms so like 8 and 2 so what this says it says hey look the degree the denominator and numerator are the same you have equal degrees you are going to have a horizontal asymptote but it's not going to be at zero that only happens when the degree of the denominator is larger than the numerator in this case you just go all right well what's going to happen here well our horizontal asymptote is going to happen at y equals just take your leading coefficients make them a fraction and simplify that means we're going to we would take eight over two so at y equals four remember that y equals four is a constant a horizontal line just like this so y equals four a divided by two is four we are going to get this horizontal line and your function will approach that it'll never equal it at infinities maybe it'll cross it sure but as x approaches positive infinity and as x approaches negative infinity this function will approach it'll get really close to the value of y equals four the function's value will be really close to four for sure now let's study why that happens because i want you to really get this so if if end behavior is determined by leading terms and we have two leading terms one from the numerator denominator we can make a ratio hey we've done that let's simplify that and go we'll wait wait if these are power functions all of the variables can simplify right same thing here we can simplify power functions very easily in this case though if your degrees are equal what is going to happen to your variables if your degrees are equal you're going to cancel them out they're going to be completely gone if your degree of your denominator is larger here you're going to get constant over variable variables can grow constants can't that's why this one went to zero because the constant stayed the same as the variable was growing that's why it happens that's why if the degree of the denominator is larger you're always going to get y equals zero for your horizontal asymptote but wait if your degrees are the same they're going to all cancel out do you see it do you see like if i have a 3 over 3 x to the third over x to the third it's going to cancel or x to the fifth or x to the fifth or x to the degree over same degree this is always going to cancel out and give me a constant and what that says is that g of x is going to be um about four that's the end behavior for it well what's what's that mean if that's a a constant value that means that you have a horizontal asymptote at that value it's not zero because there's nothing to grow larger than the numerator here you're basically saying as as x approaches positive and negative infinity they're approaching at the same sort of rate and the coefficients take over here so we go all right uh well what happens as we go x positive infinity well you're getting close to four how about negan infinity you're still getting it close to four what we do end up losing a little bit is what direction we approach it we'll need some more math to do that it's not it's not like this one you still haven't actually go okay i can kind of deal with signs here well that's positive but it's not telling you what direction you're approaching that that horizontal asymptote all we know in this case is that we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals 4. that's pretty much it as far as how to determine whether you have a horizontal asymptote we're going to deal with this throughout the next like five videos is when we have a horizontal and when we don't when you have a horizontal asymptote and it's actually quite easy to do i over talk this because i want you to understand it i hope you get that like i'm not just getting you to do it i want you to fully grasp what is going on i'm trying to tell you limits so as x approaches positive infinity if you want to write this as x approaches positive infinity g of x approaches four as x approaches negative infinity g of x still approaches four it is a constant it can't change that's why um that's why we have that that just horizontal asymptote f4 because it it can't change it's going to be there the function is going to approach that so i want you to get that i want you to understand that really the basics are look at your degree just compare them if the degree of the denominator is bigger than the numerator you have a horizontal asymptote at zero if they are equal you have a horizontal asymptote at the coefficients of your leading terms that's it if the now you probably should have a question right you have a question um what happens if the degree of the numerator is larger than the denominator well we have two more cases and that's the next two videos the next video is what if the degree of the numerator is larger by one well then we have well wait a minute what would happen think about it what would happen if the degree of the numerator is larger by one you take end behavior just like this and just like this but you'd simplify what would happen if you get i'm just making this up a numerator larger by one well your power function would still simplify and you would get 4x well what's 4x wait a minute 4x looks a lot like slope intercept form the slope is 4 x to the first power would be a diagonal line that's called an oblique asymptote that's we're going to study in the next video what if the degree of the numerator is larger by more than one so what if it's like x to the sixth well then you get x squared do you know what your end behavior should look like a parabola that's all there is to it we're just making end behavior where it gets a little complicated is these are two end behaviors you haven't seen before where we have a horizontal asymptote of zero horizontal asymptote at a constant that's basically it so i'll come back with another video about oblique or slant asymptotes they're sometimes called and then we'll continue you
