Transcript for: Graphing Rational Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 44)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we are finally going to graph some rational functions we are going to do everything that we've learned about but we haven't really put it together and so that's what this is going to be about uh we've learned all the little pieces so we know how to do things like find a hole find a vertical asymptote find a horizontal asymptote x intercepts y intercepts but i'm not showing you how to graph them and there's there's a lot of cases here and so we're going to get a lot of examples but it's going to be a good video so i'm going to give you the steps we're going to go through about six examples five of them going to take a little while one can be pretty quick then two examples of some special cases special instances we can see so we're going to get right into it how we graph rational functions i want to put in your kind of your head what the steps are in order to do this really really accurately and as efficiently as possible so a little bit of speed here but uh but accurate so that's what we want so the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to find some horizontal asymptotes or well there's only one or an oblique asymptote or just straight of end behavior and it's going to be one of those three cases so we're going to talk about finding those first the reason why is because if we factor first well then we have to go backwards to find that so typically your rational function doesn't come factored that would be easiest to find your horizontal asymptote first in that case not too bad these are leading terms from the numerator denominator and we find it if one exists or we do long division for oblique asymptote or we just find certain end behavior so we're going to talk about that first then we're going to factor and find a vertical asymptote or asymptotes or a hole if we have one and we're going to find out whether that is multiplicity odd or even that has to do with how our graph has to interact with our vertical asymptote and if we have a hole we're going to find out where that hole is an ordered pair signifying where that exists or doesn't exist i guess so we're going to do that second after that the next next two are pretty quick we're going to use our numerator set equal to zero to find x-intercepts we're going to plug in zero to find the y-intercept and then kind of a special case if we have a horizontal asymptote that is not zero so a horizontal asymptote equal to zero we wouldn't do this that's what that little note says right there but if we have a horizontal asymptote equal to a constant that's not zero or an oblique asymptote we have to check to see whether our graph intersects that and so we set them equal and we try to solve it if we run into some sort of nonsense statement mathematically well then it doesn't intersect but sometimes these do intersect an oblique asymptote that's a slant asymptote or a horizontal asymptote that's not zero why don't we care about the zero well if we set our function equal to a horizontal asymptote that equals zero we're going to find x-intercepts which was already done right there so we really don't need to do that twice this doesn't happen super often but it can't happen after that what we're going to do we're going to make a number line that has all of our relevant points on it all of our x-intercepts all of our vertical asymptotes on on the x-axis that's what those things would do we're going to make a number line that represents that x-axis and then we're going to plug in some extra points so for every interval that we have we're going to evaluate something and that's going to give us a much more precise look of our graph we haven't done this in the past we've been sketching this is getting closer to graphing it's still sort of sketching but we're moving closer to that because we'll have a little bit more accuracy after that we're getting ready to graph and we're going to we're going to get right to it so let's go ahead let's start again i'm not really trying to teach you how to find a vertical asymptote i'm just teaching you when you would do it i'm not teaching you how to find a horizontal asymptote i'm just showing you how you check to see for an intersection and put on your graph so this is going to be quicker as far as my explanation of these concepts we've already talked about them you've already learned them trust that trust that you have that we're just going to show what the pictures are as we graph them so number one the very first step that we're going to do just to get a feel for how these steps work is we're going to find the horizontal asymptote or oblique asymptote if those exist or end behavior if they don't and how we do that is from an unfactored form it's it's a lot nicer to do that when it's not factored because you don't have to do that sort of fake distribution and use your leading terms already have them so that's what we do at first so we don't have to factor and then sort of undo that so when we take a look at it our leading terms are x for the numerator and x squared for the denominator which means that our end behavior is going to look like the ratio of those leading terms and if you remember what we do is we take those leading terms we simplify it we just think about what in the world that would do as x approaches positive infinity and as x approaches negative infinity that's a limit idea i showed that to you one time really i'm not going to show it to you again we're just going to be thinking through it but really what we're doing is think about this what happens to this function as this variable gets closer to this thing and we do positive and negative infinity actually but the idea is as x gets bigger and bigger and bigger or smaller and smaller not smaller negatively so absolute value larger in both directions what's happening to my function well the one would not change but that number is getting real real big well that means that this this fraction is going to approach zero this is the idea of end behavior it's the same idea it's always just end behavior but the way that we refer to it can be a horizontal asymptote an oblique asymptote or sometimes we get like a quadratic look or some other end behavior like even or odd so in this case so when we have one over x and x is approaching infinity if you ever have a variable on your denominator and a constant on your numerator you're going to have a horizontal asymptote at zero at y equals zero we're going to write that so we're gonna have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero we're gonna put that on our graph in just a little bit once we figure out the rest of our our steps here so that's our that's our first step we take our our first terms our leading terms we put them in a ratio and we think we think what's happening yes there are sort of formulas kind of quasi formulas that says if you have a constant over a variable you have a horizontal asymptote zero that's true but i want you to understand why i want you to go yeah that's zero i want you to think what happens when x gets really big once is the same x gets really big it's it's zero the graph is going to be closer to zero somehow that's why that's there so we have a horizontal asymptote and y equals zero the second thing we're going to do is we're going to factor this entire polynomial we're going to factor the numerator as much as we can we're going to factor the denominator as much as we can and so we get this x minus 1 over x minus 2 times x plus 2 due to that fact it's a difference of squares and then we're going to start thinking about this in terms of do we have a hole or a vertical asymptote do we have some sort of denominator issue that's causing that when we look at it we see two factors on the denominator both of which do not cancel with the numerator otherwise we would have had a whole and both of which would cause the denominator to be zero at 2 and negative 2 respectively so what those things are is those are vertical asymptotes we learned about that so i know that at x equals 2 i'll do a little bit more work i'll show it to you x minus 2 and x plus two both equal zero and we're just going to write a little bit about what that means so we said if our denominator equals zero we have these discontinuities either a vertical asymptote or a whole in this case because our factors don't cancel we've got some vertical asymptotes we have two of them and we also want to know what they are we want to write what the multiplicity is so we're thinking about it going you know what because these come from factors that are one and one as far as their exponents are concerned those have a multiplicity one each that means they're both odd vertical asymptotes so we're going to write that out we're going to write a vertical asymptote and that it's odd vertical asymptote and again odd it's going to be very important for us to see how our graph interacts with the vertical asymptote whether we're hopefully remember this even would match up on both sides go to the same infinities from both directions as we approach those asymptotes from either side odd is opposite so odd opposite somehow we're going to see that bear out in our graph so we've done our horizontal asymptote we've got our vertical asymptotes we've already listed them our multiplicity was one so we just need to understand that's odd and that's going to be opposite as far as our infinities go on step number three we're going to find our x-intercepts this is typically not all that bad once you have this factored your numerator is going to tell you the factors that this that let this fraction equal 0 and that's exactly what our x-intercepts are is when our function equals zero so think about this if our function is set equal to zero so this whole thing set equal to zero if our denominator equals zero those are problems we already did that so the only place where the function can actually equal zero is where the numerator equals zero also i want to say this point it's real important for you to do these steps in order and the reason why is because we don't really want to find an x-intercept before we've taken care of finding a whole why is that well if we find an x-intercept before we've taken a hold you remember that the holes cancel out so you'll find an x-intercept and then later if you found your whole and you cancel them out like wait a minute didn't i cancel my x-intercept yeah kindly kind kind of that's why we we cancel the whole factor and write down what that that whole is before we do x intercepts so at this point you should have taken care of the whole you should have something that's simplified as possible and then we just set our numerator equal to zero it's the only part of the fraction that can actually let the function equal zero so we look at and go all right from this step let's set our numerator x minus one equal to zero and x equals 1. that's our x-intercept oh don't forget this also has a multiplicity to it so it's going to tell you whether it's a cross or a bounce you know what maybe i'll draw it again up here if we set that equal to zero only the numerator has the opportunity so we do that but we also remember that x minus one is its own factor that's where we're getting the x equals one that's where we understand that this has a exponent of one that's a multiplicity one that's an odd multiplicity and when we talk about x-intercepts that means that we're crossing the x-axis here and that's about it so that's the only x-intercept that we have to pay attention to because that's the one that there is so we're going to be crossing the x-axis at x equals one the next thing that we do step number four we're going to go down we're going to find our y-intercept this one's pretty easy you can do it anywhere in the function you can do it at the very beginning that's probably actually the easiest you can do it here when it's factored that's fine you do here when it's simplified not a big deal anywhere you want to go just plug in zero uh which also says that the whole does not if you have one does not affect the y-intercept it doesn't matter where you plug that zero in it's honestly not that bad to do so when we plug in 0 here or here you'd get 0 0 0 minus 1 is negative 1 0 minus 4 is negative 4 negative 1 over negative 4 is 1 4. so when we evaluate we just are evaluating x equals zero notice if you do it here you'd still get negative one zero minus one and here you get zero minus two that's negative two zero plus two is two negative two times two is negative four still you're basically getting the same thing negative one over negative four is still one fourth it's still the same so it doesn't really matter where you go what does matter is after you do this to put it accurately on your graph we really don't want to make mistakes there now you'll see i'm missing step five and here's why if you have a horizontal asymptote that equals zero this step is irrelevant if you don't have a horizontal asymptote or an oblique asymptote this step is irrelevant it doesn't matter and so what we're going to check for is if we don't have a horizontal asymptote that equals 0 or end behavior that's not an oblique asymptote we're going to check for intersection i said it one one i'm gonna say just one more time if you were to go and set your function equal to zero right now so if you took your function right here or right there and you set it equal to zero that's exactly what we have there it would just give you x-intercepts again you don't have to do that but if the horizontal asymptote is not zero you would need to do a step five here in step six all we're going to do is we're going to take these important points that we found put them on a number line and plug in some additional values so here's what we mean by that we're going to take every vertical asymptote and every x-intercept we're going to put them on that number line what this does it models the x-axis for us and lets us go straight to a graph pretty easily so x equals negative 2 that's one of our vertical asymptotes i'm going to put odd vertical asymptote odd x equals one remember this is a number line it's got to be an order that's an x-intercept so we're going to put cross and by understanding the context we understand that's a vertical asymptote i'm not really touching x-axis here it's giving me a vertical dotted line in which i'm going to interact with somehow this is going to be an x-intercept that's what the cross is we are touching the x-axis and then crossing at that point and then x equals 2 is our other vertical asymptote that's also odd probably the most time consuming thing that we're going to do is the next step what we're going to do is we're going to evaluate the reason why is we want some pretty decent graphs all of this stuff has to mesh together like this this horizontal asymptote and the vertical asymptotes and the x-intercept and this y-intercept they all have to work so i'm going to show you how to sketch and then i'll show you how to graph a little bit better one way to graph versus sketch is to introduce a couple extra points so for every interval this is why we do this number line for every interval like this one this one this one this one plug in a value plug in something that's hopefully easy to evaluate into your function and find an ordered pair you can do it anywhere you can do it here from the original you can do it from the factored or if you simplify you can do it from the simplified version of this that's probably the easiest to do so i'm going to evaluate for a few ordered pairs here so we don't want to do 0 because we already have a y intercept so something like negative 1. something like one and a half and something like three so here's what i got when i evaluated these i evaluated negative 3 into my function here or here and i got negative four-fifths i evaluate evaluated negative one and i got two-thirds point five i got negative two sevenths three and i evaluated i got two fifths and you can use decimals that's fine but some of those are not gonna be very nice decimals like negative two sevenths is like negative point two eight or something so our and then two thirds is point six six seven it's it's good enough for us uh but just be aware fractions are sometimes a little bit nicer now we're ready to graph and put everything together so the way that we graph this is the same way that i put these steps forward for you so number one thing we're going to do is we're going to understand our end behavior in this case our end behavior is a horizontal asymptote at y 0. so we're just going to have a dotted line now you've mentioned i've heard i've mentioned this before you've heard me mention it that we have to check for an intersection of a horizontal asymptote keep this in mind you can intersect a horizontal asymptote that's why we have x-intercepts here so we we do cross this it's not the same as a vertical asymptote you can't ever touch that but a horizontal asymptote or an oblique asymptote is something the graph can cross so don't don't make that misconception it's really common for students to go wait a minute now i'm crossing the x-axis yeah that's fine it's okay what happens is we're thinking about x approaching positive infinity that's way out there that's that's not here okay this is not even close to positive infinity so things can happen with this a finite region then afterwards we approach an asymptote so that's what's really happening we're just going to show the dotted line at the ends of our x-axis then we're going to go ahead we're going to plot our vertical asymptotes we have two of them negative 2 and 2. and we're also going to signify that these are odd that's going to help us when we're graphing in just a moment cue our brains into what's going on around them so we're going to put odd and odd do you notice how i'm making lots of little notes to help myself like do that it's really hard to have all this in your head and get it right it's a lot better to put little notes like oh that's odd what i mean in my head right now is that this is either going to interact this way or this way depending on how are our points and how our graph is shaped same thing with that one then i'm going to put down our x-intercept or x-intercept is at x equals 1 and i know it's across so i know we're crossing there remember that i came up with something that little dotted line if it's a balance or we call that a touch sometimes we're not going to use that signify we are crossing x axis after that what we're going to do is we're going to put our y intercept our y intercept is 0 comma 1 4. it's about there we just want to make sure it's on the correct side of the x-axis so it's positive i want to make sure that i put that not accidentally put it down here a real hard time making a graph work if we did that and now the last two steps this and you can probably see i must talk about the difference between sketching and graphing you're going to see that the sketching is quicker but the graphing is going to the graphing to really help you we're getting closer to graphing by using some points here's the idea if all of this stuff has to work together there's really only one way that this graph can be shaped and that is based on where your y-axis is in relation to your x-intercept is in relation to your x and here's why you see these have to have opposite infinities so this way or this way but if we trust that we have all the x intercepts down which we do and that our y intercept is accurate which it is and we found the vertical asymptotes and have their multiplicity correct which we also do and you have your horizontal asymptote which we have then this graph has to interact a certain way so there's no other x-intercepts there is no way for our graph to come down anywhere in this range we cannot do it in this interval we can't do it so because we have our y-intercept there and we do not have any other x-intercepts here it would have shown up this graph has to do this it must hit this from going from positive infinity downward hit it it's got to go and cross here we know cross and therefore because it's a cross we have to interact with this vertical asymptote going toward negative infinity it's the only way this graphing look furthermore because we have an odd vertical asymptote this graph has to now come from up here it can't cross the x-axis we don't have any other x-intercepts and it must interact with our horizontal asymptote on this side because this was from positive infinity and this is an odd vertical asymptote the other part of this graph has to end this way there's no x-intercepts it cannot cross it has to interact with the horizontal asymptote and the vertical asymptote and the opposite because it was odd that's a lot to think about right now so that's the reason a lot of people like me use some points here you see if we put these points on and say hey uh yeah at negative three we got negative four-fifths negative three comma negative four-fifths is right about there negative one comma two positive two thirds here's negative one there's two thirds at one and a half we got negative two sevenths one and a half negative two sevenths and at three we got two fifths it's like point four by putting those extra points do you see how it takes a lot of the maybe not guesswork because we weren't guessing about the sketch but it gives you not only some more accuracy because you have some some actual points but it really shows you where this graph goes like there's no guessing about it now that's why i'm going to encourage you to do that yes it takes a lot of time and i just wrote them up there you have to take the time and evaluate on your function sometimes it's really nasty but hopefully you see it's going to make a better graph for you so now we we have no guesswork we have all of the x-intercepts down we have all the vertical asymptotes we have our horizontal asymptote and we have our points so we graph it trust that you found everything don't accidentally go what if it does this it doesn't because it would cross the x-axis if it did it can't so our graph must look like that it's got to look like that there's no other way for this graph to interact with the x-axis and the vertical asymptotes other than what we've just shown because this is odd i know that now i have an opposite infinity because this is odd it'll have an opposite infinity and we're still going through the points that we just found we also have to interact with a horizontal asymptote we know that we don't cross it because those guys would have been other x-intercepts and we didn't have any of those so is it still a sketch yes it is it is still a sketch because we don't know exactly where this goes we're kind of modeled pretty well but we have a lot more points than we would otherwise but it's still sketchy it's closer to graphing because we're using some of those points we also don't know exactly exactly where like a point of inflection would be um or any sort of and that's where we change concavity it's a calculus one idea we don't know exactly where that is we find that in calc one and so we're getting but we're getting closer to that we're getting much closer so i hope that makes sense this was the first example just going through all of our our steps here unpacking the next five examples we're going to talk about what happens when you don't have a horizontal asymptote that's zero when it's some constant or an oblique asymptote if they intersect where they don't how to deal with a hole and then how to go backwards on some graphs okay here we go we're going to get right into it do another example so as we move through i'm not going to be pausing as much to explain some of the concepts we've already covered the only times i'm going to stop and go a little bit slower is when we've done things we're doing things we haven't done yet such as our end behavior here so i'm going to explain that a little bit when we get there but this is mostly just to get things in your head so that this is all gelling together so uh first thing we do now we're going to look at this and go hey is there an end behavior yeah what is it end behavior takes the first two terms so the numerator's leading term and the denominator's leading term puts in ratio simplifies is what it and we get a picture what it does so we take our x to the fourth over x squared those are our leading terms we simplify we get x squared and then we think about what happens so this right here our numerator sort of outpaces our denominator we get x squared when we simplify and that says our end behavior should look like whatever that power function is that power function is x squared it is going to look like a parabola as x approaches positive and negative infinity so our limit means as x gets bigger and bigger and bigger to positive negative infinity that function says take positive infinity square it take negative infinity square for u positive infinity square positive big square you're going to get this parabola shape to it well that'll bear out when we graph this so we know this is not a horizontal asymptote we know it's not a an oblique asymptote this is just our standard end behavior we're going to draw a little picture of that so x squared looks like a parabola with some things that happen in the middle after that step number two we're going to factor all of this so when we do notice the numerator is a power 4. it's also a difference of squares so we just have to do it twice so on our numerator we can think of this as x squared minus one times x squared plus one over our denominator is x minus two and x plus two it's a difference of squares but that also factors again so we can factor this as x minus one x plus one x squared plus one does not factor anymore that's done over x minus two x plus two and now we're ready to find a vertical asymptote or a hole if we have one so vertical asymptote says look at your denominator look at the factors that are causing your denominator equal to zero write them down and then see if you can cancel them if you can that factor created a hole for you if you can't that factor created a vertical asymptote and then identify the multiplicity of that so our denominator says uh yeah at x equals two and negative two we're going to have some issues i always write down the factor from where i'm getting those it's very very easy when you have different exponents to confuse um where that that domain issue is coming from if you don't write down your factor so i'm writing down x minus two equals zero that way i can follow this back and say oh that had an exponent one i cannot cancel that so this domain issue right there is causing a vertical asymptote which has an odd multiplicity so vertical asymptote odd and the same thing happens here this is coming from the factor x plus 2. i can't cancel it so it's not a whole it's a vertical asymptote and it has a multiplicity 1 stemming from that exponent and so that's also vertical asymptote odd after we've done that what we're going to do is we're going to take this factored form we've factored we would have simplified if we could that would have given us some holes we don't have we're going to take our numerator and set our numerator equal to zero the numerator is the only place that the function can actually equal zero the denominator can't even equal zero that's where we got our vertical asymptotes from so in the numerator we take i'm sorry on this this next step in step three we take our numerator we set it equal to zero and we solve it hopefully you notice it's nice to do it from here because after you've factored and simplified it it's really easy to use a zero product property and say if my numerator is equal to zero it's already been factored i'm gonna set every factor equal to zero and solve so i'm going to set x minus 1 equal to 0 x plus 1 equals 0. this one i could but it's not going to give me anything x squared plus 1 you can't factor that anymore that would give you some complex numbers since we're looking for actual x-intercepts complex numbers don't help us here if we did though if we set the equal to 0 we'd have to list out something like this is no real solution therefore there's no actual x-intercept at least not from that factor that's an irreducible quadratic but the other two the other two are very clearly solvable so we can get one we can get negative one and we understand that because those factors have this power one that's an odd multiplicity and that says those are going to be crosses so we've done a lot of stuff so far we have our end behavior we have a vertical asymptote in two locations we have two x-intercepts two locations we know that they're crosses that's great we know that this doesn't do anything for us the next thing we're going to do is evaluate for zero so we plug in x equals zero you can do it anyway you can do it here on your factored version uh simplified version you can do it here i think honestly it's easiest to do at the beginning so if we plug in zero there zero minus one over zero minus four we get the same y-intercept that we do on the previous graph this graph is going to look decidedly different but it does have the y-intercept of 0 comma 1 4. now again we don't have a horizontal asymptote at all in this case definitely not one that's equal to a constant we don't have an oblique asymptote we have just our standard quadratic sort of looking end behavior what that means is that there's no function to set equal to or that there's nothing to set our function equal to and solve we don't have to worry about that step the next couple examples we will show you show you that but right now we say there's no step 5 because there is no horizontal asymptote equal to a non-zero constant there's no oblique asymptote at all you don't have to worry about it it's not going to intersect this x squared end behavior not to worry step number six says let's take everything we just learned let's put it on the x-axis as a number line let's plug in some additional points and then we'll get a good graph so what that means is that in order we're going to take our x intercepts and our vertical asymptotes and we're going to put them here so x equals negative 2 and 2 those are odd vertical asymptotes we're going to write that down our x-intercepts are negative 1 and one we know that those are x intercepts and they're going to cross then what we're going to do and this is kind of tedious part we're going to plug in some values for every interval and there's one two three four there's five of them here so think of the x-axis as a loaf of bread you just slice it one two three four times you slice a loaf of bread once you have two pieces we sliced it four times we have five pieces five intervals we need a point in every one of those so i'm going to model that right now so i have some values here i've got three and positive negative three positive three negative 1.5 positive 1.5 i'm not plugging in anything here because i'm going to show you that the y intercept can work if you have one what we get if we evaluate for negative 3 we get 16. now sometimes using the stuff i've taught you can be helpful because if you think about it real well man i i hope that you're seeing it is that even or is that an odd function if you think about it that's even because all i have is those even exponents if i evaluate for negative x i get the same thing out that's even what that means think about it even means opposite inputs give you the same output if i evaluate negative 3 and 3 i'm going to get 16 that just saved me a whole lot of work i don't have to evaluate for that that's because we know it's even even a symmetric about the y axis opposite inputs equal outputs if we evaluate for negative 1.5 we get about 2.3 negative and we already know that our y intercept is zero comma one fourth now we're actually ready to graph we're gonna go in the same exact order as our steps here so number one thing we're gonna do is check this out this is pretty cool we can put our end behavior of x squared wait a minute what yeah if we picture this as x squared so just remember that this is a this is kind of a a squished graph because my scale is wrong so i would have to plug in two to get four that's a little better i'm going to put that in here end behavior up there i'm going to show you that this is going to work with that end behavior so we do that first we get the horizontal asymptote oblique asymptote some sort of end behavior then we take a look at any vertical asymptote we have we have two of them we've got one at negative two and one is positive two they're both often so we're going to draw those but we're also going to put that this is odd and odd so we're going to interact with that that asymptote at opposite infinity so one's going to go to positive infinity the other side is going to go to negative infinity as far as a function is concerned so we've done that now we go ahead we graph or we plot our x-intercepts our x-intercept has to be negative one and one they're both crosses so we don't put a little dotted line these are not balances these are crosses we put our y-intercept of 0 1 4. remember this is 4 and so this is really really down there close to the x-axis now we're almost ready to graph notice something this this might be quite difficult to do if we didn't have any of these other points so we have to think about this going what on the world set look like well it's definitely doable if you interact with this your graph would have to have that as a y intercept notice how important that is if you didn't know that there'd be multiple ways to go and do this you can cross end behavior don't worry about that you can't cross vertical asymptotes and so how this graph would have to look if these are all the x-intercepts which they are and all the asymptotes and behavior we have which we have that then this graph has to go like this that's a must it has to cross hit that and cross only way to do it is to do this with those vertical asymptotes so if it's doing this and we have two odd vertical asymptotes this infinity is opposite of this one so this would go this way this graph would do this it would follow that end behavior but also have to pay attention to that vertical asymptote this graph would also do this due to two reasons number one it's symmetrical so this part and this part have to look identical it's symmetric about the y it's an even function but also it's got a it's got to work with it's got to mesh with this end behavior and with our points now putting the points on there's going to make it a lot better so 3 negative 3 comma 16. and positive 3 comma 16 those are symmetric values we already knew that one and a half comma negative 2.3 and likewise and now this clears up a whole lot for us so we know that this graph is going to firstly do this take care of the intervals that have the physical points in there and x-intercepts a lot of them that's oftentimes easier to do so we know that this has to follow those values now there's no question because this goes to negative infinity and we have an odd odd verbal asymptote we have to have opposite infinities we also have to follow that end behavior here's the things we don't know about it that's a fairly decent graph here's the things we don't know we don't actually know where our local minima are here they don't have to be at that value they could be they don't have to be we need some calculus we want to figure that out so that's why this is still a ski we are still sketching that's getting closer to the graph by the techniques i'm showing you but that's about it so hopefully it's making sense like the order works these steps work just do your end behavior first then your vertical asymptotes then your x-intercepts y-intercept make your number line do some additional points that will really help you and then everything has to work together if you find out that man when your points is off and you cannot make your odd vertical asymptote work where your point is now up here or something well then you you've messed them down and so that's the time to check your work ah screwed it up and that'll happen it'll be okay but hopefully these these steps are making sense to you you're able to follow what you're able to see like what we've done in the past now come to fruition like oh yeah hey all this stuff we've done little chunks now we're putting it together i'll see you in a minute for another example okay let's work our way through another example so we have this next one definitely a rational function we're going to see in this example now i'm going to slow down for a little bit when you have a horizontal asymptote that is not zero you have to set your function equal to it and see if we intersect i'm going to show you how to how to do that so number one when we have a rational function the first thing we want to do take our leading terms put them into ratios simplify and find our end behavior sometimes it's going to be a horizontal asymptote so we take our function and we say this is about equal to as far as our end behavior goes can be modeled by our leading term of 3x squared over x squared now keep in mind what we're doing our leading terms give end behavior so when putting in the ratio we're finding out the end behavior of our rational function and if we simplify we just get three so what's that mean well that means that as x approaches positive and negative infinity 3 is a constant 3 does not change 3 means oh yeah my function will get closer and closer to 3 as we continue on this is what end behavior does and beaver says as x gets really really big our function kind of gets closer to this value so this takes over the the leading terms take over and so this says we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals three a constant of y equals three at which our fun to which our function will be closer and closer and closer as x gets bigger and bigger and bigger that's what that means now formulaically uh you could do oh yeah when my exponents are the same you just get the coefficients or leaving terms and it's three that's true but i want you to understand why the why is that as you simplify your leading terms which have your end behavior you get a constant out of them that means that the function the numerator generator with really really big numbers are going to get closer and closer to that ratio three over one three over one three more let's get closer and closer to that it's getting closer to this value of y equals three that's why we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals three so right now in my head i'm thinking oh that's a horizontal asymptote that's not zero i'm gonna have a step five in this step i'm gonna be setting my function equal to three and solving it we're gonna find an intersection there we'll slow down for that in just a little bit on step two factor everything as much as you can because this is where we're gonna look for a whole or a vertical asymptote so on our numerator we can factor out a gcf of 3x on our denominator we have that sort of a dynamic problem or a quadratic that we can factor honestly you could do quadratic formula here um if it's not factorable by something easy but that would lead to some seriously awkward vertical asymptotes it can happen but probably not so don't go quadratic formula right away try to factor in this case we have x plus 4 and x minus 3. now since we're looking for a vertical asymptote or a whole we first check out our denominator we say hey these two these two factors here if they equal zero that's a problem for us to identify that they're a problem that we know that at x equals negative 4 and x equals 3 we're going to have some issues either we're going to have a hole or a vertical asymptote now we look at the factor to say x plus 4 from where we get this discontinuity this does not cancel therefore that x equals negative 4 is going to be a vertical asymptote if it cancels it's a whole if it doesn't it's a vertical asymptote furthermore because it has a power one it's odd here we have also this three came from a factor x minus three it does not cancel therefore it's a vertical asymptote it has an odd exponent therefore it's odd now we're on a roll next up is our x-intercepts so once you have a factor it's really nice we take our numerator we set it equal to zero and we solve it the numerator is the only place where a function can actually equal zero the denominator equal to zero gives us discontinuities those are vertical asymptotes in this case so when our numerator is equal to 0 i told you to put some some parentheses around any factor that has a variable in it and what that does that says our real factor here doesn't involve the three the three is telling us that this is going to have a horizontal asymptote of three also says it's kind of a vertical stretch but that x equaling zero when you do it this way shows you have a multiplicity of 1. oops had that one in my mind having x equal to 0 with that parenthesis and that exponent says you have a multiplicity of 1. that's going to be a cross same thing here x minus one equals zero x equals one and because this comes from a factor that has a very exponent of one you have a cross odd multiplicity gives you crosses now for our y intercept so when we take our y intercept we just plug in zero pretty much it's easiest to do that here you certainly can do it here in your factored simplified version it doesn't really matter so we're going to evaluate x equals zero here we get zero over zero minus zero that's zero over negative twelve well zero over negative twelve is zero remember zero in the numerator and a constant on the denominator is going to give you zero so we have found a horizontal asymptote of three we've found our vertical asymptotes our x-intercepts are pretty easy once you have it factored our y-intercept we just evaluate for x equals zero we got it now step number five if you have a horizontal asymptote that's not zero if you have an oblique asymptote at all you have to set your function equal to that and solve it and the reason is it's because a horizontal asymptote takes over as x approaches really big numbers positive and negative big numbers things can happen in the middle in fact our function can cross that horizontal asymptote and it does here i'm going to show you that so when we have a horizontal asymptote that's not zero again why why not zero well if you have a horizontal asymptote that equals zero that's just the x-axis and you've already found x-intercepts so setting your function equal to the horizontal asymptote of zero is just redoing work it's just redoing finding x intercepts it's got to make sense if we don't have a zero we're going to find some additional intersects and intercepts of but not of zero of y equals 3 in this case so take your function set it equal to this if it's not zero when we do that a lot of things should cancel out we typically if we don't get an intersection we get something nonsensical like 0 equals negative 2. if we do get an intersection we're going to get x equals some value and you're going to see that right here how we deal with equations when we have fractions multiply your denominator both sides you would have already simplified this in fact you could do it here it doesn't doesn't really matter where you do it multiply both sides i like to do it from the original or the simplified version if you've cancelled factors that's easiest here we didn't do that so we're going to multiply both sides by x squared plus x minus 12. so both sides get multiplied no problem if we distribute you're going to see it right away you're going to see that a lot of things are going to cancel out like these x squares we have some these do not but if i subtract 3x squared those would cancel if i add 3x and add 36 we get notice i'm adding 3x to both sides at 6x i'm adding 36 that's 36 if i divide by 6 we get 6 we get x equals 6. that right there when you still have an x and it says x equals sub constant you are getting an intersection you're going to have to find that somewhere so we're going to take that six plug it in and find the point of that intersection now what i said is if you still have an x what's that mean if you don't have an x if all of your x terms cancel that is what tells you that your graph is not intersecting your horizontal asymptote that's what says it so solve it if you still have an x yep you have an intersection you're going to right now find where that point is so we're going to evaluate 6 comma whatever in our function if it comes down to here and you get like something like negative two equals zero and you go all my x's disappeared you go yep it sure did that means that your graph does not cross this that's a nonsense statement says there's no solution to that it's no solution means that your graph does not crawl this graph doesn't cross that graph that graph is a horizontal line that's your horizontal asymptote if you come up with this it means these don't intersect if you come within x's they do intersect find out where now the where should not be hard plug in this six player where well you could plug it in here you know what you're gonna get you're gonna do the same thing as if you plugged it in here wait a minute really yeah because you just set these functions equal didn't you so you said they're equal so if i plug in 6 here and i plug in 6 here it's going to give you the same value it's going to give me out 3. notice what you're doing you're trying to figure out where your graph crosses this horizontal line right the horizontal line is always at 3. so if you figure out oh i'm going to cross it at x equals 6 but it's got to be at 3 because that's a horizontal line so this is going to be 3. and if you want to take the time if you don't believe me plug in six here i really don't want to do it uh i'd like you know what i do i plug in six like here so if i did six minus one is five five times six is thirty three times three is ninety six minus three is three six plus four is ten that would be thirty ninety divided by thirty is three but that was much harder to do than just saying it's three yay that right there is where we're going to intersect our horizontal asymptote at six comma three next what we do is we put all of our important values on here so we're going to have a few x intercepts a few vertical asymptotes we're going to put some more points on there too so i know that at negative four and three we have odd vertical asymptote i know that x equals one and x equals zero we have crosses those are x intercepts and now we have to plug in some other values uh you might be able to get away with this as the point in this interval no no problem you could do that uh probably be better to put something else on there but that's kind of up to you i would definitely recommend plugging in some points on these other intervals so i plug in negative five i plug in negative one you have to plug in something here because you don't have a y-intercept it's not already listed so i'm going to plug in half plug in two i'd probably plug in four okay here's the values that i got i got a negative as 11 and 11 and a quarter 11.25 we got a negative one half 1 15. negative one and four and a half keep in mind we also have that point so that's going to help us out a little bit too and now we're ready to graph it man it's a lot of been a lot of work so we're going to take a horizontal asymptote first at y equals three we're going to put that up there next we're going to do is we're going to take our vertical asymptotes and put them on the board we're going to say odd a horizontal asymptote doesn't have odd or even you have to have some other points to figure out how you're going to interact with that you can do it with some calculus but we don't have that right now i should say you can do it with some limits but we don't we don't have that right now we do have that those are odd we also have that we have some x intercepts one at zero and one at one they're both crosses and that's kind of awkward they're really really close together so we're going to have to know right now whether we're doing this or this we also have to know that so that we interact with our horizontal and vertical asymptotes appropriately thank goodness we put in some extra points here and thank goodness we have that that's a big one because that would tell us a lot about this graph um so if i did six comma three right now notice if i if i find out where my graph crosses the horizontal um asymptote it better be on the horizontal asymptote right because that's where it intersects it's what we did intersections happen where you set functions equal we set functions equal to find out where they cross okay what crosses here if we set it equal to a horizontal asymptote it better be crossing on the horizontal asymptote if it does so that helps us a lot now we're going to put some of these other points so negative 5 comma negative sorry positive 11 and a quarter negative 5 and eleven and a quarter we also have negative one comma negative one half we've got one half come a 1 15 that's right above that x axis but it's a huge point isn't it because we have to we know now that we have to have no x-intercepts here come up hit this point cross hit it cross and go back down that must happen at 2 we have negative 1 that verifies that for us at 4 we have 4 and a half and this is going to give us a fairly clear picture of what's going on so we know i'm i'm gonna do this from the place where i have the most points and the most points is typically around the y-axis doesn't have to be there but it typically is so we have our x-intercepts within our vertical asymptotes we have this uh not y-intercept but another point above the x axis so we know that we've got to do this and this it might be helpful to have a couple other points in here we also know because our vertical asymptotes are both odd odd means opposite infinities we have to do this hit this point we also at that point i'm talking about that in a minute we do opposite infinities and somehow hit our horizontal asymptote or well well come close to it on that side as well now what about that point this is where it gets a little weird so we cross this horizontal asymptote but it's still there we also have an odd vertical asymptote this is true you had that point you have this opposite you have to be coming from up here it's got to be decreasing it's got to go through this point it also has to touch this point so what in the world happens here's what happens and we would know this with some calc 1 doing a a local minimum we would know that this hits this point goes down and then eventually comes back up and hits that it gets close to that horizontal asymptotes as it does a little kind of dip here and gets closer and closer as we get to infinity so there's a little dip but it crosses it and comes back up and gets really really close to that original asymptote so we wouldn't know that if we hadn't checked for this we probably would have made the mistake of just coming down here and floating above it and that's not what happens it hits it and it comes back to it so that's why i wanted to show you this example because some fascinating or sort of interesting things happen with uh with the horizontal asymptotes if we intersect them so i hope that makes sense i hope that this is kind of gelling together for you the the sequence of steps i consider this to be a fairly difficult problem to do so if you're handling it great job you're doing well i'll see you in a minute for another exam okay i hope you're ready for another one this one's got a hole in it we're gonna see exactly what to do with the hole that a hole is not something on the x-axis a hole is something that's off of the x-axis typically that we need to see where it's at so we're going to do that and show you exactly what to do so step number one we got to find some end behavior we take our leading terms we're gonna put them in ratio simplify and understand what that does so leading terms here leading terms say that if we simplify we get 2 that's a constant think about it if your function is taken over by your leading terms you put them in ratio and you get 2 that means as x approaches positive and negative infinity this function gets closer and closer to two that says that you have a horizontal asymptote at y equals two this is our end behavior this is exactly what our function is going to get closer to as we get really really big and really really negative the next thing that we do is we factor everything so we're going to take a moment factor our function both numerator and denominator so if we do that i taught this technique a long time ago but if we do this and divide by our a then what we're going to get is two factors we get this x minus two and two x minus one on the numerator we got a difference of squares i think we've seen it three times already i can't stress how important this is when you're finding a hole do not cross out your factors until you identify what your domain problems are tell you identify what your discontinuities are you have to do that first because if you cross and i go oh there's a dot you miss the hole you're missing a point here and you can't miss the point about the missing point you need to find a hole and so when we factor this the number one thing we do is we take our denominator we set it equal to zero and we say there are two factors right now there's two factors that are causing a discontinuity a domain issue one of them is x minus two the other is x plus two so we identify what they are after we identify that they are so these are domain problems now we identify what they are so we look back at this and say okay at x equals two i am going to have a serious issue at x equals negative two i'm gonna have a serious issue x equals two came from x minus two now you look back here and go oh x minus 2 is something that can cancel now you do cancel it it is gone but it's also identified what this is so when we cancel we say hey at x equals 2 we have a hole before you go any further identify where that hole occurs so we already know that it's at x equals two but that does not mean that you go here and you put a circle around that and go oh there's no point on the x-axis at 2. that is not what this means there is going to be a hole in our function it's going to be right in the middle of our graph it's going to look like this there could be a hole it's going to continue so what we do is we say all right we know right now that we set these equal to zero we find some discontinuity some problems identify what they are oh i crossed this factor from where i got the two i crossed it out that means that's a whole now figure where the hole is how you do that you take the 2 i know it's not there we're figuring out where we have a missing point take the 2 and plug it in it will allow you to now that you've canceled this out so our our simplified function looks like this i want to make kind of two mental notes about this uh the first thing is that this will allow you to find the whole plug in your two it'll allow you to find the hole the second thing everything that you could do with this function you can now do with this one so if you want to find x-intercepts forget that use that one if you want to find out uh your y-intercept you're going to do that you can use this one you want to find the horizontal asymptote you actually could have used this too look at this here's uh 2x squared over 2 of x squared here's 2x over x it still gives you 2. it's going to behave exactly the same as that why because there's only one difference between this graph and this graph this graph has a missing hole that's why we have to use this to find it and identify the hole say that one more time that's kind of missing hold this one doesn't but this one came from that so we know this has a hole at that value that's why you identify your whole first before you start canceling your junk out so we've done that now plug the two in so two would say two times two is four four minus one is three over four that's at three fourths so we are going to put an open circle at that point and that's going to signify the graph's got to go through there right it has to it's got to go up to it and then test it but that's going to be missing whole that's a bit open circle for us then we identify okay at this x equals negative two that came from x plus two x plus two cannot be canceled therefore it's a vertical asymptote and it is an odd once we've done that we find our x intercepts x intercepts are always from numerators you can set this numerator equal to zero but i would encourage you to set it equal to zero after you've factored and cancel it's much easier so your numerator is two x minus one if we add 1 and divide by 2 we get 1 half now notice this did come from a factor that has a power one it's basically a linear right so you can't even have a power two in there this is a cross step number four we're going to find our y intercept we're going to evaluate for x equals 0. you can use this if you want to it's not all that bad you're going to get 2 over negative 4 that's negative 1 half or you can use this plug in 0 you get negative 1 over 2 that's negative 1 half either way we evaluate zero and we got negative one-half as our y-intercept now step five step five says if you have a horizontal asymptote that's not zero or you have an oblique asymptote at all you need to set your function equal to your horizontal asymptote that's not zero and solve it and if you have an intersection you have to show that i'm going to show you what it looks like when you don't have an intersection you're going to come with some some untrue math statement that goes what's that mean it means it doesn't cross and so i'm going to show you that right now so we take our function now which function do you want to take this function or this function it doesn't matter so pick the easier one take your simplified function set it equal to 2. 2 being a non-zero horizontal asymptote if we multiply both sides by our denominator we get two x minus one equals two times x plus two we get two x minus one equals two x plus four and we subtract two x you go wait a minute something's wrong we just canceled out all of our x's and we get negative 1 equals 4. yes precisely can this actually happen can negative 1 equal 4 ever well no that doesn't make any sense so what that means is that if this can't happen then this can't happen if this is untrue then this is untrue this means if not possible that means it's not possible for my function to intersect my horizontal asymptote that's what that's saying this says there's no intersection here this says this can't happen so therefore that can't happen there's no solution to it so that says that this graph this graph doesn't cross that horizontal asymptote there's no intersection and now we're ready to put everything on our x-axis to model our graph and then graph it so we have a hole we have a vertical asymptote we have one x-intercept so we put that up there so we know that negative 2 vertical asymptote odd we know that we have an x-intercept at one-half as a cross we know that we have a hole and that's a whole now we're going to plug in some extra values we're going to evaluate for every one of these intervals to make sure that we um that we have an accurate graph you can use your y-intercept for this one that's totally fine so i'm going to do one two three since we already have something in there so i'll evaluate negative three use zero here you'll use one and three this is going to give us 7 1 3 and 1. and we are ready to graph the first thing we're going to do is we're going to put our horizontal asymptote on our graph after that it's time for our one vertical asymptote at x equals negative two now we know that's an odd vertical asymptote and now for our points so we have our y intercept we know that our y intercept is zero comma negative one half that's right down there we know that we have an x intercept at one half that's across that's right there then we go ahead and we say we have a couple other features that we need to need to notice we have a hole your hole is not here notice that would create some sort of really awkward thing here we have to we have to match up with this so it would be impossible for us to cross cross and then not cross again and hit a horizontal asymptote there's no other x-intercept beside the one that we have so we cannot cross the x-axis anywhere else we also know that we do not cross our horizontal asymptote that's what this said you do not cross it so there's no coming up here there's no coming up here going back down there's simply you have to do this and that is what this does for you right where we have our hole this two common three-fourths is at 2 comma 3 4 we have an open circle our graph is going to go to that circle and go past that circle now we fill this out with some other values we know at negative 3 we got seven we know at zero we had negative one half we already used our y intercept at one we have one third and at three we have one this is going to be really clear if you do it this way i hope you see i hope you're seeing how these extra points really clear things up so we know for sure like there's another x-intercept so we know for sure we've got to do this and then we have to go through that point we have odd odd means opposite infinities for vertical asymptotes we do not cross our horizontal asymptote that's what this said no intersection so you don't cross it you go right to it you don't cross it you go right to it the previous example we crossed it and had to come back to it that's not happening here that's how we do our holes what we do is we find them we figure out where they're at and we put an open circle there it's very useful because it gives us another feature of our graph the last thing we'll say is that this graph is the same as this with that filled in that's what it would look like this graph has just that missing hole it's super interesting it's kind of fascinating that they're they're so close this this one is missing that hole which is why we had to do it this way figure to hold first and then cancel it out hope that makes sense we're down to one more kind of serious one and then some special cases and things i want you to know outside of just taking a function and graph it maybe how to go backwards things like that okay we're hammering along this is going to be the most kind of labor-intensive one uh so this has an oblique asymptote in it i gotta show you how to find it um i'm to show you how to find where your function intersects it and what that means for our graph so it'll take a little bit of time to explain that but it's it's going to be the same process that we've gone through so the first thing we do find your end behavior now your end behavior can be one of three things it can be like a power function on or even a positive negative it can be a horizontal asymptote a zero or a constant or it can be oblique asymptote you are going to find an oblique asymptote if this power is greater than that power why because if you do your end behavior and you take your leading terms and you simplify them you're going to get x to the first power x to the first power is a linear function remember the second example we had x squared that was a parabola x to the first is a line it's called a slant asymptote or an oblique asymptote that's what that is however unlike with your your x squared uh what we have to do is we have to figure out where this thing is exactly for a slant asymptote so what we're going to have to do is our long division of polynomials and that can be a little tedious so when you find out that you have an oblique asymptote go one more step take your numerator divide by your denominator and do exactly two iterations of long division and here's what i mean by exactly iterations just divide your first term by your first term so x cubed divided by x squared is x multiply so x cubed minus 9x subtract and we go right x cubed minus x cubed is zero zero x squared minus nothing it's still that 0x squared and we have 0x minus negative 9 that's plus 9 that would be 9x and then check one more does this divide this no it doesn't if you had an x squared here yes you would so let's say that was like x squared x squared divided by x squared would give you one and you put plus one this right here your quotient is what your oblique asymptote is this is the function for it so y equals x this does not matter so we would i'm gonna show it to you right now if this were the case but let's pretend that this were like a a 2x squared or something well then we when you subtracted x cubed minus x equals zero 2x squared minus nothing would be 2x squared and this would be plus 9. we would do one more iteration you'd say 2x squared divided by x squared would be 2 and then you'd have x plus 2 as your slant asymptote you'd go to 2 go up 1 over 1 and draw a dotted line that goes diagonally that's what would have happened now we didn't we didn't have anything right here so as soon as you get to x plus something or x minus something or 2x whatever as soon as you get a linear equation you're done we didn't have this and we didn't have that so this was completely empty that was just 0x squared which is why we just get x and not x plus anything so our oblique asymptote is y equals x now we go and factor everything to figure out where our whole or vertical asymptote if we have any r now if you don't remember how to factor x cubed minus 1 that would be a difference of cubes how you factor difference of cubes you take the first thing being cubed you put it here you put it here but you square the second one the last thing being cubed is one we put it here we put it here but we square the second one multiply the one times the co times your your first factor that would be one x put the same size you start with that's minus one opposite sign and always a plus so this is going to factor as x minus 1 times x squared plus x plus 1. if you don't remember that you might want to go check out like intermediate algebra when you factor difference of cubes so that's on there you can check out the video on the denominator we have a difference of squares again that's gonna be x minus three and x plus three one nice thing about the difference of cubes and sum of cubes is that this is not factorable so it's going to be an irreducible quadratic which is great because that means we only have one x-intercept here now as far as our vertical asymptote or whole what we do is we identify that we have problems so we know that we're going to have problems on these two factors we write them down first and we solve them and then we identify them so x equals three that's a that's a domain problem discontinuity comes from this factor this factor has a power one this factor is not cancelable it's an odd vertical asymptote same thing here since we've already factored our function we set our numerator equal to zero for x-intercepts the only one that actually is is able to equal zero are the linears that you factored non-reducible quadrat or irreducible quadratics like this one that you can't factor try it quite try quadratic formula if you want or do you get 1 minus 4 1 squared is 1 minus 4 times 1 times 1 that's negative 3 instead of square root that is an imaginary number this is not going to give you any more x intercepts just this one so x minus 1 equals zero that comes from a factor that has a power one this is going to be a cross for our y intercept we just plug in zero it's real honestly easiest to do here so in your original or your simplified function if you have holes so from here we plug in zero we're going to get positive one-ninth now for a bit of awkwardness if we have an oblique asymptote or a horizontal asymptote is not zero you gotta set your function equal to it i would recommend setting your original function or your simplified if you cross out some factors that's great but here we have to set this equal to whatever we get here if it's not zero so we take our function the reason why we're not using this one is already factored we have to distribute it that would be a real pain the only time you use something from here for this step is if you have cancelled out a factor and it's something that's nice not factored version anymore otherwise we go right back into here we say if we had a horizontal asymptote that's not zero if we have any sort of oblique asymptote set your function equal to that so we're going to set it equal to x if we just if we multiply and we distribute and we simplify a little bit so if we subtract x cubed both sides these are going to cancel we're going to get negative 1 equals negative 9 x hey look you haven't simplified all your x's that means this function will intersect this y equals x oblique or slant asymptote it will happen where it happens is if you divide by negative 9 x equals positive 1 9. 1 divided by 9 or negative 1 divided by negative 9 is negative 1 9. but remember we've just found a an intersection right so we're not going to go to one knife here and put a little point what we found out is that this function crosses this function at that x value you need a point when you're crossing a horizontal asymptote and when you're crossing oblique asymptote so we're going to cross at one ninth comma something how do you find the something well there's two ways and we saw this when we intersected that horizontal asymptote you can take one ninth and you can run it back through your function or you can run it back through the function you're crossing this is way easier so if i plug in 1 9 here i'm going to get 127 minus 1 i'm going to get uh oh shoot no i'm not gonna get one one more that one 729 minus one i'm gonna get one eighty first minus nine that's divide those things you know what i get i get one ninth why because here's the other function the other function is y equals x what's your y value when x is one-ninth that's what we're doing we're figuring out where this function crosses this so all we have to do is plug it into what whichever one we want which is easier you see if we're finding out where these intersect they have to have the same x value and same y value we found out these intersect when your x value is 1 9 so you have to plug it in to figure out your y value plug it in here you're going to get one knife plug it in here you're going to get one knife which one's easier that one so if i plug in one knife to my x value of the function i'm crossing my oblique asymptote it's going to also give me out 1 9. that's a little awkward but that is a point on the graph that's 1 9 1 9. now why is it the same thing put an output i hope it makes sense because that's exactly what this says to you this says that for y equals x that diagonal line your output equals your input so if i have an input of 1 9 i have to have an output of one night that's gonna make sense the next thing we do is we take all of our important values we put them on here on our x-axis so we have a few points we have a couple vertical asymptotes that are odd we have one cross at x equals one i'm not going to put that point on there but i am going to recognize that this is a point on my graph i'm going to have to put that there it'll be on my oblique asymptote i'm also going to plug in a few other values so i'm going to plug in something like negative 4 i'm going to plug it i'm not going to plug in 0 because i already have that i have my y-intercept i'm going to plug in 2 [Music] so i'm going to take these values i'm going to plug it into my function let me use this one because it's a little bit easier to evaluate for me right now okay so i've taken the time to evaluate i plugged in negative four got negative nine point three two got negative one point four four and got nine we're ready to plot this along with our intersection between our function and our oblique asymptote and our y intercept so we start the same way that we went through this first thing we're going to do is show our end behavior somehow so i'm going to show my oblique asymptote keep in mind it's not perfect 45 degrees because my scale is a little bit off i've kind of compressed this a bit to allow for our space next thing we do we put any vertical asymptotes that we have on the graph and we know that they're both odd finally we put our points on there we put our x-intercept at 1 we put our y-intercept at 1 9. we put our intersection of our of our function and our oblique asymptote so this has to be on this dotted line this diagonal line that is that is our our intersection and this is a little weird so there's a one-ninth for your y-intercept and a one-ninth one-ninth for your intersection between your graph and your obligation this is one reason i put this on here because this is going to show you that this technique of graphing or sketching doesn't give you everything that you you probably should have on a real graph and we'll talk about that when we get there but we put it we put it on there we are 0 1 9 that's this one we have our 1 9 1 9 that's that one we have our x intercept of 1 we know it's a cross we know it's not a bounce and then we put our points on here so negative 4 comma negative 9.3 we also have our y intercept already we do 2 comma negative 1.4 and we have our 4 comma 9. all right and using what we know about this what we know is that we found we found trusted we found all the x-intercepts we also know that this is odd that is odd we also know there's an oblique asymptote that our function has to follow we also know that if we found all the x-intercepts we cannot come back and cross this anywhere that means that because of that y-intercept um we probably should have something yeah honestly we really should have had something in here as well we don't it's fine but we probably should have a point in here and that would show it a little bit more clearly if we plugged in negative one or negative two that this has to behave this way that would be an appropriate step to take now how in the world does this happen what happens there what probably happens is there's a little dip so a little uh sorry a little rise so this probably rises and goes back down it's not flat don't do flat it probably does this a little rise in there but that that teeny local minimum or local maximum depending on what it does that would be found with calculus so we'd have to find that here we know that it's got to follow this there's no x-intercepts hassan or y-intercept has to hit this intersection between y equals x acid or x-intercept cross passage at this point has to be negative infinity can't come back out because this is odd we have opposite infinities we also know that we do not intersect the the y equals x line that oblique asymptote anywhere but here otherwise it would have shown up and we set them equal so we can trust that this doesn't intersect this just loops around and follows that oblique asymptote because this is odd our infinities have to be opposite and something quite similar happens here that we follow that oblique asymptote that's about as good as i can do with hand sketching and this information is to get a look about like that that's why we still call it a sketch it's closer to graphing we have it much more accurate than if we didn't have these these points but it gives you a fairly clear picture of what's going on with your graph so we have just a couple more examples one that's very quick graphing and then some special cases things that we can't do okay this is gonna be a fairly quick example letter version quick of something that that's already factored for you that you really don't want to distribute and how to deal with that also how to deal with a bouncing x intercept how to deal with a um an even multiplicity vertical asymptote so that we're going to explore those things as we go through this so we take a look at it we go right x squared x minus 1 squared over x plus 3 to the fourth should i distribute all that no no when you're dealt this and you still need to find end behavior even like a horizontal asymptote deal do it the way that i showed you with the sort of fake distribution and then what that's going to do is that's going to say take your largest powers that you would get if you were to distribute and so we'd say here's an x squared here's an x to the second power that's x to the fourth on the numerator and if you were to distribute this you'd get an x to the fourth well that's one x to the fourth divided by x sub four is one this is a horizontal asymptote at x equals one i'm sorry i misspoke at y equals one we have a horizontal asymptote y equals one so as x approaches positive negative infinity this graph is getting closer and closer to one somehow the next thing we're going to do is we're going to factor everything hey look at that it's already factored that's fantastic so it means if you were to distribute this you have to refactor it don't do that just take what they're giving and say hey we're going to have a problem if this factor x plus 3 equals 0. that would be a discontinuity so we we say that we have a problem we show what the problem is and then we identify the problem so x minus 3 comes from x plus 3. this factor does not cancel so right here this says this is a vertical asymptote and it has an even multiplicity then we find our x-intercepts so with an x-intercept we take our numerator and set that equal to zero from our factored version now what i told you is that we're really concerned with the factor equaling 0 and then the power of the factor telling us whether we cross or bounce so our factors here are actually x and x minus 1. i don't want you to think of x squared as the factor which you think of x as the factor and the power 2 is the multiplicity so x equals zero by the zero product property x minus one equals zero but the same property x equals one no problem but this is a factor x it's got a power two that means that we have a bounce or a touch this also has a power 2. this is another bounce or a touch now we find our y-intercept but if we do that hopefully we understand that if we evaluate 0 and we have an x-intercept of 0 0 for x-intercept is going to be zero for a y-intercept also you can try if you want to but plug in zero here you're getting zero times i really don't care zero times anything else is zero divided by something that's not zero otherwise we would have had a hole because something would cancel is going to give you 0. now you'll notice that even though we have a horizontal asymptote of y equals 1 i'm not setting my function equal to that one and the reason is if i do that here i'm going to spend a very long time distributing so x plus three to the fourth power is x plus three times x plus three times x three times x three you use binomial expansion either way it's uh it's gonna be kinda nasty um [Music] so we're not going to do it if if you have to then you have to distribute that if you figure out where you have an intersection if you do have one i'm showing you a quick sketch to get a picture of this graph without doing a whole lot of work so this was quick this was quick this was quick now let's see that this gives a pretty decent graph without having to do everything about it without plugging in points even so we get a nice sketch so we're going to firstly do our horizontal asymptote of one our vertical asymptote at negative three and put that it's even that's different we've never seen that before then we put our x-intercepts we know that we have zero and we have one but we also know that those are bounces so i showed you a little kind of trick here if you put a little dotted line in the neighborhood of those x-intercepts that says that we're going to bounce now if those are the only way that we intersect with our our x-axis we probably need at least one other point to say where we're even at and so i would do something like plug in negative one negative one would be good because if we know that we're down here we bounce bounce well that doesn't make a whole lot of sense because we have to intersect that so let's figure out where that negative one is so we're going to evaluate f of negative one okay i've taken the time to evaluate two values i've plugged in negative one got out one fourth plug the negative two and get out 36 and the reason why i did both is because i don't want to take the time to see if this function intersects this horizontal asymptote here's the reason why i plugged in 2 points if i plug in negative 1 and get out 1 4 and plug in negative 2 and get out 36 that's way up there that means that this value let's put it here even though it's way higher than that that means that this is going to have to cross that horizontal asymptote so in plugging these two points i eliminate setting this equal to that and trying to solve it so that's now i don't know whether it crosses here and comes back down but i don't think it does so here's what's going to happen with us what's going to happen is that we know that in order to hit this point we're going to have to and we know that we don't want to hit this point we got to come from way up here we're going to have to cross hit this point we're going to bounce we have to bounce again and interact with that horizontal asymptote now what i admit to you is i don't know if this actually crosses and comes back down i'm not sure we'd have to set this equal or use some calculus to figure out whether that happens what i do know is that there's a bounce here and here so there's got to be some sort of turning point in there somewhere i also know that because this is even i have in these equal infinities i also don't know whether this is crossing here and coming back up we need a little bit more math to do it all i really want to show you in this example was how to deal with an even even has even multiplicity and therefore vertical asymptotes the same infinities also when we have bounces just keep in mind we're not crossing there so this graph looks about like this so we're going to have to come down bounce bounce and come back up so i hope that makes sense to you we'll come back with a couple special cases and then we'll be done okay last little bit some special cases an awkward formation of a function and going backwards from a graph into a function which is not as hard as it seems as long as you follow what i've shown you you'll be fine so what to do on something like that uh number one i want you to understand a couple things about this you can't there are some other ways to do it you can look at this and get some important features out of it such as you can still get a vertical asymptote at zero you can actually get an oblique asymptote at 2x so that that's sort of valuable what you what might be hard to see is that you don't have any x-intercepts uh that can be difficult so my my advice to you is take this find a common denominator and make one fraction out of it it'll make it in the form of a rational that you're used to so because our common denominator would be x we'd multiply the first function by x over x and we get this function 2x squared plus 9 over x i'm not going to spend a whole long time on this this is a lot easier to see that you have a vertical asymptote at zero it's also hopefully easy to see that if you set your numerator equal to zero there is no way that you can make that happen 2x squared plus some other number in no way ever equals zero without imagining numbers so you can't do it there are no x-intercepts there's a vertical asymptote at zero and there's also an oblique asymptote we can see that 2x squared over x gives us 2 x in fact that plus 9 without an x being up here if you were to do long division polynomials you would get 2x you'd multiply get 2x squared subtract you get 0 bring down 0x and go oh it doesn't go in hey there's my oblique asymptote so how this graph looks i'm just need a really quick picture of it this has an oblique asymptote at y equals 2x this also has a vertical asymptote at x equals zero and we know that it's odd because that's a power one so the way this graph looks you might want to plug in one half or something if you plug in one half uh notice that you get something that's let's see 1 plus 18. uh that's going to give you 19. so plug in one having some way up here so what that means is that our graph looks like this and do the oddness that it's kind of an awkward looking graph but getting some information from this is easier than that and that was my point here so get a common denominator make one rational function really easy to see that we have a vertical asymptote at y at x equals zero so on the y-axis that means that we don't have a y-intercept if you plug in zero here you have a problem there's no minor shift there's no x-intercepts it's easiest to see here we have an oblique asymptote it's easiest to see here and then to take care of it so that's what that graph would look like kind of awkward not a lot going on with it but hopefully it's still interesting to you the last one can you take and find a function from a graph yeah and honestly it's not all that bad we just have to put a couple notes on here and then we're good to go so when you're doing this we're asked to do this take a look for some important pieces of information any asymptote and any x-intercept and put odd or even on its multiplicity as far as multiplicity so let's take a look at our x-intercepts first so i see two x-intercepts one is at three and that is a cross across what we know is that crosses have odd multiplicity i'm going to look at negative 1. oh that's a bounce and what we know about bounces they have even multiplicity that's what you're looking for now we take a look at our vertical asymptote we have one here we have one here this has opposite infinity so i know that x equals negative three i have an odd asymptote and at x equals 1 i have the same infinities that means that x equals 1 i have an even vertical asymptote i'm looking for my y-intercept i see it there i'm also looking for a horizontal asymptote i see one at y equals two we'll talk about how to deal with this so when we come up with a function here's what to do first start off with your x-intercepts and your vertical asymptotes and put them in the appropriate numerator or denominator x-intercepts come from the numerator so they're going to give you factors on the numerator just match up the multiplicity so i know that we have an x minus three remember x equals three would be a zero so x minus three would equal zero and that would give us a factor this is kind of we've done this before going from from zeros to two polynomial functions we've done that that's why this is here so we have we would have one factor x minus three because that's a cross i know that we have a power one the next thing we're going to do we're going to understand that x equals negative 1 would be a zero so x plus 1 to 0 would be a factor for us but because that's a balance that has an even multiplicity so given power 2 not 4 or something we talked about why that was in another video but we don't want to go super high and we could put a 3 but it's probably not the case now go with your vertical asymptote so i have 1 at negative 3 so if our denominator is equaling at x equals negative 3 some sort of vertical asymptote then x plus 3 would be a factor on my denominator so x intercepts numerator vertical asymptotes came from denominator therefore vertical asymptotes will give you factors on the denominator one of them is x plus three x plus three notice if that was there that would give you an x minus 3. it has an odd multiplicity because of the opposite infinity so we're going to put a 1 and now we have x equals 1. that was a vertical asymptote so x minus 1 equal in 0 would be a factor on the denominator that's giving us that vertical asymptote hopefully at this point you're understanding we're just going backwards but we're just kind of going in a totally odd like opposite order also so we're dealing with our x-intercepts before our vertical asymptotes getting numerator before denominator and now we're dealing with our multiplicity so an even multiplicity for our our asymptote right here same infinity says let's put a 2. we're almost done the only thing that we have to do now is check for for our horizontal asymptote our horizontal asymptote is 2 now what's that mean a horizontal asymptote only happens at a constant if your degree is the same for the numerator and denominator let's check that here's one two three one two three so i know my degrees are the same here as they had to be to give me a horizontal asymptote that was not zero and not some other end behavior so that had to happen our degrees had to match up on numerator and denominator now i know that that horizontal asymptote is at two so what i'm going to do is i'm going to say hey this would give us one over one i'm going to make sure it's 2 over 1 i'm just going to put a 2 right there and you can double check everything about it but this will be this graph i know my degrees match i know i have a horizontal asymptote too you can fake distribute to try that out i have my vertical asymptotes at negative 3 odd cool positive one even got it i have a cross at three i've got a bounce at negative one and my y-intercept of uh negative two we can plug in two and check that or plug in zero and check that if we want to so if we did that this would be 1 this would be negative 3 and this would be 2 so that would be negative 6 over plugging in 0 here 1 times 3 that would be three negative six divided by three is negative two so we know we're right on the money so that's really nice uh you can do you can do the horizontal asymptote a slightly different way by taking this point that's not on your x-axis and calling this a i'll show it to you now if you called that a then what you could do is plug in zero negative two zero for your x and negative two for your f of x and it would solve that for you uh now we get a equals two and that would tell us hey that a right there that's a two so there's a couple ways to think about that one is just using your horizontal asymptote and you're good to go the other one is using a point off of your x-axis and doing what i did here we've actually done that already we did that in our polynomials when we were in the same section as using graphs to figure out your functions so taking x-intercepts and going backwards so we've done that this is just another iteration with rationals i hope all this makes sense i hope it's gelling together i hope that you understand the interplay between your vertical asymptote and your graph and your x-intercepts your bounces across put everything together right now for you so i know it's long video i hope that you hung out the whole time or watch it over several occasions or put on two times speed so i talk super super quick that's fine too ultimately i hope that you've enjoyed the graphing we're basically done this is as much i can teach you as far as graphing rationals in this class next what we're going to do we're going to talk about inequalities for polynomials and for uh for rationals and we're about done then we wanted something completely different talking about exponentials and algorithms so i hope you're hanging with me hope you're enjoying the class still see you later you
