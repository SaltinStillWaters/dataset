Transcript for: Area of a Sector, Angular Velocity, Applications (Precalculus - Trigonometry 5)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to do a few applications of some angles as they relate to some circles so things that involve arc length and area of a sector and then some angular speed so that'll be kind of interesting and we'll figure out how fast we're going at a certain location on the planet earth so that'll be kind of fun so just a few things to get us realizing that these angles are very useful and i've picked three examples that i thought were kind of fun so let's get right into it so i live at about 48 point whatever that is degrees latitude and there's a city that i have to go to and i've been to a few times that's at 43.6 so odd degrees latitude and roughly the same longitude so if you're not familiar with latitude and longitude every line of longitude is a great circle a great circle means a circle that goes around a sphere that if you cut it would pass the center of that sphere longitude goes between the poles and always those circles would go through the center latitude is like climbing up the the um the face of the earth from south pole to north pole and so only one of those is a great circle at the equator all the rest are minor circles they don't go through the center if you were to cut of make it smaller and smaller and smaller so if we are at this many degrees latitude versus another degrees latitude and it's on roughly the same longitude so a great circle which means the radius would be the same from the center of the circle to those two cities can we find out how far apart they are now of course it's going to take a lot more miles to drive this than what it is because we got hills and detours and i like to stop and take breaks and see cool things but could we find out the the literal distance if the earth was a perfect sphere and we can we can't with just the the length of an arc so our plane so let's do this if we have this this picture in our head of on one circle we have a difference of 48 basically minus 43 degrees if we find the difference between those two locations of latitude on that one longitude that can be our angle that sweeps out or subtends a certain arc length all we need to know after that is what our radius is so when we run into problems like this and we're thinking this is on a circle we can do things like subtract angles and get a distance or an angle between them which is very nice to do so we're going to do that first so let's take our 48.6 ish degrees minus our 43.6 degrees and the difference between those angles will be the distance orbit practically that that angle between them and that only works because they're on roughly the same longitude if they weren't don't you imagine this if they weren't on the same longitude you'd have a great circle going this way and another one going a different way you'd have some sort of a a distance between them kind of sideways if you will not straight up and down that's why it required this in the same longitude so so practically if we have this ball then we're going on one great circle from one city to another that's going to be the same radius to the center that's going to be one straight let's say above the other and that's why we can subtract these angles if this wasn't there this would be a problem so when we subtract that we get about 5.1 but we're going to be a little more specific 5.083055 degrees so given that and that the radius is about three thousand nine hundred sixty miles from uh any longitude to the center of the earth the longitude remembers it's a great circle and so it goes all around around the earth and if you recut it would go through the center so therefore the radius from that to any longitude of which both of these are on the same one is 3960 miles um so that's our radius from the center to protein well i mean the earth isn't a perfect sphere but if it were to any point on that sphere including these two and this becomes kind of a nice problem really easy actually arc length would give us the distance from one point to another on a circle since we're on the same circle remember that was heat then we're finding the distance from this first city to the second one by simply finding our r plane so 3960 miles times 5.08 3055 degrees whatever that that distance between those angles are or the difference between the angles now of course there's a problem with this and i really hope that you see it whenever and it's meant it's such a common mistake i see it all the time whenever we're given something in degrees which is great can we use it for formulas that are not based on degrees well no this is what was so important about understanding that with degrees and radians a lot of our formulas only work in radians or we have to convert them i mentioned that last video and now we're seeing it in play so this right here this works only if we have radians why because there's really this hidden over one rating when we started to create uh that proportion so this is only in radians you can't do this can you see how a lot of students would make that mistake they go oh yeah i get miles i got an angle let's multiply that we're going to get i don't know close to 20 000 miles probably not because the circumference of the earth on any great circle is only about 25 to 26 000 miles so probably not with only five degrees what happened there is we used a formula that had only the ability to plug in radians and we used degrees so this has to be translated fortunately for us we know how to translate that we know that we can take this and say okay 5 degrees times pi over 180 would be our conversion between um 180 degrees times one radian or pi radians so if we do that conversion what we're going to end up getting out of this is that this degree converts to point to point zero eight eight seven one six zero four five radians all i've done there is taken on my calculator and done five degrees times pi over 180 radians the degrees cancel we're left with radians that's our conversion we learned in last video now this is what we use for our formula so we know that because our arc length only works in terms of radians we've got to do that it's really common to to make that mistake also notice that because this has a hidden over 1 radian our radians have to cancel that that's the reason for the the the problem with our degrees this is really over one radian your angle has to be in radians in order for our units to work correctly if not we'd get something weird we'd get like uh miles times degree radians well you need to convert one of those in order for your units to match up so here we get miles times radians so mile radius doesn't make sense but remember there's really a hidden over 1 radian there that's why the units actually work so when we multiply we say all right first thing make sure on the same longitude that's one circle therefore we're finding arc length on one circle it's got to be a great circle for that to work we subtract that's the difference between the angles on that same circle well that gives us the swept out portion if we find arc length of that angle with whatever radius we have toward the center of the circle that's great but we had to have that in terms of radians for our formula work we made our conversion not hard just to convert from degrees to radians you're multiplying pi over 180 the degrees have canceled you're left with radians this has a built in over 1 radian from our original proportion and then we multiply what we're going to get out of that is a unit of length that's that works great for us as long as our units have matched so our arc length is whatever this is so we're going to multiply about 351.3 miles now how accurate is that it kind of depends on if these are actually on the exact same longitude these are probably not really close um if the earth is perfectly spherical on that portion or if it's been dented somehow if there's a big mountain in the way but if you were to take this on a sphere that's that's the close to the exact distance that you would get between these two cities so i hope that makes sense i hope that you understood the key point here was first two key points firstly it had to be on the same circle same longitude secondly we had to have this in terms of radians and i can't tell you how many times i've seen students try to plug in degrees because they were never taught where this formula comes from and that there's really an over 1 radian that you have to cancel out and that's why it needs it necessitates the use of radians there so i hope that makes sense we're going to go on we're going to talk about area of a sector all right so if we're going to talk about the area of a sector what are our plans going to be because we don't have a formula yet is we're going to create a proportion very very similar to what we did for arc length but instead of using the circumference of a circle the distance around that circle compared to the arc length or proportion of that we're going to look at the area of a circle compared to the area of a sector which is a portion of that so we're going to create a proportion to do that so start thinking about it if we remember back to the area of a circle we get this pi r squared pi times the radius squared would give us the area of any circle so let's say that's the area in one full revolution or one the one time around the circle if you will sweeping out the entire circle will give us an area of pi r squared whatever that radius is but what's the angle of that well well the angle in terms of radians here now that's something right because we're using not 360 degrees we're using radians and so what the formula we're going to get is it is only going to work with radians so if we go all the way around a circle number one we have an area of pi r squared number two well the angle that we just swept out is 2 pi do you remember that there's 2 pi radians in one full rotation of that circle or having a terminal side that ends where your initial side begins that's what we know we know that one full circle pi r squared one full circle two pi so that's a proportion we can use now what we're going to do is say all right what if i don't want to go one for rotation what if i want to sweep out just a certain what we call sector a certain sector to find the area of that sector well the amount of area that sector contains will be proportional to the angle that creates it so we're going to set up a proportion for sale right suppose that we sweep out the sector a a compared to the angle that sweeps it out has to be equal to a full area of a circle compared to the angle that sweeps it out that 2 pi the full 2 pi radians that create one full rotation that circle and we're going to set that up so a the area of the little piece like a piece of pi that sector compared to the angle that sweeps it out must be some proportion must be in proportion comparable to the full area of the circle compared to the angle that sweeps out that full area so the piece we're looking for compared to the angle that makes it has to be in proportion to area of a full circle compared to the angle that makes that which is that 2 pi radians and this is really nice you can see it's really nice because a lot of things start to simplify that wouldn't happen if we had used degrees so this formula while it only works for radians is a very nice formula if we multiply both sides by 8 we end up getting this equation for the area of a sector of a circle so i'm going to take one half you can easily leave this over 2 but one half r squared times theta if we multiply both sides by theta the pi's are gone you have this over two idea one half r squared theta but theta has to be in radians the reason why it's got to be in radians is because that's what we chose as the angle measurement that sweeps out a full circle we said all right the angle that sweeps out this portion or this sector area of the that sector has to be proportionate to the angle that sweeps out a full circle but we chose radians and that's why that works so this creates something really nice for us we're going to do a couple examples really quickly about finding the area of a sector given that we have a radius and an angle or a radius an area can we find the angle that needs that it needs to be to sweep out that certain area so let's give it a try if we have this radius of three meters and we have an angle of 120 degree weight 120 degrees is that a problem well it's certainly going to be a problem we try to plug it in here because if we were to do that and we'd say hey our area of a sector that has a radius of 3 meters and an angle of 120 degrees is not going to work here this is a big problem for us uh the reason why this is a big problem is because there's a hidden two pi radians right there and you need to see it you see why this is a second time just like we did on on arc length is that by not writing that radiance sometimes we forget that this really when you simplify this is one-half radians r squared times theta radians uh is just one over two radians what it is one over two radians times r squared which is a a distance squared that's that's a that's a unit of area times theta radians so when we do this we have to have radians to cancel that out it's a really important thing but if we don't show that we don't say this is really over two radians on the denominator that becomes an issue we start plugging in things like degrees and we make very big errors so so don't don't do that let's make sure that we understand that these formulas only work for rates because that's what we chose here and you have to simplify those units some textbooks even don't show that they just kind of assume that you understand it but that's what's going on we oftentimes have in these formulas that are based on radiance this over one radius or in this case over two radians that have to simplify units so that would be a big problem because we'd get let's see nine over 2 radians times degrees so that'd be um let's see 540 units of measurement degree radians and degrees over radians that that's that's very awkward um so what we're going to do here is we're going to translate that so we can't plug in the 120 but we do know that we can convert it pi of radians over 180 degrees is our conversion so when we simplify that we would get 2 pi over 3 radians that's what we need for a lot of reasons that i just explained to you it's very similar to the arc length but in our area of a sector we had to use that radiance and that's in that formula it's hidden but it's in there and this is one of the problems that we have by losing some of our units it's very common to do but remember this this is meters so we're going to get 9 square meters here this is 1 over 2 radians our ratings are going to cancel there's a lot of things that actually simplify here we get our 2 simplify this would give us a nine simplifying three was going to be three pi three um sorry nine squared over three that's going to be three but squared square meters there so three pi meters squared oftentimes we don't think of things in terms of three pi we go what's three pi i don't know well it's it's roughly uh 3.425 meters squared and so that is a unit of area i really want you to watch the units here sometimes we ignore that we just go it's 9.425 what is that i don't know i have no idea or because it says area we're finding an area which is true but look at why that is look that this goes here that's three meters either square is going to give you a unit of area there this is one over two radians this is radians the radius cancel you're left with those meters squared so everything else works itself out we get that 9.425 square meters or meters squared it matches up and we know that's the area of the switch the sector swept out with that angle measurement 120 degrees or two pi over three that's going to be in in quadrant two and then a radius of three meters so kind of a large area i hope that makes sense to you now we can go backwards so if we have an area of a sector eight meters squared and we have this radius of 6 meters and we put in the right numbers in the right units in the right spot i am on purpose not writing those units so that you get kind of used to it because a lot of people don't do that now should we yes we honestly should we should be putting meters squared and meters and over 1 radian because that's really there or in this case over 2 radians because i want you to see what actually happens here so i didn't write it first because you need to be used to it but secondly i want you to see that it actually works and that what we're getting out of this has to be in terms of radians so if we have 8 that's little but meters squared and this is 36 meters squared and divided by 2 and we keep that radians then what we're going to end up getting is this 8 meters squared equals 6 squared 36 divided by 2 is 18 meters squared over radians if we multiply both sides by that 1 radian and divide by 18 meters squared notice you're going to get 8 meters squared over 18 meters squared radians will switch to the numerator what you're going to be left with is in terms of radians so just simplifying a little bit looks like 4 9 radians now a few things we could do with it could we could we change this into degrees yeah if we wanted to we'd multiply by pi over 180 i've started 180 over pi i'm making this smoke there we multiply by 180 over pi that would change this in two degrees to be kind of nasty but you could certainly do that i'm not going to do that but you can try it i've taught you how to convert so that's 4 9 radians remember it would be 180 degrees compared to pi radians and so we can simplify radians 180 or pi times 4 9 you get the number of degrees there you can also make a decimal that'd be point four four four four four four four forever radians and you could do that as well so i hope it makes sense i hope that you're understanding the idea that radians are super important that's what you're gonna get out of these formulas because they're based on radians when we can when we complete them when we make them also the units do work a lot of times we don't show them because we kind of infer that they're going to work because we we set it up correctly and that's okay to do that but i want you to at least see a few times that this is what's happening and this is why right here why that angle comes out to be radians in the end because it's hidden in there right there when we write this formula very beginning so i hope it made it make sense we're going to come back with one more hope you stick around for it it's about um angular velocity angular speed and uh velocity uh on a kind of a rotating sphere so i'll see it in just a second all right let's do one more example i'm going to try to go pretty in depth in this example i think it's going to be kind of fun so we're going to talk about how fast we are going as we are standing on the earth right now so the earth is spinning around its axis i've tried to represent this here with our axis a little bit off kilters not perfectly straight up and down and we're go we're going around this thing so how fast am i moving where i'm at right there this is me hmm well interesting question right because right now it doesn't feel like i'm moving at all but we are also traveling around the sun and we are spinning we're talking about just the spinning just that that uh that linear velocity as we are spinning on the surface of this sphere and we're going to talk about that right now it's going to take a few things to first get there we're going to need to know well our angular velocity so how fast our angle is changing and in which direction we're going to call it positively but positive angular change is going to be swept out at a certain rate that's going to be our angular velocity we also need to know linear velocity so how fast our arc length is changing well that's going to be a measurement according to time and we're going to put those together and see how just about how fast we're going as we're standing on this this spot now a couple quick questions about that does your linear velocity change depending on where you are on this great sphere that we call the earth yeah yeah it really does where would be your fastest change and why well because our axis goes right through the two what we call poles of our earth the closer that we get to that the slower we spin because our radius starts getting closer and closer and closer to zero to on the pole that's interesting where you'd spin the fastest would be right at that equator and so we're going to look at that a little bit later but i'm kind of prefacing where we're going with it so let's talk about angular velocity angular velocity we're going to call this a little little w it looks like a w at least um is going to compare our angle that we're changing with time and so our angular velocity is kind of a logical thing that we get here angular velocity is the angle we're sweeping out compared to the time it takes to sweep out the angle well if we sweep out let's say degrees just because we're usually 60 degrees in 10 seconds or 60 degrees in five minutes it's going to be a different rate of angle sleepage if you want to we're sleeping at an angle at a slower or quicker rate so that's our angular velocity is what we call that now how about linear velocity linear velocity we call that v is how quickly our arc length is swept out so how fast we're traveling along that arc of whatever circle in this case this minor circle why not a great circle well it's a minor circle because it's it's perpendicular to our axis but not going through the center and so yes it does cut a circle but not not the biggest one that's possible on our sphere it's a minor circle goes not through the center perpendicular to an axis that's going to create a smaller circle than an equator every latitude besides the equator is a minor circle it does not go through the center every longitude does because every longitude has those poles of the axis as part of that circle and so every single circle that goes this way is a great circle goes to the center every circle that goes this way up that or perpendicular to the axis is not that's our latitude so our linear velocity is going to say all right it kind of depends on on a couple things it depends on our arc length compared to the time it takes to traverse that arc length that distance well now that's kind of cool because we know an arc like this our arc length there's another formula for that isn't there this arc length is r times theta now stop right now and make sure you understand this because we're using this formula our angles have to be measured in radians if there are degrees we have to convert them because right now we're putting that idea in there remember this is like over 1 radian we don't write that but that's there so let's make a little substitution if our velocity is equal to arc length compared to time and arc length is r times theta let's put that in there right now in your heads you should be thinking this makes perfect sense this is arc length compared to time arc length is a distance so covering distance in a certain amount of time that gives us a velocity we have a direction here so we're thinking positively measuring though this does give us a distance converge time or a velocity now wait a second if you look really closely here this angular velocity is whatever our angle is compared to how much time it takes to sweep it out but our velocity our linear velocity is a radius times the exact same thing so we're going to take that and substitute it that right there is angular velocity so doing a nice substitution hey arc length compared to time that's kind of a logical intuitive approach to saying yeah uh how fast you're sweeping out a distance is a velocity or how fast you're covering a distance i should say our arc length is r times theta that is a radian idea well let's substitute that in there so we have arc length over time great that's velocity and now this little part is our angular velocity how fast we're covering that swept out portion that angle and that right there is how we'd find linear velocity it's going to take two things we number one have to find angular velocity and then substitute that in there for a rate with a radius and we'll find out how fast we're going on the edge of our minor circle on which we're standing it's kind of cool so let's think about angular velocity right now if we wanted to take one full rotation of our earth so one full rotation on on any circle really one full rotation on any circle is going to cover two pi radians now why am i using 360 degrees right there i want my units to match and so i'm going to use that two pi radians as a way to say if i were to go around one full revolution have you noticed that we're always really doing that we're always taking one full revolution because we take proportions thereof to find all these other formulas so if i want to find out how fast we're going on any of our our minor circles or great circles around our earth then i would say let's do it for one revolution in one revolution we have two pi radians think what we're doing right now i'm saying if i want to on any of our our circles here on any of our latitudes if i'm going to go all the way around and end where i started well then that's going to take us 2 pi radians to do that all right well if that's 2 pi radians how long does it take to complete the two pi radians in other words if you start where you stop or sorry if you stop where you start you've made one day how long does it take to sweep out two pi radians on on our planet uh to sweep out one full rotation one revolution well it takes 24 hours i'm going to write the radians there so that we see that that's a united measurement has a unit to it does it make sense you that on our earth on these circles on which we live whether you have a minor circle here or a great circle here or you're down here it's going to take you 2 pi radians to complete one full revolution and no matter where you are it takes 24 hours to do that that should make sense to you you should see that you should see that yes going around one circle is two pi radians as far as the angle being swept out that's angular velocity two pi radians no matter where you are you're going this way around the axis it's going to take you 24 hours a day is 24 hours whether you're here or here you're just moving faster here than you are here than you are here interesting okay well let's uh let's simplify that a little bit so on earth no matter where you are our angular velocity is pi over 12 radians per hour that is exactly what we're going to do there that's exactly we're going to put all we have to understand now is well what's the radius where i'm located for me not for you because you don't live in the same planet you live in the same latitude that i do that that'd be cool doesn't work for you too but you don't say live at the same latitude as me probably so your distance from where you are to the axis is different from where i am to the axis of rotation our axis of rotation we call that uh going to the north and south pole our axis of rotation has a different distance depending on where you are on this longitude so as where i am this 48.6 degrees north that is a radius of 3 000 miles approximately now that's saying something because the radius as you get to the equator which would be the furthest distance from the axis of rotation is about 3960 miles so i am 960 miles closest to the axis closer to the axis of rotation than someone who lives on that latitude that we call the equator i hope you're getting this i hope you're following it's kind of interesting so my radius is three thousand miles so 3 000 miles times pi over 12 radians per hour wait a minute i'm seeing the miles per hour but what gets rid of my radiance well this came from arc length arc length had a hit hidden over 1 radian this has a hidden over 1 radian there's a hidden over 1 radian here the radians are going to cancel and you're going to get 3 000 times pi over 12 miles per hour if you approximate that that works out to about 785 miles an hour so where i stand right now even though i'm not moving because i'm spinning around that axis of rotation at that minor circle it's not the equator it's something smaller it's a smaller circle because i'm further up that axis around that circle on which i stand i am traveling approximately 785 miles an hour what about someone who's more north than me they're traveling slower they have to cover less distance to make it around in a day less arc length to make it around a day less circumference because their circle's smaller what i'm saying at the equator they are traveling faster the radius is larger they have to cover more distance more arc length to make it around to where they started in a day that means they're traveling faster to do that but some more south well it starts getting slower and slower and slower and slower to get to the north pole or the south pole depending on where you're located what atmosphere so i hope i've made that uh made that makes sense to you i really hope that that you're seeing the interplay between this that you say this formula makes sense that's the the amount of angle compared to time the amount of arc length compared to time we can have an arc length and it creates for us this angular velocity we can do a substitution all we need to know is the radius from your minor circle where you are on the ser the uh descriptions of that to your axis of symmetry and then for everyone on earth we are all traveling at 2 pi radians for 24 hours that's what a day is so that's pi over 12 radians per hour so if you want to do this on your own um there's some some places on the google that you can look up what your latitude is and then from there you can figure out the distance it does require a little trigonometry sometimes if you're gonna do it on your own find out the distance from where you are to the axis of rotation just plug it in you can see how fast you're going if you want to do this on the equator to see what uh what the fastest people on earth are doing all you'd have to do is plug in 3960 miles that's generally the the radius from uh the center of the earth to any edge now you might be thinking that wait a minute why isn't this from the center of the earth to the edge because the earth is not spinning around that center it's spinning around an axis that goes through that center and so we find the distance to that axis that is the distance or that is the um the thing around which we are spinning so we're not just tumbling we're going around an axis so if you want to find out the fastest people and say well the equator is the distance furthest away from that axis of rotation that radius would be 3960 miles and you can figure that out okay i couldn't just leave it so i did this with on the equator and how fast people are going just by standing still the linear velocity of someone who's standing on the equator right now and it's uh not an insignificant difference so 1037 miles an hour a bit under let's see 250 ish uh 250 miles ish greater than how fast i'm going just by living in a different part of the world so interesting so some of you are going a lot faster than i am and some of you are going a bit slower not much i live fairly far north um but anyhow i hope that uh that it's made sense i hope you found it interesting it's kind of fun you can do it on your own if you really want to but most importantly i hope you're seeing the interplay of some of the formulas the necessity of measuring and radians for these particular formulas to work or doing some sort of a conversion so i hope that you've enjoyed it and we're we're gonna move on to something called the unit circle on the next video i'm gonna show you all about it hope it's making sense hope you're having a great time i'll be having a good day we'll see you soon you
