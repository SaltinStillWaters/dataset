Transcript for: Converting Radians and Degrees (Precalculus - Trigonometry 4)
hey there welcome to another video i hope that you're doing well and i hope that you watch the last video on what radians really were because what we're going to get into is how to convert between degrees and radians why well because both units of measurement of angles are very important and they're used in real life quite often a lot of our math is going to be geared toward radians a lot of real life stuff is geared toward degrees and we have to be very comfortable and confident with using both of them and so what we're going to do today right now is learn how to convert between radians and degrees if you've ever studied radians and you've heard of them and you really don't didn't know hopefully watchlist video didn't really know what they meant hopefully now you do hopefully you understand where radiant is this idea of the angle that's needed on the center of a circle to sweep out an arc length or cut or subtend an arc that is equal to the radius that's it that's all it is it's different than degrees and a lot of formulas only work with them so but if you understand that you and you've been or maybe you didn't understand that and you've you've seen some of the radians like what does pi over 3 mean why why do radiant type measurements have a lot of pies in them why do why do we get that why do we have this man we get 3 pi over 2 or whatever we have or 2 3 pi or 2 pi over 3 or negative pi y is pi so involved with radians we're going to find that out today so let's get started with it what we learned last video was that if we have an arc length that's cut by some central angle theta we can determine what that arc length is or if we have a radius and arc length we can determine the angle is needed to get that particular argument then we had a formula and we made a big note that said this is only for theta radians because there is a one radian idea built into that proportion from when we did it last video so i hope you watch it i hope you remember that we did a couple examples not too many of them we're going to get to some applications a little bit but let's come back to an idea let's come back to this idea of arc length is proportionally related to the central angle that cuts it what if what if we took this circle here with a radius of who cares just r and we went not just a little angle not just a big central angle but a full on rotation around that that circle so if we went and measured this counterclockwise so positive and it sweeps out one entire revolution so our our theta here is the central angle that terminates the radius where it initiated hopefully on the positive x-axis we should have got the whole thing well then what would the arc length be well the arc length would be s and we'd say okay well we know a couple things about this right we know that arc length equals r times theta but we know a little bit more uh we know that arc length is also the full circumference of a circle here so so this is kind of cool this says if we sweep out an entire central angle that represents one full rotation it terminates where it begins it's going to have an arc length of the entire circle which is the circumference and that's what that angle represents well then we can keep on going and say hey that that arc length we know that we know circumference of a circle in this case would equal arc length but circumference of a circle is 2 pi r which says that in this particular case if we allow that central angle to be the entire circle there then 2 pi r would be our arc length the circumference and that would equal r times theta now here's what this means watch very carefully remember that theta is in terms of radians it's always radians for this formula we just use this formula we just said hey imagine the state is the entire swept out portion of that circle it makes one revolution then the arc length is the entire circumference of the circle but we know the circumference circumference is always 2 pi r so if the arc length is the full circumference the circumference is 2 pi r then 2 pi r has to equal r times theta radians and we're going to remember that this was over 1 radian that is why this had to be only in radians so if we remember that we understood that this had to be in terms of radians 2 cancel it out well if we want to divide by r which we can certainly do because r is not zero if r were zero we wouldn't have a real circle we'd have a little dot we had that which had no breadth it would not have this this idea of a circle to it so provided that we have a real circle here we can divide by r and we can get 2 pi r's would cancel equals theta over 1 radian let's multiply both sides by 1 radian and here's what this means i hope that you followed me i hope that you saw that if we sweep out one entire rotation of a circle and that is our angle a central angle represents that entire circle and our radius here's our our arc length is going to be the entire circumference of a circle which we know to be 2 pi r so arc length is circumference we know that arc length also equals radius times theta in terms of radians if we divide by r we have that there are two pi radians in one rotation of a circle one full circle now that's impressive but it's also where all that pie junk comes from so when we see oh man when we work with radians is always pi over 3 or pi over 4 or 5 pi over 6 y is always have pi in it because of this right here because of circumference actually so because circumference represents the entire arc length and we divide both sides by r we get the central angle needed to represent that arc length well the arc length the the central angle is now too high because of that circumference and everything that we do that cuts that angle smaller is cutting the circumference not circumference but arc length smaller and so it's based on a proportion of two pi let's say that again willing to sink in because the full circumference is 2 pi r and hence we get the central angles 2 pi anything that has a smaller angle will have a proportionally smaller arc length but that's based on the circumference of 2 pi r so it's a proportion of 2 pi for the central angle that we're dealing with which is why those radians always have pi in them almost always have pi in them it's because of that reason so i hope that you're seeing that connection it's not magic it's just the circumference that's it we're taking parts of it to create central angles smaller than the theta creates the arc length of a full circle let's go ahead and let's let's go a little further but wait a second one full rotation of a circle contains two pi radians we also know something we know that one full revolution circle is 180 degrees sorry 360 degrees if one full revelation revolution is two pi radians and one full revolutions 360 degrees then those two things have to be equal they both represent the same exact measurement of an angle that has the circumference of the circle i hope that makes sense to you it should be kind of straightforward i suppose uh one full revolution or rotation or whatever you want to call it had 360 degrees that was the definition of what a degree was 1 360th of a circle or rotational revolution but we also found out that there's two pi radians in that same measurement so they must be equal and this gives us a way to convert between radians and degrees just depends on what you want to solve for so if we divide both sides by 360. we would get one degree we can simplify that a little bit so 2 and 360 have that common factor of 2 so we can reduce this to pi over 180 this is actually how we convert between degrees to radians if we understand that one degree is pi over 180 radians that's pretty small right because think about that pi well pi would be half of a circle and if we divide that into 180 little parts well 100 that's pretty it's pretty little there in 180 little parts that's going to be one degree so pi over 180 radians is that one degree now what if we divided both sides by two pi well then we're going to get one radian equals into this terms of degrees so let's divide both sides here's one way divided by 360. let's divide both sides by two pi with a very similar simplification we would get one radian equals 180 degrees over pi or 180 over pi degrees is a good way to state that as well so one radian this thing that represents this central angle that represents an arc length being equal to the radius that one radian is equal to 180 degrees divided by pi that would be the degree measurement it would take for a radius to equal a subtended arc length in any circle that we have these are also the ways that we go ahead and convert we're going to practice a couple in just a second but i want to get you used to two different starts of a unit circle we'll talk about unit circles in a little while if you've ever seen one i'm going to show you where they come from and a very easy way to to remember it because you will you'll want to memorize it you'll want to not have to always look back at the inner circle even though a teacher might give it to you it's really nice to have it down and so we're going to learn kind of two different types of unit circles one based on degrees and one based on radians because they're they need to be interchangeable on your head because we use both of them so how we started with an x y axis or coordinate system we said this initial side always starts on the positive x-axis and if our terminal side ends right where it initiates we'd have an angle of zero degrees or if we did one full revolution or rotation we would get 360 degrees if we went to one of the first quadrant angle we would get 90 degrees second quadrant angle was 180 degrees 270 degrees and we also know that we could measure clockwise negatively so negative 90 negative 180 negative 270 negative 360 degrees am i going to show that but that was something that we could do now what happens if we have these these radian measurements well if we have no let's think about what this comes from if we have no angle being swept out then that idea of hey your terminal side doesn't move from your initial side there's no distance between them so to speak then you still have an angle of zero whether you have radians or whether you have degrees so we'd still have zero but it'd be in terms of radians don't put the degree there now what would happen if i go all the way around the circle one full revolution well we learned that right here we said one full revolution is equal to two pi radians so on this different type of way to represent our angles you'd have 0 or 2 pi for the positive x-axis but they're in terms of radians now now what happens let's think about this what happens if we go to half of a circle well think logically about that if one forward relation or rotation is two pi then half of that would be two pi over wait a minute 2 pi over 2 would just give us pi so the second quadrant angle there would be pi pi and 180 degrees are equivalent units of measurement for your angles that's kind of what it says here pi over 180 and pi over 1 over 180 over pi represents like this idea of one it's the same thing when you're comparing those measurements degrees and radians now what if you did only a fourth so we know that one full revolution was two pi we already studied that we said if we cut that in half that'd be half a revolution that'd be pi but what about half of that what about a quarter of a revolution well it seems that if this is pi radians half of that would be pi divided by 2 and that's exactly what we get for that positive y axis there it will come about that you will memorize that 90 degrees and pi over 2 mean the same thing and they do whether you have the first quadrant angle representative degrees which 90 or the first quadrant angle represented range which is pi over 2 they mean the same thing now what about the last one well if we count by pi over 2's that might be a good way to go so 0 pi over 2 1 pi over 2 2 pi over 2 which would be 1 pi or 3 pi over 2 and if we go a little bit further we get 4 pi over 2 but 4 pi over 2 is 2 pi that's exactly what we can do here too 90 nothing plus another 90's 180 plus another 9270 plus another 90's 360. pi over 2 plus another pi over 2 plus another pi over 2 plus another pi over 2 gives us every one of those quadrant angles this is what i'd like you to know i'd like you to know what the quadrant angles are whether we're talking about degrees or radians it's very valuable it's going to start us off on what a unit circle is in just a couple more videos and then we're going to use that for basically the rest of our math lives you're always be coming back to a unit circle or at least having your head and understanding the translations between them so i hope this has made sense to you so far we're going to come back and show you some conversions between radians and degrees but at this point we really need to understand the interplay between what a circumference of a circle is the fact that this arc length is that circumference and this is the reason why we get a lot of pi's in our radiant type measurements so i hope it's making sense i'll see a little bit for uh for some conversions now that you have hopefully a good idea about where the the conversions come from between degrees and radians radius degrees we're ready to do a few examples i know that i probably could have just given that to you and you would have been fine but a lot of times students do not understand why readings have pie in them and i really need to see i wanted you to see and understand that it's based on the circumference of a circle and proportions thereof and that's where that comes from so now i'm going to show you how to use this we're going to go from degrees to radians that's typically a little bit easier to do as far as understanding where the quadrants are because we're more used to degrees and then i'm going to show you a nice way to count with radians i'll show you exactly how to do that so let's uh let's go ahead and get right into it if we ever have to convert from degrees to radians here's the idea one degree is equal to pi over 180 radians and so that's substitutable and so what we're going to do every time we change from degrees into radians we're going to show that we're going to show that hey 60 degrees is the same thing as 60 times 1 degree but because we know one degree has the same central angle measurement as pi over 180 radians so remember pi is 180 it's a straight line the angle of a straight line is 180 or it's pi if we divide that into 180 parts well then we get what run rating of one degree really represents and so we'd say okay this is 60 times one degree but because one degree is pi over 180 radians we can make that substitution you're going to really like it when your numerator and denominator simplify it's going to give you what are nice for radians and this is what happens here so i'm going to start trying to introduce some of the very common radiant type measurements for us to get used to them so 60 divided by 180 well that's going to be one-third and so we have pi over three and we typically write that way we usually don't see 1 3 pi we see pi divided by 3 and simplified fractions within that so 60 degrees is the same it's the same thing as pi over 3. now i really want to start thinking about the quadrants also we need to be very good at understanding that 60 degrees and pi over 3 represent the same thing and they're in the same quadrant so 60 degrees very nice on this sort of degree driven unit circle which is where we're going or degree driven xy plane so 60 degrees we probably understand that's somewhere between 0 and 90 closer to the 90. can you do the same thing with pi over 3 the answer is yeah i'm going to give you a the way that i think about this here's what i understand about it and hopefully this works for you too if i know that pi represents this straight angle is what they call that or the second quadrant angle if i understand pi represents that i always think about my straight angle like the upper half of my xy plane and i cut that into whatever my denominator says so my denominator says cut that into one two three parts so first part second part third part i've got a picture in my head now my numerator says how many of those parts to count so one remember one part two parts this would be the third part my numerator says count one of those parts well i know i haven't made it past halfway yet so that's going to be in the first quadrant still that's how i always do it so again i take my straight angle that represents pi remember that is pi my denominator cuts it my numerator counts it for me that's the easiest way to go about do it i don't make mistakes because of that i would think okay this would be one two three i'm sweeping out numerator one of them that's the same exact quadrant same exact angle is 60 degrees and get used to it that those are the same of the interchangeable now how about 150 degrees 150 degrees well we can write that as 150 times 1 degree but because that degree is pi over 80 radians 180 i should say we can simplify it it's not as nice but remember that 150 and 180 are both divisible by 10 and 3 so that means 30. so that would be 5 over 6. now you can divide both by 10 get 15 over 18. then divide both those numbers by 3 that also works you get 5 over 6 either way we get 5 pi over 6 radians you know what as some some students they just hate to simplify these things just leave it um you can you can't it's not appropriate but you can't leave it and it doesn't mean the same thing but think about this in order to count that would you really want to divide that up into 180 parts and count 150 of them or would you rather divide the straight angle by six and count five of them well that's a little bit nicer to do so let's look back at this figure out the quadrants for both of these angles represent the same angle represent two different ways 150 degrees yeah that's going to be somewhere between 90 and 180 60 degrees past 90 30 degrees from 180 so that's going to be closer to 180 than the 90. well now let's think about how that would affect our movement or our terminal terminal side on our our radian driven xy plane so 5 pi over 6 is what here's what i think of i think of here's my straight angle of pi if i divide that into six parts that would be one two three four five six so three parts would equal that pi over 2. three parts of six is halfway through so i'm going to count one two three four five or one two three four five that gives me the same angle as 150 degrees but just in terms of radians so i know both of them because of the same end up in quadrant two just getting in the in the habit of thinking of that so that pi represents straight line denominator cuts it numerator counts it hopefully that helps it helps always help me how about negative 45 degrees well negative 45 degrees we know that measuring clockwise 45 degrees is right between 0 and negative 90. so we're going to be in that quadrant quadrant number four if we convert this to radians it should yield the same result notice how the conversion between degrees and radians has nothing to do with the sine so whether you measure degrees positively or negatively you're going to measure ratings the same direction so negative 45 degrees negative 45 times 1 degree we know that negative 45 times 1 degree can be represented as that pi over 180 radians and if we simplify that well 45 and 180 45 goes into 180 how many times 45 goes into 90 twice 90 goes into 180 twice it's four times this would be negative pi over four but now we're talking about in terms of radians so let's think negative means i'm still going to go clockwise pi over 4 all right well if i think about this as pi then pi over 4 would cut that pi over 4 that forward cut that into four pieces so here's my here's my pi my straight angle i would count one two that would be halfway through and then three four so my four pieces are here here here and here well i'm counting now just one of them the denominator cuts it the numerator counts it so this would cut one part two parts three parts four i'm going to count down one of them that's still in quadrant four that's the same exact angle as negative 45 degrees represent a slightly different way last one 107 this is nasty and when you simplify it it's not going to work in that case it's okay to use decimals but we start running into an issue of how to represent that on a unit circle or xy plane that has radians let me show you that in a second so 170 degrees would say all right well 107 times 1 degree we know we're measuring counterclockwise we know that we're past 90 by 17 degrees so that's just about right there so we know we're in quadrant two and we would get 107 pi over 180 radians if you didn't simplify and it doesn't simplify it but that's very hard to think about why because you'd have to think of 180 little parts on a straight angle and count 107 of them well that ends up being exactly 17 degrees past 90. in which case this would be a better way to go like you'd think about it a little bit easier when that happens and it doesn't simplify it's appropriate to use a decimal i think i get 2.8 or something like that oh sorry about 1.8 1.868 so on your calculator just do 170 times pi show pi button divided by 180 and you'll get that one point now how in the world could we get 1.868 in terms of radians on that go i i don't know that's all in pies this is not pie so so in the world this is a radiant stone so so think about it if pi is you should know pi you should know that pi is approximately 3.14 all right well half of 3.14 is what 1.57 so half of that this is 1.57 1.68 is past that that's one way that we start thinking about where these radians lie even if we don't have the pi i'm restraining myself from making jokes about rhymes but i have to so that 1.86 well that that's that's past that 1.57 so that would still be in quadrant two now notice how that was a bit more difficult to deal with right because you had to you had to approximate a lot to get there and that's what we have to do when we can't simplify and have it in terms of some sort of a nice denominator to cut our pie into that's where 180 is divisible by our denominator that makes things nice and that's going to yield some very nice things for radians if you're 180 your pi is divisible by your denominator that's a nice thing to be able to to to deal with anyhow um what if i had like 90 degrees so we should understand this that we've already kind of done it if i'm giving you 90 degrees and actually change to radians it's a really easy conversion you're going to get pi over two and the reason for that is because if we have 90 over 180 we're going to get a denominator of two and that's going to be a nice quadrant angle for us you don't see that super often we're gonna see here but that that can happen now let's go backwards what if we have radians and we we want degrees let's give that a try all right so we know that pi over six radians this radian type angle measurement but we also know what one radian is one radian equals 180 degrees over pi so we can go about the same conversion just backwards so pi over six radians is the same thing as pi over six times one radian you're taking a fraction of that radian but one radian is 180 degrees of apply and lots of things are going to simplify it's kind of fun okay i like doing that oh the pies are gone and 180 divided by 6 is going to give you well it's going to give you 30 degrees can we determine where both of these lie well pi over 6 means 1 out of that pi cut into six parts so if pi is a straight angle and we're gonna cut that into six part denominator cuts it numerator counts it cut it into six parts one two three four five six now count one of them oh that's right there so denominator had cut in six parts and the numerator just counts it up which counts one of those six parts that's going to be a very low not very low a lower angle closer to zero than pi over two but your your angle certainly being quadrant one they go up 30 degrees 30 degrees is one third of this distance just like uh this was one third of this distance so 30 degrees closer to zero than 90 that's the same angle they're both in quadrant one let's keep on going how about three pi over two radians now if we're in radians we go through the same conversion we can still take that three pi over two times one radian 1 radian is the same thing as 180 degrees over pi pi simplified i would probably do 180 divided by two and then multiply by three but you have a calculator it'd be kind of nice to do a fraction times 180. either way you go you're going to get 270 degrees and we kind of should see that right here's three pi over 2 that's quadrangle here's 270 degrees it needs to be the same and we see the math here that it does it does equal the same thing don't forget to put the degree how about negative 3 pi over 4 radians we can still measure angles negatively with radians just like i showed you a little earlier with that negative 45 degrees and the conversion's the same it's not going to change the sign of your angle measurement or the direction in which you angle you you measured your angle so we take our negative three pi over four times one radian we know what run rating is we know one radian is pi 180 degrees over pi so the pies will simplify 180 divided by 4 probably a little easier to do than 3 times 180 divided by 4. so 180 divided by 4 is going to be let's see divided by 2 90 divided by 2 you get 45. 45 times 3 well that's going to give you 135 so negative 135 degrees let's think about the quadrants and see if it actually makes sense so negative 135 degrees is negative 90 not negative not past 180 though negative 90 and then halfway between negative 90 and negative 180 that's almost like having a 45 degree angle starting from here and going downward and that's exactly what we get from something called a reference angle we would get something very similar to that so negative 135 degrees or we can think negative 3 pi over 4. just do the same thing here's your here's your straight angle of pi if you cut into four parts that would be one two three and then four now we're counting numerator negative three of them so denominator cuts it into four parts numerator counts it one two three that's going to be still in quadrant three for us so we can we cut one two three four parts and count three one two three that's quadrant three it's the same exact angle as negative 135 degrees and they they mean the same thing we just got to be very good at and uh and going back and forth between them and the reason why i'm sending so much time is so that you you're starting to see them you start to make the connections that they are measuring the same angles in two different ways and that they they're interchangeable so we're gonna do two more examples and then we'll be done all right we've got just a couple more examples so let's get after these two and then we're gonna be done how about 7 pi over 3 radians now we're going to convert that to degrees and i've done something kind of tricky we can still measure more than one full rotation on this it's okay to do that with radians as well and we can still convert to degrees the same exact way but let's start thinking about the quadrant here let's say i took my straight angle of pi and i cut it into three parts that would look like one two three now if i had to count seven of them i'd have to think of a little bit further than that one two three four five six notice that my numerator is counting more than the six parts that would that this denominator would cut two pi into so what i'd be doing is thinking straight angle does one two three another straight angle does one two three that's six and then one more so if i had to count this remember what we do your denominator cuts your straight angle into that many pieces so first straight angle is one two three second string angle is four five six multiples of three next triangle is seven so we are going to end up in quadrant one here this would be cut this into three parts one two three cut the next right angle in three parts one two three cut the next triangle straight angle in three parts and then go to the first one so that's one two three four five six and then seven so we're going to be 60 degrees above that that zero that that first initial side um when we do our conversion but we're going to have gone one full rotation around there to get there or pi over three past zero but haven't gone one full rotation to get there so we're still in quadrant one if we convert two degrees that's seven pi over three times one radian for sure but that one radian is 180 degrees over pi the pies are nice they simplify 180 degrees divided by 3 is 60. 60 times 7 is 420. well let's think about that 420 degrees probably right away for you is a lot easier to think about than seven pi over three because this is nice and and countable by 94 so we can 90 180 270 360 and then let's see 420 is 60 degrees past that so we've gone all the way around and then 60 degrees puts us well into quadrant one at the same angle as that ended but with a different type of a measurement so we're still quadrant one we've gone one full rotation in 60 degrees or pi over three degrees or pi over three radians past that they represent the same thing last one four ratings there's no pies what are you going to do with no pies well if you have no pies it's not going to cancel and you're going to probably end up with a decimal so 4 radians before we go any further and do that four radians think about where that would be on a unit circle on this x y plane do you remember that pi is 3.14 because remember that this is the number of radians this is zero radians this is pi over 2 radians that's like 3.14 divided by 2. this is pi radians that's 3.14 radians this is in terms of radians so where would four radians fit well if this is point one four radians this would be three times three point one four divided by two that's like four and a half a little over four and a half so four radians would be somewhere between three point one four and close to four and a half somewhere between that that is what 4 radians would be now that's in quadrant 3. let's see if the same thing works out with our degrees so 4 times 1 radian and nothing simplifies nicely so in this case yeah you just take 4 times 180 and divide by pi what we're going to get is 229.18 degrees if we if we approximate that well where is 229 degrees here's 180 so going half of a rotation but not as much as 270. granted this is much easier to place on this then four radians is on that because we'd have to think about pi in terms of a decimal number that we kind of understand when we're putting four on there i hope that makes sense i've gone hope i tried to go above and beyond and give you some examples that are a little weird but the main thing i hope that you you have realized is that both are very valuable we'll be using value using these in all of our math radians are what we typically use for formulas so i'm trying to get you used to it i hope that you understand the conversions and but most importantly where they came from where where we understood that because the circumference of a circle is 2 pi r we divide by r radians have pi's in them a lot because it's a proportion of that circumference that we're sweeping out with a central angle i hope that you you notice the idea of cutting your straight angle with your denominator and counting it with your numerator that's helped me out tremendously i hope it helps you out i hope i've done a good job i've explained this to you i hope i've explained it well enough for you to understand i hope that you're ready for another video we're going to go for for some real life examples here in just a little bit have a great day
