Transcript for: Reciprocal Identities in Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 9)
welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the reciprocal identities to some trig functions we'll see how to use them and be pretty brief we'll talk about what happens when a trig function can be assumed to be on a unit circle and when it can't and maybe you can think of it both ways so we'll talk about how to deal with them and find other trig functions given that we know just a couple of them or one and the quadrant that it in which resides so let's get started we've seen this a couple times but i want to make sure that we're really really comfortable with how these functions interplay so if we define sine of theta as y and cosine of theta is x relating to a unit circle and sine of theta gives you that y coordinate of a point on the unit circle and cosine theta gives you the x coordinate and tangent of theta is the comparison of those two the y over the x well remember something though this is for a unit circle what that means is the radius is one so this would really be y over one and x over one we're going to talk about that in just a little bit and how you can consider this um this particular trig function to relate to a unit circle or to relate to something that's bigger than unit circle where your radius is more than one or less than one even so then we also talked about cosecant secant and cotangent and that those are called reciprocal functions of these trig functions so when we have sine of theta equals y well if it's y over one cosecant of theta is one over y but wait a minute if cosecant theta is one over y and y is sine theta then we can also think of this as one over sine theta and the same thing works for secant theta and cotangent theta relating to the respective trig functions so we can see cosine of theta is x well that's x over one secant theta therefore is one over x or secant theta is one over cosine because x is cosine theta on that unit circle tangent of theta is y over x so cotangent is x over y but because y is sine theta and x is cosine theta we can also think of tangent as this relationship of sine over cosine for whatever angle you have and cotangent as cosine over sine the big deal here really isn't to to memorize these like verbatim as far as formulas but to get the idea you can tell that i'm really really trying to repeat myself on cosecant matches up with with uh with sine and secant with cosine cotangent with tangent that's an easy one because it has the same same name but people oftentimes get these two things confused why i think because that starts with a c and this starts with an s so they want to pair them up that's not the way that it works so i'm really trying to get you to remember that cosecant and sine are reciprocals of one another secant and cosine are reciprocals of one another tangent and cotangent are reciprocals of one another which means that yes these formulas are nice but honestly it's just take your fraction and reciprocate it and you will find secant for sine cosecant sorry um secant for cosine cosecant for sine cotangent for tangent and they go back and forth that's really the the drive behind this so we're going to practice this very quickly just to show you uh that this is not all that bad so let's look at let's look at this angle and sine of this angle is four-fifths and cosine of this particular angle phase is negative three-fifths and they're asking you to find the rest of those four basic trig functions you go okay is it that hard to do not really work your way through with the reciprocal identities now we're going to talk a lot about this firstly why do they give you two of them why is there sine of four-fifths and cosine theta of negative three-fifths do you even need to know the angle first off to determine these other trig functions and why are there two of them let's answer the second question first why do they give you two trig functions the reason is is because with those two trig functions like sine of theta and cosine theta we can determine where this angle actually is in what quadrant it is and that helps us find out the other trig functions and the signs of those trig functions which is very important to do especially with tangent because that's not given so so here's a couple things we should know this should be in your head right now we should understand that if sine is positive so is cosecant that's why i'm having you make that relationship between them because they'll always have the same sign if cosine's negative secant's negative again those para those are reciprocals of one another so they have to have the same side taking a reciprocal does not change your sign now tangent and cotangent we really wouldn't be able to say if we covered that up and didn't know it we wouldn't be able to say what the sine of tangent would be why not well because if you look at sine of theta this gets it comes into our second question but if you look at sine of theta sine of theta has four or five now you can think of this two different ways this is answering the second part of this question is this on a unit circle or not it doesn't even matter well you could think of this as a y a four and a radius of five in which case it would not be on the unit circle okay well that's possible we're going to deal with that in just a little bit in the second part of this video or you could think of this as well wait a minute four-fifths is point eight remember that the range of sign goes from negative one to one and every value between them do you remember that sine theta is from negative one all the way to one all these y values all those blue values so somewhere in there you're going to hit point eight now watch very carefully point eight here's let's say y equals 0.8 there are going to be two outputs for sine theta that give you positive four-fifths point eight and we could consider it to be on a unit circle it'd be like having a y of 0.8 and a radius of one that would be here or here let's say somewhere in there but wait a minute cosine and all the other trig functions it would it would matter what quadrant we reside in so that we would know the sign so putting this all together i'm going to kind of repeat a little bit of what i said number one why do you why are you given two so that you can determine the signs of the rest of your trig functions it's very important so we know that sine is positive and cosine is negative or sine theta is positive cosine theta is negative for this particular angle that's going to help us here so that's great second part of this question so it tells you the quadrant and we'll talk about that in a second the second part of this question is is that on a unit circle does it even matter it doesn't really matter for two reasons i'm gonna say them again if you consider this to be on the unit circle this would be like four-fifths over one you'd have a y of four-fifths and a radius of one that'd be y over one or four point eight over one if you will um that would be on a unit circle now why in the world are they the same that's that's another like question that we should ask why are they the same why doesn't it matter it has to do with similar triangles so imagine something imagine a y of 0.8 that's four-fifths and a radius of one now grow it make it a y of four and a radius of 5. nothing changes due to the fact that those particular angles sine of that particular angle has to do with a ratio a comparison of two sides y over the radius in this case would be one or you consider four or five if you multiply point eight over one times five over five you're going to get the same relationship four over five that angle does not change as our triangles get bigger and bigger and bigger it's going to be the same exact relationship so long story short it doesn't really matter what does matter is determining the quadrant that's why we're giving 2 these things and making sure we understand the reciprocal identity so let's determine the quadrant here if sine is positive and we don't have that this is going back to the first question if we don't have that thing there's no way to determine the rest if we had no idea that cosine was negative remember sine on a unit circle would be sine of theta would be 0.8 that's positive 0.8 here or 0.8 here that's two particular that's two different points on um on this unit circle we we needed to be one point to find out the rest of our trig functions so we'd say all right if sine is 0.8 remember sine is positive here we're either here or here if cosine is negative we can't be in the first quadrant but only in the second and that locates the quadrant for us let's take a moment and review this for a second do you remember that in quadrant one all of our trig functions are positive so sine cosine tangent and the reciprocal functions they're all positive here in quadrant two only sine is positive and therefore cosecant is positive the cosine is negative here only tangent is positive and cotangent is positive why i'm making those connections for you in quadrant four only cosine is positive and therefore secant is also positive so if we wanted to find the quadrant where sine is positive that's one or two but cosine is negative well remember you're either in one or two and now cosine's negative says you have to be here that's what this means it says sine is positive cosine's negative that's located in the quadrant for you and that will help you determine the signs specifically in this case of tangent so let's walk our way through it i've talked a lot about it hopefully you understood the point that can you consider this on a unit circle yes yes if you think about this as four-fifths over one then that's point eight that's on the range negative one to one there will be a point on this unit circle with a y value of 0.8 somewhere and this is the angle that's giving you that y value that's exactly what's happening it can happen in two locations either here or here that's why we need this to say it ain't this one it's got to be that one and that puts us in quadrant two so is it on unit circle doesn't really matter but you can consider it to be here if not then it's just a bigger circle and you have a radius of 5 and that's fine too the point is that we can't determine the quadrant given two trig functions or knowing a quadrant that just gives it to you but we have to know that for the signs of the rest of it so let's see if we know that sine and cosecant have this relationship of being reciprocals then sine of theta is four-fifths means that cosecant theta is 5 4. and that's what i want you to remember is that sine and cosecant are reciprocals of one another we shouldn't have to go back to like a formula sheet every time for reciprocal identities how about cosine theta if cosine theta is negative three-fifths then secant theta is the reciprocal reciprocal functions do not change signs so this is negative five-thirds now tangent this in this particular example is why we needed to understand that that was negative you see if we went back here and said oh hey yeah let's imagine that our four fifths sine of theta equals four fifths or point eight or somewhere in the unit circle is right there we imagine that well then tangent would be positive if we imagine this one then tangent would be negative how do we know which one this was the whole problem this is why for sine of four-fifths and you've got hey your y-value here is four-fifths or 0.8 either somewhere over here remember 0.8 is about here somewhere over here or somewhere over here somewhere in there well it matters for tangent so we had to know the cosine was negative to say it's not this y value of 0.8 it's this y value of 0.8 so go up the y until 0.8 you're going to hit 2 you're going to have two outputs there it's this one that we want because it said cosine's negative therefore quadrant two what that means is that tangent has to be negative well we're going to see that bear out because when we take a comparison of positive divided by negative you're going to get a negative so it does work for you but without this one you'd have no way to tell you could not do this if you did not understand that that cosine was also negative somehow i hope that makes sense to you so tangent theta says all right let's go ahead and take sine over cosine we know that's y over x sine of theta is y that is your y value 0.8 this is your x negative 0.6 we're just comparing them or just dividing them so sine divided by cosine if we multiply by the reciprocal there so four-fifths times five-thirds we get negative four-thirds if we maintain that sign the way that i always do this is i always figure out if i have to find all the trig functions i find tangent first and i don't redo cotangent i understand that cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent i don't need to go back to my formulas if i understand the relationship amongst my trig functions so with reciprocal identities i think that hey tangent theta is negative four-thirds cotangent theta has to be negative three-fourths that's how we can find all of these trig functions given just a couple of them or given one of them and then a quadrant to determine the size of the rest now i'm going to lead you i'm going to preface what we're going to do after this next example which you should do on your own what i'm going to do is i'm going to tell you well what if we only know one trig function and a quadrant could you find out some of some more of this stuff yes but requires knowledge of what the formula of a circle is and using it's a it's really a pythagorean identity using that to find a missing side really of this triangle on this on a unit circle so we'll do that in just a bit at this point i would hope that you could figure out what these trig functions are um the first thing i want us to do is really look at this and think sine theta is positive cosine theta is positive think about the quadrant there what quadrant do you have to be in if both sine and cosine are positive not that one sine's negative not that one they're both negative not that one cosine is negative this one both of them are positive and so we understand that if sine is positive cosine's positive that angle that we don't even know lies somewhere in this quadrant we're in quadrant one what's that tell us well that tells us that tangent is also going to be positive all of our trig functions should therefore be positive remember that cosecant has the same sign as sine secant same sine as cosine tangent and cotangent also have to have the same sign because reciprocals do not change signs i hope you're sticking with me so let's think about cosecant theta because these are reciprocals i know that cosecant theta for whatever angle we have here is going to be the reciprocal 2 over square root of 3. which when you rationalize the denominator multiplied by square root of 3 over square root of 3 that's 2 square root of 3 over 3. now secant theta secant theta is the reciprocal of cosine so for whatever angle that is we're going to have two over one tangent tangent takes sine or y and divides by cosine or x for whatever angle you have so that's square root of three over two over one half if we understand that we're going to multiply by the reciprocal we're going to get the square root of 3. now because we figured that out for tangent it's just a matter of reciprocating for cotangent so that's one over the square root of three or again if you do rationalize that that's square root of three over square root of three so one times square root of three is square root of three square root of three times square root of three is one so it's just a sorry out of three so square root of three over three and we have all of our trig functions so the last thing that i wanted to talk about here is kind of prefacing where we're going to go next when we talk about inverse functions so this one you couldn't really do it very easily but i want you to check it check this one out could you find the angle if sine of square root of three over two sorry sine of theta is square root of three over two and cosine theta is one half could you find the angle that gives you that point you go would it be what do you mean the point well the point is cosine theta gives you an x coordinate that is an x coordinate sine of theta gives you a y coordinate that is a y coordinate and now maybe you'll see that you need both of them to determine a unique point on this unit circle that's how inverses work is a unique point here so let's let's see about that if our x is one half let's look at this unit circle if our x is one half that puts us here or it puts us here notice something i could not figure out what quadrant this is in unless i had another trig function or knew it already or we defined it specifically so that we're bound between a couple quadrants that's what we're going to do with inverses just a bit but for right now you can't do the rest of this because you'd have two points that you could pull from you could pull from an x of one half here or an x of one half here and your signs these signs positive negative signs that i'm talking about would change for sine cosine tangent and cotangent and all these other things so the issue is i need another trig function to determine that so let's see if cosine theta is one half that puts us here or here there's not another positive one half obviously that's the case because one half is right here on the x axis so we're either an x of one half or one half sine being positive square root of three over two says oh yes this is the one point you're talking about that's a unique point that says that the angle that would give you that is 60 degrees or pi over three so we're going to start doing that when we get to a lot more videos honestly we're going to start thinking about that like thinking what would this have to be what angle would cause this to happen on a unit circle so let me do a little recap before we go on can you consider these to be on a unit circle yes if this is less than 1 which it has to be that's the range of sine and cosine so you can think of this as some sort of a decimal or fraction on the unit circle that doesn't really match up very well with an angle does it because 0.8 is not on here as like 60 degrees or something so we can think of this as a unit circle do you have to no you don't you can think of this as a similar triangle that you've made bigger and by doing so you still have the same ratio four-fifths over one is the same as four over 5. what's that mean the y of 0.8 compared to a radius of 1 is the same exact triangle just made bigger if you have a y of 4 and a radius of 5. that's why this stuff is so nice and we can change between a unit circle and a right triangle later on i hope that you remember that when we get there the other thing is you need to know two trig functions or at least know one trig function in a quadrant to figure out the signs positive or negative for the rest of your trig functions let's move on i'm going to show you the case where we can think about this as not being on the unit circle so that we can find more information hang on all right let's keep on rolling so i have another example on the board but before we before we talk about it and as we talk about it i really really really want to make sure that i'm clear about what is going on and why we consider this to be either on a unit circle or not and get the same exact result we're talking about similar triangles the way that angles are congruent as we make them larger or smaller in similar proportion which means equal proportion so let's take a look at it now if you remember we talked about this one time and i made the reference to a right triangle and i said hey we can think of sine of theta as just y what on a unit circle why because the radius would be one and if the radius is one we get y over one and cosine of one and y over x that's not different for tangent but what if we enlarged that triangle and said okay let's make this a little bit bigger well can we consider sine cosine different a little bit yeah we can consider that to be the relationship between the opposite side the y side and the hypotenuse whatever r is and that's something that we can we can deal with so here's what that means if you have sine theta equals some sort of a fraction some some ratio you can consider this to be one of two things either you can consider that to be a complete y value somewhere on the unit circle if it's between negative one and one which it has to be or you can consider this to be two sides of a right triangle that can be inscribed on some sort of a circle what do i mean by that well this is the equation of the circle now it should look a lot like the pythagorean theorem for you and it is it's the same thing because you can inscribe a right triangle onto that unit circle or any circle with the radius of whatever the r is and so we're going to talk about that we're going to say that hey if you can identify your r so let's say for sine your y and your r if you had a y value and you had an r value right there could you find an x value yes would you have to find an x value to complete all the trig functions yeah you would because notice cosine of tangent it's therefore secant of cotangent they need an x value and so if you have sine there's no way to figure out cosine and tangent without doing a little bit of extra work i'm going to show you exactly how that works and why we're able to do it so let's take a moment for a second so we understand that sine of theta is this relationship of y y over 1 for a radius of 1 or y over r for radius is not r does it even matter it doesn't matter i'll show you that so let's say that y is 12 why am i getting that well i know that sine theta is y over r okay r would be 13 here now what if you don't like that what if you think well wait a minute i know that sine of theta is a y value right so these are all y values so can i make this 12 over 13 with a radius of 1 yes you can 12 13 is somewhere between negative 1 and 1. 12 13 will be some y value really close to here that is known as positive right positive y is going to hit your unit circle in two places here with a radius of one yes you can consider sine of theta to be a y value with a radius here with a radius of one now let's look at the triangle and see why it doesn't really matter how we consider it so if our y value is 12 thirds sorry 12 13 and our r is one this is not drawn to scale but i want you to notice something let's say that i multiply both of all the sides of my right triangle by here's 12 13 here's one so this is one from here to here and that vertical is 12 13 on a right triangle first question could you use pythagorean theorem to figure out this missing side here's x squared plus y squared would equal r squared or x squared plus 12 13 squared equals 1 squared now you might be thinking using that fraction is not going to be very nice in a pythagorean theorem and you're right that's why i'm giving you a different weight here so check it out now let's say for a second that if this y value this y is 12 13 and this this radius or this hypotenuse is one well we know about similar triangles or we should that i can take all of my sides and multiply them by some some number it's called scalar multiple but some number and grow all those sides in the same proportion and in doing so i'll get a similar shape now what's that mean well similar shapes maintain their angles so the angles on similar shapes corresponding angles are congruent that means equal so let's see about this if i multiply all of these sides by 13. why 13 because it gets rid of my fraction let's multiply it then 12 13 times 13 would just be 12 and that side would grow to 12 if i multiplied everything by 13. 1 times 13 would be 13. obviously not to scale and whatever this x is i'd multiply it and get x times 13 whatever that would be now take a look at it did the angle change when i went from the small triangle to the big triangle no it didn't so if the angle didn't change sine of that angle can't change which means that we can put this in a different relationship or at least consider it differently something on the unit circle remember you could draw a circle here and that would have a radius of one great sine would be considered as twelve thirteenths over one or not on a unit circle radius of 13. sine of that of that angle would be 12 divided by 13. y over r uh this height over the radius either way do you see it you see the same thing 12 over 13 is the same thing as 12 13 over 1. you could see it either way so could i consider this way yeah i sure could but if i do that remember we're about to do pythagorean theorem to find x if i do that then i'm going to deal with a fraction for my y and that's not very nice okay well what if i consider this to be not 12 13 on a unit circle but a height of 12 and a radius of 13 because again because similar shapes maintain angles sine of that angle does not change whether i consider this twelve thirteenths over one or just twelve over thirteen you get twelve thirteenths for sine of whatever the angle is and due to the similar shape that's never going to change for that same ratio amongst your sides now is it nicer yeah it is because finding this is a little bit easier than finding this because you're dealing with whole numbers and not fractions it's honestly not a huge deal but this would be nice to find well could you find x sure if we understand that because you can inscribe this this right triangle on a circle with this particular radius we can always use the pythagorean theorem you can even think of just like a right triangle use it by failure and theorem or the equation of a circle and find out what your missing variable is if you have two of them you should be able to find the third one so let's do it why we're doing this again is because if i'm required to find cosine tangent secant and cotangent this only gives you a y and an r well because we now understand that this can be built on a right triangle either on a unit circle or not doesn't really matter they're similar then we can use that to find the missing variable like x and then find cosine very nicely and so we can do that now this is the part that's very important i really need you to not blow by this slow down the video and really pay attention not to like quarter speed or something but really pay attention do you remember that when you take a square root on your paper it is never okay to just put x equals five here why because when you take a square root well those power twos they they do not maintain sign you plug in a negative you get a positive you plug in a positive you get a positive so due to that fact when we take a square root we have to put a plus and minus in front of it now that appears to give us two different x's why does that happen here's why man i hope you get this if you get this it's going to make sense for a really long time and what we're talking about why does that happen because imagine if i had not had my right triangle oriented this way but had it oriented this way instead of a positive x i'd have a negative x let's draw it this would still be 13 still a positive radius this would still be 12 so a positive y but this would be a negative x so what's the problem the problem is there's some missing information here and i hope that you're seeing it on a circle on a circle you can have a radius and a y value that are the same and have two different x values in fact we talked about that in the last example a little bit about what if your y value is 12 13 like we have here that's right here that is going to have a point here with a y value of 12 15 and a point here with a y value 12 13 but two different x values which one do you use that's why it's necessary to have one of two things you either need two trig functions with any two trig functions uh besides like a reciprocal like a pair like uh sine and cosecant with any two trig functions you can tell what quadrant you're in if you know the signs of those trig functions so we either need two trig functions we don't have that we have just sign we were able to find out x that's fantastic by using some some pythagorean theorem or u uh equation of a circle that's great but without two trig functions or knowing the quadrant in which this angle resides you can't choose the right one you'd have two answers here and that's that's not really okay for us so i hope that you're understanding why we either need two trig functions to determine the quadrant or we need to say something like hey sine of theta is 12 13. okay great but your angle is in quadrant two now what's that do what that does is answers the question on what sign should you pick so one more time all the way through here as far as why we need two trig functions or no quadrant this is fantastic the sine theta says that hey if that's positive you're either in man get this if sine theta is positive you're either in quadrant one or in quadrant two that's great however x is positive for this quadrant and negative for this quadrant which means cosine is positive for this quadrant negative for this quadrant because cosine theta is your x coordinate on you on your circles whatever it is so which one do you pick well if sine is positive and we're in quadrant two that says that i'm going to have to pick the x value that is let's think about it x's are negative here if i'm in quadrant two i'm going to pick my negative x so which one do i pick well cosine's negative x is negative in quadrant two i have to pick the negative i hope i've explained that well enough i hope that you see that by understanding what quadrant you're in you are determining your y value it's well you determine your with the sign of your y and also the sine of your x if we're in quadrant two our y is positive here we already knew that sine theta is y but our x is negative now we understand which one to pick so we've used pythagorean theorem we got down here we go okay if i am in quadrant two my x has to be negative and now we're ready to find the rest of our trig functions so we have a y we have an x we have an r and after this this is pretty easy to do so let's go fairly quickly through it remember that we know that we're going to treat y as 12 and r as 13. why we are doing that is so that we can easily find out what our x is and not have it as a fraction you could have done this with fractions that would have been okay to do but this is a little bit nicer and it doesn't matter because similar triangles maintain angles corresponding angles are congruent for simple shapes and therefore sine cosine tangent they can't change they're just their relationship amongst your sides it's it's one ratio whether the ratio is small well 12 13 over 1 or 12 over 13 it doesn't matter it cannot change and so i have explained it to you very well so now we're going to go through and say let's just let's just assume that our y is actually 12 and a radius is 13. can you find cosecant theta from that well cosecant theta is the reciprocal of sine theta so i can look right back over here and think okay if sine is 12 13 cosecant theta is 13 12. that actually is right here too 13 over 12. cosine theta well this is why we had to have quadrant two so we could pick the correct x but now that we have that we know that cosine theta is x over r adjacent over hypotenuse or the x coordinate over the radius on a certain circle this has a radius of 13. so that would be negative 5 over 13. okay pause right there and let the sink in notice how cosine theta being negative when sine is positive does in fact put us in quadrant two also notice this even though we use this as having a radius of 13 could you think of this as negative 5 13 as an x value negative 5 13 that's less than halfway that's like right here that's like that that point has an x value of somewhere in here has an x value of negative 5 13. if you were to consider it on a unit circle you're just dividing by 13 and shrinking that triangle back down to a unit circle from a radius of 13 to a radius of 1. this is a negative x value this point here would have a negative x value and a positive y value that's what we're saying here whether it's on a really big circle or a unit circle it doesn't matter as far as what the cosine of that angle is that angles don't change how about secant because we have a reciprocal here we can think of this as negative 13 fifths tangent's really nice now you could certainly take sine divided by sorry sine divided by cosine and get negative 12 or 5 or you could think of this as y over x and just think hey here's my y that's 12. here's my x that's negative 5. that's negative 12 fifths that's y over x do you see though that you could do 12 13 over negative 5 13 multiply by the reciprocal there and you get negative 12 fifths also now that we've done that cotangent we can reciprocate tangent and get negative 5 12. here's what i'm really hoping happened in this last example i'm hoping that i'm making connections for you i've seen far too many students treat these like formulas and they never get it it never really clicks that there's interplay here that i don't care whether you're on a unit circle or a really big triangle or a really big circle it doesn't matter because what these trig functions do is take an angle and relate to a pair of sides a pair of sides is a fraction whether that fraction grows or shrinks would like both numerator denominator grow the same proportion or or shrink the same proportion the ratio itself will not change so it doesn't really super matter how you consider it we think of it both ways which is very cool for later on now we are used to a unit circle that's fantastic but i hope that i made that make sense that we're really just growing or shrinking a triangle to fit a radius that we want and we can consider two different ways but it does work on the unit circle and showing you that as well i also hope that you understand the necessity to understand a trig function and another one or a trig function and a quadrant to determine the sign of how you use the pythagorean theorem whether you take a positive or negative after determining what quadrant you are in whether x is positive or negative and therefore cosine and secant are positive negative whether y is positive or negative and therefore sine and cosecant are positive or negative and then tangent and cotangent play along with those two things because we have a positive or positive negative or negative or positive or negative negative or positive four quadrants um two and four respectively so i hope it makes sense it's not all that hard i'm gonna put one more about the board that we're gonna work through and then we're gonna call it good let's go through one more example let's say that you know that secant theta is 2 and you're trying to find out the rest of our trig functions can you do it without this no you really can't but not because you can't find out x and r with this we're going to see that just a second but because you wouldn't be able to figure out the sign of y positive or negative and and not being able to do that you wouldn't be able to figure out sine or or or cosecant tangent or cotangent and so we really need to know on what quadrant this angle is that's that's the reason why they're giving you this so let's let's go ahead and figure that out let's think about where secant is positive secant matches up with cosine and so we're going to look at the quadrants in which cosine is positive because that creates secant positive 4s so cosine is positive here not here not here because why why why is cosine and therefore secant negative here because cosine is the x coordinate on the unit circle or the adjacent side of the triangle here and that would be negative for both of these quadrants that's why cosine is negative here is because the x is negative look here's our x-axis it's all negative for every point on this unit circle all the x's here would be negative therefore all the secant thetas on these two quadrants are also negative well secant is positive where cosine is positive or x is positive that's in quadrants one and four so it matches up with cosine so i know that if i'm not given this information that i am in quadrant one or four i need you thinking of that like every time think what quadrant am i in for my angle so quadrant one or four here i need more information i need what the y is doing so i'm going to have to get like tangent or cotangent or cosecant or sine i'm going to have to have one of those things something with a y in it to determine whether my y is positive that's a pure or negative that's down here and that would determine my quadrant either one or four and so we're going to look at this and say hey sine is negative so where is cosine positive and sine negative cosine is positive where x is positive sine is negative that that's what this means sine theta is less than i've got too excited about thetas sine theta is less than zero or negative where y is negative so if secant is positive therefore cosine's positive you're in these quadrants your x is positive and if sine theta is negative that means your y is negative sine theta is y that means your y that's this quadrant x is positive y is negative that's how you figure it out we can we can go and just look at our signs but i'd rather you understand what's going on i mean that's how i always teach you right is to make sure that you really get what is going on here don't just use the formulas really walk your brain through that it'll help you out so much when we get to graphing uh when we get to calculus as well so i know that what this means is cosine positive sine negative quadrant four now that determines something for us that says that sine and cosecant should be negative secant and cosine should be positive tangent and cotangent should be negative so let's figure it out if we know that secant theta is 2 let's treat this like a fraction let's i know that this could be something on a unit circle it would be one half for for x value because this is well this is 1 over x so let's think about that way if secant theta is 1 over x or r over x r being the radius if i extend this on a similar shape so this would be r over x which means that our x would be one so secant theta is r over x secant theta would have an x of one in r of two now we can easily figure out cosine theta from this naturally because this is just a reciprocal so i could get one half no problem you do not need to do any of this if you were just looking for cosine theta you'd be done but if we are looking for the rest of the four trig functions here sine theta and the rest of them well then we need to know the y value i have an x right there i have an r right there could we use pythagorean theorem to find the y of course so the pythagorean theorem or the equation of a circle same in this case we can write that out and then solve for whatever variable we're missing a trig function should give you two of them if you have this this fraction for whatever angle you're given so let's go ahead and subtract we're going to get ultimately here's four and one y squared equals three let's take the square root of that if we take the square root you have to show the plus and minus that tells you you have two possible outputs and then this is going to tell you which one to pick so y equals positive or negative square root of three because we said that sine is less than zero sine is negative sine is the y here so we have to pick the negative and this lets us find everything else so we can go through and figure out sine theta and then cosecant theta tangent and cotangent theta so sine theta sine theta is going to take your y divided by your r that's how it always works since that's opposite over hypotenuse or the y-coordinate over your radius on some sort of a circle not this is not necessarily thought of as a unit circle you can negative square root three over two quadrant four sine with an x of one half negative square root of three over two cosecant reciprocates that and after rationalizing we get negative 2 root 3 over 3. tangent compares your y and your x if you have an x and a y don't be going and taking sine divided by cosine it's you'd have to simplify that that complex fraction let's just think about it as hey tangents y over x here's your y you know that's negative and not positive because of the quadrant that determines that tangent is also negative because of that quadrant quadrant four tangent's negative if you see that sine is positive cosine's negative sorry sine is negative cosine is positive negative over positive is negative that'd be negative square root of 3 over an x sub 1. y over x cotangent reciprocates and after rationalizing we get negative square root of 3 over 3. i hope i made it make sense man i really hope that i'm making some connections for you then if you've done trigonometry before that maybe you haven't never seen if you have seen them maybe you haven't never understood i hope that you understand them now if this is your first time through i promise you that understanding what i've talked about in this video will help you extremely when we get to right triangle trigonometry pass that then we need to calculus because sometimes we miss the connection between a unit circle and the sine and cosine and right triangle trigonometry sine cosine all the trig functions they're the same we're just making the triangle bigger and we can do that because angles do not change on similar shapes that's why it works so i hope it's making sense i hope in building connections i really need at a minimum for you to understand that cosecant and sine match up a little bit the reciprocals secant and cosine match up if you get that and cotangent tangent match up that that you will have these reciprocal identities down we won't have to always go back to formulas so we're going to come back we're going to talk about whether sine and cosine are even or odd and the pythagorean identities so we're going to take this and we're going to run with it a little bit so i'll see you for that video
