Transcript for: How to Use Product to Sum and Sum to Product Formulas in Trig (Precalculus - Trigonometry 29)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the sum to product or product to some formulas I'm going to prove them for you they're not that bad we'll deal with a few examples it'll be a briefer I suppose relatively briefer video um but I'm going to make sure that you understand how to do this we'll end with a couple identities how to prove them using these formulas that really it really sinks in and then solve an equation so hope you're ready for it so what we deal with with with the product to sum and sum to product formulas is how to really change between these these products or these these s and cosine functions multiply together and change them into a sum or from a sum into a product they're both very useful uh they're both necessary later on in some math so let's get right into it first thing I'm going to do is prove the product into sum formulas for you so let's take a look at the well let's see this was the sum and difference formulas for S and cosine and here's what we're going to do the whole idea behind these proofs is if you can add these together what's going to happen is part of this equation is going to cancel if you subtract them on this one at least another part's going to cancel and we'll be able to solve for a product or a product that we can write as a as a new identity so let's go ahead and do that let's see what happens when we take these two formulas and we add them together if we do add them we're going to end up getting cine of alpha minus beta plus cosine of alpha plus beta so I'm adding these equations together this would give us this equal to the same thing happens here we're adding these together so if you remember anything about like systems of equations you can add equations as long as you add one side and add the other side at the same time so we're adding the left side we're adding the right side but what happens on the right hand side if we take a look at this we would get cosine Alpha cosine beta cosine Alpha cosine beta we would get two cosine Alpha cosine beta but what happens here this is sin Alpha sin beta minus sin Alpha sin beta those are going to cancel those completely drop out of that equation so when we're adding systems add one side add the other side but those things cancel when we add now if we solve for cosine Alpha cosine beta we're going to get our first product into a sum formula let's just divide everything by two now we're going to write this as a 1/ half in front instead of creating this fraction because often times we deal with fractions in here well sometimes deal with fractions in here it's just kind of awkward to do so if we divide both sides by two or multiply both sides by one2 we end with cosine Alpha cosine beta a product of cosine of one angle time cosine of a different angle that's what's important here equals 12 remember we're dividing both sides by two cosine Alpha minus beta plus cosine Alpha plus beta so this takes here's what it does takes cosine of one angle time cosine of another angle at product and changes it into a sum of cosine sometimes that's a lot easier to deal with uh sometimes it makes other things possible later on in math as well now this is our first Formula what do we do about Sin Alpha time sin beta maybe there's a way to change that product into a sign so if we take a look at our our formulas that we've already dealt with what if we didn't add what if we just subtracted this entire system well if we just subtracted them we get cosine Alpha minus beta minus cosine Alpha plus beta but on the right hand side remember that when we subtract more than one term we've got to really think about subtracting term by term or changing the signs remember that when we subtract we sometimes distribute that idea that subtraction idea so cosine Alpha cosine beta minus cosine Alpha cosine beta well that's zero but check this out sin Alpha sin beta minus a negative you think about that as a negative that sin Alpha sin beta minus a negative or plus sin Alpha sin beta so if we if we subtract these this system we get something very similar to happen that we had right here we're just going to get the cosiness cancelling and leaving two sin Alpha sin beta so let's subtract them on the left hand side we get cosine Alpha minus beta minus cosine Alpha plus beta on the right hand side remember we're subtracting these are going to cancel these are not that's going to create two s Alpha sin beta if we follow that that idea let's divide everything by two then we'll have solved for S Alpha sin beta or a product of sign functions with two different angles and we can see it we can see sin Alpha time sin beta equal cosine alpus beta minus cosine Alpha plus beta these are the first two of our product into sum formulas notice what they do they take a cosine times a cosine with different angles and change it into a sum they take a s times a sign function of two different angles and change that into a difference or a sum with a negative so these are our first two now what what's the only one that's missing well we got cosine cosine we've got s s what we don't have is a sin cosine or a cosine sign now because multiplication is commutative we don't really have to find a s cosine and a cosine sign it's enough just to find a s cosine or a cosine sign uh what that means is we don't have to do this whole add and subtract thing but let's take a look at this if we have S Alpha plus beta equals all that that sum and difference formula for for S we have sin Alpha cosine beta plus cosine Alpha sin beta then sin alpus beta equals something very similar with a different sign let's suppose that we just add those together if we add them we're going to get sin Alpha plus beta plus sin Alpha minus beta on the left hand side on the right hand side hopefully you see what cancels out we're going to get two sin Alpha cosine beta that's what we're looking for looking for not cosine cosine not s sign but s cosine of two different angles this is going to give us the last of our our product in some formulas that we actually need so we're going to cancel these guys and have two sin Alpha cosine beta and like if we multiply everything by 1/2 or divide everything by two we can solve for the last of our products that we didn't know sin Alpha cosine beta and that's it that's the last of our product into some formulas for S and cosine we can see that we can have one of three things we have cosiness multiplied with different angles we have signs multiplied with different angles we have S and cosine multiplied with different angles I said something ear that maybe now you can see we don't need both s time cosine and cosine Time s because whatever these angles are doesn't really matter for the formula if you have sin Alpha and cosine beta or cosine Alpha sin beta th those those variables don't really determine what your angle is your angle determines your angle it doesn't really matter what what those are so we only need one formula there and that's our last one so what we're going to do is I'm going to come back show you how to use these with just four examples um that illustrate that and then we'll talk about our last four formulas like ever uh for trigonometry before we get into some of our our triangle right triangle trigonometry law of cosiness law of signs so hope you're ready for it we'll come back with a couple more examples so let's look at how to actually use these often times we're given some some junk some trigonometric junk and asked find an exact answer for this well that's pretty hard to do with angles that are not on your unit circle like 285° or 7 de I know we've been dealing with uh with radians very often but it's it's time to start thinking about degrees because as we move toward right triangle trigonometry sometimes we deal with those quite a bit more so I'm going to start prepping you for that as well so let's suppose that we had these these angles that are clearly not on the unit circle but you still want an exact answer for them that's pretty difficult so one thing that we can do like I've shown you a lot of other formulas is if we have a product sin s cosine cosine or sin cosine we can change it as long as they're multiplied together we can change those angles hopefully it creates something a little bit easier to deal with on the unit circle so let's take a look at this this is s of an angle times s of a different angle um the reason why I say sign of a different angle is because if they're the same angle you can just get S squared of that angle we have some other identities that deal with u with angles that are the same like we dealt with double angle formulas things like that but here we have two different angles and a product of two sign functions so let's take a look at what our formula says we just created it but our formula says if you have S of one angle Time s of another angle we're going to have cosine of subtract the angles minus cosine of add the Angles and that's really how I think about it we put a 1/2 in front of it and this will simplify this problem for us and allow us to find some things that otherwise would not be on our unit circle so let's go ahead and do that so we know we at 1/2 all of these product some formula start with 12 the S time sign says take your cosine subtract your angles minus cosine of add your angles I typically write these out every time just so that I can double check my work make sure I'm not accidentally subtracting or adding something wrong in my head I'm always just double checking so I know I have S sign got it 1/2 got it cosine I've subtracted looks good minus sign is really important cosine of okay now I've added them then I'm going to go ahead and simplify and hope that this is something I can work with a little bit nicer so 285 minus 75 is 210 285 + 75 is 360 now that's really nice because 360° is one full Revol Revolution just like 2 pi so I already know that one that's on our unit circle 210° is also on our unit circle so we might want to have our unit circle handy because we don't deal with degrees all that much or at least we haven't so far so let's take a look at this cosine 360° is great that's the same exact thing as 2 pi so cosine of 2 pi that's one so I already know that one that's that's fantastic this is going to be one but 210° is also in a unit circle right there it's the same thing as 7 < 6 so cosine of 210° or 7K 6 is < tk2 so we still have our 1/2 we looked up cosine 210° we looked up cosine 360 if we had to that's pretty much it I mean we can do a couple things to simplify this like maybe factor out a negative would look a little bit better you could find a common denominator to make one fraction But ultimately Ely what we' get is exactly this this is your exact answer I'm going to factor the negative make sure you factor from both terms and leave it just like that let's take a look at another one we look at cosine 285° * cosine 195° remember we have a a formula that will deal with any of these products of ss and cosiness we've dealt with stimes sign now we see cosine * cosine so let's take a look at the formula cosine * cosine of two different angles say put your 1/2 like all of them have then we're going to have cosine of subtract the angles plus cosine of add the angles exactly the same thing that we did just were adding here instead of subtracting so let's let's copy that we're going to start with our 1/2 cosine of subtract them plus cosine of add the two angles that follows exactly what we we know that formula is going to do for us it says that we're going to take subtract the angles add the angles cosine in both places and add them together so we've done exactly that so if I take 285° and subtract 195 we're going to get exactly 90° so this is cosine of 90° that's pretty convenient because that's the same thing as Pi / 2 when we add them together we're going to get cosine of 480° now that's great cosine of 90 degre is on our unit circle cosine 480° not so much remember even though we're dealing with degrees you can still subtract a period from any of these angles if we had like cosine of 5 Pi / 2 we would subtract 2 pi if we have cosine of 480° let's subtract 2 pi but do it in terms of the type of angle that you're measuring in so if our period is 2 pi or 360° for cosine and for S and 180° or Pi for tangent we can always subtract that or add that get the same exact value on our unit circle so if we have 480° that's not on there well subtract the period if we subtract 360° we're going to get 120° again cosine 90 is pretty nice that's Pi / 2 that's going to give us zero so cosine of 90° is zero remember we're looking at the x coordinate for cosine cosine of 120° is same thing as cosine of 2 piun 3 those are the same angle it's going to be 2 so 0 + -2 * 1 12 that's -2 that's 1 12 so 12 * -2 is -4 now we've done something pretty impressive we found the Val an exact value not an approximation you can do that with the calculator really easily we found an exact value for a product of two functions of two angles that are not even our unit circle and that's what a lot of these formulas let you do they let you work with things that otherwise you might not be able to do so let's go ahead we'll come back and do one more with a S and a cosine so we've dealt with s s cosine cosine we'll do a S cosine let's keep on going so a lot of times we're asked can you express this product in terms of just a sum of signs or cosiness um it helps a lot in calculus to to write things as sums rather than products because you have a a different different rule for them and it's a little bit easier if things are just added rather than multiplied you're going to get there but just just know that sometimes you want to break up products into sums so let's suppose we wanted to do that so we have S of 4 thet time cosine of 6 Theta we get a s and a cosine multiplied together as a product here's what this formula tells us to do it say put your one half like all of them have we have sign of add the angles plus of subtract the angles this is the only we need for S and cosine so let's go ahead and try that sin 4 th * cosine 6 let's start by putting our 1 half sign of add the angles together plus s of subtract the angles now you're going to know something very important while it's not imperative which angle you call which it is imperative that you add them or well namely subtract them in the proper order so you cannot do something like 4 theta plus 6 Theta and then 6 Theta minus 4 Theta that doesn't work and the reason why it doesn't work is because this this does have an order for it for the angles you'll get a negative angle in there now that that's fine we can deal with it but you have to know that sign you see sign's an odd function if we want to change the sign of the angle well then we need an identity to do that and because sign's odd we can it's just that we have to know the proper sign in order to get it correct so we've got this we said hey s cosine we have a formula for it we're going to double check looks like we've got it right s of added them plus sign of subtracted them now I'm going to simplify a little bit so I'm thinking hey s of 4 thet + 6 thet is 10 theta plus s of -2 Theta now I'm really hoping that you remember that because sign is an odd function you can change the sign of your angle provided that you change the sign of your function odd means opposite inputs give you opposite outputs so if I change that sign I have to change the whole sign I'm not just pulling out the negative if I could do that why wouldn't I just pull out the two and pull out the 10 or pull out the four and the six and call it good we can't we need identities to change angles in intrig functions always so if I want to change that to a positive I need to change a sign of my function now now could you just take and subtract those and make that s of 8 Theta no that's the reason a lot of identities exist is to let you let you do things like that but you got to follow the rules if we just subtract them we're making up our own identities and that's not okay that's not a good thing a lot of people run into a lot of problems doing that so this is as good as we can get we cannot simplify anymore um and make it look any better this is in terms of all signs they're being subtracted and so this would be somewhat easier to deal with if we had do certain things later on in math that you're going to find out okay one last one how about cosine 3 th time cosine 4 Theta we see a cosine times a cosine again really you should stop the video and and try this on your own just pause it see if you can identify the proper formula to use see if you can evaluate it appropriately and simplify it if we run into evenness versus oddness remember cosine is an even function let's give it a try right now so we've got 1/2 they all start with 12 cosine * cosine of two different angles is this this formula right there we're going to take cosine of subtract plus coine of add the Angles and so we've done that cosine of subtract the angles plus cosine of add the angles we going double check check it looks really good we have to subtract the angles in order that's really really important and we've done that first angle second angle I've subtracted them now let's go ahead and simplify this 3 Theta minus 4 Theta is negative Theta at the same time 3 thet + 4 thet is 7 Theta now there's not a whole lot we can do with the the we don't even know that angle but we can use the fact that cosine is even to say opposite inputs give you equal outputs that's how every function works so instead of just pulling out the negative that that doesn't work at all actually we're thinking because cosine is even if I change the sign of my input or change from negative Theta to Theta it will not affect the sign of my output so I'm going to remove that netive it's going to look like it just disappears but we're using the fact the identity that cosine is an even function fun that says opposite inputs equal outputs that's as simplified as we can get we've just written this as all cosiness in a sum sometimes it's a little easier to deal with now I said something earlier I said that the order really really matters on what you're doing with these angles you have to subtract them or add them in the same same order mostly subtract them but it also said said that multiplication is commutative so you should be able to switch these around and get the same result you can as long as when you switch them you maintain the order um you can probably see it here but cosine of 3 thetus 4 Theta if I reverse this would change to cosine of 4 Theta minus 3 Theta well that's different it is but because cosine is even it will maintain that sign that's absolutely fine um one thing that we can't do remember that s and cosine while you could commute them if you have cosine 6 Theta sin 4 thet that would no longer fit that formula this says s has to come first so if you're ever given cosine s commute them first then use the formula and it'll work out just fine as long as you're maintaining the order When You Subtract it's going to be just fine for you so let's go ahead and come back I'm going to give you four new formulas show you how to use them and do um do one more example of how to solve an equation okay so as you can see I've put up four new formulas for you I'm going to lead you through three examples um to use three of these that they're very very similar and in what you do um as far as our product and sums we're now just going from sums into products and so that they're used quite quite similarly um all of the ones that that you'll encounter with this are fairly similar to what I'm I'm giving you so let's go ahead and see what what's going on here if we want to add two sign functions with different angles or subtract them or add two cosine functions with different angles or subtract them we now have a formula to do that to put them into a product now does it help yeah yes we go both ways from products into sums from sums into products at different times in math and we have a product to do we have a a way to do that I should say so s of alpha plus s of beta is two s you add the angles over two cosine of you subtract the angles over two if we want to subtract our signs we have something very very similar be careful on your signs here if we want to subtract our sign function with different angles we have two s you subtract the angles over two cosine you add the angles over two cosin's a little bit um little bit different so cosine of alpha plus cosine beta so two different angles adding the cosines we have two cosine add them over two cosine subtract them over two if we want to subtract the cosine functions -2 s add them over two s subtract them over two so we're just switching our functions here from cosin to signs and put in a negative in front let's see if we can do this with a few examples how about cosine of 2 thet plus cosine of 4 thet so we're going to check out our our formulas we know that we have a sum of cosine of two different angles so that's going to be right here so what's it say to do put the two first cosine of add them over two cosine of subtract them over two two cosine of add them over two cosine of subtract them over two remember just like in the product of sum the order is very important here so we want to make sure we're adding and subtracting especially subtracting in the proper order and then we're going to simplify so 2 theta plus 4 Theta that's six Theta over two and cosine of 2 thetus 4 that's - 2 th/ 2 take some time to simplify the fractions we're going to get 3 Theta and negative Theta now the cosine 3 Theta is set you can't do anything with that but cosine of negative Theta because cosin's even we know opposite inputs give us equal outputs we can change the sign of our argument without changing the sign of our function that's it flip the sign you're good to go with even functions so 2 cosine 3 Theta and then cosine positive Theta it's really tempting to want to pull the three out it's really tempting to combine your cosines and combine your angles you can't unless you're using an identity the stuff we want to do by pulling stuff out it really does not work so leave it just like that you're done that's kind of nice kind of refreshing that you don't have to do anything more with that you really can't unless you have an identity let's take a look at this we have cosine functions being subtracted with different angles if we have them subtracted they count as a sum into a product formula but we're just subtracting instead of adding and that that's okay it's like you're adding the the negative so we're right down here we're subtracting cosines with different angles we're going to start with this with a -2 then sign add them over two s subtract them over two -2 sign let's add them all over two so -2 sign add your angles got it over two and then sign subtract your angles over two we have a bit of simplification to do here one thing you could do you could multiply both your numerator and denominator all by two and distribute and kill off your fraction right now if you want to do that that's totally fine so we' get twos cancel Theta 2's cancel 3 Theta 2 * 2 gives us 4 you can do that if you prefer to make already have a common denom make this one fraction you can do that as well I'll show you that here it just might start looking a little awkward with complex fractions so thet / 2 - 3 thet / 2 is -2 thet / 2 now our twos are going to simplify giving USGA Theta over 2 and for Theta over 4 we can simplify that now please keep something in mind I said something that's kind of confusing for some students to understand what I told you is you can not manipulate the argument to change it but then we're adding and subtracting things in here and that seems Maybe contradictory keep in mind I'm not actually changing the argument I'm simplifying it I'm not moving anything out I'm not putting anything in I'm not changing the sign I'm just manipulating this inside but I'm leaving it inside I'm not pulling it out I'm not changing that from what it is I'm just making it look a little different by by simplifying the fractions in there and things I'm not changing the value of it to change the value of it the sign of it you need an identity I hope that makes sense to you we're just kind of messing with this to make it look prettier we're not fundamentally changing it like changing that sign to a positive that's different fundamentally changing like pulling a three out or something that would be changing the value we're just changing the uh The Look by simplifying our fractions so 4 Theta over 4 we are just going to get Theta now the negative Theta over 2 that's inside sign so if we wanted to change that sign of the angle we could but we need an identity because sign is an odd function opposite inputs give us opposite outputs if we change the sign of our input it'll change the sign of our function our output so we're going to do that we're going to change this to a positive but it's going to change this function to a negative negative * a negative is going to give us a positive so I'm going to change this but it's going to change my sign here so I'm showing that right now I'm showing that this is odd so I can do this with it now a negative times a negative is going to give us a positive that's about as good as we can get as simple as we can make that no this two and that one half do not cancel because again to change your argument fundamentally to move things out put things in you need identities okay last one you should really pause it and try this on your own take a look at which of these formulas actually works see if you can understand the concept of what's going on behind it and then simplify as much as you can so for us we have S of theta over 2 minus s of 3 thet over 2 so we have two sign functions with different angles being subtracted it looks like that one so what's it say put a two got it s of subtract over two cosine of add over two so we have two different functions there SS and cosin so we've got two s subtract the angles over two cosine add the angles over two you can see the only one we're not using in these examples is that one it's very very similar to everything else we've done so follow the same pattern but we always do want to double check so I'm going to double check subtract got it angles look really good first minus second so I have an order over two okay I'm adding them over two I haven't messed up any my angles now we're going to go ahead and simplify um I should showed you that you can multiply by LCDs that's that's nice these already have a common denominator if you just want to combine them that's totally fine too I'm going to do that here so Theta / 2 - 3 thet 2 is -2 Theta / 2 so -2 thet 2 all over 2 still and then we'll have four th/ 2 all over 2 and fortunately we can simplify that -2 thet 2 is Theta / 2 cosine of well let's see 4 th 2 is 2 2 / 2 is Justa now I'm hoping you see what's happen what's going to happen next cosine looks great cosine Theta you're done s of theta 2 think about what sign is is s an even function or an odd function we're thinking that's an odd function what do odd functions do opposite inputs give us opposite outputs so if I'm going to change the sign of input it's going to change the sign of my output if I want to change this in other words it's got to change that sign evens don't do that opposite inputs equal outputs so if I want to change the sign of my input I don't change the sign of output that's why for cosine with a negative it looks like you just dro the negative it's because it's an even function the sign of the function does not change when you take an opposite input so I'm going to make this negative this says change your input for an odd function you have to change the output sign that's as good as we can get that's as simple as we can get that's to taken a a a difference of sign functions with two different angles and made them a product and only signs and cosiness sometimes it's very valuable I hope that's made sense we're going to come back and do one equation um and then we'll call it good so you might be wondering why in the world do we do a lot of this stuff uh why do we change from a sum to a product why do we change from a product to a sum a sum to a product is very nice why well because if you're trying to solve equations a sum cannot be solved very easily by stuff that's nice to use like the zero product property but but products can think factoring like factoring works because you create these these factors that you can set each one equal to zero by this zero product property what could you do there like we can't pull out a two we can't pull out a four we can't Factor anything about this in order to change the arguments you need identities if they're not the same you can't add them you can't Factor them you cannot factor a sign out here you can't factor a two out here you can't do anything with it you can't set each of these equal to zero they're not products there are some and so a lot of times when we deal with equations like this with different angles of s functions or cosine functions added or subtracted it's very nice to make them a product we have the same situation that we have here notice that the signs are being added with different angles let's use our formula so this says you're going to take s of add/ 2 2 cosine of subtract over 2 so we are solving an equation I'm working on this side I still have this equal to zero I'm not not putting things in random places or anything I've used the formula appropriately let's see I had of different angles being added I've got two I got two s added over two cosine subtracted over two in the proper order first angle second angle so I want to make sure that's correct and now I'm going to simplify it so I did this one pretty quick 2 + 4 is 6 6 2 is 3 2 - 4 is -2 Theta that negative is important divid two that's going to give us negative Theta so let's write that now what do you see what hopefully you see that cosine of Theta is an even function I'm going to change the argument without changing the function sign change the sign of the input it will not change the sign of the output for even functions now this is why we might want to use a formula like this to change from a sum into a product you see if we have this now as a product equal to zero the zero product property still works let's take all of our factors that contain variables not the two the two doesn't even matter here but if we take all of our factors that contain variables we're able to set them equal to zero so if things multiply together equal zero each one of those things those factors equal to zero provides a solution for us so I'm going to take s of 3 thet equals 0 and cosine of theta equal 0 let's start with the cosine theta equals z so we pull our unit circle out we take a look at it and go hey when does cosine Theta equal Z when do we have an x coordinate of zero remember cosine of theta says our x coordinate for this angle is in this case Zero that would happen at Pi / 2 and at 3 Pi / 2 that's when our x coordinate is zero we're done with that we're done with this one this one's a little trickier man I hope that you remember that when we have Co like s of 3 Theta one of the first things that we we learned about solving these equations was you can you can do a substitution it it puts more uh frequency on the same period remember that cuts your period by three or it it it compresses it uh into a third of a normal period so three of them are going to fit on a normal period that compresses it so that more fit between 0 and 2 pi and if we're looking for Solutions on 0 to 2 pi which we almost always are then we have to take that into account so here's what to do this is a recap we would call whatever that angle is something different let's call it Alpha for a second so Alpha equals 3 Theta we're making a substitution can you solve that now yeah yeah that's not bad s of alpha equals z alpha is let's see if s of alpha gives us the a y coordinate for this particular angle and says your y-coordinate is zero I'm looking for angles that create a y-coordinate of 0o s is the y coordinate on a unit circle that's going to be zero and Pi now we just talked about this but because that shortens your period or compresses it more will fit on the same period in fact whatever that number is do you remember this whatever that number is ADD periods so 2 pi for s pi for tangent 2 pi for cosine add periods until you hit that many cycles so I'm going to add 2 pi I'm going to add 2 pi again so 0 + 2 pi is 2 pi add another period That's 4 Pi how about 4 4 Pi do the same thing remember that three of these periods are now going to fit in the original 0 2 pi so I'm going to add 2 pi again that's going to give us 3 Pi add it again you're going to get 5 Pi so we have 0 Pi 2 pi 3 Pi 4 Pi 5 Pi those are all the the solution is way more than 2 pi right now for Alpha but look what's going to happen because we use a substitution because we said hey we're calling 3 Theta into this alpha alpha can be this to satisfy a y-coordinate of zero either Z or 2 pi or 4 Pi or uh we could do s of Pi or 3 Pi another Revolution or 5 Pi when we take and put our substitution back and say yes but do you remember Alpha is really 3 Theta what's going to happen we have to divide everything by three in order to solve for Theta that brings it from way outside of 2 pi like 5 Pi is way outside that brings it from way outside 2 pi back into it because it's compressing that it's making more periods fit on the original 0 to 2 pi so let's divide everything by three so we would get zero pi over 3 2 pi over 3 3 pi over 3 is pi 4 pi over 3 and 5 pi over 3 notice what happened all of these are between 0 and 2 pi one revolution on the unit circle we just happen to fit more periods on that original Revolution so combining these Solutions with this solution satisfies that equation I hope that makes sense to you I hope that you're seeing the utility in using the sum to a product so that way we can make them factors use a zero product property and solve them with a substitution like we already know otherwise if you don't see that that gets really really hard I'm not obviously doing more because the only things I can really do are put a minus there or do cosine plus cosine or cosine minus cosine and we deal with the same type of formula we do the same type of problem so um you can do that on your own hopefully you understand what we've been talking about hopefully that this helps you I hope you're enjoying the videos have a great day
