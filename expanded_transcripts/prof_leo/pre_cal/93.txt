Transcript for: An Indepth Look at Using Inverse Trig Functions (Precalculus - Trigonometry 21)
hi welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk a bit more a lot more about how to use some of these inverse functions that we just learned about namely sine inverse cosine inverse tangent inverse and a little bit about cosecant secant and cotangent inverse so let's let's just refresh a little bit about what what these things mean maybe a slightly different look at it remember that when we're talking about a unit circle sine of theta equals y or the y coordinate of some point on the unit circle for whatever angle theta is and cosine of theta equals x and tangent of theta equals y over x now what that means is that they're inverses basically undo that so sine inverse of y equals theta says this if your input is now the y coordinate of some point on the unit circle sine inverse of that y coordinate is going to give you the angle that creates that point with the y coordinate of whatever it is this was also exactly why we had to define whatever our domain of sine was to create a one-to-one function because obviously we know that we can have a y coordinate that's the same at both a an angle that's smaller and larger if we go from the from the x axis uh a smaller angle and a larger angle one in quadrant one and one quadrant two if that y coordinate's positive that would create a problem and so we've defined these on very very specific domains so that the inverses actually work so we have a one-to-one function that lets us map forwards and backwards so what this says is that we can use the unit circle as long as we remember that sine cosine tangent take in angles and give you out the y coordinate for sine the x coordinate for cosine or the y over the x coordinates for tangent for whatever angle you plug in the inverses reverse that the inverses say as long as we remember that the y coordinate for sine inverse the x coordinate for cosine inverse or the y divided by the x coordinate for tangent inverses as the inputs will give you out the angle that creates those points but only on two out of the four quadrants so for sine and sine inverse the quadrants are four and one negative pi over two to pi over two for cosine cosine inverse those quadrants are one and two zero to pi for tangent it's four and one again but it does not include negative pi over two does not include pi over 2 that's why i have parentheses or these inequality notation without equal sign now in a little while we're going to do some stuff with cosecant inverse and secant inverse and cotangent inverse and they match up pretty good where they're defined so the the domain or actually the the range for this our range for cosecant inverse is only valid for the same thing that sine inverse is so from negative pi over two to pi over two wherever that's defined don't wherever that's defined there is a vertical asymptote in there so we have to be very careful and thankfully secant inverse is defined on the same exact interval as as as cosine inverse is provided it's defined now cotangent is a problem cotangent inverse has a different range for our theta than tangent inverse does and so that that is an issue so whenever we're working with tangent inverse we oftentimes will use well what do you think cotangent inverse is paired up really nicely with cosine inverse and so those those actually work very well we're going to see that in a couple examples a lot of examples when we get there that sometimes we can have a little work around if we're struggling to find an angle for something so we're going to get into it we're going to learn all about how these inverse functions really give you out an angle and that's that's the whole point so let's take a look at sine inverse of the square root of 2 over 2. right there i really need in your head that what this gives you out what this says is hey the y coordinate is square root 2 over 2 give me the angle that creates that that's what sine inverse is doing sound number says plug in to be a y coordinate and i will give you the angle that creates the point on the unit circle with that y coordinate i will give it to you from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. why because that's the one to one part of that part of the function that we defined are inverses on so we're going to say this gives you out an angle now we can really do something with that we could actually go right from here and say hey if we really understand how to use our unit circle we really understand that sine inverse is only defined from negative pi over two to pi over two then really what i'm looking for is the angle that gives me a y coordinate of the square root of two over two so i'm going to look at that notice how there is no repeat of y coordinates on this part of my unit circle that's why we defined it there would be if i included this that's why we didn't include that so square root of 2 over 2 happens only right here at pi over four so that angle is pi over four theta is pi over four for sure now there's something else that we can do to show a little bit more math some students really like doing this some don't so take it as as you will it doesn't really matter to me but here's one thing that we can do if we understand that sine inverse of y coordinate gives me angle matches up with sine of angle gives me y coordinates sometimes seeing that makes it easier for students either way you go it doesn't really matter this is just putting it in something that a lot of students are are more readily able to see okay i'm looking for an angle that's giving me a y coordinate square root of two or two are you really doing anything different no you really aren't you're not doing anything different there so however you go whether you understand that's the y coordinate find me the angle okay pi over 4 or sine of what angle gives me square root 2 over 2. again that'd be pi over 4. we have to stick to the correct range for our inverse functions domain for our our trig functions so no matter what we get pi over 4. now here's the next question what i'm getting you to understand is that sometimes we get some weird stuff like this and i'm walking you through that right now i'm walking you through like how you would do this is understand that that is man that's a that's a y coordinate of a point this is creating for me the angle or finding for me the angle then cosine can ask about that angle so could we find cosine of the angle you just found well yeah sure cosine of pi over 4 is also square root 2 over 2. and that's precisely what this asks you so what this part says is find cos cosine okay what do you plug into cosine you plug in angles to cosine and angles of sine and angles to all of our original trig functions so cosine needs an angle does this give you an angle yeah it does this says find me the angle that has a y coordinate square root of two over two we've already done this so this is exactly what this is talking about and it's it's exactly the process of going through it so whenever you get these kind of weird things or what in the world are they asking you they're there to do they're saying find the angle from this inverse trig function then find cosine or whatever that trig function is of that angle it's honestly not that hard to do as long as you remember what in the world inverse tree functions are doing they're saying find me the angle that gives me this particular y coordinate for sum x coordinate for cosine and y y over x for tangent inverse that's what it's doing for you so this says hey you could find cosine of this is the angle that's why we defined it that way it was really nice to do that so this gives you an angle if i wanted to find cosine of this remember these two things are equal sine inverse of square root 2 over 2 is the theta that we were talking about this is cosine of pi over 4. and that is square root 2 over 2. and that's really all there is to it so we're going to practice several of these i'm not going to walk you through it this way anymore i'm going to just give you this and say here's the thought process i'm going through it's exactly this structure this is talking about an angle find the trig function of the angle just make sure you are on the right domain for your trig function or range for your university functions we'll see that in just a second let's move on so we're taking a look at tangent of cosine inverse of negative square root three over two what the heck what does that mean remember what these things do tangent needs an angle think about what cosine inverse does cosine inverse is going to give you out an angle this was the big deal here saying regular trig functions give you in angles give you out coordinates of points inverses say plug in coordinates of points i give you out angles so this is going to give us out an angle so the first thing we're going to do here is take the inside if it's an inverse trig function understand this is going to give me an angle call it an angle call it theta or something and then find theta there's two ways to go about doing it for some of you it's going to be really easy to look at this and go okay i understand that cosine talks about x-coordinate stuff on a unit circle so cosine inverse is saying this is an x-coordinate on some point on this unit circle restricted to zero to pi so can we look at this can we look and say hey from zero to pi find me something with an x coordinate this is x an x coordinate of negative square root of three over 2. all of our x's are positive here this is quadrants 1 and 2. so an x coordinate right there that's an x coordinate of negative square root 3 over 2. the angle that causes that is the output of our inverse trig function so this says find this angle this is talking about an angle here this is saying here's the x coordinate find an angle that gives me that x coordinate on zero to pi that's how we define it to get a one to one part of this i hope it's making sense to you this is 150 degrees or we probably put 5 pi over 6. we always use our radians for our inverses so our angle is 5 pi over 6. what that means is this thing in here is 5 pi over 6. you see we set this equal to the angle we just saw the angle we can make a substitution now this is this thing so what this all boils down to is you've now found the angle that causes the x-coordinate now find tangent of that angle well that makes sense because tangent needs an angle to give me some sort of an output we can do more work if you need to um you can do a couple other things here that would be of benefit to some people sometimes we can say all right if this is true then cosine theta equals negative square root 3 over 2 you can find theta it'd be exactly the same but maybe it's a little easier to look at you go find cosine of what angle gives me that x coordinate restricted to that domain well that would be negative square root of three over two i'm sorry five pi over six but either way we get that also some some teachers like you to show that because you called that theta that you can write tan of cosine inverse of negative square root of three over two as tangent of theta but we now know theta personally that's a little bit of overkill for me but some people like to show all that work the way that i would normally do this is identify this as an angle use your unit circle right from here find the angle and then because this is equal to this thing you can substitute that that's a direct substitution to get right down to here and then we'll perform that trigonometric function tangent of 5 pi over 6 is asking you well here's 5 pi over 6 can you find tangent of that angle tangent relates to the y over the x coordinate so one half over negative square root 3 over 2. if we get that we're going to get negative 1 over square root 3. or negative square root of 3 which is exactly what this is equal to so it's kind of a long process if you do show the work um hopefully it's not a hard process hopefully you you're making the connections that inverse trig functions give me out angles trig functions need angles as inputs so this output becomes the input for our trig functions it becomes an angle for trig functions i hope that works for you i hope i hope you're really seeing that so we're going to do three more examples uh two or three more examples i'll show you what to do when they're not on a unit circle and then we'll switch it around we'll say what if we have an inverse of a normal trig function all right here we go so we have secant of sine inverse of negative one half right in your head right now think secant requires an angle as an input we look inside okay is this an angle sine inverse inverse trig functions give you out angles so if we evaluate that we are going to have an angle out that's what this says sine inverse says i'm going to give you out an angle well now let's think about that for a second if this gives us out of an angle then this has to be some sort of coordinate on somewhere on the unit circle hopefully but what coordinate well sine inverse says instead of plugging in an angle and be giving you out a y coordinate like sine does that inverse says give me the y coordinate i'll give you the angle so sine inverse matches up a y coordinate to the angle that creates that so sine number says this is a y coordinate find me the angle that makes that y coordinate that's what that's going to give you out so how do we do that remember that sine inverse is only valid from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. so we're in quadrants 4 or 1 but using negative angles here and so what we're going to do is understand that hey a y coordinate of negative one half let's see y coordinates are positive here and negative down here negative one half is right there do not use 11 pi over six don't do that because that's not in there you have to use negative angles here so sine inverse of negative one half says find me the angle that gives me a y coordinate of negative one half on this part of your unit circle from negative pi over two to pi over two but they are using negative angles so that would be negative pi over 6 not 11 pi over 6. well that's pretty good news because now we understand what that part is this said here's my y coordinate finding the angle and we just did this angle is equal to whatever's inside that function right now whatever's in secant this thing is the angle we just found so we can rewrite it and now that's something that we can do also notice that even though secant inverse is only defined from zero to pi it is okay for us to find a regular trig function of negative pi over six we're not finding it inverse of secant right now we're just performing a trig function secant is defined well on the entire domain except where we have these vertical asymptotes and it's not at negative pi over 6. so we can go ahead and find this just fine so secant of negative pi over 6 well this is going to give you 1 over cosine or 1 over x and so you can do it that way so here's negative pi over 6 secant is the in the reciprocal of cosine so that would be 1 over square root 3 over 2 or 2 over square root 3. that's totally fine to do that as well if you needed to show this and get 1 over square root of 3 over 2 that's 1 over x you can get that that's fine but you'll immediately reciprocate and multiply you'll get 2 over square root 3. yes we're going to rationalize this we're going to get 2 square root 3 over 3. that's about all there is to it we're using inverses to find an angle and then evaluating a trig function of that angle the outputs of our inverses are angles the inputs of our trig functions are angles it works perfectly hope it's making sense i hope you're understanding that even though our inverses are restricted to certain domains as long as we don't get anything undefined our trig functions are just fine with whatever angle we get out of that it's perfectly okay to do and so here we just like yeah negative pi over six and then secant is one over x or the reciprocal of cosine so i'm thinking cosine square root of three over two the reciprocal is secant and that would be two over square root of three let's move on to another one so we're taking a look at cosecant of tangent inverse the square root of three all right well let's start out let's start with the inside of that parentheses and say and figure out what tan inverse square root of three actually means what tangent inverse is going to give you just like every inverse trig function it's going to take something to do with our coordinates and give you out an angle that creates that so just remember what tangent deals with tangent deals with y over x so tangent inverse is going to say you give me that you give me that y over x and i'll give you out the angle that makes it that's my output to you it's an angle and so we would think all right tangent inverse of square root of three equals angle what angle gives me a y over x is square root of three sometimes as i was saying it's easier for people to think of this tangent of what angle gives you square root of three that's especially useful if you have a table so i i do this all by unit circle but sometimes you can get a table that says tangent and cosine and sine of all and the cosecant secant and cotangent of all these very normal uh angles and and this will be on there and so you look through and go okay tangent of what gives me square root of 3. if you like this way do it that way if you like this is a tan inverse of what angle gives me this y over x or the same thing tangent of what angle gives me y over x either way you go with the same question i hope that you're seeing that these are no different but this is easier to use with the table because this is on there directly so we think and go all right that's got to be it's got to be pi over 3 because pi over 3 is number one it's on the correct interval for our inverses to work tangent inverse only works from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 not including those two n values but the only place where on that interval we're going to get a positive relationship with square root of 3 is when we compare this y square root of 3 over 2 divided by one half because the twos cancel and we would get that out so that angle is pi over three either way you go your angle is pi over three and it worked well tan inverse of square root of three give me out an angle now we're going to evaluate cosecant of that angle because this angle equaled this inside of your function we can substitute and say now we're going to find cosecant of whatever angle we found so cosecant takes 1 over y or reciprocates the y coordinate how does it do that cosecant is related strongly to sine so sine is the y coordinate cosecant is 1 over the y or the reciprocal of the y coordinate so we take a look at that right now cosecant pi over 3 says here's pi over 3. remember it can be anywhere unit circle for the trig function it does not matter you do not have to restrict it but cosecant of pi over 3 says find your y coordinate take 1 over that or reciprocate it so here's my y coordinate i'm going to take 2 over square root of 3 again if i rationalize we get 2 square root 3 or 3. all right let's take a look at this one cotangent of cosine inverse of negative one-half we're going to go fairly quickly through it understand that inverses give you out angles so let's write this as that relationship right now understanding that cosine inverse of negative one half is going to give me out an angle but it's only going to do so where cosine inverse is defined uh well sorry where cosine is defined to give me a range for cosine inverse of zero to pi so only on quadrants one and two so let's take a look at this let's understand that cosine is relating an x coordinate and an angle together cosine of the angle gives me x coordinate cosine inverse of the x coordinate gives me the angle so let's find that that x coordinate but only on this part of my unit circle so my x coordinate has to be that one right there that's negative one half that's on this zero to pi where we restricted that to get a one-to-one function so negative one-half for x y x it's dealing with cosine what angle creates that well it's going to be 2 pi over 3. if we want to show it this way sometimes that's a bit easier cosine of what angle gives me an x coordinate of negative one-half now this is really clear because we know cosine is equal to the x-coordinate for whatever angle it is cosine of what angle gives me that still you get 2 pi over 3. by the way sometimes you'll have students who really really want to use a calculator here because your calculator will perform it but they're probably not going to give you that it's going to give you a decimal out some do and that's really nice but it's very very beneficial to make sure you can use the unit circle so refrain from using your calculator unless you absolutely have to so we're thinking hey cosine inverse x coordinates deal with x and angle our angle that makes that x coordinate on the appropriate domain is 2 pi over 3. now we're going to find cotangent of 2 pi over 3. that's what this thing is it's the angle we just found the angle so now evaluated so cotangent of 2 pi over 3 let's see tangent is y over x cotangent is x over y so we're going to go right back to that angle we just found 2 pi over 3 we're going to evaluate cotangent the x over the y so negative one half over square root 3 over 2. if we reciprocate and we multiply we get negative one over the square root of three if we rationalize that's negative square root three over three so i hope i've made it very clear what we're doing here depending on what inverse trig function we are we set up what interval on the unit circle we're in sine numbers and tangent inverse deal with negative pi over two to pi over 2 sine includes those n values cosine is the odd one because the inverse from 0 to pi actually cotangent is 2 we'll get that later but we restrict that we find out the appropriate angle that's giving us the y coordinate percent inverse the x coordinate for cosine inverse or the y over x for tangent numbers that gives us an angle that we evaluate the trig function of that angle i hope that's really clear i hope i've explained it to you in such a way that that makes sense i'm going to come back and i'm going to show you what happens when these things are not on a used circle we're gonna have to draw some triangles not that hard and it's super it's super valuable for calculus 2. all right so let's take a look at something like sine of tangent inverse of one-half we think all right we got this right sine needs an angle tangent inverse it gives us an angle that's great that's exactly what we want inverse trig functions give out angles that's their output so let's set it up that way okay well here's what this is asking i want you to take tan think of tangent tangent is y over x now tangent inverse says take that y over x relationship and give me the angle that creates that and you go but wait a minute tangent of one half is i don't i don't see that one half for a comparison of y over x on the circle and that's true that's that's not there and so what happens is this is one of the reasons i was prefacing that if tangent inverse of one-half equals theta this is only if tangent then equals one-half now before when we were on a circle this was really easy but when we're not this is really helpful so if you are not finding this out very easily you're like i don't know where that is uh we'll write this as a normal trig function so we're thinking that gives me an angle that's true this is not on a unit circle it's also true so let's write this as hey if tan inverse of one half gives me theta tangent of theta gives me one half so what's that mean well tangent takes a relationship of an angle to the y over x coordinates so wait a minute on a triangle this would be y over x okay let's draw a triangle like that you see that's what a unit circle did anyway it was basically uh super subscripting these triangles onto this circle so let's let's make a triangle out of this where a y is one and an x is two so we can do that provided that we're in the right quadrants so remember what tan inverse does tan number says i only work in quadrants four and one from negative pi over two to pi over two so you have to obey that otherwise you'd be able to draw two triangles here for instance a y of one and an x of 2 would put a point right there that would be a relationship on a right triangle with a y of 1 and an x2 but you could get the same exact relationship if you did negative one and negative two do you really do you see that do you realize that negative one divided by negative two is also positive one half so why wouldn't we use that triangle right there that's the entire reason maybe the first time you really is really clicking is that we had to eliminate like half of the unit circle or half of our xy plane if you will so that we don't have this situation where we could possibly get out two different angles that's why we restricted it so when we're dealing with inverse trig functions you're in only one of two quadrants you're either in four one negative pi over two to pi over two or you're in zero to pi one of those sets of two quadrants so for tangent inverse tangent inverse only works in these two quadrants that's exactly what this says negative pi over 2 pi over 2. so that means this is not okay so our relationship says yes tangent inverse is 4 or 1 the only place where both x and y are positive for tangent inverse to work is quadrant one that's why we draw it there now can we go a little further can we take and wait a minute that's a right triangle i hope you're seeing that tangent of theta equals one half says your y is one your x is two that gives me a right triangle could we find the hypotenuse well wait a minute it's a right triangle that's awesome so right triangles say yeah if you can take x squared plus y squared it's going to equal r squared for whatever hypotenuse you have that's pythagorean theorem well now let's plug in some values please for goodness sakes don't forget to take square root super common people oh it's 5. take the square root we get the square root of 5. so by the pythagorean theorem leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared we know that that hypotenuse is square root of 5 or that this would be like on a circle with a radius of square root of 5 not a unit circle a square root of 5 circle not a thing now why in the world would we do that well to answer that question you see if we're not on a unit circle we have to basically reinvent the wheel so to speak um for every different radius it's not one the unit circle is great because with the radius of one we got a lot of very common angles and their respective points that's great well do you have a circle like written out with a radius of square root of five no i hope not and it doesn't take forever to do all the possible radii that that's impossible for us to do that and so what we do is we go okay let's invent just the one angle that we need that has this relationship so bear with me here's a like a 20 second recap we take our inverse trig function we write out equal to an angle if this is on a unit circle this is pretty easy because we go okay uh tangent inverse of what's the y over x find me the angle it gives me that even if you write it this way tangent of what angle gives me y compared to x on a unit circle pretty nice if it's not then we're going to create the one triangle to find the one angle that we need that has a certain radius with a certain y and a certain x so we can draw it as long as we remember what tangent does tangent relates y to x draw a picture in the appropriate quadrant in this it's quadrant one our y is one our x is two we can complete that triangle with pythagorean theorem every time and now here's the magic part tan inverse of one half equaled an angle this is that angle so if you find sine with late relating to that angle you're going to solve this so let's go over here let's understand what sine is sine if you remember was y but what did what did it really mean it meant y over 1 or y over the radius the opposite over the hypotenuse this is the the main reason why a long time ago when i introduced what sine really was in the unit circle i said remember that sine of theta is y over r cosine theta is x over r tangent theta was y over x if you remember anything about right triangle trigonometry remember that tangent theta is opposite over adjacent sine was opposite over hypotenuse oh there it is there's our r y over r cosine was x or adjacent over hypotenuse for whatever right triangle we have also i want to mention you use the signs here so sine not like that sign but positive and negative you have to have that because we're working on an x y coordinate plane we have to have the ability to have negative x values negative y values so for us now that we've found that now that we've said we've got a picture of this angle we have a picture of what this gave us this angle that we're talking about is that angle and here's the the way the triangle would have to look if we have a comparison of y to x of one-half that is the angle now find sine of the angle relates back to says find sine of whatever angle this is giving you this gave you an angle relationship amongst these sides just like that so find sine of that angle sine of the angle we just created takes well let's see y over the r normally it's just y because our r is one for unit circle but here it's not so that plays part of it so y over r says take your one that's your y over your square root 5. if we rationalize that denominator we're going to get square root of 5 over 5. now i know it's kind of weird that we actually never found the angle but that's not what it's asking it's it's not asking you really for the angle it's asking sine of that angle equals what and that's what we found so that's kind of neat that without even knowing what that angle is specifically we can relate a triangle that answers the question side of that angle so it's kind of a kind of workaround um this is why we had to draw the triangle so that we could relate these two sides and how sine wants you to do it for whatever angle tangent inverse of one half is going to is going to get you that's the idea here i hope that makes sense we're going to come back and do a few more but the plan is if something's on a unit circle it's easy find the angle and you can actually find it explicitly then find the trig function at angle it's not a problem if it's not on a unit circle you won't find the angle explicitly you'll try a triangle that relates sides in the appropriate way that represents that angle then you find a trig function of that triangle so for sine that was opposite over hypotenuse no problem and that's what we get all right let's try this one tangent of sine inverse of one-third think about what sine inverse wants to give you out it wants to give you out an angle so what we're going to do is say all right the first thing we're going to do every single time is say that that sine inverse of 1 3 wants to give me out an angle if that's on the unit circle you can do it right from right here or if it benefits you a little bit sine inverse of 1 3 equals theta if and only if sine theta equals one-third now for a unit circle you're perfectly okay doing it here if it's not on unit circle you kind of need this one why well because this this is showing you how an angle is related to two sides on a right triangle so this is saying sine's giving you a y over an r or this this vertical part of your right triangle compared to your hypotenuse or the radius on some sort of circle because sine inverse only works from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 we're going to put this on our x y coordinate system appropriately to represent just one point and not two points you see here's the thing we can put this on our unit circle and this will always be the case in two places that's why we had to restrict this to half of a unit circle or half of a x y coordinate plane so if we have a positive y value of one and a radius remember what sine theta does it says y is our vertical and r is our radius we could do one of two places if we had a 1 with a radius of 3 we could be either here or we could be over here you'd have a radius 3 going this way or radius 3 going this way both of those points would be absolute value does both have a positive one one those both have a radius of three they would both represent an appropriate angle so which one's right the one that's in the right quadrant the one that's in the right domain for our sine to be one to one that would be just from negative pi over two to pi over two this is in quadrant two sine inverse is not worked there sine does not work there to give you sine inverse so this is wrong this is not what we want i hope it's making sense to you at this point why in the world we restricted that domain i know it probably did before but now you're really seeing why because otherwise we can't do this you'd have two angles that that's a really big problem and so we think of it this way i think this is going to give me a one angle relate that okay where does it have to relate if y is positive and the radius is positive also the hypotenuse is positive that's got to be quadrant four or one well down here y would be negative so we're we're in quadrant one for sure by the way this is obviously not drawn scaled it's just a graphic representation of what we want to show now that we have that let's find x let's find whatever this this x value would be and that's going to be pythagorean theorem every time so leg squared plus leg squared was hypotenuse squared no problem we can have x squared equals eight and ultimately we get x is this 2 square root 2. now is it valuable well yeah absolutely it's valuable because this gives me a way to look at this angle so sine of theta is one third says here's the triangle that matches up i don't even know what the angle is i don't even care this is the angle we just found it it's right there and then and this is like the one time in math you can go find x and you go there it is find theta there it is it's like right there like this is the triangle that gives you that particular angle so we found the angle now when we ask the question can you find tangent of the angle yes tangent using this angle as what this is giving you because that's what it gave you this gave you an angle relating y over r you found the x this is the one and only one triangle that would have the angle and the one and one only one angle that would have this particular triangle with these particular y values and hypotenuse values and x values so tangent says now let's work with that so tangent is look at the angle that we just got from the triangle we just created from this inverse trig function and give me what tangent does tangent theta is y over x that would be 1 over two square root two if you rationalize that we get square root 2 or 4 and no you can't simplify don't simplify that that'd be bad news but that's it this is what we're looking for you you're looking for what tangent of an angle is going to give you a relationship among sides we just found it you don't even really care about what the angle is now we could do this with um with our calculators but that that's not what the idea is the idea is give me the relationship among sides y over x for an ang tangent of that particular angle that's what we're doing that's what we showed ah that's so close don't you there's a little two if it's a little two we'd be done almost done because that would be on the inner circle but it's not so let's go through the process we know that inverse trig functions give angle start with that this is only true cosine inverse of negative square root 3 over 3 gives you theta if and only if cosine theta equals negative square root 3 over 3. now we look at a unit circle can you find me an angle on a unit circle where the x coordinate is negative square root 3 over 3 you go no i can't do that then draw yourself a triangle with this relationship that this is giving you x over r cosine can be viewed as x over 1 or as x over r well that makes sense because if the radius is 1 we just get x that's that's true so cosine gives you x over r but we also have to play along with where cosine inverse is defined see this where its range is really this only works if that angle is between zero to pi so if this is x and x is negative notice and r is positive here we have a couple of choices we can do a negative x positive r up or positive r down but because this would be in quadrant three i can't do it cosine inverse only works from here to here zero to pi so here would be positive x here would be negative x you'd have to be in this quadrant i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing why we restricted it and how it's so very important to understand that so let's do negative square root 3. we don't have to be really to scale here you just need to know your quadrant so our quadrant is because x is negative i'm on this half of my my y axis or my extra equivalent plane and because of that i know that cosine inverse is only 0 pi it's got to be up here so our x is negative square root 3 this is why we had to allow for these negative values so that it puts us in appropriate quadrant and our r or our radius or our hypotenuse is 3. take the time to go ahead and find out what y is i always write y x and r because it makes the pythagorean theorem work a little bit better for me so leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared is negative square root of 3 squared plus y squared equals 3 squared and we're going to solve that for y negative square root 3 squared is this is 3. so negative squared gives you positive square root of 3 squared is just 3. so y is going to give you the square root of 6. now this is super valuable because what this gave you was an angle and based on the triangle that that angle gave us that this gave us we can find cotangent of that triangle i should say really cotangent of that angle using the triangle we created so inverse function gives me angle out that angle is this angle right there the only way that this triangle is created from the angle or the angle from the triangle in this relationship is if this is the angle we're talking about and now we find cotangent of that angle don't even know the angle i just need to know the triangle that creates it so let's think of cotangent theta cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent so tangent was y over x cotangent is x over y so cotangent of this angle says i want you to put the x over the y and we make sure that we use sines so if we deal with that most of the time what we do is we see if we can simplify these square roots before rationalizing i'd make one square root that's going to be the square root of one over two well the square root of one is one but the square root of two we would rationalize and we would get negative square root 2 over 2. well that's exactly what this is equal to this caused angle angle created a triangle since it's not on the unit circle we did not find the angle specifically like explicitly finding that we're finding the triangle that is made from that angle using this relationship amongst x coordinate or the x side and the r or the hypotenuse side of our triangles then we find a trig function from that triangle and this says this whole thing is equal to negative square root 2 over 2. i have one more i know i'm doing a lot of examples but it's because i want you to really really get good at this and really see it as an appropriate quadrant based on how your trig functions are defined as far as your inverses are concerned so back with one more then we'll start going backwards what happens if you have an inverse of a trig function it's a little bit easier okay last one before we start going backwards so sine of tan inverse of negative three tangent inverse is going to give you out an angle let's start with that this is only true if tangent of the angle is equal to negative three these are both two statements of one another so tan inverse of negative three equals theta if and only a tangent of theta equals negative three now let's think about this can we find an angle that gives me negative three when i compare y over x on a unit circle no there's no negative three i can't find that on the unit circle specifically so we're going to draw a triangle from this now remember there's always two places where this is going to be true on a unit circle however only one place if we use the appropriately defined domain for tangent so this has to take place between quadrants four and one negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. and maybe think about it this way where is tangent negative tangent's negative in quadrants 2 and 4. which of those quadrants works in this well only quadrant 4. this is off limits you can't do it there so if we're going to say hey tangent theta relates y to x then that would be a y of negative 3 and an x of positive one y of negative three x and positive one would be here's a y of negative three and an x of positive one now you might be thinking how in the world would you get something up here well you understand with fractions that negative can go to the numerator or denominator so you could do a y of positive 3 and an x of negative 1 and get the same point but that's in quadrant 2 and tangent is not defined there tangent is only defined for inverses only on four or one that's why we had to choose that that is probably the biggest thing i have to talk about you need to absolutely make sure you're following that where this stuff is going to explode so we're in the appropriate quadrant not that one this one tangent's still negative there that's fantastic we have a y value negative three and x value positive one so let's keep going with our setup we've got a y value of negative three an x value of positive one and we can go ahead and we can find that r so we know that pythagorean theorem says leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared or x squared plus y squared equals r squared no problem so we can do that that would give us a square root of 10. now one thing i've been neglecting i want to show you right now when we take a square root we typically do a plus and minus and that is that actually is really relevant because we want to make sure that we're in the white right quadrant so what would it mean if we had a negative square root 10 this um this negative radius what that would do is flip that about our origin so that would create this other radii going kind of in quadrant two instead of quadrant four so if we want to do that we want to keep this in the correct quadrant so we're going to keep this as positive square root of 10. but please notice something that sometimes when we take a square root if we're in like quadrant let's say 2 for cosine inverse or something and we need to find the x value of that well then when we take a square root we want to keep the negative enough positive you need to make sure that you're in the correct quadrant that's a really big deal so here we're we have this r of positive square root 10 that keeps us in the right quadrant it's quadrant four and now because that angle is giving us that triangle we can find sine of theta using that triangle find it so sine says i want to take my y over my r or my opposite over my hypotenuse or my negative 3 over square root 10. use the science it's really important if we rationalize we get negative 3 square root 10 over 10 that's exactly what this equals so we're done let's go backwards a little bit let's start finding inverse functions of some original trig functions like sine cotangent cosine of these values and then find inverse of those it's a little bit faster and the reason is is because these things are defined everywhere where there's not a vertical asymptote on your unit circle so there's really not an issue these are all going to be very easy to find you have to worry about that and then when you do the inverse just make sure you're on the appropriate portion of that unit circle and you're going to be set so we're going to do that we'll come back and deal with some more cotangent inverse and cosecant inverse and secant inverse which we don't see that a lot but i'm going to show you how to work with that and then that that'll we'll call it a day so in order to deal with these there's not going to be a lot of triangle drawing anything like that all we really have to do is figure out what sine 5 pi over 4 is and find cosine inverse of that so deal with your inside first like before it's just easier because we're more used to these normal trig functions and they'll all be something that are defined you don't have to worry about restricting that right now so sine of five pi over four we know that sine of five pi over four should mean that's the y coordinate of the point where that angle creates on the inner circle so 5 pi over 4 is let's see right there sine is negative square root 2 over two and now we think of cosine inverse of negative square root two over two remember that this is going to give us an angle so cosine inverse of negative square root 2 over 2 asks now is where you restrict your domain on the appropriate portion of your xy chord x y coordinate plane or your unit circle basically from 0 to pi on 0 to pi where is your x coordinate negative square root 2 over 2 right there that would be three pi over four if it helps you to do that that's fine it says cosine of what angle gives me an x coordinate negative square root of two like i was saying this is very very useful for a lot of students because this puts in your head like oh yes i'm looking for the x coordinates sometimes your c the angle would still be x coordinate of negative square root 2 over 2 on the appropriate domain for that to be a one-to-one function for the inverse function to work would have to be just 3 pi over 4. and that's really about it so this is going to give you an angle and then this asks cosine inverse of that sorry this is going to give you a coordinate so angle this gives you a coordinate that asks what angle creates that coordinate for you on the appropriate part of that unit circle how the next one tangent inverse of cotangent of 2 pi over 3 find this part first now cotangent of 2 pi over 3 it's not a vertical asymptote right there this should be pretty easy to find so use your circle and find that cotangent of 2 pi over 3 2 pi over 3 is right here now if you're thinking well wait a minute tan inverse isn't defined there who cares cotangent is and that's all we're talking about right now we're going to deal with the inverse function after we figure that out so it's not to worry right now don't worry about it figure this out first so 2 5 over 3 says cotangent instead of y or x takes x over y negative one half over square root of three over two if we rationalize and we simplify the twos we're going to get negative square root 3 over 3. now what do inverses give you inverses give you out angles and so we can ask that question we pull out a table if we want if you're going to use a table it is often easiest to think of it this way tangent inverse of negative square root 3 or 3 equals theta if and only if tangent theta equals negative square root of three over three now what in the world is that going to give you well that probably comes from one over the square root of three so that's going to be let's see firstly negative where is tangent theta equal to a negative comparison of y to x well that goes back to inverse so this was able to be found no problem on the unit circle but tangent inverse is restricted so when we're talking about the inverse now this angle has to be from here to here okay what what does it mean if it's negative that means that we're in this quadrant from negative pi over two to zero we have to be here that that's gotta click right now it's gotta be like yeah that makes sense because tangent is only negative here and here this one's off limits for tangent inverse it was absolutely just fine to find cotangent no problem but now when we start talking about tangent inverse we use cotangent 2 pi over 3 to create this this number this y over x for us now tangent inverse says okay find me the angle but be on the appropriate part so from here to here well that's got to be let's see y over x that would be 11 pi over so well negative pi over six will have to make a big mistake why couldn't it be 11 pi over 6 that would be this angle i'm not talking about that i'm talking about this angle so negative pi over 6 that would create this negative one-half divided by square root of three over two that would be negative one over square root of three and then we rationalize get negative square root three over three so it's gotta be negative pi over six if you have a table out you can see that pretty clearly as well okay last one sine inverse of cosine of negative seven pi over six find this one first it's not a problem don't even worry about the inverse yet understand that cosine is defined everywhere it on the unit circle everywhere so we're not restricting this yet so cosine of negative seven pi over six uh well let's think about cosine for a second cosine is an even function so we could find cosine of positive seven pi over six man i hope you remember i hope you remember that cosine of e is an even function so cosine of opposite inputs gives you equal outputs says i can just switch my sign just fine with even functions so let's find cosine of 7 pi over 6. that's right here cosine is going to give us the x coordinate negative square root 3 over 2. now is where the domain restrictions come in now is where we go okay sine inverse is talking just about these two so we're going to say sine inverse is going to give us an angle what this is asking is what angle on this interval is going to have a y coordinate of negative square root 3 over 2. if you want to write it like this that's totally fine as well that's the same thing sine of what angle has a y coordinate of negative square root 3 over 2. the only reason why i wanted you to see it this way is so that we don't accidentally go outside of the appropriate domain there so we need to be in quadrants 4 to 1 negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. so this says my y coordinate is negative square root of 2. sine relates angle to y coordinate on this part for an inverse so y is negative square root of three over two that's right there that's going to be negative pi over three remember it's negative here and that's exactly what this equals and this was negative pi over 6 and this was 3 pi over 4. so find your trig function first because it's going to give you a coordinate or a comparison coordinates then your inverse that's when you restrict your domain that's why it was a little more difficult in the last way we did it because you restrict your domain first here you just figure out the trig function restrict your domain last let's come back and deal with uh cotangent and cosecant and secant inverse and then we're gonna be good to go all right we're gonna deal with some of the well lesser used i would say uh intrigue inverse trig functions like cosecant inverse of whatever uh let's talk about what that even though it means but before we do something we're going to be using here really really important is that nicely cosecant inverse and sine inverse they have the same range domain for our root functions there are our normal sine and cosecant they create these inverses for us they have the same range for output now what that means is that we can use a very nice reciprocal to change cosecant into sine that's going to be very very useful for cosecant inverse and secant inverse notice again cosecant inverse has the same exact range as sine numbers and secant inverse has the same exact range as cosine inverse where the problems happen is cotangent inverse this is a different range than tangent inverse i'm going to show you how to deal with that so last example two examples that we do but for the most for most of them for cosine inverse secant inverse no problem set this equal to an angle and then switch it to cosine or sine respectively sine and cosine the reciprocal functions because these domains match up so well it's not bad to do we can't do that with cotangent very often but we will in the first example not the second so here's our thought process inverse functions give you angles that might be hard to do cosecant inverse of that looks like a bunch of junk equals an angle so what angle gives you that relationship of one over y might be difficult to deal with so let's write this as well the normal trig function now here's the magic happens if cosecant inverse of this one over y gives you theta this is only true if cosecant theta gives you negative 2 square root 3 over 3. because cosecant inverse has the same domain overall range but domain for where one-to-one functions came from and sine inverse we're allowed to use well this nice reciprocal because they do and we're not going to be switching outside of the quadrant that we're not supposed to be in cosecant theta equals negative two square root of three over three well then sine theta must be equal to the reciprocal of that and if we rationalize this gives us 3 3 cancels of 3 we get negative square root 3 over 2. wait a minute that's actually pretty easy to find sine of what angle gives me negative square root 3 over 2. now here's why it was so important that i made you recognize that these intervals are the same that the range or the domain of sine is the same as the domain of cos cosecant where we get our inverses from because now you'll know where to look because sine inverse is here to here and cosecant inverse was from here to here where it was defined then this now is found on that same interval are you seen are you seeing the point of why they had to be the same that way we'd say hey this is defined only from here here perfect sine inverse is the same thing let's use a reciprocal and now we know we're on that same interval so where is the y coordinate what angle gives us a y coordinate of negative square root 3 over 2 on the appropriate range for sine inverse well that is going to be let's see negative pi over three so cosecant inverse of this junk is negative pi over three you have to match up those domains so we're going to say yeah all right this is true this is true if then this has to be true cosecant theta equals that let's do a reciprocal and find it on the same exact domain that we're used to let's move on to secant inverse of negative 2 let's do the same thing inverse functions give you angles this is only true if this is true so secant inverse of negative two equals theta if you only have secant theta equals negative two well this is great because secant inverse has the same range as cosine inverse does that means that we can reciprocate it and look at the appropriate interval on our unit circle so secant inverse i'm sorry secant theta equals negative two then cosine theta equals negative one half let's reciprocate that that's negative two over one no problem because they're on the same range we can take a look at the cosine theta from zero to pi secant inverse zero pi cosine over certified and we're looking for an x coordinate remember cosine is talking about x here cosine of the x coordinate gives us this of negative one-half is um two pi over three so taking a look at it thought this is kind of hard this is a lot easier it's on the same interval let's just use that so cosine of theta equals negative one half says what angle on the appropriate domain is going to have an x coordinate of negative one half cosine is the x coordinate and that's two pi over three and that's exactly what that's going to be for you let's try a couple more and we're going to learn well what happens if if these these aren't a new circle use your calculator but not the way that you think so secant inverse of negative three inverses give you angles let's write that this is only true if secant theta equals negative three we go right hey secant inverse and cosine inverse are are defined in the same same domain there so let's let's reciprocate it if secant theta equals negative three cosine theta equals negative one third which go wait a minute i don't see an x coordinate of negative one third on the appropriate domain that that's a problem so what do you do well you see there most calculators some do most calculators don't have secant inverse on there so when you go to plug in ui i have cosine inverse well this will allow you to do that and so if we want to find theta remember that cosine theta equals negative one-third if and only if cosine inverse of negative one-third equals theta put your calculator in radians and press cosine inverse of negative 1 3 and that will give you a decimal approximation for this angle that's about 1.91 but it is radians make sure your calculator is in radians is going to give you out radians now how about cosecant inverse of negative 4 well we can start the same way that's going to be some sort of an angle so cosecant of that angle has to be negative 4. because cosecant inverse and sine inverse are defined in the same range and domain for sine and cosecant respectively let's find the reciprocal and say hey that's that's sine theta equals negative 1 4. no problem just reciprocate it but the problem is that between negative pi over 2 and pi over 2 i do not see a y coordinate of negative 1 4. well then we can do the same thing we did here so theta would equal sine inverse of negative 1 4. so this is a way that we can sort of get around the fact that some of our calculators won't do cosecant inverse to allow you to actually do it so sine inverse of negative 1 4 is going to give you about negative 0.25 this is exactly negative 0.25 but that's not what's talking about the angle is negative around negative 0.25 radians if you want a super shortcut look here and look there just reciprocate it and use the the appropriate reciprocal inverse function the only one that will not work with is with cotangent so i'm going to show you that one just a second all right let's do the last two examples cotangent is a bit tricky and the reason why it is is because cotangent does not really match up very well with the interval for tangent as far as our inverses are concerned now is there part of this that matches 0 to pi and negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 here's 0 to pi negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 yes in quadrant one if you are in quadrant one if this is going to give you some sort of an angle in quadrant one then you're fine and you can use tangent for this so for cotangent inverse of the square root of three call that the angle that it is this is only true [Music] if cotangent of theta equals square root 3. so we think okay that's positive where is cotangent positive well the same place tangent is positive in quadrants one and four that's the only place uh sorry one and three the only place tangent is positive and cotangent's positive well that's in quadrant number one so we're not going to use three we can't use three because cotangent inverse is not defined there tangent inverse is defined there it's just in quadrant number one and so we're thinking what angle is going to give me a x over y square root of three now if that's it's as difficult again i really don't can't think of that that way if you have this in quadrant one then you can do something like tangent of theta would be one over the square root of three and we could write tangent theta equals square root of three over three if we rationalize so if that's true and we're in quadrant one here that was quadrant one this is quadrant one they have the same interval as far as quadrant one is concerned you can do this if not then you can't so then we'd look at where would you get uh why compared to an x of square root of three or three well that's actually this might be even easier either way you go one over the square root of three would be taking one half divided by square root of three over two that's at pi over six this has to be pi over six so the only way that this actually works is if this is giving you an angle that's in quadrant one then use tangent so what if it's not what if this is not in quadrant one well then we have to find a trig function that's in the same interval as this is that's going to be cosine so let's take a look at cotangent inverse of negative 2 it's probably the most difficult problem we'll do here if we did this we said hey look inverse functions give you angles all right we're good with that this is true of cotangent theta equals negative 2. let's put this negative 2 over 1. now if that's true then this is going to give me an x over a y remember that cotangent is x over y why am i not dealing with this in terms of of tangent why can't i just do tangent into reciprocal here's the reason why where this gave you an angle in quadrant 1 this is going to give you an angle in quadrant 2. why quadrant 2 cotangent is only defined from 0 to pi so from this top half of your x y axis right there well if you have a negative 2 and a positive 1 that's here that as opposed to a positive 2 and negative 1 that's down there that's not the right quadrant we have to be from 0 to pi so negative 2 positive 1. remember that cotangent inverse is only defined from here to here you have to be somewhere on there because that's in quadrant 2 tangent does not work tangent inverse does not work you can't deal with it would have been fine if we were in quadrant one because it overlaps if it doesn't overlap you see that here it overlaps here and here that's not true we've got to use something else so our x is negative two our y is one we know that cotangent is x over y if we find our radius there or our hypotenuse that's one squared plus negative two squared that's going to be the square root of five remember to keep the positive there because i want to be in the same quadrant positive square root 5. now how in the world are we going to find an angle from that if we have to actually find this angle i i don't maybe have a cotangent inverse on my calculator if i did i'd be done right here i would just do it that'd be great uh this is not on our unit circle anywhere so cotangent inverse cotangent theta equals negative two there's nothing that's giving me a y an x over y of negative two that doesn't work i can't use tangent because it's not the right domain so what is what's the only trig function inverse that is in quadrant 2. it's got to be cosine so that's quadrant four to one that's quadrant four to one uh so is cosecant inverse and secant inverse cotangent inverse needs something that will work from zero to pi cosine inverse does that so we're gonna go for cosine inverse so cosine theta let's find cosine theta cosine would take x over r well if we um we don't need to rationalize if we take the inverse of both sides now that we'll let your they'll let you do it on your calculator you find cosine inverse of negative 2 over square root 5. it's about 2 2.68 radians and sure enough that is going to put it right where we want it to be so anyhow um but why do i say right where we want to be this is three point one four radians zero to pi positive about 3.14 radians so 2.68 is somewhere in that quadrant two where we thought it was and that's exactly the angle that we're dealing with i know that this is probably challenging um when you have cotangent in quadrant one use tangent that's fine when you have cotangent inverse that's not in quadrant one that's that's outside of that draw a triangle if it's not an unit circle and then you have to use cosine to deal with it because cotangent and cosine have the same exact domain for where we've got our one-to-one functions that also means that when you define this and find your angle you can use cosine inverse that's what we wanted to get to and that's a appropriate angle i know it's a long video i hope it made sense i've done a ton of examples so that i would actually teach you the ins and outs of this i don't want to give you just three or four because there's a there's a lot of differences in how we deal with some of these things you're seeing that right now that's about as much as i could possibly give you i think i've gone above and beyond and given you everything i possibly think of on how these functions and inverses interplay with one another i hope it's made sense next time what we're going to do is we're going to start talking about equations so i hope you're ready for it have a great day you
