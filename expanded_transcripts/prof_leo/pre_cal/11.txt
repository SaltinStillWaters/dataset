Transcript for: How to Graph Piecewise Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 12)
hi welcome to another video in the next few videos we're going to talk about graphing and in this and this class we talk about graphing an awful lot and so we're gonna get really good at that and how we start is basically understanding some of the ways that we graph so in the next few videos we're gonna talk about what piecewise functions are how to graph them what our basic graph shapes are kind of a library of functions idea and they have transform them so I move them up and down let's right stretch them compress them things like that and then we move forward we'll have a better understanding of like how graphs work in general for polynomials and rational functions it all starts with just some some key features of graphs one of them kind of a a little sidestep from normal graphing is something called a piecewise function so in this this video what I'm gonna intend to get you understand is personally what a piecewise function is how they work what the domain for piecewise functions are how to use them kind of the directions for the graph directions for how to use the function and then we're gonna review some of the kattegat align like what slope means what a parabola is what a cubic function would look like that way our library functions in the next video makes a little bit more sense so we're kind of refreshing our memories on on what these basic graph shapes are as we're doing some of these these piecewise functions so we're gonna jump right into it what I'm going to talk about is what a piecewise function is how to work with it and then how you graph them so what a piecewise function is a piecewise function of 1 it's a function which means that for every one input you get exactly one output that's key that's an important thing so how piecewise functions look is a little bit funny we see a function we have this little curly brackets and a it's a it's both of these things oh great so I'm just going to take numbers plug them into both of them no no don't no don't do that because if we take any sort of an input you plug it into both of these little pieces of your function piecewise functions it's going to give us two different outputs for most of our inputs that's a problem so every one of the piecewise functions I've given you right here is really not defined for you so what a piecewise function says is sure you got this thing as a function it's gonna give me one output for every input I'm going to give you directions on what to do but then also directions on how to use each piece of it so a piecewise function gives you a function in pieces you can only use one piece for certain sections or intervals of your x-axis that has to be defined for you don't just need to make it up so I'm going to tell you what these pieces are so here's the the domain for these functions it says this function is going to be X cubed that's the piece of it but you only use it for a little bit of this graph or some some interval of this this x-axis when your X's are less than 1 that's when you get to use X cubed for this function it's gonna say I also want to use 3x minus 2 it's going to use 3x minus 2 anytime your X's are greater than or equal to 1 this is sort of like our separating value on your x-axis this says for anything less than 1 strictly less than 1 you're going to use this piece this thing this function to define f of X for any value 1 or more so any x value that's greater than equal to 1 you're going to use this piece to define that function that has helped piecewise functions work it gives you the function in little pieces that are not the same piece the main thing here please don't ever take a value and plug in one value to both of these pieces what that's doing is that's breaking the fact that this thing is actually a function we need one output for every input so here's the what you do here's the when you do it this right here this is your domain this is this is where this function is defined more than that it tells you when to use each of these pieces let's try it we're going to plug in a couple of values I mean four values will do the same thing over here I'll give you some directions of the domain for a piecewise function we'll plug this in and then we're going to go back we're going to grab them and that's that's pretty much it so if we use this piece whenever X is less than one we use this piece of number X is greater than equal to one we should never ever have a time with these crossover graphically that means our graphs will never cross will never have the same piece same graph sorry never have two different graphs on the same interval of our x-axis how we use it practically to evaluate we just have to understand that these are the values that are our inputs we need to notice where they go and then plug them into one and only one piece of that function so let's look at F of negative 1 asks you look at the function f got it I want you to evaluate negative 1 you okay eeny meeny miny no no no don't do that we look at negative one and we say where does native one fit in our domain negative one fits in this part of our domain negative 1 is less than one fits that that direction that well this interval of your x axis so it says I'm gonna plug in negative 1 where it actually works I'm gonna plug it into just this piece it doesn't qualify here it's not fitting that condition doesn't fit this domain so we say they can plug this here that means that I would have negative 1 to the third power I'm using just this piece and we would get an output of negative 1 that means you had an input of negative 1 and you would output a negative 1 that's a point on this graph that needs to make sense to you when we graph this thing in them field a while we're gonna notice that that point is going to be on that graph how about F of 0 F of 0 says all right well look at your functions look at your function f got it plug in 0 that's your input okay how do I do that I use one of these pieces depending on where if it's my domain 0 is still in this interval of the x-axis less than 1 so I would still use just this top piece not both that means that I have 0 to the third power I plug in 0 I got out 0 that's another point on our graph how about 1 well let's skip that one let's get let's go to 3 so f of 3 evaluate the function for 3 here's our function f our input is 3 I'm gonna be using these two things to define my function but what my domain is is given over here so I'm gonna look at 3 and say is 3 on this interval of the x-axis is 3 in this domain no 3 is not freeze not less than 1 is 3 in this interval the x-axis 3 in this domain yeah 3 is greater than or equal to 1 its namely greater than 1 so it says you are defined this 3 is defined for this this domain this 3 says you would use this function which has this domain plug in 3 so when we have 3 times 3 minus 2 let's see 3 times 3 is 9 9 minus 2 is 7 we pointed in 3 we value it for 3 we got him out that is a point that is good beyond this function that needs to make sense notice how you're just taking one value finding out where it fits and plugging in to one of those pieces never ever vote well you know 101 doesn't one fit in both no it can't and you will never see an equal sign on more than one of these intervals you don't even have to have the equals it doesn't have to be a continuous crap this won't be it doesn't have to have an output I'm sorry it doesn't have to have every input on your x-axis that doesn't have to be the case there if it does though if it does have an this this interval that x-axis for which you have every single input you can't ever have an equal sign on both of those domains that would disqualify that from being a function that would say you can plug in one or value it for one and have more than one output that's a problem so when you see this F of one it's got a fit and only one spot so look at your function f plug in 1 no problem use these pieces but how you use them is your domain so it's a where's one fit is one less than one no no it can't be it will never ever be the case on a function where you will be able to plug in one value to two different pieces it won't happen so plugging in one says one is on the interval of X greater than or equal to one this is specifically equal to one that says oh hey I fit in this domain let's use that piece for which the domain is defined that'll be three times one minus two let's see three times so it's 3 minus 2 is 1 I evaluated one I got an output of 1 these are giving me points on my graph that is exactly how evaluation for piecewise functions work just figure out the domain well figure out where your input fits in your domain and use that piece of your function for which that that domain is defined next one obviously this is incomplete this is why I got three different pieces that define this particular function of F I have x squared I have two and have two x plus one and it has to be given to you what for what interval the x on the x axis that this piece of the focus is defined so basically what your domain is well let's say that x squared is defined any time X is less than zero that's an interval in your x axis mompos are you can you look at your x-axis right now you should be able to and say the interval of my x-axis or which this piece of the function is defined X is less than zero that's this entire interval of your x-axis it should be pretty clear right now that I'm looking here that means when we get to graphing we're going to look at this we're gonna make a little separator line and say this piece is on that interval and that's probably the best way that I know how to graph piecewise functions it's separating my x-axis into intervals for which my functions are to find my little piece of line and then graph in those pieces on those aerials alright moving on this says that you're gonna have the output of the function to be - anytime X is just equal to zero and you're gonna use the piece of the function 2x plus 1 anytime X is greater than zero notice real quick I only have one equals only one I'm using the entire x-axis this is less than zero equal to zero more than zero therefore I can only have one equals sign now could you have it like something kind of weird where you went from maybe negative 5 to negative 2 and they skipped a few points and then defined it again from like 7 to infinity sure and then you could use more than one equal sign but if you are having the same number you're saying I call it separated number boundry number whatever you want to do on your your x-axis if you have the same number here you can't ever let one input give you more than one output just check for that make sure you're not plugging in one value to more than one piece that should never ever happen so let's see negative two this is look at your function plug in negative two and just see where it fits in your interval on the x-axis your domain maybe two fits let's see it's not equal to zero it's not more it's less than zero I'm going to use only this piece of the function for which this domain is defined and my input fits in that domain so I'm going to plug this in here it's a negative two squared is four that means I have a point negative two comma positive four that's going to be a point on this graph where the graph a little bit zero Wow zero doesn't fit in this interval it's not less than zero it's not graded zero it's equal to zero and this gets a little funky it says well what do i do have nothing to plug in for yeah exactly it's called a constant these what you plug in you're going to get out to well specifically says if you plug in zero you're going to get out - it's only defined for one input value this is defined for the input value of zero hey I haven't input value zero it means I get out - that's a point zero comma two for F of two it's not less than F - is not less than zero if it says my input values have to fall in one of these intervals in x-axis my domain says two is not less than zero tubes not equal to zero two is greater than zero so I would use just this piece this is two times two plus 1 that's five so we're going to plug in two or evaluate for two and then gave us an output value of five every input must have one output value that's what a function means right now we're going to transition to a little bit we're gonna graph these so what I'm going to talk about when we graph them so I'm going to talk about how our domain is always based on the x-axis well therefore our domain can separate our x-axis into intervals we kind of did that we were evaluating right we just said yeah that separates it a X denote my x-value an input can only fit in one of those intervals we're gonna do the same thing so we're going to say because this is the domain for that piece of the function and this is the domain for that piece of the function if we separate our x axis and say that function is only defined on that domain that interval this function is only defined on that domain that interval then we have a very clear marker on our graph for when we use one function first or the other one piece of the function versus the other so I show that to you right now I'm going to erase the our values we really don't need them all that much I want to keep that we'll keep it even so let's go ahead and erase those and what we're going to do is I'm going to show you the kind of Lenard way to graph a piecewise function so here's here's what I do here's how this much for us because their domain separates our x-axis domain is always an x-axis idea our domain shows us for what interval we use each of our pieces of our function so what I would like to do is I'll take our what I call a boundary number or separating value and I go to my x-axis something alright this is defined for less than this value this function is defined for this piece of functions of for greater than that value but they have the same value so I'm gonna go to every single one of my values that's given in my domain my domain from each of these pieces I'm gonna put a little vertical line so I'm gonna look at 1 1 is the only value on our on each of these these domains for our pieces so I'm gonna go to 1 when we all right well 1 has this kind of this idea of separation it's a boundary for which these pieces are defined now here's the next thing I'm gonna do I'm gonna look at that and I'm gonna understand that what that does is practically it's not in your graph and please please don't get this confused with like a vertical asymptote idea it's not a vertical asymptote and that's the same sort of a line that we use for her glasses oh so I understand that but in the context of what we're doing we don't have a vertical asymptote here that comes later we will talk about them give you everything a vertical asymptote is and show you how to use them but all this does practically it separates your x-axis and it says that your pieces of your graph will be defined on either this part or this part but never both you will never ever have a piecewise function where you have two different graphs on the same interval of your x-axis that's got to make sense we know that domain says for all of these inputs I'm getting one specific output that's all that that says you can't ever have an interval where you have two outputs that means your graphs can't cross your graphs can't overlap at all so we're going to look at this guy right 4x is less than 1 X is less than 1 on this interval not up to the y-axis up to the dotted line up to this x equals 1 up to that boundary line I'm gonna have X cubed so I'm gonna make a little little mark over here that up to here I'm gonna have X cubed the graph of x cubed is only on that interval of x-axis all the way going to negative video on the right hand side so 4 X is greater than or equal to 1 so about this one we're going to have 3 X minus 2 so what we're doing is we're taking our domain or separate our x axis into intervals of that domain and we're understanding that these pieces will fall into one or the other interval just follow the directions so this is 4 X is less than 1 here's an X cube 4 edges greater than equal 1 using 3x minus 2 now the next thing that we're gonna do we're gonna review what in the world lines and cubics look like what in the world quadratics and constants and lines look like the same thing to two lines over here so when we were doing this what I always do I always graph the left interval first oh well I always grab the side of all of this the side of my boundary line where my y-axis is so my y-axis is on the left hand side I'm gonna graph this interval first I'm gonna graph this interval so I'm going to look at X cubed what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna understand what X cubed looks like I'm not plugging in points if I don't have to there's only pretty much two values of one value I'm going to plug in for two different functions I'm going to plug in my boundary line number so my one I'm gonna plug that in I'm gonna understand what less than what greater than equal to actually mean there and that's the only value no I'm not plugging a whole bunch of points I'm basically understanding what X cubed is though X cubed is this X curve graph looks like this and it has a few key points to it right now I'm trying to teach two things number one is how to graph a piecewise functions but number two is that when you're graphing some of these basic shapes it really helps to have an understanding of what X cube looks like what the execute has three key points on it one one zero zero and negative one negative one that stems from being an odd function we talked about odd functions this is kind of revolve a ball around or has symmetry about the origin that 1 1 and negative 1 negative 1 have opposite inputs and therefore opposite outputs so when we graph that and we say alright X cubed looks like this it has some key points 1 1 0 0 negative 1 negative 1 yes and plug those in I could plug in zero zero I could plug in negative one and get up negative one I could plug in one whoa hang on I can plug in one and I could get out positive one there's a mistake on the on the board right now but I'm going to fix it just a second so this is the way my graph X cube looks X cube is only defined for this interval of our x-axis it's an s-curve it's gonna say all right well I'm gonna leave my origin on my left hand side of the y-axis I'm gonna drop to negative infinity eventually I'm gonna go all the way up to this point but I cannot cross it I can't let it go into the interval for which three X minus 2's define that wouldn't break the fact that this is a function you can have the only one piece of the graph on one in earlier function otherwise you have two outputs running but that's a big problem now the next problem what about that point this is a mistake I was talking on this is wrong why why is that wrong because wow this says you can go up to 1 it says you can't include the 1 so here's the deal whenever you don't have an equal sign you must not include that specific point now please don't say well I can only go up to 0 no no you can get all the way up into almost 1 you can plug in point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine if you plug that in cubed you're gonna get almost one but it's not quite there for that reason what we do if you do not have the equal sign do not include this value as an endpoint how do we show that you're just gonna say all right well you know what seven plug in 1 1 cubed is one that gives us a almost the point 1 1 but we're going to show this as an open circle saying that just that's a civic point is missing you need to remember this from some of our previous videos that we just did that when I don't have the equals sign I just don't include the point how we don't include the point is with an open circle like the parenthesis idea is all the way up - it just does include that point it's missing one point so long sort of a really short hopefully is find your domain separate your x-axis identify what piece goes in what and graph the piece if you don't have an equal sign use an open circle for the endpoint so here I said okay X cubed I understand what that looks like I understand my three key points negative 1 negative 1 0 0 1 1 so I put that on my graph and then say all right I'm gonna look at my boundary line I'm gonna look at that value on my x-axis and say ok one should not be included so this point is an open circle that needs to make sense before we go any further next I'm gonna look at 3x minus 2 now the reason why I do this side the y-axis side of my boundary line is because it's a little bit easier for me I have a y-intercept that's very easy to find I don't have that on the right hand side and frankly it doesn't matter would you graph first on the right hand side I think it's a little more difficult because there's no y axis there's no y intercept over there so here's what we do what we do is we take our boundary number or separating number that one and we plug it in so exam right well since this piece is defined for this interval I'm gonna plug in where I start oh my god I plug in 1 3 times 1 is 3 minus 2 is 1 so if I find F of 1 that says all right this is giving me out the point 1 comma 1 Kelvin what wait a minute that's that's interesting that's this value right there so so wait a second this cubic was missing that point this value to this graph has that point so we're gonna graph this in just a second we're gonna graph it and what we're going to do is we're going to say I'll write the black line right here hoping to the colors the black line is X cubed the purple line of about to grab says this point starts right there it starts there notice how this does not fail to be a function in that there's not two points for that one input value of 1 this value 1 is not defined for X cubed there's a hole this this value is defined for 3 X minus 2 it doesn't a hole it's not break in fact it's a function because X cubed does not have an output for that they've won this does have an output for the infant value one so happen city thinks in that pool that's pretty that's pretty neat kind of a cool little graph that we did kind of made it up in my head but works pretty well now for the rest of it since we have now a starting point we know that our output value is actually on that set that boundary line says this is defined for once plug in one I did three times one is three three months two is one okay here's the plug didn't one got out one right there now what is that what is three X minus two well it's not a cubic it's a line lines have a starting point we've got it they also have a slope like three over one so it says from that point from that one starting spot on your boundary line not before it don't go to the y-axis don't go to a y-intercept of negative two what if you went to a y-intercept of negative two and started graphing this you're gonna have a whole bunch of points right here for which you are breaking the rules of your domain since it's not even this is not defined on the side you can't go till the left of that boundary that's why I choose to graph the y intercept the y-axis side first they go right I cannot cross that I cannot I can't touch that this is the only this is the boundary there's the only place where my functions are fine I've done that I've plugged in the boundary number plug in one I got out one now let me use the fact that this has a slope of three to go from that boundary sale right how slopes work is we go up three one two three we go to the right one because the slope is 3 over 1 and this gives us some line so we're going to graph that piece of the function on this interval of x axis for which we're to define the domain that's the way that this graph it almost looks like a cubic but it's it's not this is a straight line that cubic would have gone very steeply through here this is the way that piecewise functions are graphed what you do is you look at your domain you separate your domain into an interval I call it a boundary number of separating number no problem this tells you what intervals axis for which these pieces are fine don't break the rule just make sure that we are understanding where that separator is we're understanding for where our pieces work on the intervals for which we just have a define domain let me graph okay this for 100 this for another interval you can do it by plugging in points but again my secondary like motive for teaching you this is to understand what cubics look like to understand what lines are with slopes and to understand these things do not cross over the lesson the last thing I want to mention here is that not all of your piecewise functions look like this this is kind of a special case where one interval we had this cubic that left an open circle an open point of missing value this one filled it in there's kind of a cool little graph that's not going to happen on this we're going to look notice how with piecewise functions often we get these jumps where we don't have a continuous function so I'm gonna talk about continuity here real fast and then we'll move on so we're not gonna have a continuous function you have this I'm sorry I'll talk about after we do this in only one so we're not gonna have a continuous function we're gonna have a little gap here so I'm gonna show you how to deal with that so start now we look at our function we got right here's a piecewise function we basically have three pieces and three different domains it says for what interval in the x-axis these particular pieces are defined so I'm gonna go to my separating value of let's separate these well what's the kind of boundary for when we use these particular pieces that's zero well x equals zero that's the y-axis so we're gonna go to the y-axis and say alright at x equals 0 that is my boundary to the left I'm going to be using a certain function to the right I'm going to use in a certain function add it I'm gonna be use of certain function so to the left of 0 this is say for grid 0 and use this piece for equal to 0 use this piece for less than 0 so on our x-axis our domain always separates our excess into little intervals says for anything less than 0 to this side I'm going to use x squared for anything at 0 I'm going to use 2 for anything greater than zero I'm going to use two x plus one that's exactly what the domain for a piecewise function does separate your x axis into little intervals on which you're gonna grab specific pieces of your function so let's do it you know probably the easiest one to do right now is at the x equals zero so at x equals zero says hey on on x equals zero on that line on the y axis you're just gonna have an output value of two so we're gonna go to two all right output value to done that is the point if you remember I erased it but it said is right there it says when you plug in zero you got out two Beyblader we got a two that's all that means the only point on the y axis needs to be an output of two plug in zero you get out too what that means is that for this function and this function when I get to my boundary line I'm going to use an open circle signifying that I don't have an output there the output for zero is two but it's gonna go right up to them output about you that we're missing so x squared do you remember what expert looks like do you remember that it's a parabola crowd let's look like this and they have some key points they do have zero zero but because if I plug in zero zero squared zero they have 1 1 but plug in 1 1 squared is 1 they have negative 1 negative positive 1 I plug in negative 1 squared I get positive 1 it's an even function and we need to know what even functions mean they have symmetry about the y-axis so I'm going to look at this and go all right I'm gonna graph x squared but I'm only going to graph it up until this boundary so I'm gonna be able to graph the 0 0 I'm gonna be able to graph the negative 1 positive 1 here's a negative 1 positive 1 here 0 0 my parabola looks like well it can't cross over to here I used 2 X plus 1 over there so for my parabola I'm gonna graph it just like a parabola always is and it's gonna stop right at our boundary so our parabola looks like like that I've graphed x squared I've graphed a parabola but only done it and the interval for which to find only on that particular domain all the way up until our boundary you should see the mistake right now man I'm really hoping you see the mistake right now right now is this a function right now if you look at it and go hey is it a function up until this boundary yep yeah for all these input values of X I have one specific output you can plug in negative 2 and negative whatever and you can get these output values mine's a little bit too steep here but at 0 this is a problem so we go back to when I talked over here for every single boundary that does not have an equals you must not have a solid circle so what this says is it you're gonna graph a parabola yeah you're gonna graph it on this interval no problem but when you get to zero you need not include it so I've graphed my parabola I'm almost able when I get to zero I'm going to not include that as an alpha value it's not there now you can plug in negative zero point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one and you can square it to be really really close to zero it's going right there but we're just missing that output value that has to be there in your head right now that makes sense so we alright I've graphed x squared I've graphed it to my boundary I am not including that end point because it's not included be like a parentheses that end point is not included there to zero or taken care of that where that point is what that output is for that value of zero now the last one I'm gonna graph 2x plus 1 for everything greater than zero on this interval x axis for which this function is to find them a domain I'm gonna grab this so how to do it well what I told you is plug in the value of your separation or your boundary number for your domain so I'm gonna I'm gonna plug in 0 well what about that you can plug in 0 well we're gonna outsmart this thing we're gonna plug in 0 to this two times zero plus one we're going to get one so if I plug in zero to this function which I know that I can't do I'm gonna get a value of one here's what that means that gives you a place to start it just says just don't include the actual output value what I plug it in but then when you say alright I would I would normally if this was here if that was there you'd be here at zero one obviously you'd be there since it's not included we're saying yeah I would start there but I'm just gonna dis include that little end point just give it an open circle and say my line is gonna start just after that point not at one it's still you plug in zero you're just not including the end point kind of like a parentheses if you said on a number line here's 5 to infinity let's say well I want to I want to show this interval of my x-axis I'm making up the 5 is not coming from anywhere well would you start at 6 would you say oh this goes from 6 to infinity no no that wouldn't be right you'd say I'd start at 5 to infinity but I can't use a bracket because the 5 is not included this says oh I would use these parentheses I used kind of this open idea that's what that open circle says it says I want to I want to make sure that my x axis for greater than 0 is defined but greater than 0 is a parentheses idea greater than 0 is an open idea written 0 is a yeah you're just missing the endpoint just don't include the endpoint use no it's perfect so for here I'd say up to 0 double to the endpoint at 0 I'm including the point after 0 don't for the endpoint but I still basically plug in 0 so that's what I'm starting at 0 1 now we hadn't understand hopefully that that's a slope the slope is 2 over 1 so from that point I would go up 2 over 1 that point is there on that value of 1 I am certainly defined everywhere after that open circle undefined on my interval so the only place we got a really worried about is the values that are our boundary lines are they included or not in this case because I don't have an equals right here I cannot include the endpoint or that value that's on my boundary line on my separation value oh that makes sense I hope you're understanding or that I've taught you well enough that our domain for our pieces show you intervals in the x axis what we do is we graph the pieces on those intervals make sure that it fits make sure that if you have no equal sign you just have an open circle on boundaries if we have no equal sign we just have an open circle on that boundary equal side give us building points sometimes we have these values these lines that are these are functions that work together and give us what's called a continuous function this is a continuous function what's continuous mean continuous means that for your interval you can put your pencil on your graph and you can graph the whole thing without picking it up that's a really loose way to say continuous alright can i graph this whole graph without picking it up the one single missing point here is filled in by that graph I can graph that whole function without thinking of a pencil can I do that here let's see I go this way oh man then I would jump to here fill that out jump back down to here and finish my function this is not continuous notice how the piece that or the the point that's defined is not in this circle even if it was it would fail to be continuous because that has an open circle and it's not you're not able to to graph this without picking your pencil off the paper that's one way to think about continuity alright the last one now there's obviously something missing I'm missing the directions here so let me go ahead and make them up let's go let's say that this is define from negative 4 to negative 2 and this piece is defined from negative 2 onward I'm not going to ask you to plug in value so we're evaluate but you should be able to do that right now you should be able to say all right if I'm plugging some values I would take them and find where they fit in my domain and use the piece for which the domain is define what I'm asking to do here is just graph it so let's take a look at it so though the lamp thing I don't know what am I thinking right now what I'm thinking about is I'm going to look at my boundary values for each section of my my domain for each of these these pieces I want to put a vertical dotted line saying this is the boundary for the interval my function that piece is going to fit on these interval for which I'm now kind of deleting a dominating my intervals on my x-axis I'm gonna say where the function fits that's I'm going to do so my first general my first piece X plus 3 this is defined on the x-axis from negative 4 to negative 2 so I'm going to go to those boundaries here's a negative 4 here's negative 2 I'm going to put a vertical dotted line so I looked at I said this piece has this four domain our domain always separates our x-axis in the intervals so the interval is negative 4 to negative 2 and I know that X plus 3 it's going to fit in that particular interval now the next interval well because this has the same boundary number I'm going to say that from everything from negative 2 onward X is greater than that I'm going to be using negative 2x plus 3 so from here onward that's this piece of our function notice something negative 2 negative 2 this one doesn't have an equals that one does isn't going to be continuous I don't know we'll see when we graph it if we have to jump somewhere then it's not continuous it fills in the whole than it is one more thing I don't have to have a piecewise function that has this number the same as this I can do some weird things I can do things like go from negative 4 to negative 2 and then what if this was 2 what if that wasn't there well then I wouldn't have anything defined it would say there's no no piece for this interval or function I can now have a boundary of two and then go on to another value or go to infinity it doesn't really have to have the same numbers as a boundary this one happens to and most of them do but I just want to make sure that you understand that you don't have to have the same number here here so what we looked at we said our domain is this for these pieces we've defined our x axis as having those particular intervals for which are our pieces are defined have a domain now what we're going to do is we're going to say we're going to graph well I'm gonna graph the the function that has the y axis first it's a little bit easier for me to do that so I'm looking at this interval and saying this interval right here has my y-axis I'm going to use that because it's easy to find a y-intercept it's easy to go ahead and graph this function so I'm gonna go alright what's my y-intercept I'm gonna plug in 0 I'm gonna understand that's a line this has a slope of negative 2 so if I have a slope of negative 2 and I plug in 0 or we understand slope intercept form this has a y-intercept of negative notice how that is certainly a point it's not an open circle it's clearly in the defined domain of that function its output is negative 3 then I'm going to think all right it also has a slope of negative 2 which means that I would go down 2 and write 1 not left one it's always slope means a positive goes up negative goes down your run so that's 2 over 1 it says you're gonna go to the right one so let's see down to write one that gives us our lying but we want to be a little bit more specific we don't want to just graph this thing go all right and up about here on my daughter's line I'm gonna do one more thing so I know what I cross the y-axis I know where my next point is but I'm also going to take my boundary and I'm gonna plug this in a separate value I'm gonna plug it in here it says it's defined even if it wasn't guys if it wasn't defined I would still plug in negative 2 so let's pretend about this for a second let's say it's equal you're going to plug in negative 2 so f of F of negative 2 let's see negative 2 times negative 2 minus 3 so I'm taking my lay into my boundary by separating value I'm plugging into this piece no matter what I would do this so negative 2 into here maybe 2 times 2 is a state that's positive for positive 4 minus 3 is 1 negative 2 comma 1 now I told you that no matter what we would plug that in so please watch her let's say that this was not equal but sin that was not equal I would do exactly the same thing I take the negative 2 I would plug it into this piece I know it's not going to exist and not have enough but at that value I know that I know that this would be a point where I'd be missing well a but would be missing the point don't miss the point so if I plug in negative 2 even if there's not an equal sign that said my output would be 1 but now it's missing we'd still put that open circle it would say that if that was included I'd have that value since it's not included I just I'm missing the point but this line would still do this says this graph this piece is defined for this interval from negative 2 onward it just if I don't have the equals I would not define the output but use it use where the output would be to give yourself an open circle to say at the boundary I'm just I'm just not including the point I'm missing the endpoint that's how to use that so we graph the y intercept we've graphed our slope we plug in the value this separation this boundary value or our domain even though it wasn't even there you still plug it in and you say I'm just not include I'm should have an open circle instead of a solid circle now do we have to actually have an equal sign there if you don't and if I if I left it like this I would have this that's the X plus 3 it would look like like that I would just have this this line and then I have no end point there now if I do you have an endpoint that just says that all right I have an actual value there and you're gonna fill it in that's the only difference there so so again people sign you got an endpoint no equal sign you still use the value you still plug it in you still get the same exact value for an output you just show that you don't include it with no but circle no equals open circle equals close it in and now we're gonna go and graph the other interval that says from negative 4 negative 2 I've got a line you know what we can just plug these values in I'm never gonna make it to my y-axis this is only fine for this little interval so I'm going to take negative 4 I know it's a line negative for plugged in or it evaluated it's going to give us negative 4 plus 3 that's negative 1 in your head you need to be thinking that because that's equal this value I can actually have an output at negative 4 negative 1 so negative 4 negative 1 as a solid closed point that exists on the domain that means that point exists and has an output that we have defined how about negative 2 this is what I don't know that can actually include it I know but plug it in anyway so I'll write hat negative 2 if I plug this in negative 2 plus 3 is 1 that means that my output value would be negative 2 1 so I'm gonna use that I'm gonna say here's negative 2 here's the value 1 but wait up with is over there's already point there can I put a point on a point no no no you can't for that reason we'd say oh hey that's why that was open that's like a little open circle so what the if I erase this what this graph would do is this would say I have an open circle this function would go from here to here in fact if I plug in negative 3 you get 0 you can see that that's true but if I plugged in negative 2 for this particular function this would say you plug in negative 2 it's going to give you an open circle it was already previously filled in with this output that's the way this graph would look I hope that I've explained piecewise functions to you and how you approach him how you approach them is you look at your domain your domain tells you when to use each piece of the function when you're when you're evaluating values it also tells you the intervals on your x-axis for what your piece is defined and so when we look at it your domain breaks up your x-axis it shows you when you use each individual piece plug in or evaluate your boundary markers your boundary values you're separating numbers what do you want to call them plug them in if you don't have an equals you do not include the end point it's just an open circle if you do have an equals you have a closed circle put them together we can have continuous functions these two are continuous functions we can have discontinuous functions so that doesn't have continuity to it hope it makes sense practice a whole bunch of them and then we'll move on we'll talk about well our library of functions we've kind of practiced what quadratics are before those are the power twos cubics power threes and practice lines so we'll look at a few more functions next time in certain memorizing these have a good day you
