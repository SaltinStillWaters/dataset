Transcript for: Properties of Functions - Even vs Odd (Precalculus - College Algebra 8)
hey welcome to another video so we're going to continue talking about some features and prop racism functions and the next thing we're going to do is we're going to talk about even an odd and often misunderstood thing or property of functions that students really want to get wrong because they have a misinterpretation of what even versus odd means hence it's right in the root of the word even odd so we'll talk about exactly what even and odd means how to look at it graphically what that translates to mounds of great Glee and then how to check whether it functions even versus odd I'll give you a very very quick way to do this so number one thing that when we talk about even versus odd of course some numbers pop in our head we know even numbers or numbers like 2 4 6 8 10 odd numbers are 1 3 5 7 9 and so oftentimes what students will do when they hear the word even versus odd is think that that relationship between even numbers and odd numbers is always what determines of functions even this oddness or neither nests and that's not true so I'm going to give you the formal definition of what even odd actually mean then we'll talk about algebraically how to deal with it so what an even function looks like graphically and then algebraically after that when we say that a function is even its graph is going to have a certain property to it the graph of an even function is going to be symmetric like if you fold it down the y-axis and fold it onto itself it would be a mirror image perfectly well toggle that means House of bread from in just a second but graphically that's what an even function would do it's going to have a mirror image on write down where that axis symmetry look that y-axis where if you fold it over and make a perfect mirror image and you can probably look at the graphs behind me and determine which one is even and which ones are odd or not what odd means a little bit more difficult odd is this symmetry about the origin so I rotate the graph 180 degrees it's going to give you this thing that was kind of cool if I rotate the graph 180 degrees gonna give the same exact picture that's what odd means for for the graph of a function every odd function will have that property where if we rotate 180 degrees it's gonna be symmetric so looking very quickly we're gonna do a couple things here we're gonna look at the graphs and determine even versus odd we'll also talk about domain and range so you don't forget it well even are there any graphs up here there even well yes this graph is even if I fold this across the y-axis I'm trying my best to make this symmetrical about the why this has symmetry to it this is an even function because we have this this idea of symmetry about the y-axis if I fold it across it match up do we have any odd functions well let's look at the next one is this even well no if I fold this across the y-axis it's not gonna match up but if I rotate it 180 degrees about the origin it would still have the same exact picture to it the same exact graph this is an even function that's giving us this bigger graph this is an odd function that see this this particular graph now notice something you maybe you had some trig before but if we start thinking oh well odd just means the power of the function or something like that that's a trigonometric function if I use PI or I manipulate a little bit but this is based on a trigonometric function its sine of X sort of I would use negative PI and PI but the point is that the exponent itself has very little to do with actually being even or odd in power functions it does single term functions the power will tell you whether the function is even or odd that is true but if I have polynomials we really lose that also functions that don't even have exponents can still be even versus odd so please don't let that misconception probably the biggest one is even an odd that misconception that oh the excellence what tells me that it's even or odd not necessarily so cosine of X is an even function but it doesn't have an exponent at all we need to get away from that we need to understand the definitions of what what these things mean even means as far as its graph is concerned that it has symmetry about the y I'd means as far as this graph is concerned as symmetry about the origin that needs to be in your head right now so even yes even no but it is odd if I rotate 180 degrees about the origin or hath cemetery about the origin that's a lot of function you know what let's skip this one for a second let's look at this one is that even I think in your head right now is that even if I fold this across the wax it doesn't match up no no if I fold it across the y axis and the x axis or rotate 180 degrees is in the same picture yes that right there is an odd function and so you heard me mention something this is this double sort of symmetry if I reflected one piece across the Y and then reflect it across the X so all you visual type people you could probably see that right now can you see it right they might fold this and then fold it again it would give me the same picture same thing here if I reflected this about the Y and then about the x axis it's gonna give me the same exact picture down here that is another way we can think of rotating 180 degrees about the origin this definitely has symmetry about the origin so symmetry about the y even symmetry about the origin odd symmetry about the origin odd symmetry about the y no symmetry about the origin if I reflect it twice does it make the same picture or rotate 180 no that would be neither so if we want to write this stuff down this is an even function both of these are odd and this is neither a lot of graphs are neither even nor odd I don't wanna say most of them but lots of graphs so have this feature the features as far as being having any sort of symmetry there and that's okay we're just trying to have classify this and we're going with it so you know is that when we get to graphing polynomials and especially rational functions that even versus odd is going to tell us a whole lot about how they look in a neighborhood of points so how they behave with asymptotes how they behave around X intercepts has to do with multiplicity and that's an even versus an odd idea so getting a picture what these looks like incredibly important that's why we're studying them now before we go back and I'm a top talk about the algebraic manipulation of this and just saying but before we do that I want to make certain that you understand domain so it so stick with me here let's just go through these really quickly do you remember that the domain is the section or interval of the x axis of their graph covers and the range isn't section or interval the wax or graph covers so let's run through the main real fast domain here would be from negative 4 to 4 including the endpoints range would be from 0 to 3 including the endpoints here domain is from the entirety of the x axis it will eventually cover that negative thing to infinity a range even though we have a couple points here our range will eventually cover the entire y axis this graph goes down forever it will cover the entire y axis domain would be all real numbers range of the all real numbers here domain this will eventually cover the entire x axis domains or members range is from oh not the whole y axis but only from 0 and up but not including the 0 we have parenthesis 0 to infinity here our domain is awkward man what can't we get out if I look at the x axis only I can cover everything past 0 I can cover everything up to 0 but 0 itself has no output remember the domain is all the values of x that give us a valid defined real number output 0 doesn't have that I would have to exclude 0 here interval notation negative a to 0 and then 0 to infinity with with a union between or to say X cannot equal 0 and that's that be fine same exact thing happens on the range I don't cover the whole y axis I cover everything from 0 down everything from 0 up but not 0 itself so I'd exclude 0 in the same exact fashion I hope that makes sense I just want to refresh your memory because domain you get lost when we don't really practice it now because I mentioned that even is a cemetery about the wine odd the graph will have symmetry about the origin sometimes we don't have a graph to look at and I want to be a little bit more specific on what happens with even versus odd because that is a definition but not the only one that we have this is a great definition for grass oh yeah even wood all over have symmetry about it now y-axis odd would rotate 180 or double flip around x and y if you want to call that it has symmetry about the origin but I want you to look at what happens to the inputs versus the outputs and don't give us a new definition for this this is more important so really focus on this if we look at an even graph what happens to the outputs when I plug in opposite inputs and think about how this would cause symmetry here if I plug in or look at my inputs for and the opposite negative for what would have to happen to keep my graph symmetrical about the Y well what would happen to happen is if I plug in let's say for you guys negative 1 and 1 and I want symmetry about the y-axis I want to look for even functions but I plug in 1 negative 1 and positive 1 my outputs would have to be exactly the same if I plugged in negative 4 and positive 4 my outputs would have to be the same no matter where they're both above or both below here's what even really does even functions take opposite inputs and give you equal outputs they give you the same output they'd say okay take an opposite take two opposite numbers so 3 and negative 3 and 3 or negative 4 and 4 and they even 101 or whatever you have and whatever my opposite inputs are they would have the same output are you see you have to see how that would create symmetry about the y-axis that would say yep my outputs are the same when my inputs are opposite that's what even functions really do it says if I plug in if I remember to put my sign correctly if I plug in opposite inputs they have the same output opposite inputs they have the same that's 2 I will put it that is what even functions do now mathematically here's how it looks it says if I plug in man I hope you get this if I plug in opposite inputs notice how this is opposite inputs it says 3 up negative 3 this is negative 5 over negative negative 5 opposite negative 5 that would be positive 5 whatever X is these are giving you opposite inputs and says for even functions if you have opposite inputs you will have equal outputs that is what defines an even function says if I'm plugging in two numbers which are opposites my outputs will still be the same are you seeing how that would give you symmetry opposite inputs same outputs that's how we check so basically what we're going to be doing is you're saying if I take a negative x it's the reason why we we started evaluating like several videos ago like can you plug in five can you plug in negative x completing X plus one why why why would we try to negative x that's how we show even functions and mod functions so with even functions the graphs will be symmetric about the Y but what that means for us is that if I take opposite inputs now I have to have the same output out opposite inputs will still yield equal outputs now odd is different odd says if I want to be odd or symmetric about the origin I want to be able to plug in opposite inputs but get opposite outputs so plug in one and negative one and get out five and negative five I'm saying I want to be able to plug in two and negative two and get out one and negative one say I want to be able to plug in opposite inputs and get opposite outputs out that would give us this ability to rotate and have the same exact picture one of the 180 degrees or about people words that's what's happening here if I take positive two and negative two I'm getting opposite outputs one negative one every single odd function will have that feature now how does it how's that look mathematically well if we have symmetry about the origin if we're talking about odd this says if I plug in opposite inputs notice these are opposite inputs then well the outputs would be opposite as well so says take your take your input values plug them into your function these things will not be equal that would be even if I take out opposite inputs and I get the same output I'm getting symmetry about the y-axis if I take opposite inputs I get opposite outputs I'm taking opposite values in I'm getting opposite values out no matter how you cut it that would be an odd function this is what defines odd so it all comes down to your understanding of what even means and how that relates to it mathematically you have to get it if even means symmetry about the y that requires you to be able to take opposite inputs and get on the same output opposite inputs same output equal odd says I'm requiring you to take opposite inputs and get opposite outlets here's opposite inputs and they're opposite outputs this is exactly how we check algebraically to see whether it functions even odd certainly surprisingly to some of you it's not about the powers this definition works for for every function that we would check for even versus odd absolute values those don't really have exponents in them but there you do you have a power one if you wanted absolute value X that that V that we get for an absolute value that's an even function it has nothing to do with an exponent sine cosine tangent those things we can check whether the even odd or neither by taking these and a certain interval of numbers so we'll be doing that in just a moment erase these functions at this point you need to really have in your head two things number one how to identify even and odd versus the graph whether it's cemetery about the why cemetery about the origin or neither and then the idea that even means opposite inputs same output odd means opposite inputs opposite outputs and that's going to really drive what we do it in just a little bit so stick around be right back okay little mistake there what I want to mention is that when we have F of negative x we plug in an opposite inputs I had this sign wrong this sign should be over here that should be an opposite output so this says hey if I take opposite inputs my outputs are also opposite sorry about that I want to make sure that that is clear the sign is gonna be wrong use a little bit but this is what you need to know I need to make certain that so that's clear for you so odd says if I plug in opposite inputs I've got opposite outputs this is the output of the function is that the function they would be opposite values so that's what odd means mathematically all right so we're ready to see whether these functions are even odd or neither and instead of grafton because it takes a whole lot of work we're gonna use the definitions of what even and odd actually mean so even means if I plug in opposite inputs I'm gonna have the same output all it means if I plug in opposite inputs I'm gonna opposite outputs that would give a century about the Y and the origin respectively so one way to do this it's not by looking at the expo all the time at least this down a really bad path there's some times I'm going to show you very quickly how to do it something very similar to that by looking at excellence and changing certain parts of it but in general one idea that to find this without graphing it is to just evaluate it so if we evaluate our function from negative X and we get exactly the same thing so basically we plug in negative x and see we the same function back if that's true if we plug in negative x at night for negative x and the thing we got out here is exactly the same thing that we started with it's what you're starting with then we have an even function since you plugged in opposite values in general not for just one point and it gave you opposite but it's the same outputs they gave you equal outputs that's even for odd we could do the same thing so if we plug in negative x to our function and we get out the same thing we started with but with a negative sign or every sign is opposite that would be odd so in general we're going to evaluate for negative x and see what happens so you can have maybe a guess at what goes on some of these you know well every every powers even it's probably even that's true sometimes you can do that every power saw it's probably odd no it's not that's not odd there's even an odd ones that one the idea isn't just about exponents the idea is what happens my plug in opposite inputs so I'm going to show you how to do that with these six examples just walk through them and true we're looking for I'm also going to give you kind of a shortcut here mathematically what we're doing when we have value for negative x is we're plugging in an opposite input to our original function we're saying imagine taking positive numbers or plug in all days or negative numbers and the hub solute negatives positives and seeing what that gives us case-by-case so but for all inputs if I do that man our knowledge of compositions or of evaluating functions comes into play we've already done this we say how do you evaluate well you say I want to replace the X with something I want to create a blank space I want to plug that negative X in there for that blank space what is going to happen when you have even exponents well your powers are the powers are going to change the signs are going to cheat the signs are going to be positive so if we have these positive even exponents and we start plugging in negative numbers it's going to always give us positive out so for every positive whole number even power we're always going to be getting a positive numbers out so negative x to the fourth power has to give you positive x to the fourth our sign is not going to change our minds doesn't gonna change negative x to the second power is positive x squared notice how what we got out is exactly the same thing as what we started with so this says you plug in opposite inputs you're getting the same exact outlets out no matter no matter what input that is that right there is the definition of even it says that nothing changes when you plug in a negative X you evaluate that nothing changes you have an even function now let's try G of X when we look at that ago right now you know what we know what's do we know that in order to test whether this is even odd or neither we start by evaluating native X you start by plugging in a negative or an opposite number and seeing if we have the same outputs or ops outputs so we're gonna do this you know all right well when we evaluate things we always give our self some blank spaces and then we plug in whatever value is here so this is replace your X with negative x no problem there's negative x here's negative actually already looked at compositions well with our power 2 we know that that even powers maintenance positives all the time they maintain positivity so we would have an x squared minus 1 our denominator has not changed but our numerator there's no even power here it's an odd part power one well odds maintain silence so that would be a negative x over positive x squared minus one well for me right in just a little bit I could write that negative in front that is saying hey look yeah the same thing as you started with but with the negative front that's this case it says you ended with the same thing Hey look you put the negative X we're looking at negative x you got the same exact thing but with a native front same exact things are started with the native front this is what God looks like that's what God looks like so in general evens a little bit easier to find because nothing changes oh yeah nothing changes legs thing but odd is a little more difficult because you have to you have to find a function where if you factor a negative out you can get original function with a negative front that's what we're looking for let's talk about one more and I'll give you kind of a quick way to deal with it so H of negative x this is testing whether we have an even odd or neither function and so what this says is you're gonna replace your x value with something but notice how the +5 cannot possibly change you all right let's evaluate with negative x I know that odd powers maintain signs so this would be negative 3x to the third here's negative x cubed three times that's negative three X to the third plus five you go well that's that's not exactly the same as that notice this is not the same thing as that so they can't be even so okay what's the next step well let's factor out a negative if i factor out a negative I get 3x cubed minus five what's the minus five when you factor that negative out you go we'll wait a minute this is not the same thing as I started with so this is not just opposite outputs this is not the same output at all right there that's telling you that this is neither it's not even you didn't get the same thing out it's not odd you get the same thing with a negative in front you didn't get the original function with a negative front you got neither the original function in neither of these cases so you factor negative that's not the original function you didn't factor negative that's not the original function so this is not even not the same this is not odd not the same with a negative factored out this would be neither now what we can infer from that is that this doesn't have any sort of symmetry about the y-axis or about the origin so it's kind of nice to know that now here's the little shortcut that I would do when I do these on my own I know that because even powers make everything positive and odd powers change the sign if I plug in a negative and constants don't change how I check for even odd or neither is I just change the sign of my odd powers and then if I get the same thing out well then I know it's even if I if I don't well then I know it's if I get an opposite in front then I know it's on if I get neither those two things I know it's neither so here I'd say hey let's change my odd powers there's none okay that's even changing my odd powers okay there's one on powers power one so I'm gonna change that sign there we go okay factor that it's on I'm gonna change my odd powers so I changed that to a negative so change of terms and my odd powers leave my constants oh wait that's neater so that's a very quick way to at least check your work with it let's go to the next one so I think about that if I think let's plug in negative x my odd power terms would change signs I don't have any nothing can possibly change signs here that's an even function or you see what I'm talking about now so I'm looking at this and going my odd powers would change signs if I do F of negative x I don't have any odd powered terms and so I know that x squared and say the same plus 3 that's a constant it can't change x squared let's say it's a my so let's say the same that's exactly the same function I started with even though I plug in negative x that would be an even function and this function will be symmetric about the y-axis important stuff to know let me talk about here for a second so H of negative x age of negative x ago right let's see I'm gonna change my odd powered terms I'm going to leave my even power terms alone and my constant loan that's what negative XO do now can you show this by evaluating of course I've shown you three examples where that's the case I'm show you do it right here but if you're if you're really thinking about it what what happens or even power terms would not change signs even if I plug in a negative my constants cannot change no matter what I plug in my odd power terms will change signs so negative x-cubed become positive execute you go wait a minute i can't factor a negative out of that that's true but think further than what we're doing this is why we talked a long time about the idea of you're plugging in opposite inputs you're getting out opposite outputs probably care that I don't have a double negative here or something what I care about is that this really is probably appropriately written as this here's your input here's the output here's your input here's the output I have opposite inputs do I have opposite outputs yes one has a negative in front and one does not this would be an odd function this is going to have symmetry it's graphs could have symmetry about the origin if you need to see another way or you want to show some more work listening we'd have to show that we'd be plugging in this 2t here I'm gonna erase this first thing I'm gonna do it that way we'd say all right you have a negative I know that I'm replacing X with negative X I'm plugging in opposite inputs I know that negative x cubed is negative x cubed but then that negative is going to give me positive x cubed this would be positive 3x squared because even powers always make that positive for you or if you want to show this differently say you know what I can factor that negative I can leave this as negative x cubed over 3 x squared minus 9 then you do that move this negative to the front of a fraction leave this naked as negative x you and now you can really see that hey here's the original that I had here's my opposite in front of it so opposite inputs yielded opposite of the same exact output that we had either way you want to go on that work now the last though this is definitely on I have the last one so we know that even and odd we take an opposite input so as we evaluate for negative X and we look at what happens if we get the same thing out even if we get opposite outputs out so the same thing with a negative front we get odd now in a situation like this where Y all right well wait a minute if these are positive numbers because domain wise you have to have positives gives you that to give you a real defined output then these are all be negatives if these are negatives that would be defined and those are view positives so one of these is not a great situation for us when that happens you have a meter because if you're positive values are defined and your negative values aren't what that means is you plug in opposite inputs and one of them works and one goes not real number when that happens you have an either this is not even there's no symmetry about the y it's not odd there's no symmetry about the origin this graph will have no symmetry at all because ops and values aren't even defined these would be imaginary numbers so we say neither all right I hope that makes sense for you I hope that graphically understand the idea of symmetry I hope that you understand why this is the case based on that symmetry in looking at the graph so then we used it we understand that even means opposite inputs same exact outputs odd means opposite inputs and then opposite outputs yielded from that we can check it through evaluation simplifying if we get the same exact thing we started with by plugging in negative x so we have an even function if we get an odd function that means that we have a negative that we can factor out me an opposite in front of the original function after plugging in negative x if those things don't happen then you have an either so that's it for even on we'll talk about that's something three my next time local extrema and absolute extrema so local maximum or relative maximum and absolute maximum I'll see you for the next video have a good day you
