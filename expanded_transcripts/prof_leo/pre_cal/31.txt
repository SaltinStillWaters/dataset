Transcript for: Synthetic Division and Long Division of Polynomials (Precalculus - College Algebra 32)
hey everybody welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about division of polynomials and man are we going to need that in the next few videos we're going to unpack something called descartes rule of signs use that to simplify or make our lives easier with what's called the rational zeros theorem it's basically how to find x-intercepts if you have no idea what they are so we're going to we're going to start with long division polynomials and synthetic division polynomials because we're going to be using so much in just a couple videos so we're going to spend a lot of time doing that but before we get to that there's something i want to talk about called the factor theorem and part of it is the remainder theorem what just lets the stuff pop be possible so i'm going to explain that we're going to talk about long division and synthetic division why both because you need both synthetic division is super nice and it's very convenient and very fast but it only works under certain circumstances and so i'm going to teach you both of them because you will be using both long division and synthetic division in your math lives so that's we're going to be doing so let's get right into it what lets division of polynomials be possible is something called the factor theorem and what we're going to be using is this idea that if you get a remainder of zero what you're dividing goes into what you are what you're dividing by goes into what you're dividing evenly and is therefore a factor that's basically all of it in a nutshell with this gel it sounds kind of wordy if you uh really just read it and it goes if upon division you get a remainder of zero your divisor is a factor of your dividend here's what that means here's 48 here's six you go okay let's divide 48 by six this is your dividend this is your divisor this up here is going to be your quotient so we start inviting go hey does uh does 6 go into 48 it goes in 8 times you go oh 8 times 6 is 48 and if we subtract we get 0. oh hey the remainder 0 and that's what this says it says if your remainder is zero then your divisor is actually a factor of your dividend that means that you can factor your dividend as six times some other number and that's exactly what we're going to be doing that sort of summarizes the remainder theorem and the factor theorem as far as what you need to know to get this stuff done so we're going to be doing a couple things number one we're going to use the remainder theorem to say if you if you divide and you get a remainder of zero this is combined with vector theorem then what you're dividing by is a factor of what you are dividing we're also going to be checking this by plugging in a value and making sure that you get zero out of it that would say that you have this zero which would create a factor for us and then we can sort of use that in conjunction with our theorems to give ourselves a factored polynomial that's what we're going to be doing this is actually a good model for long division of polynomials how it works and so let's just jump right into it let's see as we keep going what this stuff means in relation to what we're doing so again why we're doing it you are going to be doing this stuff a lot once i teach you about the rational zeros theorem you might hear rational roots theorem that is really important for us going forward with polynomials and also with rational functions so here's how this works the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to start testing a number to see if it's actually a zero so here's the logic behind this if i say here's my polynomial and i really can't factor it so if i try to factor this i might think grouping or something grouping's not going to work i don't really have just a quadratic so quadratic form is not going to work for us there is actually a technique that you can go through to solve a cubic by just doing using the coefficients that's possible but it's really beyond the scope of like a precalculus level class so you learn that much much later and it's very very involved so the way we get around that is by doing something called the rational zeros rational zeros theorem and what it does i'm going to kind of cheat here and give a spoiler what the rational zeros theorem does is it gives you a list of numbers that are potential zeros for your function all the rational that's whole numbers positive negative so integers and fractions that could potentially be factors of your polynomial so no it wouldn't include square roots things like that but it's really really helpful for us so what that's going to do that's going to have a list of numbers for you and you're going to start trying them you're going to say okay hey if something is a 0 an x intercept or a root of our function then when i plug it in it should give me zero that's the whole point of being an x-intercept so here's what we're gonna do we're gonna take this value and we're going to evaluate it if it gives us a zero that means that this is going to create a factor force think back to last video that's kind of exactly what we did we said oh that's an x-intercept yep and we can make a factor from it uh you have to subtract one you get x minus one and you know that's two years ago and you know that's going to be a factor well that's using these theorems that we're talking about so we're going to plug it in see if it gives us a 0. if it does we're going to divide because we know it's going to be a factor by these theorems and then we're going to get a at least partially factored polynomial from it that's awesome because the last video what we had was i gave you the polynomial already factored so let's graph it you know how do we get the factors like this by dividing long division or synthetic division so here's our steps we're going to go through number one we're going to check to see whether this x value is in fact an x-intercept if you evaluate it and it gives you 0 then that's an x-intercept think about that if i plug it in it says you have a height of 0 then you are on the x-axis that's we're going to check first after that we'll create a factor and start dividing so we're going to evaluate f of 1. so f of 1 would take and plug in 1 everywhere you see an x and so we'd have two minus one is one plus two is three minus three is zero hey look at that if we plug in one we get zero here's what this says what this says is that if you plug in one and you solve it that is going to be your remainder if you were to divide divide the factor that that one is giving you let me say this one more time i'm going to evaluate one it's giving me zero this right here is the remainder that i'm going to get if i divide the factor that this creates so if i get 0 i have an x intercept that's what this is saying saying this is for sure and x intercept because when i evaluate x it gives me zero gives me something on the x axis that's fantastic let's find the factor so the factor would be subtract 1 on both sides oh that x minus 1 equal to 0 that's using that sort of zero product property to say this thing is a factor that's part of the factory third as well this thing is a factor of your polynomial why because we know that our remainder's zero remember if you divide something and your remainder is zero then your divisor what you're dividing by goes in evenly or perfectly divides your dividend you're going to get a remainder of zero and so we're going to use that so we're going to take our polynomial and we're going to do what's called long division of polynomial and then i'm going to show you some the synthetic division after that synthetic division is much quicker but it only works in certain circumstances i'll explain that when we get there so long division of polynomials takes your polynomial the whole thing and then it writes it where the dividend goes so like where the 48 was in the first example what you do need to make sure that you have you need to make sure that it's in order that is very important all our polynomials should be in order but we need to be extra careful on that also you need to have every exponent below your degree remember your degree is the largest power of x below your degree you need to have that represented so if you're missing any you put a almost like a place value holder like 0x cubed or something like that we'll see that in the next example here we're not missing anything so we're going to write the polynomial and then we're going to write the factor that we're dividing so one time all the way through we are going to be checking to see whether this number creates an x-intercept if you get zero it does after that we're going to create a factor from that x-intercept we know it's an x-intercept now therefore it should work in the zero product property that when we multiply it it's going to give us 0. so we're going to create a factor and then we're going to divide our polynomial by that factor this is factoring your polynomial but not using a technique besides kind of checking a number to see if it's an x-intercept or a zero now the question you should have in your head is where where'd that come from did you randomly guess it no i didn't um this is going to come in two videos from now when i teach you the rational zeros theorem i'm teaching this now that way when we get there we can immediately go for it that's what this is for so i'm going to go ahead i'm going to write out my my factor x minus 1. now please listen to something i know for sure that this has to divide this already why because i plugged in the one and it gave me zero it has to be a factor so if i do all this work and i get not zero down here either i messed up on my evaluation or i messed up on my division if you plug in this number and it gives you zero then the factor that you create it has to be a factor like it must divide this and give you a remainder of zero 100 every time that also means this you're not going to waste your time doing long division if you check this number and it doesn't give you zero so if you check and he goes oh you got like seven why are you wasting your time because we're trying to factor polynomials now there is cause to do this sometimes sometimes you do need to divide things that are not going to divide evenly especially like slant asymptotes of leg asymptotes you do have to do that so i'm going to show that to you but if you're checking to factor your polynomial and it's not giving you a zero you're not like you wouldn't go any further so i guess the main point is if you do this and you get this it better divide evenly if it doesn't you've made a mistake so here's how long division of polynomials works what we do is base pretty much everything off this first term so we're going to check our first term and divide by our first term so 2x to the third divided by x what's going to happen is that really all you're going to be doing is lowering that exponent and keeping that coefficient because you're just dividing by x 1 x to the first power it's not going to change much that's the logic of how the synthetic division is going to be built so synthetic division only works if you have firstly a linear so like x minus something not x squared not x to the third just x to the first power and it also only works if you have your coefficient of x as one if that's not true synthetic division does not work or at least it doesn't work very well um long division of polynomials it's it's much more robust it'll work all the time so it'll work with it x squared or 3x squared or 2x which is why i need to learn both of them so i need to learn long division polynomials because you'll be using it to divide out x squared quadratics at some times you'll be using it to divide out when your x is not just one x or you'd have to change it and then use submit division so and you choose that but you do need to know both of them so with long division polynomials we take our first term and divide by our first term if you need to write this off to the side like hey 2x to the third that's our first term divided by x that's our first term here what we're going to get is 2 divided by 1 is 2 x to the third divided by x to the first is x squared that right there is the first part of our quotient we're going to put it right there now just like every time you've done long division we're going to multiply do you remember that like we divide then we multiply and we subtract the same thing is going to happen here however when you have more than one term you do have to distribute this so we're going to take 2x squared times x well that's going to give us 2x to the third power and it should always be that your first terms here should be identical because you're subtracting and you need them to go away and we distribute 2x squared times negative 1 is negative or minus 2x squared this is the reason why you have to make sure that you have every potential power of x 3 2 1 constant uh at least represented in that that dividend because you're going to be matching up exponents and if you miss a spot you're going to go where do i put this you go i don't know you mess it up um that's why we have to have that then we subtract and this is where all the mistakes happen like 99 of them and you know that well 95 you know this right because i say this all the time that 95 of your mistakes in math are probably signed errors like mistaking negatives with positives and that's what happens here you see when we subtract right now we are really subtracting a polynomial minus another polynomial put parentheses around here and when you subtract understand that what you're really doing is 2x cubed minus 2x cubed great that's 0. but you're doing negative x squared minus negative 2x squared wait a minute negative x squared minus a negative subtracting a negative is adding this sign the second sign inside your parentheses will always change always so keep that in the back of your head if you're always subtracting and you're distributing a minus sort of uh you're subtracting both these terms in this polynomial your second sign is always going to change so this says negative x squared minus negative 2x squared no no negative x squared plus 2x squared well that's positive x squared and we would bring down the plus 2x looks a lot like regular long division of of integer numbers and then we keep on going so this is an algorithm it's a process for doing this stuff and we check the next term so this first term divided by this first term again so we take x squared divided by x and if you simplify x squared divided by x is 1x to the first power just x well that's the next thing that we're going to put on our quotient so since that's positive we'll put plus x and we're going to do the same process we're going to take our positive we'll think about this as positive x and we're going to distribute so x times x that's x squared it's looking good those are exactly the same that's what we want to see and we distribute x times negative 1 well that's negative x or minus x and then just like before we're going to subtract so i'm going to put my parentheses around that because i'm really subtracting polynomials so first minus second says x squared minus x squared that's 0 that's what we want to see we want to see those first terms kind of disappear all the time but watch your signs 2x minus negative x and that's going to give us 2x plus x do you see i hope you see why i use parentheses because that's a little q for my head say hey slow down you're going to have some sign changes the second the second term is always going to change signs because you are subtracting if you have more than that all of your last terms are going to change signs because you are subtracting a full polynomial so 2x minus a negative so 2x plus x is 3x and we bring down our minus three and we do this one last time we're going to take our first term divided by our first term if we simplify we simply get three and it's positive three so we'll put plus three if we distribute one last time three times x is three x and three times negative one we think of that as negative one is minus three and if we subtract this is pretty neat this is what we knew would happen oh man hey look we should have a remainder of zero this is what we knew would happen and what we wanted to happen because when we get a remainder of zero it says that what you've divided by is your divisor divides perfectly into your dividend gives you this quotient in other words this is a factor if you have a remainder of zero it's a perfect factor that's great it means you can factor your polynomial fantastic so when we subtract this 3x minus 3x is 0 negative 3 minus negative 3. negative 3 subtract negative so it's negative 3 plus 3 that's zero if you do not end with that either you've done something wrong either this was wrong or something happened here so if you plug in this number and it gives you zero and you create your factor by subtracting that number or adding that number if it's negative and getting this factor this has to divide that and give you a remainder zero if that doesn't happen something went wrong or if you didn't get a zero there then why are you doing this if you don't absolutely have to sometimes you do but for finding factors you wouldn't you'd want to make sure right you don't want to check and do long division on every potential factor that's crazy it's going to take you forever so we find the factors or sorry to find the values of x that give us 0 we create our factors and we know that they're going to be factors that's what we're going to be doing two videos from now now why why does this even matter well here's the reason why it matters because if we know that we have a remainder of zero we can now rewrite this polynomial that we did not know what its factors were we didn't know how to graph it and now we can rewrite it and we know for sure right now that hey this dividend is now a product of a factor we know it's a factor it has a remainder zero and the quotient so we could write it as x minus one two x squared plus x plus three now what would you do now uh well that's a quadratic you could try to factor it further you could try a quadratic formula but if you do that your discriminant is negative it says that's an irreducible quadratic check it if you want to pause the video check it try the quadratic formula you'd get b squared minus 4ac and that's going to be negative there's no x-intercepts the same irreducible quadratic that's fantastic if you do quadratic formula and you get i or a negative inside your square root you have an irreducible quadratic you can't factor it you're done this is completely factored over the real numbers that means that you had really no idea what was going on here besides that's a positive cubic so it should look like this it should have at least one x intercept think about that if your graph looks like this here's your leading term here's your degree max turning points of 2 that's a positive odd looks like this that means that you have to cross the x-axis well you know what we just found it we cross the x-axis at x equals one multiplicity one it is a cross and this is an irreducible quadratic and we have no more x-intercepts that's pretty neat but that's the reason why we need to learn how to divide so we can get this far so we can understand okay that's really what this graphics can look like it probably has another turning point but it's not one that causes a different x-axis intercept so we um we're done that's that's about as much as i need you to know so we're plugging in a value we're making sure that we get a zero if we do cool we create a factor we divide it and we write this as a factored polynomial can you continue past this yes but you need to try another x-intercept in our case we had a quadratic and you'd go let's just do quadratic formula because that's easier than guessing and checking but if you had like a power 4 still power 3 still you'd need another x-intercept to create another factor and that's the whole process in two videos we're going to have a list of numbers we'll get an x-intercept create a factor divide it find another x-intercept create a factor divide it we keep on going now i'm going to show you synthetic division it's really cool i mean it's really really useful but there are some special circumstances that you have to have i already explained it but i want to go through it one more time this is what you have to have number one you have to have that your divisor has a one in front of your x honestly you need to basically solve for x i'm going to show you this in just a second you want this to be x equals some sort of a value it can't be a fraction it can be a fraction that's okay but you need to have solved for x here basically second thing you need to have every single one of these exponents of x represented just like you did for long division polynomials and that's pretty easy so here's the way that synthetic division works we're going to use just the coefficients of our polynomial and we're going to put them right here so we're going to say that our coefficients are 2 negative 1 2 and negative 3. we can include the constant even though it's not a coefficient we include that and we leave ourselves a space right below then what we do is we take the x intercept one not negative one i see so many students make that mistake and they go oh yeah you get your factor and you do this you're going to put negative one here no synthetic division is very special synthetic division when you divide it has the special circumstances so that you can just take this value and divide with it so we're going to take one we're going to divide we're going to use one as the thing that we're dividing with synthetic division so we just put our 1 here so you take the x intercept not the factor the factor you is used when you're actually dividing that's what we're doing we're taking the factor divided by the factor but with synthetic division you don't do that you take what x equals this is why i started this way this is why i said this is what we're checking this is the x-intercept this is what you divide by if you make and put negative one you're going to run into a whole lot of issues and you're gonna get very frustrated because you're ah never works darn you leonard hey maybe make sure that you have the x-intercept there and here's what we're going to do it's it's a process it's an algorithm it's extremely fast we bring down the first coefficient so we're going to bring down the two oh yes i forgot the other special condition with synthetic division you have to have solved for x which means you cannot have x to the second power here or x to the third power so that division works as you solve for x completely x equals a constant and that's what you're dividing by right so if you don't have x to the first power you haven't solved this yet and therefore you can't put that number there unless you solve for x so um this is a very special case thing where you have x to the first power equals an x-intercept it's just for x-intercepts and it gives you a factored version of it in just a minute so that's what we're doing just make sure that you've actually solved for x and you're set so we have x equals one we put the one we bring down our first coefficient we put two and the whole process the whole algorithm is multiply put it here add multiply put it here add multiply it put it here add and this will be your remainder the last number you get is your remainder so let's go ahead and do that i'm going to now multiply 2 times 1 i'm going to put it right here then when i add i'm going to get 1. i'm going to multiply 1 times 1 and i'm going to put it here 1 times 1 is 1 and i'm going to add well 2 plus 1 is 3. i'm going to multiply 1 times 3 well that's 3. i'm going to put it here when i add notice you're adding here you're going to get 0. this last piece is your remainder well wait a minute that zero is exactly like that zero that's your remainder we knew we had to get a remainder of zero that's what we did when we checked for an x-intercept at the very beginning now this might look like just gobbling  but that right there are the coefficients of your quotient 2 1 and 3. so because we're always dividing by x to the first power while dividing by something that's equal to x to the first power really what we're doing is we're just lowering our exponent of every term by one and what that means is that no matter what you do here you just look back at your original okay because i start with x to the third power and i'm practically dividing out an x to the first power what i'm going to get is lower all of these by one this would be two x to the second power plus one x to the first power plus three well that three doesn't have an x to a power because that's a constant that right there is your quotient and this is pretty cool it's pretty cool because we got the same exact thing as this we got our quotient but we spent a whole lot less time on it and that's not just because i was explaining this fully it's because that's much quicker but for certain circumstances again that will not work if you're trying to factor out quadratics and this will which is why you need both of them so the last thing we do is say all right we're going to go ahead and factor our polynomial like we did over here we know that 2x squared plus x plus 3 is part of it that's an irreducible quadratic we already explained that but now i have a factor and this is the second place where some students can't get confused on this so keep this in mind what you did right here is you set and found an x-intercept of one and use that one you need to make sure that you subtract one to find your factor you can see this right that a lot of students go oh yeah my factor is x plus 1 because that's positive no no it's opposite of that sign so think back to what you're doing this right here gave you that number this right here is not your factor you have to subtract one to get that factor so our factor is x minus one and that's exactly what we got here can which one do you do which one's better um honestly i'm pretty quick at this and i never make mistakes with signs because it's right there so i actually prefer this and it works all the time but don't let that don't let my opinion influence what you choose a ton of people love this because it's extremely fast i'm going to be doing both of them pretty much all the time just so you can get good at it and i want to always reinforce the content so you're going to be seeing long division of polynomials and you're going to be seeing synthetic division it doesn't take that much longer for me to show and so i'm going to always do that for you just to get you prepared you even use long division and calculus like help one count to calc 3 on occasion where you have to divide a polynomial by something and sometimes it's useful to divide it even if you know you're going to get a remainder that's not zero so we have two more examples to do the next one we're missing some exponents and the one after that where we don't have a remainder of zero and just what you do with that this would be like a four-layer sort of an idea so we'll see in a second all right let's keep on going shall we so we have a honestly really nasty uh polynomial there and we're going to try to factor it as much as we can or at least we're going to get one factor out of it and then we're probably gonna stop because it would take a long time to keep on going but this idea is is important uh however i have not taught you how to get the list of numbers so we'd have to really guess and check to keep on going after this so we're gonna try to factor that thing now before we get going if you have a degree 5 or higher there is no general way to factor that by using the coefficients so there's no formula to plug in to factor that thing you have to know something about this function in order to factor it that's where the rational zeros theorem is going to come in in about two videos i know i'm over i'm kind of playing it up so you'll have to watch it but this is what would happen you'd have a list of numbers and you would say all right which of those are x intercepts so you plug them in you go i'm going to plug in something easy like one does it work uh no 3 plus 82 plus 27 that's that's not one that's not zero plugged in negative one uh no that's not your word either and eventually you get through your list and you get to something like negative three so that's where this would come from i'm not making it up i'm not really guessing at it i would have a list of numbers given by a technique i'm going to show you in two videos that would give that to you and so here's our job once we have that okay i'm going to check negative 3. we're going to plug in negative 3. we're going to evaluate this and we're going to see what it gives us if it doesn't give us 0 then that's not an x-intercept and it will not create a factor for us if i evaluate for negative 3 and it does give a zero think about that evaluate something it gives you 0 you're on the x-axis it is an x-intercept it will give you a factor and then we keep going and then we divide so that's the process of doing this that's what we're going to get to in just a couple videos so let's uh let's evaluate g of negative 3. so um did this already that's pretty hard to evaluate you're definitely going to want your calculator because negative 3 to the sixth power is already pretty big and then you multiply by 3 add 82 times negative 3 to third power and 27 and you are actually gonna get zero so we'd spend the time to do that and we'd say hey because i evaluated negative three and it gave me zero i know a couple things about this function right now number one thing i know is that that's an x-intercept now that's fantastic you know why don't you stop there because that could potentially have five more and so you're going to want to know what this function looks like in order to figure out more x-intercepts now what should this give you if i start dividing by x plus three which is a factor should give us two things number one a remainder of zero number two it should give us some degree five polynomial remember i have x to the sixth i'm going to be dividing by x to the first it should give us a degree 5 polynomial as a quotient and that's important to understand that we're just going to be lowering the degree by 1. that means we could potentially have 5 more x intercepts to find and so that's the reason why we don't just end here like i am good uh we have to keep going to give ourselves some quotient to see what's next if you go well why don't you just try all the numbers on this apparent list that you're going to give me and just be done with that well because the list is only rational zeros it won't show up any square roots so any radical zeros or other types of numbers and so it is important for us to be able to use this to get a polynomial that we can do for the work with that's why we're doing it there's not really a great way around it and so here's our thought process we plugged in negative three we evaluated that it gave us zero it says this that's an x-intercept we know that if we have an x-intercept we did a few videos ago that i can set this equal to zero by adding three and x plus three is a factor it has to be a factor of that polynomial and it has to give us a remainder of zero this is what our remainder should be this is what we're going to get when we divide so we're going to put x plus 3 where we put our divisor and we're going to put our polynomial inside of our our division symbol it's where the dividend goes and so what we're going to be doing though is we're going to make sure that we have a power of of x for every potential exponent less than 6. so 6 is our degree we're going to start with that but we have to represent the fifth power the fourth power the third power it's there second power first power and then our constant it's there how we do that is with a zero so we'd say zero x to the fifth it's kind of like a place value holder 0x to the fourth we actually have an x to the third we don't have an x squared or an x but we do have a 27. and so we now have let's make sure six five four three two one constant and we filled that out completely it looks pretty um pretty tedious and honestly it is there there's a lot of work here we have lots of steps i'm going to go through them fairly quickly man you should be doing the same thing on your own all right we really really should be checking this along with me so what we would do though is basically the same thing we did in last example take your first term and divide by x that's always our first term if our first term is not just x this will still work even if you have a quadratic or something like that you're trying to divide so 3x to the sixth divided by x is three x to the fifth i'm not gonna be writing this off to the side i'm doing this in my head three x to the fifth times x we're gonna get three x to the sixth we distribute and we get nine x to the fifth now i always put parentheses around it because we're subtracting and i know that when i'm subtracting polynomials my signs change so three x to the sixth minus three x is six that's zero uh zero x to the fifth minus nine x to the fifth not plus minus your sign changes that's negative nine x to the fifth and i bring down my zero x to the fourth and i continue then we start with our next first term so z not negative nine x to the fifth divided by x basically you're just subtracting one from the exponent that's really all you're doing that's negative 9x to the fourth power so i'm going to put minus and then i'm going to distribute make sure you distribute with your sign negative 9x to the fourth times x well that's negative nine x to the fifth that's fantastic uh that's we we're always checking this if that's not the same we've made a mistake the negative nine x to the fourth times three is negative so i write minus 27 x to the fourth double checking my work okay i know that's right now i'm going to subtract again keeping in mind that when i'm subtracting polynomials my signs change in my parentheses so negative nine x to the fifth minus negative nine that's zero zero minus negative 27 that's positive 27 and i bring down my next term and again we start with our first terms 27 x to the fourth divided by x well i'm basically just subtracting from my exponent because my coefficient is 1. 27 divided by 1 is 27 and x to the fourth divided by x to the first you subtract exponents you get to the third and that's what synthetic division division is kind of based on anyway but here i get positive so 27x to the fourth divided by x is positive 27 x to the third and i distribute so 27x to the third times x is 27 x to the fourth 27 x to the third times 3 is 81 so positive 81 x to the third i hope you're seeing the reason why we had to have a place value for every potential value of x otherwise we would have no no where to put that where do i put it i don't know there's no spot for it that's what we had to have that so i'm keeping in mind that when i subtract all my signs change inside my parentheses is why i put my parentheses 27 minus 27 is zero my exponents match up that's fantastic 82 minus 81. remember we're subtracting positive 81. that's one x to the third i bring down my 0x squared x cubed that's our first term divided by x that's our first term of our divisor is x squared positive x squared when i distribute we get x squared times x is x to the third x squared times three is three x squared we put our parentheses we do our subtraction we're getting a little tedious here but that's okay it's going to work out well x cubed minus x cubed that's zero zero minus three remember our sine shape zero minus three is negative three x squared and i bring down my zero x we actually know it's going to work out because we already checked it so that's kind of cool that's that's encouraging that we know what we're going to get and we take our first term and divide by the first term of our divisor so negative 3x squared divided by x is negative 3x so we put minus then we distribute negative 3x times x is negative 3x squared that looks great because it matches up with our first term that always has to be the case and negative 3x times 3 is minus or negative 9x we put minus 9x and we subtract your signs are going to change negative minus negative so negative three minus a negative is zero x squared zero minus negative nine well that's zero plus nine that's nine x and bring down our 27 that's exciting uh 9x divided by x hey those x's would cancel you just get 9. when we multiply 9 times x is 9x 9 times 3 is 27 when we subtract 9x minus 9x is 0. 27 minus 27 is 0. we know what we should have got 0 and now we've confirmed that we got it so we're for sure that we have this stuff all correct that's why you go all the way to the bottom plus you figure all these coefficients and constants anyway so this is what this says to us this says that this polynomial has a factor and this is what's left over after you've factored it out so in other words yeah run already write this get your function name right we have x plus 3 as one factor that's a linear and then we have this power 5 polynomial 3x to the fifth minus nine to the fourth plus 27 x cubed plus x squared minus three x plus nine now are we done we are done but what would happen later is that you would have some more numbers on the rational zeros list that you would plug into this power five polynomial to see if it gave you an x-intercept to see if you evaluate it gives you zero that means you're dealing with an x-intercept that gives you a factor and you would redo this until you got down to one or two types of factors linears or power twos that the quadratic formula does not work for in other words it gives you complex numbers that's when you're done so if you have a power 5 i guarantee you there's at least one more x-intercept why because it's an odd that right here is an odd function it has to cross the x-axis one more time it has to not just bounce cross it there has to be a cross there so this would not be fully factored guaranteed we're not going to spend the time to find the the other x-intercepts because we don't have that list of numbers and i haven't talked to you how to do it that's not this video but just understand that once you find this is the process here is for you to understand that once you find an x-intercept you get a factor and you divide it now we're going to do synthetic division it's much much quicker you're going to really like it here and then you'll see that that we get the same thing so let's write it out how we do it is basically the same as this but you don't include any x's so you still have to have all of those coefficients so you look at your polynomial and say all right there'd be a 3x to the sixth then you have no x to the fifth and no x to the fourth you have a 82x to the third you have no x squared you have no x and you have 27 as your constant we know that our remainder should be zero let's make sure that that that happens so what we're going to do is we're going to do synthetic division here um it is a little bit different than long division because you don't take the factor you take the x-intercept and use that in the algorithm so we're going to take negative three now when we go ahead and do it the first step is to bring down your first coefficient so we're going to bring down the three the reason why that works is because with synthetic division you always have to have x that solve for so no coefficient so basically you're counting on that you're dividing the first term by one x to the first it's just lowering your exponent by one and it's keeping your coefficient that's why that works now we're going to multiply and add multiply and add multiply and add so bring down the 3 this is negative 3 times 3 is negative 9. add 0 plus negative 9 is negative 9. multiply negative 3 times 8 minus 27 0 plus 27 is 27. multiply negative 3 times 27 is negative 81. add you get 82 plus negative 81 is 1. multiply negative 3 times one is negative three and add zero plus negative three is negative three multiply negative three times negative three is positive nine add zero plus nine is nine do you see it that's exactly the same coefficients that we have there multiply negative three times 9 is negative 27 if you add 27 plus negative 27 is 0 go to the end make sure you have a 0 there if you don't if you did this right here and it says you do have a zero and you don't get it there something happened that was bad and now the last thing we would do is understand that you're dividing out x to the first power you're just going to take all of those exponents and subtract one from them that's what you're dividing out does dividing exponents you subtract so we'd have three x to the fifth minus nine x to the fourth plus 27 x to the third plus one x squared minus three x plus nine and everybody agrees that that's way faster and that's fantastic do it all the time if you want to just when you can't do it it's nice to have something that works for like quadratics and things of that nature so this would be exactly the same as what we have right here we'd say hey that's that's our quotient we know what a factor is a factor would be that's an x-intercept never forget this this is not x minus 3. this is x equals negative 3 therefore x plus 3 equals 0 your factors x plus 3 not x minus 3. that's the same exact factoring that we've got right here so either way you want to go on that for now again i'm going to be doing both that's obviously a little bit a little bit a lot quicker i have one more example when you what to do if you don't have a zero but you still need to divide so hang on for that one okay one last example of what to do if you don't have a remainder of zero but you still need to divide what you do with that remainder i want to bring it back a long long time ago what happens if you were to divide 49 by six you know well it doesn't divide you're right you need a remainder of one actually so six goes into 49 eight times if you multiply you get 48 and if you subtract you get one and that remainder of one creates a fraction if you divide your whole it goes into 49 eight whole times and you get one over six or in other words your remainder over your divisor and this can be added added to it eight plus one six is 8 and 1 6. that models what we do with the remainder that's not zero so i'm going to show you that right now so let's uh let's first check to see what the remainder is you know hey x is 2 that's on my list and so here's my um here's my polynomial here's a number that i'm checking so i figure out what happens if i evaluate 2 so i plug in 2 and i go right let's see 2 cubed is 8 8 times 4 is 32 2 squared is 4 this is 12 13 12 is 20 minus 16 that's 4 plus 4 is 8. go oh great i'm going to get 8. yay wait is that an x-intercept no because if it was if you evaluated it x-intercepts give you 0 on the x-axis when you evaluate them so this is clearly not an x-intercept what that means is that x minus 2 is not a factor if i divide this polynomial by x minus 2 it is not going to divide evenly i will not be able to write as a factor but i can write it as a quotient plus some sort of a a remainder and so that's what i'm going to show you how to do sometimes you have to this is not often but sometimes you do so we're going to write 4 x cubed minus 3x squared minus 8x plus 4. there's no missing exponents that's kind of nice i'm going to take the potential factor we know it's not going to be and i'm going to divide it i'm going to go very quickly here so 4x cubed divided by x is 4x to the second that would be 4x cubed minus 8 x squared when we subtract we need to make sure that our signs are changing our parentheses this gives us 0 that's great negative 3 plus 8 is 5x squared i'm going to bring down my minus 8x and we're going to do the whole thing again so 5x squared divided by x is positive 5x i'm going to distribute 5x squared minus 10x so 5x times negative 2 is minus 10x i'm going to make sure that my parentheses because when i subtract over parentheses my signs change 5x squared minus 5x squared zero cool negative 8 minus negative 10 that's 2. and lastly 2x divided by x is 2. so put 2. 2x minus 4 and you go oh that's 0. it's not 0 because when you subtract 2x minus 2x is 0. that's great but 4 minus negative 4 is 8. that says we have a remainder wait a minute that's exactly what that is exactly that's great that's fantastic it's what we wanted to happen we knew that it was not going to factor well that's not a factor of this so here's what you do with it much like the 1 over 6 the remainder over your divisor you take this if it's positive you write plus if it's negative you write minus so here we write a plus your remainder over what you divided by and that's how you can take and divide a polynomial by something that's not a factor and still write something relevant this is useful on occasion when you get to something like calculus 2. sometimes we have to do this to do some integrals and make things a little bit easier you'd end with it if you did this you know the integral of ln uh x minus two but that's um that's way beyond where we're at i'm just letting you know this is what you do when you when you get there so if you don't have a roommate honestly if you plug that in it doesn't give you zero in this class you're pretty much done but if you have to do it then this is the way you go and do it you have a remainder you put if that's negative it would be a minus here minus 8 over x minus 2. okay synthetic division is very very similar we take our coefficients in our constant four negative three negative eight and four we have no missing exponents so that's cool and we take what x is equal to not our factor but what x is equal to our potential x intercept and that's 2 and then we go ahead and we do our synthetic division synthetic division based on the factor dividing by x to the first power brings down your coefficient multiplies four times two is eight and adds negative three plus eight is five multiplies two times five is ten and adds negative 8 plus 10 is 2 multiplies 2 times 2 is 4 and adds it doesn't subtract it adds and you get 8 you get a remainder of eight and this says okay this would be four x squared plus five x plus two plus eight over don't get confused your factors not x plus 2 x would equal to x minus 2 equals 0 your factor is x minus 2. that is what your quotient would be if you divide it let's see i think that's about all that i want to tell you that's what you do when you have this this remainder and how you represent that could you write it it's a little awkward but you could if you had to write this as a sort of factored form you could still write x minus 2 times your quotient but it gets really awkward and that's not going to help you at all with any further factoring so i hope that makes sense and i'll see you for another video you
