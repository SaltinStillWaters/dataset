Transcript for: How to Graph Phase Shifts of Trigonometric Functions (Precalculus - Trigonometry 16)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about how to phase shift some trigonometric functions and all that really means is a horizontal shift we've talked about it before and a lot of the college algebra graphing even the intermediate algebra graphing how to shift left and right and so that's what we're talking about with the phase shift i'm going to show you exactly how to work with it i'm going to refer back to how we graph some trig functions without that phase shift vertical shift and some key points that's about it so let's talk about what phase shifting does this is a horizontal shift along the x-axis and we're going to see right away that that shift is going to be located right next to the x variable which is really convenient so x-axis stuff is right next to the x variable which is nice now if you remember anything about the horizontal shifting the biggest thing that gets you to know these two pieces of information is number one it's opposite of the sign that you kind of want it to be so we oftentimes want to see plus as right and it's not adding next to your your uh your input adding next to your whatever your your input is like x is going to shift to the left on that input axis so adding next to x shifts to the left on x subtracting next to x shifts to the right on x so adding is left and subtracting is to the right so we got to make sure that we have that down the second thing it's right here but it's a big deal is that if you're going to identify a phase shift a horizontal shift the coefficient of your x has to be one so almost always we're going to be dividing first like forcing this sort of factor and i'm going to show you that in our very first example and so we have some steps um this kind of culminates all of our graphing and trig functions number one thing is we're going to look for whatever vertical shift we have after that we're going to identify a phase shift well a phase shift you're going to have to make sure the coefficient of x is 1 that's typically what i do first then we're going to take a look at our periods so that's another reason why we want to divide before we do that and lastly we'll use our key points and graph this so we're going to go right into an example right now remember the only thing that is new right now is dealing with a horizontal shift plus means left minus means right it's called a phase shift for a trigonometric function so let's take a look at that if we have 3 sine of 2x minus pi because because we need that coefficient of x to be 1 to identify not only our period but our phase shift this is the first thing i'm going to do i'm going to put in the proper form if you remember that with graphing the proper form is very important for us so we like these things in certain order any constants being added subtracted last it's a vertical shift likewise anything inside of our parentheses needs to have a coefficient of 1 next to our x we're going to force this to divide 2. so how do we factor out a 2 where do we put it number one thing don't factor out a 2 and put it there that is not at all what's happening so sine of this thing that's an angle and so we've got to leave that junk in those parentheses we're going to factor out 2 but it's going to remain inside that function we're basically just going to divide both terms by 2. and if we do that 2x divided by 2 is just x or 1x and that's what we want now we're not factoring a negative so our sine isn't going to change but notice that when you factor you have to divide all the terms upon what you're factoring so 2x divided by 2 is x but pi divided by 2 is pi over 2. and this helps us identify whatever that phase shift is this is the right form this is what we do first now we're going to do these steps when we graph it but we want to make sure it's of the right form this doesn't break our pattern here we always make sure our functions are the right form before you graph them and that's what we've done this is what we want we want a factor if you have one then a trig function then an x with a a coefficient of one if you factor you factor and lastly anything added subtracted which you don't have now we're ready to start identifying all of these transformations so we look for a vertical transformation first we don't have one a vertical shift would happen back there there's nothing added or subtracted to our outputs so we're not shifting up or down then we go ahead and look for a horizontal transformation so whether we're phase shifting left or right and this is where it's going to happen is right here with a coefficient of 1. that minus pi over 2 is a phase shift a horizontal shift to the get it to the right pi over 2. if you have to write it out you can write out that this is a phase shift right pi over two i typically just circle it and say right pi over two then what we do after we've identified any vertical shift any sort of a phase shift is we draw those on our graph and so we're going to take a moment to do that right now now we don't have this this sort of a vertical shift so i'm not going to be drawing this sort of new x y x axis but we do have phase shift so i'm going to redraw a version of a y axis upon which we're going to base all of our stuff our period and our key points now that we've shown where that phase shift is so this right pi over 2 and say okay this is where this is what we're going to treat our y-axis as our key points are going to relate to that remember that our key points are based on whatever trig function you have and for sine that means that we have x-intercepts at the ends and center of the period and key points at the quarters well that's now going to be based on this is the start of your period we've just phase shifted to the right you treat this like the origin right now and so we're going to deal with that so we said hey no vertical shift yes this horizontal phase shift to the right of pi over two now we're going to look at our period and base it on where our period starts now the shifted version of it so our period is always take a look at your trig function find the period sine says your period is 2 pi and divide by the coefficient of x well in this case we divided that out so you're going to divide by whatever that number is that 2 and this is going to have a period of pi now here's what to do with that because this period is pi but it no longer starts here it starts here this requires a little bit more work for us so we knew that everything but tangent had this period that we can consider starting from from zero and that was really really nice but now we've started to shift that so here's what you do with that when you find your period for whatever function you're trying to graph and you've already phase shifted which is why we do it in this order take this phase shift add your period to it and it will give you the end of your first period that's what this means so vertical shift we didn't have one phase shift we put in the right form we saw that we show it first so we shifted that over we found our period awesome now because we've already shown this phase shift you know that your period is take your phase shift whether you move right or left just add your period to it so i went to the right pi over 2 great oh that's not a problem now add your period of pi well that's going to be 3 pi over 2. so i've done that in general this is how you figure out your first period so you kind of these things are going to cycle of course so you figure out your first cycle here find your phase shift add your period now because we know how sine operates it doesn't change the fact this is a sign we need to find the middle and the quarters so we found the the beginning and the end here's the middle so the middle of this is going to be pi and now we have our quarters so i've shown that here i've shown that hey we'd start at pi over 2 we'd end at 3 pi over 2 that's one period the center is pi the quarters are 3 pi over 4 and 5 pi over 4. now it is very important to understand that this is based on sine so i am teaching this with this idea that you know what sine looks like this is not a vertical asymptote this doesn't have any vertical asymptotes it's still just a sine function just moved it it's not that bad and so a lot of things that pop in our mind about sine are are going to start happening right now such as with sine the x-intercepts happen at the ends and the center of our period well we have that now our ends are pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2 and the center is pi our quarters are where our peaks and valleys are our local maximum local minimum in fact with sine it's first quarter one and third quarter negative one so we're gonna you're we're gonna use that and then we're gonna alter that if we have a factor there remember what that can do that takes the outputs of our key points and multiplies them by whatever is right there so we can grow this shrink this and reflect this so first quarter comma one third quarter common negative one and then we can multiply that so these key points would be what they what they are after a phase shift in a vertical shift if we didn't have any sort of a vertical stretch here which we do that vertical stretch is going to multiply our outputs we get that right there should be the same number you don't change that and so we're going to plot that first quarter one it changed it grew it it did this vertical stretch into the first quarter comma three notice how i'm not saying three pi over four even though that is where this point is that's fine i'm treating this like just the first quarter of the period that it is this is how i usually graph these trig functions works out really nice as long as you remember what sine does x intercepts at the ends and center quarters of first quarter one third quarter negative one that's our key point then we can start modifying that and now we're ready to graph that's really all there is to it i think the steps kind of speak for themselves is this isn't that bad if you understand everything but the phase shift not a big deal the phase shift just puts one more aspect to it it does make working with your period harder because you are having to add this and then what i typically do is average these two to get my center average these two to get here and that's fine you just add them together divide by two your calculator would do it very nicely just don't use the pi on it do like one half three halves middle of that is one well it's one pie one half and one middle of that is three-fourths well two that's three pi over four uh one and three halves at the middle of that is five-fourths that's five pi over four and that that's how i typically do it now we're in the graph we have our points you've also noticed i've extended this so if we need to go more than one cycle to the left right that's totally fine so that's one cycle and we can continue this if we just added another pie we'd get a complete other cycle on that half of that cycle half of that period would be two pi where the first quarter would now be positive three and this would be a third quarter of a previous cycle and we could continue so i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing that the utility of these steps order is really important we want to make sure that we have that the order means in the proper form that your coefficient of x is one that's the only way to properly identify both your period and your phase shift so we do that first then we start our graphing steps vertical shift happens first we show it in the graph a horizontal shift or a phase shift happens second we show on the graph find your period add it always add it to your phase shift and that will create your first period for you after that identify what trig function will work with i'm only going to show you sine and cosine you can't do this with all the other trig functions but i think i've made it very clear that cosecant and secant are based on sine and cosine so it's not bad and then tangent and cotangent you can also phase shift so we deal with our period add that to it and then deal with your key points as the trig function that they relate to so we're going to come back we're going to do three more examples all right here we go so we have another graph that we're we're going to do right now uh 4 cosine of four x plus but three pi in parenthesis plus one before we do anything about graphing it's really important to get in the proper form so the order is important and the structure of it is important so the two cosine looks fine we want that first we want the plus one last it's great that's our vertical shift but inside the parentheses is very important we need the coefficient of x to be one that identifies both the period for us and any sort of phase shift that we have so we're going to factor out 4 right now 4x divided by 4 is x and three pi divided by four is just three pi over four and now i'm ready to go if we had to identify all of our transformations and write them out which i'm not going to show you that's not the purpose the purpose is to get these things graphed but if you had to write them out you would have a vertical shift of up one you'd have a phase shift of left three pi over four probably should put that in there why left well adding next your input is left on your graph so left on the input axis so adding 3 pi over 4 that's right next to the x coefficient x is 1 that's fantastic this is going to be left through pi over four we have a let's see taking our two pi and dividing by four that's going to horizontally compress us and vertically stretch us there are one two three four different transformations here you can have up to five you can have a vertical a horizontal horizontal stretch of compression vertical stretch compression and a reflection if you have a negative out there so you can have up to five of these transformations we'll see that one of our examples let's go ahead and start identifying what's going on here starting from step one a vertical shift is at the end of your function it affects the output output is this vertical axis so that's going to be the shift up 1. next to your input your x is going to be the shift along the input axis the x-axis and it's opposite of what you want to think of it as so this plus 3 pi over 4 is left 3 pi over 4. we're going to pause right there and we're going to graph this right now the reason why we do is we're about to do the period and the period needs to be related to where this is shifted so i'm going to graph this up one that's going to treat this like a new x axis and left 3 pi over 4 it's going to treat where we move to this new y y-axis so hopefully it's natural to you that up one should be this vertical movement and left so plus three pi over four left three pi over four should give us this negative three pi over four now why well remember where cosine starts cosines period along with all of them a tangent start at 0 so this left 3 pi over 4 is going to move us left to or negative 3 pi over 4. this is where we're going to start this graph it's going to act like the beginning of our first period now what we're going to do is find our period because the period of cosine is 2 pi and we're going to divide by this coefficient this is going to give us a period of pi over 2. now notice what i was saying i prefaced this so that it would make sense right now the normal period is 2 pi we have shortened it we've horizontally compressed this now here's what we're going to do take whatever your phase shift was this horizontal shift you're left with 3 pi over 4 this negative 3 pi over 4. take this add that it will show you where the end of your first period is so we're going to do that right now so we took this negative 3 pi over 4 we added pi over 2 we got negative pi over 4. this is the beginning and end of what we're treating as our first period this distance is pi over 2 that is your period now we're going to find the center and the quarters of that because a lot of important things happen all the important things happen at the ends center and quarters of our period so we have the ends now now we're gonna do the center and quarters much like sine this doesn't have any vertical asymptotes this is cosine it's not a bad function we know that x-intercepts happen to the quarter so those are important to find and then we have peaks at the beginning and a valley at the center or local maximum at the beginning to end and then at the center we have this local minimum eventually we're going to start altering that but that's how we start so let's find the center and the quarters so we've gone ahead and done that if you needed to use your calculator find the center by taking and averaging your start and your end of your period so negative three fourths and negative one fourth average that you're going to get negative one-half negative three-fourths and negative one-half average out you 5 8. same thing here negative 3 8. and then just do it without the pie and put the pie back it's probably the easiest way to work the fractions and then realize what we're doing because this is based on where we shifted it to so this left and this up shift i've also rewritten these numbers on here this is going to act like where your key points and how these key features of this graph relate so when we talk about hey with cosine your x-intercepts are at the quarters of your period well that period's moved hasn't it's moved left and it's moved up and so we're going to relate our x-intercepts to the quarters of this particular period not down here up here now of course we're all smart enough to realize that yes those are no longer actually x-intercepts yeah we get that but what it does is helps us graph this so they're acting like x-intercepts on where we've shifted this to i hope that makes sense to you so we said vertov shift we got it horizontal shift or phase shift we've got it we've now identified our period we found the ends the center and the quarters those are the most important points for us now we're going to take a look at our key points remember with cosine there are three key points that are not x-intercepts there are the ends which are positive one and the center which is negative one so we have that here we have our two ends of our period negative 3 pi over 4 or negative pi over 4 comma positive 1. we have the center at comma negative 1. i'm just getting those numbers from here here and here and i'm basing this on cosine originally has positive 1 at the ends and negative one at the center that's what we've done now any factor here can modify that it can stretch it it can compress it and it can reflect it and we're gonna let that happen right now let's multiply by two wow i really hope you see the utility and showing this and this it makes your graphing so much nicer because while these key points are not the actual points on our graph we've shifted this around what it's going to do is going to allow you to graph this very nicely and then you can see what those points are it's not that bad but they have been shifted it's just a really nice graphing tool so let's go ahead and do that because these relate to these actual values this is pretty nice here's negative 3 pi over 4. this acts like you're zero so negative 3 pi over 4 comma 2 is up 2. so i have negative 3 pi over 4 two and negative pi over four two that's the ends and positive two in this case because we multiplied and now our center is negative pi over two comma negative two but it's from here not here from here not over there but here down two so this would be negative pi over two comma negative two put us right there and so we're ready to graph our first period now you can continue this and you've seen this if right now if i continue my my period here the next quarter would be negative pi over eight and the next center would be this zero that's where that would be and to the left the next third quarter would be whatever this is and then the next half would be whatever this is which would be negative pi and we can graph this so our our first period really shifted to right here i've just extended it on here and here and you keep going by doing this if you wanted another cycle just keep on adding your period every time so we do a vertical and a horizontal shift we show that find your period add it to your phase shift you keep on adding and subtracting as many times as you want in order to find out as many cycles as you like then find ends center quarters repeat those every period and your key points will be based on that and will also repeat which makes it very convenient once you get the idea down the last time i mention it is please remember even though the the x-intercepts of the original cosine function are at the corners these are not actual x-intercepts are they because they've been shifted our x-intercepts are somewhere here i don't know what they are this is certainly not it they're somewhere between here and so i wanted to make that that just really clear for you that when we start shifting things we also shift x-intercepts which is the whole basis of my technique that i'm showing you so i hope it's making sense let's come back and let's do two more let's get going on another example so we've got y equals negative 3 sine of negative 2 negative interesting negative 2x plus pi over 2 nothing added or subtracted afterwards form is incredibly important for trigonometric functions so put in the proper form now before we go jump into any conclusions going oh my gosh that negative does something that negative does something that's crazy watch what happens and why i'm telling you about form first because we have to have the coefficient of x positive and one in order to identify both the period and the phase shift we do that first and you're going to see something happen in this when we start factoring out that negative two so when we do and this is the real important reason why we don't just memorize formulas why we understand about the form and then look at what's actually happening because when we divide out negative 2 it's going to change signs that's not a shift to the left it's going to end up being a shift to the right so negative 2x divided by negative 2 is positive x this is what we want to identify both the period and to identify any sort of phase shift let's see positive pi over two divided by negative two is negative pi over four this is the proper form we can verify that that's true negative 2x plus pi over 2 that's fine but this is the proper form to identify at least the phase shift now what about the period this is not the proper form yet for the period why well because really what you should be doing is dividing your period by a positive number you go wait a minute that's a negative i thought you could just pull out negatives you can't listen carefully this is the biggest deal right now is that that negative while you can't put in front of the sign because you cannot move that negative outside of the argument of the sine function you can use the fact this is a significant difference that sine is an odd function what's that mean odd functions mean this you can change the sign of your input if you change the sign of your output in other words if you change the sign of your argument of your input of your function in this case sine then just make the sign in front of it negative or change the sign in front of it in this case so odd functions sign being odd says if you remember this we did stuff like this remember how sine of negative pi over 4 we said hey that's an odd function this would be the same as negative sine of positive pi over 4. doing to the fact that this is an odd function please listen carefully again this last someone said is that you are not simply moving the negative out front in fact with cosine cosine's an even function you just make it positive because with odds opposite inputs give you opposite outputs evens opposite inputs give you the same equal outputs even as equal outputs so the long story made short is man this is great sine is an odd function all we have to do to change that sign is change that sign and that's what we're going to do right now because it's an odd function you could do a little bit of more work here if it looks like magic to you we could say that this would be negative negative 3 sine but the idea is an opposite input which is exactly what this is will yield an opposite output which is exactly what we show this is due to the fact that sign's an odd function now this is much nicer to identify everything that we want to about this so we're going to go through and follow our four steps the first one is do we have a vertical shift we don't there's nothing added or subtracted do we have a phase shift yeah we do it's right there and notice that that is a right pi over four so we've shown this phase shift a horizontal shift of right high four uh we're not moving up or down so that's fine just right there so this acts like our x-axis and it is our x-axis this acts like our y-axis it's been shifted now we find our period because sine has an original period of 2 pi we divide by our coefficient notice it's so nice divide by positive numbers you don't have to think about adding a negative here that's why we use the oddness for sine and evenness for cosine to alter whatever that is if it's negative it's not that bad and it saves us a lot of headache this is going to give us just pi now what we do with that take that pi add it to your phase shift now if we haven't phase shifted well that would have been zero we would get whatever that is pi um with tangent we would have started not at zero but at negative pi over two with this because we shifted this to the right pi over four where you take pi over four your phase shift add your period that's how we always do this isn't it you take your start of your period and you add your period to it tangent does that cotangent all of them do that so pi over four plus pi is five pi over four that really is a period of pi now we're going to find the center and the quarters so we got phase shift we added the period we found the center and the quarters hopefully make sense of how we do that if you want to you can average them if it doesn't make sense in your head but one-fourth plus five-fourths divided by two is three-fourths so three pi over four then do the same thing here and here you got the appropriate ends center and quarters now look back at the functions we're dealing with we're dealing with sine think about what sine does sine has x-intercepts at the ends and center of your period that is shifted but it still relates so x intercepts at the ends and center the key points of first quarter one and third quarter negative one might be changed but we want to make sure we write them down so first quarter is pi over two comma one originally now we might change that but originally it's pi over two column one or first quarter comma one may be a better way to think of that and third quarter common negative one that's what sine does now aren't you glad that we did this form before we started doing our key points this is why this order is incredibly important it's going to lead you down the right road right road to success so now that we have our key points as they are and our our form correct this is not a reflection this was sort of a using oddness to change that sign and it's not going to reflect this and so we have this positive three as our factor that's going to be a vertical stretch there's only let's see one two there's three transformations here there's a shift to the right phase shift right power four there is a horizontal compression two pi into pi and as a vertical stretch one times three so one into three now we're ready to graph so we're gonna do that we're going to go up down and up i haven't gone any further that way i'm going to show you that zero would act like a third quarter of the previous period kind of miss that one just make the point bigger looks okay which looks like junk hopefully you get the idea that that that point is a little bit off um but that's that's about what this function would look like this would be at least your key points you'd have the shape of it the period of it you could do several cycles from it i hope that's making sense we're going to come back and show you what would happen if that was a cosine and deal with a very awkward period so hang on for that okay last one and we're going to go through it very quickly i'm actually going to shortcut some of the keys key points because i'm going to show you how to do that just from the period probably i've already figured that out if not it'll be pretty clear for you so let's take a look at 2 cosine negative 2 pi x minus 4 plus 3 that's crazy um form is incredibly important let's put it in the right form here's what we're going to do we're going to make this so that this looks pretty good but that our coefficient of x is positive 1. we're going to have to divide out negative 2 pi now when we do that negative 2 pi x divided by negative 2 pi is positive x that's great negative 4 divided by negative 2 pi is not great that's positive okay 4 divided by 2 pi is 2 over pi now we're ready to take a look at our shifting but that is really nasty 2 over pi is going to be a shift to the left of 2 divided by pi well that's not exactly negative 1. it's not exactly easy to it's not exactly anything that we can represent as a decimal in fact but you might have your calculator out handy to see where that actually is so let's go through this let's identify what our shifts are but before we do that if you remember the last example that negative on sine created a negative or a change or sign for our function cosine is an even function that means opposite inputs give you the same output what it means is that cosine of any negative angle is the same as cosine of the positive version of that angle in other words evenness means these are the same well that means i can change that sign and get the same thing i don't know if it makes any better but at least you have to deal with that negative now we can identify what our shifts are this has a vertical shift of up three and i've actually shown that one two three a vertical shift of up three this has a horizontal shift of left two over pi and we're going to show that now so my vertical shift is up 3 and then left 2 over pi so i've estimated that about where it is on the x-axis and related some points according to that you can see that in a second now we figure out what our period is so the period says take your two pi your original period for cosine divide by your coefficient which is also 2 pi and you're going to get 1. now add that to whatever your phase shift is wait a second negative 2 pi plus 1 is 1 minus 2 pi figure out where that is in relation to this is it positive is it negative it turns out that if i add negative 2 over pi plus 1 i get 1 minus 2 over pi that's about 0.36 then we figure out the center and the quarters which isn't really all that bad because if my period is one check it out this is a period of one one minus two pi minus negative two pi is one this is a period of one well what's half of one one half what's a quarter of one quarter what's three quarters of one three quarters and then just subtract two over pi from each of those that's the easy way to find out your n's your center and your quarters from here we just need to identify what cosine does cosine has the x-intercepts at the quarters at the ends and center you have 1 1 and negative 1. just multiply it because you have them right on the board here's your n's here's your center you can literally just say from here multiply 1 by that that number right there so 1 times 2 is 2 1 times this would be negative 1 times 2 is negative 2 and at your end your end is normally 1 multiply it by that number so at your end 1 times 2 gives you positive 2. i just wanted to show you a quick way to graph these exceptionally fast uh with remembering that cosine you're ends with your quarters and that they're sorry your intercepts are at your quarters and that your key points are n's comma one well multiply that if it had been negative two you'd reflect it and your center is uh negative one multiply that and you get wherever your key points end up being that that's without showing you these awkward key points comma one a negative one and then multiplying so i hope it makes sense i hope i'm showing you face shifting to your satisfaction remember there are some things where you can go backwards if i give you a phase shift and an amplitude we should be able to go backwards on that but it doesn't happen very often so i'll see you for another video we start talking about inverses have a great day you
