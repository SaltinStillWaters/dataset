Transcript for: Geometric Series (Precalculus - College Algebra 72)
welcome to another video with what we know about geometric sequences we're going to now learn geometric series so what a series does if you don't remember a series takes the terms of a sequence and adds them up so a geometric series says take your geometric sequence it's built on a geometric sequence you should be very familiar with that yes we're using k to match our series we've already talked about series but all we're doing is saying this is a geometric sequence this adds the terms from the first one to the one i tell you stop of that particular geometric sequence so geometric sequence series adds it up there's actually a formula for how to add that so here's what the formula says for a geometric series if you can identify your first term now i'm saying that very specifically because this will still work if you think about that as a first term it'll still work even if that's not k minus one i'm gonna show you right here in this example that i'm covering up i want to show you that so you take your first term divided by 1 minus r and multiply times 1 minus r to the n whatever that n is also you might notice at this point that most textbooks show this differently most textbooks have a sub 1 and then this divided by that i'm not doing that i'm doing not doing it for a very specific reason that you're going to see when we get the infinite series in the last half of this video so we'll talk about infinite series what do you mean can we add up the terms of a series forever and get something out wildly the answer is sometimes not all the time but if our common ratio is between a certain two numbers negative one one the answer is yes it converges it will add up to a certain value it's very fascinating um you're all very smart and you've made this far you're going to be just fine some of your brains are going to hurt a little bit because we're going to talk about taking a value to infinity and sometimes it hurts our heads when we talk about infinity so much so i'm going to i'm going to teach that to you but this is gonna be much better for that so what we're learning is we're taking a geometric sequence it has a common ratio and a starting value we're adding the terms up and this is the formula for how to do that so what we're going to do is we're going to take that series this is a geometric sequence maybe you can see it and we're going to add up the terms well now what we get out of that when we add it up is called a partial sum why partial well because you're adding for the first n terms you're not adding to infinity and therefore we consider that a partial sum so let's take a look at this example um now firstly how do we determine whether something is geometric at least a sequence of what the series is built or not well we have to have a starting term we see that three nights and conveniently they haven't simplified it made it one-third and we need to identify what you're multiplying by so how do i get from three to the first to three to the second to three to the third with the nines not changing well i'm multiplying by three by 3 by 3 by 3. my common ratio is 3 here and my starting term is 3 9. now i'm going to show you something that's really really nice when they give you a sequence or a series and it ends with a term that's based on n you do not have a lot of work to do your sequence is 3 to the n over 9. wait a minute is that easy it is you don't have to do the following if you do if you repeat what i showed you a long time ago with your your sequences you go well what's the first term first term is 3 9 and the second term is 3 squared over nine and the third term is three cubed over nine and if you remember that the whole goal was to get down to what the end term is it's to get down to that and what we did a long time because we said okay well what's not changing remember we wanted the same form find out what's not changing what's not changing well the 3 is not changing the 9 is not changing so this would be 3 to the first over 9 and 3 to the second over 9 and 3 to the third over 9 and we'd say whatever's not changing is going to end up in your formula and relate what is changing to your index so it's not changing 3 is not changing 9 is not changing and our whatever is changing our exponent here our exponent is exactly what our index is every time so 3 3 2 2 1 1 n n but that's exactly what they're telling you there so if they give you your sequence or your series and it ends with the nth term that nth term is your geometric sequence it's telling you that and you get exactly the same thing it's very convenient and so when we do this we say hey what's up what's our what's our formula for the sequence on which a series is built well it's just your nth term if it's in terms of now if they didn't give this to you then yeah you'd have to go through and do exactly what i've shown you but i've shown you that already it's it's the same thing that we've been doing as far as our series are concerned so we're going to take that we're going to write it with the appropriate index so watch this crucial nuance step is that if our sequence is the nth term is three to the n over nine notice number one the nine is not being raised to nth term it's just three to the nth over nine then if that's to the nth term remember that we have to match whatever this says so we need to say this sequence is three to the k over nine why why that because you'd start at one now imagine this plug in one you're going to get 3 to the first over 9. that's that plug in 2 3 to the second over 9 that's that plug in n 3 to the negative 3 to the nth over 9. that's why we have this as a different variable or index so that we're allowed to plug in something different to it and we can end with that nth term now if you're thinking that this looks different than that it does it looks a little bit different than how a geometric sequence normally does it's not what we're used to i really need this to make sense to you i said this is the first term not necessarily just a sub 1 for a reason and here's the reason it does not matter at all if this looks exactly like this this makes it easier a little bit but it doesn't matter all you have to be able to do promise is the case is identify your first term and identify your common ratio so let's talk about the first term how do you identify the first term the first term is always identifiable by taking this and plugging it in so even though it doesn't look like that take one plug it in here 3 to the first is 3 over 9 is 3 9. that's exactly what we have here and that's exactly how you can fill out this partial sum which is kind of nice now the common ratio it is more difficult to see if you don't have it written like that it's not hard to do but just think about the thing that's being multiplied what's changing here what's inside of the thing being raised to the power well it's three three is your common ratio so your first term is three nights you find it by plug in one every single time your common ratio is three now could you write it differently yes that's why i have a different example here so here's what you would do if you really needed to match up first thing is you'd strip off that 1 9 that's in there so that would give you 1 9 times 3 to the k because 9 is not being raised to the k power that's perfectly appropriate to do the other issue though is that that says k minus 1 and that one doesn't so what do you do well that doesn't say k minus one you can change it but you have to really think outside the box here i know that looks funny but i want you to really think about it is it true is it true that 3 to the k is the same thing as 3 to the k minus 1 plus 1. well k minus 1 plus 1 would just give you k so again it's true this is the way that you reduce a power so you write this as minus one plus one and think how how do you connect addition of exponents well that has to happen via some sort of multiplication so the only way exponents are added is if they came from common bases being multiplied so think backwards on this three to the k minus one times three to the first you would add k minus one plus one that would give you k minus 1 plus 1 which would give you k this is the same but it's taken and stripped off a power and you can always do that it's it's not as hard as what i've i've explained it to you this is explaining why it works but it's really not that bad to strip off one factor from any sort of exponent and reduce the exponent by one we actually could do it all the time just think about it for a second if you had three to the seventh couldn't you write that as three to the six times three to the first yeah we do all the time we do it when we factor all the time we just think well yeah seven is six plus one so it'll be pretty easy well isn't this seven minus one yeah that's exactly what that is you're subtracting one from the the x to the power the exponent and then you're using one of those powers to represent some sort of a constant and that's exactly what we're doing here so we can take this and say hey this right here that 3 to the k you could write it as 3 times 3 to the k minus 1. that's exactly what we've done here 3 to the first times 3 to the k minus 1. if we put that 1 9 back so 1 9 here this is written as 3 times 3 to the k minus 1 and if you simplify that yeah these really should be written a little bit better i'm going to do this there that's better that matches what we have here this is in if you take a look at it if you match it perfectly to this so you start at one that's a sub one that's your common ratio to an exponent it says this should be your first term well it is three ninths is one third this should be your common ratio it is it's three now could you find the same thing by just plugging in one yes i've said that to you if you plug in one three to the first is three over nine that is one third this is your common ratio of three now which way is better it doesn't really matter as far as finding the sum so what we've done so far is we've identified what a geometric series is we've gone through an example shown that if they give you at the term you find your series very easily and now we're going to find the sum of these series i'm going to show you it gives you the same thing no matter which of these you actually write so let's give it a try here's what a geometric series adds up to in a partial sum again partial means you're not going to infinity and so you consider this to be up to a certain point now we're going to go from the first term all the way to the nth term well what does that mean you just leave the n that's okay here's what this says find your first term divide by 1 minus the common ratio and then multiply 1 minus your common ratio to the nth power whatever that power is so let's identify the first term this way it's pretty easy because it matches up perfectly okay your first term it fits the model perfectly your first term is 1 3 divided by you take 1 minus your common ratio that's 1 minus three so we have first term one third here one minus common ratio one minus three times 1 minus 3 to the n this needs to be simplified so you don't leave it one third over one month you just take a little bit of time and simplify that so one-third divided by negative two is negative one-sixth times 1 minus 3 to n there's not much you can do to simplify that let's see if it gives the same thing here now remember even though this is not fitting this model all this means is find your first term and find your common ratio let's find the first term how you find the first term is just plug in that number if i plug in this number well our first term would be 3 to the first over 9. why i'm not going back to here is what if you're given this without this what if you don't have that you can't just say yeah first term which is one-third but plug in the value so plug in one three to the first just three over nine is one-third notice it's giving you the same thing identify what's on the inside of your parentheses being raised to the power that is your common ratio so our common ratio is three and if you simply understand that this really does stand for the first term and you can find it by just plugging in that value it's going to save you a lot of time here and a lot of time in calculus 2. because a lot of times we have to if you don't realize that you have to manipulate a lot of junk to get it to fit the exact model just to find out what the first term is when it's very simple you just plug that in it's going to tell you your first term and you put it on your numerator it's plain and simple you can see it's exactly the same now this is adding up to a partial sum of the first n terms what if what if we just wanted to add the first 12 terms what would you do in either case if you're going to a finite number of terms this will add it this says if you're going to the 12th term then you're gonna do exactly the same thing your first term here one minus your common ratio that's what that says and then one minus your common ratio to whatever your n is in our case we change this to negative 1 6 1 minus the common ratio to the 12th power that's all there would be to it 3 the 12th is fairly large so i really don't want to do that but you take 1 minus 3 to the 12th and then multiply whatever that is that is times negative 1 6. it will give you whatever these terms add up to that's pretty fascinating so if you took 1 3 and 9 9 and 27 ninths and all of those things and added those fractions up for the first 12 terms you're going to get exactly what this tells you i ended up getting 88 573 and one-third i just couldn't leave it alone i had to figure out what that was so i hope that made any sense i really hope that you're seeing that these two things are equivalent i've shown that to you and that you are are ultimately going to get the same sum whether you write it in the same exact format or not just realizing that all that's really asking for is the first term what we're going to do now is we're going to come back we're talking about infinite series these were partial this was going to a finite number i could have stopped at 5 i could have gone to 50. it's in the same way you're just plugging in whatever your exponent is it's very nice because it's only in one spot that's very convenient so we'll come back and talk about when a geometric series will add up to a finite number with an infinite number of terms okay here we go last little bit talking about infinite geometric series what in world does entail what if i didn't stop and i just added up all the terms of this geometric series sequence from the first term all the way to infinity so i never stop adding them up is there a time when this is going to add to a finite number that's a wild thought and can really hurt your head a little bit if we start thinking about infinity that's not possible it is possible and i'm gonna prove it to you but only certain cases so we're gonna figure out when a geometric series will what's called converge add up to a finite number or diverge add up to either positive or negative infinity it will be one of those two cases that's the only two things that we can possibly have with a series adding to a number or not all right well let's figure out what in the world happens i want you to look at the subtle changes i made between the last part of this video and this part instead of going from one and stopping at n this is now an infinite series i start the first term i don't end that goes to infinity now we still have a sum this is the sum of every single geometric series ever and i know that if you see this in your textbook that's not there we're going to talk about why right now so on a partial sum you have the ability to stop right you have the ability to stop somewhere and say all right i can plug in a value here here's when you should know when this series is going to converge or diverge i really need to listen very carefully about this let's imagine that n goes to infinity so a certain thing kind of a limit idea what would happen if n goes to infinity if i just don't end what would that happen well r your common ratio this is key your common ratio would be raised to a really really really big exponent infinity is this always going to be infinity now you might be thinking well man if i take a constant comma ratio and i i multi i just you know take infinite power it's just going to be really big or maybe really negative but it's just going to be really really big is it though let's think about this what would happen if this value is i don't know two well then two to the infinity would be infinity but what would happen if that was one half think about the values of of fractions when you start multiplying them so one half times one-half is one-fourth one-half to the third power is one-eighth one-half to the fourth power is one-sixteenth what would one-half to the infinity power be well that would be one one to any power is one but how about two two to the infinity power would be infinity now this is the key what would one divided by infinity be close to will be close to zero so wait a second if i take certain values of common ratios i take them to an infinite power this part goes to zero not infinity what's one minus zero well one minus zero is just one so if i have certain values of a common ratio this part actually disappears why because that common ratio to infinity power would be zero one minus zero would be one one times whatever i have is whatever i have by the multiplicative identity that one is i would just get this for my infinite series but only if get this only if r is a certain range of numbers what are those numbers you can't just say fractions because some fractions are greater than one but one and negative 1 are the cutoffs here man i hope i made that make sense to you i kind of went through it fairly quickly but the idea is if r is between negative 1 and 1 then when you take it to the infinite power you're going to get close to zero you can say that two ways if r is a fraction between negative one and one or if the absolute value of r is less than one these two things need to be the same same in your head you go yeah okay absolute value wise these make the same same thing if this is true then your partial sum when i take r to the infinity if we have a fraction when you take fractions to exponents as exponents get larger those fractions get smaller one minus r to the infinity if r is a fraction between negative one and one this is going to go to zero if this goes zero one minus zero is one this times one gives you this but only if r is between these two values so this only what we call converges has a finite sum if r is between negative one and one so what happens if one if r is one or more so outside of this interval so less than negative one or more than one or equal to negative 1 and 1. that's what this says what if the absolute value of r is greater than 1 or equal to 1. well if it's equal to 1 then what we would get here is we would get 1 but this would count for whatever first term is for infinity so you'd have like maybe that's one ninth one-ninth plus one-ninth plus one-ninth plus one-ninth plus i don't know i don't care how many times you add one-ninth if you do it infinity times you're going to get infinity this would be diverging or this would diverge what if a r is more than that like two well it's going to diverge even quicker so if r is outside that interval so imagine that imagine r is a number like two two to the infinity is infinity you're you're smoked you're done because one minus something that's infinity is negative infinity i don't care what you have here it's not going to be zero something times negative infinity is going to be negative infinity unless it's negative it's positive infinity but you're not going to get a finite cell so the long story that i just explained is important but i hope that you understand this this more concise wrap up if you have fractions between negative one and one when you take them to the infinite power you get zero and that means that this part is gone and this would be your sum but it only works if that part goes to zero and that part only goes to zero if this happens if your common ratio an absolute value is less than one or other words between negative one and one a fraction less than one raised to a power gets smaller that's what we needed to make that not be infinity on the cons on the contrary if your common ratio is more than one that keeps growing this whole thing goes to infinity and if your commemoration is more than one that's what's going to happen every single time we call that diverge or diverges we can say divergent you might have noticed something too you better know something this is not even going to be here this is the formula that's in your textbook but i just showed you why that was so why is this why did i write it that way why i write as a sub 1 over 1 minus r times some other piece instead of the way your textbook writes it as this they usually write it as what i have here over 1 minus r this shows you what happens with this if r is less than 1 the absolute value that's gonna go to zero and then one minus zero goes to one that's great this gives you the formula for an infinite series this is exactly what the formula for an infinite geometric series is that's where it comes from but here's the thing you might have noticed that no matter what r is you can still plug it in couldn't you you could still find out what your first term is and you still plug in an r this means that you're able to find some solutions that mean nothing if your r is more than one or equal to one so don't can't equal one it's going to be zero but don't don't be plugging in things if you know it's done if it diverges so here's the order of operations of figuring out your infinite series number one find your common ratio number two determine if it's in the range of numbers that interval that allows this series to converge to a finite sum if it's not just write divergence and you are done give me 30 problems that diverge probably think i'm tricking you uh but right just right right diverges if your common ratio is more than one you're done now if it's not then you find your first term just plug in one whatever it is plug in your first term and then divide by one microphone ratio and it's very easy it's not bad so we're gonna run through our five examples here i'll reiterate this i'll talk about how um taking that partial sum and letting your n go to infinity is how we're finding this and what would happen if your r is less than uh one in absolute value so we take a look at it is that a geometric series well yeah it's got a it's got a common ratio it's being raised to an exponent is an infinite series yeah it's got infinity so that we're getting used to this right now the first thing we do is we identify what our common ratio is so our common ratio is one-third it's always the thing in parentheses being raised to the exponent in general it's the thing being raised to the exponent so our common ratio is one-third now classify it if our common ratio is between negative one and one this infinite series will converge and we talked about why if i take one-third to the second power let me get one-ninth how about you the hundredth power well i'm going to get something really really small in fact to the infinite power so small it doesn't matter so the formula we had before says if my one-third goes here and my n gets absurdly large then this gets absurdly small one-third to the infinity is going to be zero one minus zero is one that's why that partial sum actually works for an infinite series because this disappears but only if your fraction is between negative 1 1. that's exciting that's very interesting we're using some pretty cool stuff here most people never get that they never see that ever so we're going to determine our common ratio we're going to say this fits here this is less than one absolute value that means that this series will converge and now after we've determined that it converges we're going to find the sum you see it's really pointless to say diverges and then try to find the sum when you say that this diverges you're saying the sum goes to infinity that's what you're saying so divergence says it doesn't go to a number goes most of the time goes to infinity or negative infinity so you're saying that right here saying it doesn't have a sum that's what diverges me doesn't have a finite sum okay so it doesn't have a finite sum why would you go and find it if it diverges if it converges it's saying it does have a finite sum now once we determine it converges we find it how we always find the sum of the geometric series is find your first term then divide it by one minus common ratio so what i always do i just plug in one i don't care what form it is it does not matter just plug in one so one minus one is zero one third to the zero power is one and eight times one is eight what i walked you through that whole one minus one is zero thing that's why this is written as first term here because if i plug in one one minus one is always zero combination zero power is always one and one times this is always going to give you first term so that's why that's your first term here is eight then divide by one minus common ratio and simplify it a little bit so this is eight over two thirds i think we get 12 out of that number of ways you do it use your calculator eight divided by two thirds uh you could do eight divided by two times three that would give us 12. uh you could multiply both the numerator and denominator by three and get 24 over two which would also give us 12. now i mean the first time i saw this kind of bloom of mine like wait a minute you're telling me that i can take this and i can start writing out my my terms of my series like you plug in 1 you get 8 plug in 2 you get 8 over three plug in three you get eight over nine uh and i could i could do that forever and then add them all up and it's going to equal 12 like exactly yeah that's exactly what this means why is because that fraction being between negative 1 and 1 when i take that to very very large terms ends up being 0 it all matches up to give you 12. it's a fascinating piece of math let's move on a little bit so we have another geometric series we know oh can you identify your common ratio can you right now look at this and say common ratio is the thing that's being raised to the power it's not one half it's three can you identify your first term if you had to well it fits our form and so our first term would be one half or plug in one one minus one is zero zero three to the zero power is one one times one half is one half now before we find any sort of sum we need to identify the two things that are very very important number one we already did r is three so if r is three think about what that means if our common ratio is three three is not less than one three is more than greater than or equal to one now why would that make a difference imagine plugging in three here think about this this is the formula for a partial sum we're just letting this go to infinity it's only part of this that can change because we're the only part we're letting go to infinity so if this goes to infinity then 3 to the infinity is enormous 1 minus that is really negative and that's our first term we're going to have this is going to negative infinity there's no way that this could ever go to 0 because 3 to the infinity is enormous so this would diverge and that's why i'm trying to walk you through why this makes sense again and again so that it'll stick with you so this says yeah your comma ratio is more than one in absolute value it's going to diverge for the reasons we just talked about so would it benefit you to do that what a benefit you take your first term divide by one minus your common ratio uh one minus three notice how you can get an answer but notice that we already said it's going to negative infinity and i showed you that right here this is nonsense it's absolutely useless this only works if this thing goes to zero this thing only goes to zero if your common ratio is less than one in absolute value the only way it works so if you just if you go well i mean i'm just taking this piece of it look what you're missing you're really missing this this is the formula this only disappears if r is less than one so this is the formula with this here and you start eliminating this piece the only way you can eliminate it is if your r is less than one if your r is three then really what you would have here is the missing piece that you're taking for granted that works even though it doesn't it's it's not going to work for divergences if you write diverges that's going to infinite in this case uh no actually positive v because that right there would give you a negative so that would go to infinity and you cannot add this up it's impossible here's what i hope you're seeing right now i hope you're seeing that the only reason this disappeared from our partial sum to an infinite sum is because that piece goes to zero in certain cases if that piece is not going to zero because it does not qualify for those certain cases you basically can't eliminate it and then this does not work without that piece and with that piece it goes to infinity that's the idea so we don't want to show that let's move on to this guy so we have a series of from k equals 1 to infinity of 3 to the negative two-thirds to the k minus one negative two-thirds of the k-minus one first thing we always do we identify with a common ratio is in our case the common ratio the thing being raised to the power is negative two-thirds we look back over here where we think about it just thinking about it is enough think about how your partial sum was this and now i'm trying to plug in negative two-thirds that's a fraction less than one fractions less than one between negative one and one raised to infinite powers or raised any powers get smaller and smaller and smaller this thing if i raise it to the infinity is going to be close to zero that disappears one minus zero is one i get this i get that sum out of it and that's why this is so valuable so i know that because of that because my combination is between negative one and one this will converge it will go to a finite sum all right if it converges well you need to find out what it converges to so let's find our first term because we know that's going to work let's find our first term either plug in 1 or if it fits your model perfectly take your first term it's going to be three y minus one is zero negative two thirds to the zero power is one and one times three is three divided by one minus my common ratio of negative two-thirds just be careful on your signs you are subtracting a negative so you're going to be adding that so let's see three-thirds plus two-thirds is five-thirds that's going to be nine-fifths so if i add all the terms from here to infinity from three to infinity you're going to get a sum of nine fifths really really cool stuff i hope i'm making it make sense that you're seeing why this piece goes did disperse if r is between negative one and one i hope you're seeing that and why it doesn't if r is greater than one in absolute value okay just two more so we're taking a look at this we're gonna move a little bit quicker on these things uh this next one we have an infinite series from one to infinity we're identifying what our common ratio is the thing being raised to the exponent we identify that first always then we classify it is this uh is this common ratio between negative one and one or is it outside negative one and one in other words is the absolute value less than one or not well the absolute value of this is five fourths five fourths is one and one fourth this is greater than one absolute value or it's it fails to be in our interval from negative one to one this is not going to converge this diverges we always determine that before we find the sum so at this point here's what this says if your common ratio does not fit a convergent model and it diverges then we say there's no sense in finding the sum because this is either going to be positive or negative infinity this is not going to add up to a finite number therefore this formula does not work because we'd be missing this piece and this piece would go to infinity that's what happens when r is greater than one and you take it to an infinity it goes to infinity as well either positive or negative and so this says now we're not going to get there that diverges don't go any further don't use this formula because it doesn't make sense to do without that piece and that piece says infinity last one so the sum from one to infinity of three times two thirds to the k let's identify our common ratio first notice it doesn't have to look exactly like that our common ratio is just the thing that's being raised to the exponent it's two-thirds well let's let's classify that does that fit in converges or diverges think about it if two-thirds is our common ratio and that's between negative one and one or that's a fraction less than one absolute value then when i take it to infinity it's gonna go to zero one minus zero is one this falls out i get this as my formula that's exactly what we're looking for so we say yes this does converge that's exactly what this says our common ratio and absolute value is less than one it is going to add up to a finite sum that's really cool and now we can find it all we have to remember is that when you're adding this up you need to find your first term and put it on your numerator that's what that says that's why i put first term there so your first term is not 3. now i've been prefacing this with every example we've actually found a sum before but i always do this i take 1 and i plug it in whatever you get is your first term that's what the 1 means so if i plug in 1 i get 2 3 to the first power ah not 0 power i get 2 3 to the first power times 3. so this when i plug in 1 is my first term and then 1 minus r could you take the time to manipulate this to make it fit that model exactly yes and i showed you how to do that in the previous example i'm not going to do that i really am not the same because it's it's a lot easier just to understand what this is talking about what this is talking about is take your first term whatever it is how do you find your first term plug in that number so if i plug in that number and take that on my numerator divide by 1 minus a common ratio take that on my denominator and then simplify it so 3 times 2 thirds is two over one third one minus two thirds is one third that's gonna give me six so if i have all the terms from one to infinity i'm going to get exactly six i hope that that you had a little hope you had fun i hope you enjoyed thinking about the infinity and when that would go to zero and when it wouldn't and how that affects going from a partial sum where that is to an infinite sum where this either goes to infinity or it goes to zero depending on what your common ratio is i hope it made that make sense that you really really see it if you can then this this really if you've taken calculus 2 you understand how this idea will really help you there or probably would have helped you if you would have known that before taking account too so if you're you're going to get there eventually when you get there this idea of understanding how infinity works with fractions can be very very very valuable which is why i'm teaching it to you now so hopefully i've explained it in such a way that you understand what's going on with that that formula i know that your textbook will not show this to you for an infinite series i did so that you understand where it's coming from in relationship to a partial sum which they show a little bit differently so i hope you enjoyed it i hope you got the concept and i want to see you for the next video when we talk about proofs with mathematical induction have a good day
