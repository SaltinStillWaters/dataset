Transcript for: Finding ALL Solutions of Polynomials (Precalculus - College Algebra 37)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to try to find all the zeros all the solutions to a polynomial including some complex ones so i'm going to walk you through about six examples uh the first two were given a complex solution we find the rest of them including real solutions then we're going to remember to not forget about factoring and then lastly we're going to start from scratch and find every single solution that we can i'll show you exactly how to go through and do that from a polynomial so um i do want to admit that the first two examples are sort of contrived because i'm giving you a complex solution first and while that is possible to do it's not very likely so i'm going to admit that the first two are are kind of like would these would these really happen probably not we'd probably find real zeros first if there are any but if there aren't any then we're left with the idea of find a complex solution first the the reason why i'm going through these is because this is going to teach you how to do long division of polynomials without a linear factor with a quadratic factor an irreducible quadratic factor and that can be an important concept as you get into something like calculus 2 when we do some of the uh like a partial decomposition fractions right before that you learn how to do long division and so we're going to be doing that sort of as a preface and if you happen to get a problem like this where you do have a complex zero how to structure it so we're going to start right away with this example x cubed minus 4x squared plus 4x minus 16. and i'm going to tell you that it has a 0 of 2i or a solution a complex solution of 2i and that's a complex solution of course it'd be 0 plus 2i that would be the real part plus the imaginary part and we're going to find the rest of them so here's a couple things to refresh your memory about polynomials if you have a degree 3 then there are going to be exactly three solutions to that now some might be repeated but there will be three solutions given one we should be able to find the other two in complex numbers this is always true so we if we have a degree of three for a polynomial you are going to have three solutions so here's the idea for all we're gonna do today number one we're gonna find a zero if they give you one awesome if not we're probably gonna have to fall back on the rational zeros theorem to find our own zeros number two we're going to create a factor if you have a real zero well then you're going to create a linear factor and you're going to use synthetic division and that's really quick if you don't have a real zero if you have a complex zero then the thought process as we learned in the last video if you have a complex zero they always come in complex conjugate pairs they come in pairs so we're going to take a pair of zeros get a pair of factors distribute that and get an irreducible quadratic factor so create a factor for linear this comes from a real zero using negative synthetic division a quadratic for a complex pair so two complex numbers give you two factors you distribute to get rid of the complex that's why we practice that and then we have to do long division because synthetic division will not handle that after that we try to factor the rest or you repeat this find another zero create another factor or pair of factors which gives you an irreducible quadratic and divide again or synthetic division so that's the whole thought process also on this first example we're going to sort of ignore that you can factor that but in real practices you would never you would not do what i'm doing you would absolutely group this factor by grouping and you'd be done i'm just showing you on an easy example so that we get the idea of what to do with that what to do with long division with something that number one is a little easier number two students make a lot of mistakes on not because it's not easy but because they don't know what to do when you distribute and you're missing a term so i'm going to show you how to do that it's a very important example for that so let's get started number one we're going to find a zero and if it has one awesome if it's linear oh sorry if it's a real zero you create a linear factor so if we would have got like hey it's negative 4 then we write x plus 4 and we have ourselves a linear factor here we have a complex solution and so we have 2i but we also know that complex solutions or complex zeros come in conjugate pairs so we automatically get one for free so 2i we also know that negative 2i which is the conjugate 0 plus 2i and 0 minus 2i are conjugates that's also a solution complex solutions always come in pairs like that and so now what we're going to do is we're going to create some factors we've done this before but we're going to create x minus 2i equals 0 and x plus 2i equals 0. this is the way we go from solutions to factors it's sort of using the zero product property to say hey listen if these are zeros well then you can subtract 2i and get x minus 2y equals zero but that would come from some polynomial factored being set equal to zero and using zero product property so we basically go backwards and say that's a factor and that's a factor what we do here is quite important you see with long division of polynomials or a synthetic division this doesn't work with complex numbers and so we have to at least distribute to get rid of those complex numbers what we're going to do is we're going to distribute this this is pretty nice this is already set up in conjugate form it looks like a difference of squares sort of and so when we distribute we get x squared we would get plus 2ix and minus 2ix well those are going to cancel this is always the case when you're multiplying complex conjugate factors like this and then we're going to get minus 4 i squared remembering what i squared is i squared is just negative 1 that's all it is so x squared minus 4 i squared is really x squared minus four times negative one or x squared minus negative four well that's x squared plus four what i squared does is essentially just change the sign of that term that's really all it does this right now we think through it we said okay hey that's a zero complex conjugate pair says that also gives us a zero now that we have these two zeros we can create some factors no problem we got it now they have complex numbers in it let's distribute to get ourselves an irreducible quadratic that irreducible quadratic is a factor of this polynomial right there it has to be because it came from the zeros it's a must so this is what we're going to factor out or divide out from our polynomial i'm going to show you how to do that synthetic division will not do it and this is why i taught you long division so we could do this and why i'm doing this is so that later on when you get to some things that you have to do long division for you're at least prepared a little bit and so we're going to divide our original polynomial by the factor that we got from multiplying our complex linear factors or our fact of the sort of linear factors factors that have linear factors that have complex numbers in there we have to distribute those and then we get a irreducible quadratic factor now let's go ahead and divide it this works the same way as any other long division it's just that you're not dividing by x you're dividing by in this case x squared so let's go ahead and divide what we're going to do same as always is take our first term divided by our first term i'm going to show you for a couple times so x cubed divided by x squared this is what we're doing x cubed divided by x squared the rest of this is just going to play along and that gives you x to the first power and then we're going to distribute remember that this is the way long division always works you divide and then you distribute and then you subtract so when we distribute we get x to the third power plus 4x that goes under here you'll wait a minute what am i x squareds well you don't have any in this case you see you're missing that middle term because this is one of those sort of special irreducible quadratics that came from a 2y minus 2i rather than like a 3 minus 2i case in which that's going to have a middle term i'm going to show you that one as well as well we have two examples here so when that happens i always give myself a little place holder saying hey here's my x to the third power that has to match i don't have any x squared because there's no x to multiply and then plus 4x so i'm always matching up what my my terms are and the reason why i do that is because on the next step we're about to subtract so you've seen this before you see me do this parentheses this cues my brain into i'm subtracting each and every one of those terms so i'm taking x cubed minus x cubed negative 4x squared minus 0x squared and this is the reason why i put that 0x squared if i don't do that it's often that i'll subtract these and get 0. subtract these and get zero and go i have nothing left what did i do wrong by putting that there i make sure that i'm actually performing a subtraction concept and i basically bring down that term but if i don't do that most of the time i forget so negative 4x squared minus 0 is negative 4x squared 4x minus 4x is 0 minus 16. so i'm going to put 0x there just to keep my my term i don't necessarily need it but i put it there just to keep that like a place value holder and so then i'm going to take my first term and divide by my first term again so negative 4x squared divided by x squared we're going to get negative 4 and so we're going to write minus 4. and that basically completes our division we're just going to go through the distribution to make certain that what we do gives us a zero remainder if it does then we've done this right if it doesn't we've made a mistake on our division because we already know that that has to be a zero and that has to be a zero these have to be factors and if we've distributed correctly then that is an irreducible quadratic factor of what we've been given so it has to work it has to give us a 0. so let's distribute make sure that happens negative 4 times x squared is negative 4x squared i don't have any x's so there's still a 0x and then negative 4 times 4 is minus 16. and this looks perfect because when we subtract we're gonna get negative four x squared minus negative four x squared that's zero zero x minus zero x is zero i made a mistake i don't know why that's fourteen weird negative 16 minus negative 16 is also zero well that's that gives us a lot of confidence that what we did is perfect division and that's that's fantastic so here's what this means for us what this means for us is that we have now found a quadratic factor we've divided out and we're left with our quotient of x minus four that's a linear factor that means that we can't really go any further and this says that our polynomial if you needed to write this in factored form you could write it a number of ways so the first way that you could write this you could write this as factors with complex this would take our degree three and say you now have three factors you have x minus four that's a that's including a real solution you have x minus 2y we have that here x plus 2y you have that here this is factored over the complex number system if you have to show factor over the real number system then you just say well you know what we've done that when we go ahead and distribute these complex factors we get an irreducible quadratic but that irreducible quadratic is only irreducible over the real number system and that would show factorization over the real number system that's good and lastly if you need to show all of your zeros so if you show all your solutions we already really had one we got another one for free and lastly we know that if we set x minus four equal to zero we can use the zero product property again so x minus four would equal zero x would equal 4. that'd be a multiplicity 1 that'd be a cross that fits our paradigm that that's an odd that's an odd polynomial odd power function it has to cross the x-axis at least once and it does right there that's our only x-intercept it is a cross look at the multiplicity one that's got to make sense to you and then we have two complex solutions this probably gives us some sort of turning points that don't interact with our x-axis so that's what i want you to know about this so the main things here are if you're even complex you automatically have another multiply those factors first to give yourself an irreducible quadratic then divide it out and deal with what you have here sometimes you'll have to continue to factor that if you don't you're good like here this is this is fine we had basically two factors wrapped up here here's our third factor that's a degree three degree three means three factors if you factor over the complex degree three means three solutions all the time if you include complex solutions and sometimes multiplicity so let's go on to the next example here this next one is g of x this is clearly not factorable they don't have we don't have a gcf in there this is not going to work with factoring by grouping so we're really left to we need to know a factor in order sorry a 0 in order to create a factor in order to divide this so the zero that we have either comes from like rational zeros theorem this is the most often case like where you have you know nothing about it and you start plugging in numbers and those numbers come from that list that we learned about go okay well that would work and then i divide out a linear factor by synthetic division it's actually fairly quick that's the last two examples we do today in this video but here they've given us a 0 3 minus 2y and so we're going to go through the same process just please be aware with one complex solution you really can't do much as far as factoring that you can't because you can't do long division polynomials with a complex number it doesn't work and so what we're going to do is we're going to use the idea of if you give me one complex zero i automatically know another one they always come in pairs by the quadratic formula they have to they always come in pairs and so we're going to take those complex conjugate pairs build a pair of factors so find a zero we got one create a factor hey a quadratic comes from a complex pair let's get a pair let's cut let's let's distribute them let's get a irreducible quadratic and let's factor that out so we're going to start with that so we look at it we go okay i want to find all the zeros of the polynomial in your head right now you should be thinking there's gonna be how many there's gonna be four of them that's a degree four there should be four zeros and four factors over the complex number system can i factor it no i can't do i have a zero can i find zero yep i have one that's three minus two i and when that's complex you have to find a pair if it's real you're good if it's a real number like i said over here it was gonna be four so if it's a real number well then x minus 4 is your factor and do synthetic division or long division and you're good but with a complex you need a pair of them so uh 3 minus 2i oh yeah the pair would be 3 plus 2i and we're going to go through the process of of creating those factors i showed you this in another video where when you have a complex solution really take the time don't just go straight to the factor write these as equal to zero and then group your first two terms to create this sort of two term times two term multiplication so we're going to subtract three and add 2i subtract 3 and subtract 2y and these right here become our complex factors but i hope you remember that this is really difficult to distribute if you just take three terms times three terms that gets really nasty and so what i taught you in another video was just group these first two and group these first two on a complex conjugate pair your real part is the same the three and the three it's always the same and so when we subtract that you're going to get the same exact expression on both of your complex conjugate factors both of them are going to have in this case an x minus 3. group that group that and then these become your factors and we treat them like they're one two terms one two terms so when we distribute it's much nicer it creates this conjugate factor for us where the middle terms cancel when we just have x minus three squared it's a lot easier we've studied in another video so i'm not going to go into it fully right now but this is the way that we're going to go ahead and distribute because it's so much nicer than treating this as three terms times three terms okay so we had a complex zero we got another one for free we created complex factors regrouped the first two terms and now we have this sort of conjugate not really sort of i guess it is sort of because this is not really one term but a conjugate look to our factors when we distribute this we're going to distribute x minus 3 times x minus 3 we get x minus 3 squared if you were to distribute you'd get minus and plus the same exact thing that's going to cancel it's going to give you 0. so then we're going to distribute 2y times negative 2i that's minus 4i squared we talked earlier about a couple things that refresh your memory number one when you are doing this and multiplying complex conjugate factors like you're doing here you will always get a minus you'll always get an i squared which will change this to a plus every single time also why we're doing this again is that you cannot divide this on a polynomial over the real number system it doesn't it doesn't work so we basically have to have a pair we have to have these two factors we have to distribute and we have to simplify this into an irreducible quadratic so when we do that this gives us x squared minus 6x plus 9 minus 4i squared just remember that that 4i squared is really plus 4. that i squared is negative 1. and so subtracting 4 times negative 1 well that's really adding 4. so here's what we know about that we know that this right here is an irreducible quadratic but we also know because it came from two things that we were assured were solutions to this polynomial that the factors we created created another factor for that polynomial in other words this has to divide that for sure so we're going to show that and so we're going to do long division because synthetic division is certainly not going to take care of that for you synthetic division works only for linear factors and only when your x it has a coefficient of 1. so let's go ahead and let's divide we've already got this set up appropriately where every single power less than our degree is represented including a constant if there was no constant you could factor that because everything would have an x in it that of gcf you could lease back to that we have our irreducible quadratic yes you must have that to do long division polynomials it is an irreducible quadratic linear factors with complex numbers do not work and so now we're going to divide again it's just your first term divided by your first term and here this is actually a little bit easier than this one because everything matches up term for term so we're going to see that so when we start dividing we're going to take x to the fourth divided by x squared x to the fourth over x squared gives us x squared so when we multiply we're going to distribute your first term should always be the same when you distribute if not you chose the wrong thing x squared times negative six x is minus six x to the third and then plus thirteen x squared we always put parentheses we always subtract we always remember that i'm subtracting term by term x to the fourth minus x to the fourth is zero that's what we need to happen negative nine x cubed minus a negative so that's plus six x to the third is negative three x to the third 21x squared minus 13x squared that's going to give us 8x squared and we're going to bring down 21x and do the same thing again so we take our first term negative 3x to the third divided by x squared well it's going to give us negative 3x so we write minus 3x and we're going to distribute again so x squared or negative 3x times x squared is negative 3x squared that looks good negative 3x cubed i meant to say then negative 3x times negative 6x is positive 18x squared negative 3x times positive 13 well that looks like negative 39x we have to be really careful on signs here so negative 3x cubed minus negative 3x cubed that's zero that's perfect 8x squared minus 18x squared that's negative 10x squared 21x minus negative 39x so that's adding 39x that's going to give us 60x and our last step so we're going to take a look at this and we're going to divide our first term by our first term again notice how the long division of polynomials is really just based on the first term and everything else just gets distributed and plays along that's how it works looks really confusing the first time you see it you know what am i supposed to do with all this just focus on your first terms you're going to be fine so negative 10x squared divided by x squared gives you negative 10. we're going to put -10 we're going to distribute one last time and just make sure that our remainder is 0. negative 10 times x squared is negative 10x squared negative 10 times negative 6x is plus 60x looking good negative 10 times 13 is negative 130 and we can tell when we subtract when we subtract something from itself we get zero and so that's perfect that's exactly what we want now what do you do from here well what we've just done is we've reduced this polynomial we've we've factored it into two quadratics now we already know that one of them is irreducible this is an irreducible quadratic you cannot break that down anymore but this one's not this can be factored so there's the first step in how we factor this polynomial we have two quadratics this one came from our linear factors that had complex numbers in so we're not going to be able to factor that in any other way factoring is unique to a polynomial so you're done for this one this one came from these two unless you want to break that down into linears that have complex which you can do we're just going to leave that we basically use that quadratic to figure out what was left now this one you need to go a little bit further on that so x squared minus 3x minus 10 that's factorable as x minus 5 and x plus 2. this would be completely factored over the real number system so this is good to go as far as real number system if you have a factor over the uh the complex number system well then you would go back and you'd say all right there's x minus five there's x plus two and we actually already have those factors x minus 3 minus 2i and x minus 3 plus 2i that came right from here this would be completely factored over the complex number system so you have 1 2 3 four factors that's a degree four that matches up how many solutions do we have well using the zero product property going kind of quick on it we'd have x equals five and negative two and x equals three minus 2i and 3 plus 2i we already knew this one we got this one for free and then we just figured out these two from that quadratic that's the process of going through and solving these so we have a degree four we have four complex factors we have a degree four we have four complex solutions we have a degree four over the real number system you have an irreducible quadratic because that gave you complex solutions i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing the interplay between this stuff the last thing i need to mention to you about this before we go any further what if that was not factorable most of the time it's going to be because you're working out of a textbook or something but what if that's not factorable then what you would do is you would use the quadratic formula so you do quadratic formula it will give you two solutions whether they're real or complex i can't guarantee you it could very well be the case that you have a degree for with all complex solutions that's possible what if you have a degree four could look like this where it doesn't intersect the x axis at all you're going to have four complex solutions here we know we intersect the x axis and it's a multiplicity one multiplicity 1 so we cross the x-axis at those two x-values we know that it goes down and it comes back up and it probably does something some weird little loop that doesn't interact with the x-axis we get a picture of that because we know about graphing that's why i taught you that stuff so i guess long story short your degree has to match up with your complex solutions not necessarily your real that's the the maximum number of real solutions you could have it's the exact number if you include complex that's the maximum number of factors you can have for real numbers it's the exact number of factors if you have complex so here we have one two three factors but one of them is here additional quadratic here we have one two three four again that could be if you cannot factor it that could be something you need to do with quadratic formula it can look a little nasty when you start using the quadratic formula for that because your if you have to write factors because your factors could be x minus something that comes from a quadratic formula and x minus the other thing that comes from a quadratic formula like like this this came out of nowhere but if i had a quadratic that gave me this solution and that solution notice x minus and x plus x plus and x minus one plus square root of three over two that does not come from this i'm just making this up then you write x minus that and x minus that but that looks a little bit nastier doesn't it it's still a real number i mean it doesn't have an i in it it's still a real number so it's factored over reals but that's what we would get out of that so i hope that makes sense uh the next two examples we're going to talk about don't forget to factor like what we should have done on that example so i'll be right back with that all right let's keep on going so one thing is that a lot of times when students are in section uh they focus on the technique of the section and it seems like everything they've learned before just just goes out of mind the way that i teach i always try to do what's called spiral i always try to look back at stuff you've learned incorporating what you're learning and not so so as to not forget about it because the things you learn first tend to be easier and if you can use them why not use them and this is two examples just to reiterate that factoring is very useful and as far as easiness it trumps what we've been doing because using the rational zeros or something like that is just way overkill when you can factor it very easily same thing for that so we've learned some techniques just don't forget about them so when you're going through this i really don't care what they tell you to do if it says yeah use rational zeros theorem but you can factor why are we using rational zeros theorem there's other ways to practice that so let's factor when we can factor so if we take x to the fourth minus one and you're tasked with finding all of the zeros of this well we could use rational zeros they're going to give us a hint but notice how we're not given any zeros around the bat we're not given a complex like we were in the previous two examples then we could build another pair two pairs of factors distribute for a complex a irreducible quadratic and do long division that's great we're not given that here so we're starting from scratch we could start with rational zero's theorem but why why when we could factor so if we set this equal to zero and that's how we find all solutions ever set that equal to zero well then that's that's a power four but it's model on a square of a square x squared squared so you probably have seen the uh like use of substitution i know we've done it in this this series where u equals x squared you do that you can just straight up think hey you know what that's a difference of squares with x squared minus one and x squared plus one and that's a true story x squared minus one x squared plus one that's x to the fourth plus and minus x squared is zero minus one that looks like a difference of squares why not factor it like a difference of squares if you want to see a little better you can think of this as x squared squared minus one equals zero that's x squared minus one and x squared plus one okay well how about that well let's keep on factoring can you factor x squared minus one no no that's an irreducible quadratic can you factor x x squared plus one no sorry x squared minus one yes that's not irreducible that's it that's a difference of squares legitimately x minus one and x plus one and then you'd still have x squared plus one equals zero now here's what i'm going to tell you this is completely factored over the real number system you have a linear which is going to give you a real solution and it's going to be a crossing because we have a multiplicity 1. we have another real solution a linear factor gives us a real solution multiplicity once is we have another crossing this right here you do not say it has multiplicity because multiplicity comes from the power of the factor not the power of the term so that x squared plus 1 it's not factorable the the quadratic formula would give us an i in there this is an irreducible quadratic so this is not giving us real zeros this is not giving us x intercepts but we still need to know how to find complex solutions so how do we do that well we start with the easy factors all right how do we find factor or sorry how we find zeros is by using the zero product property we have these factors set equal to zero we have two linears and irreducible quadratic where we go from there is using the zero product property to say well yeah x minus one equals zero and x plus one equals zero and sure enough x squared minus one plus one would also equal 0. now this is really nice x equals 1 and x equals negative 1. what you do with irreducible quadratics is one of two things listen carefully how you solve these is factor if you can find a factor if you can't with with a real stereotypically or like i used earlier a complex zero where you find a pair create your visual quadratic and divide so find a factor okay great factor it okay great factor as much as you can over the real number system it should be linears and irreducible quadratics set your linears equal to zero by the zero product property but also set your irreducible quadratics equal to zero these are very easy to solve these are both crossings multiplicity 1 they're real x intercepts the graph is going to cross the x intercept twice for irreducible quadratics this falls into one of two cases number one something like this where you can solve for your x squared and simply take a square root yes you will get eyes you know what for all your irreducible quadratics you get i's so we're going to subtract one x squared equals negative one when we take a square root oh don't forget you gotta have a plus or minus don't forget that we get x equals plus or minus the square root of negative one well wait a minute the square root of negative one by definition is exactly what i and what i is is imaginary number so we get plus or minus i that gives us two solutions we get i and negative i that's case one if you have x squared plus some number then you solve it just like it showed you said it uh solve it for your your x squared take a square root plus a minus you get a complex number out of it if it's x squared minus a number you better factor that even if it's like x squared minus five remember you can do x minus square root of five and x plus square root of five so x squared plus a number yes complex x squared minus a number no not complex real numbers that's factored you'd have two solutions you'd have 5 square root of 5 and square root of a negative square root of 5. now what if this well if this was an x squared plus a number but something like x squared minus 6x plus 13 what then well then you would do the quadratic formula it will show up your zeros for you and you can write them as factors if you need to so we're going to do both of those things right now we've found for the degree four are one two three four solutions this is all we're asking for is uh is those four solutions next if you have to write this as completely factored over the real number system this is it this is factored over the reals if you have it factored over the complex then you just simply go back and from here you create your factors we already know these two x minus one and x plus one from these two factors you can get x minus i this looks really familiar because we've done it x plus i and those would create two additional factors for you that include complex numbers this would be completely factored over the complex number system degree four four factors but some of them are complex so i hope that makes sense the biggest thing here is don't ignore factoring if you can use it it's way quicker let's look at the next one so x to the fourth plus 13x squared plus 36. if we remember we've done i'm going to use this substitution so we can sort of spiral that into for things that have a power here that's twice the power here you can do a substitution so we're going to call u equal to x squared what that means is that x to the fourth would become x squared squared or u squared remember x to the fourth is x squared squared plus 13 x squared so we can call this x squared and that x squared this u some some dummy variable so u squared plus 13 u plus 36. i'm going to speak a little bit about this when we're done we're going to come back and say well what if you couldn't factor that try again because almost always they're factorable but what if you what if you really can we'll talk about that this is factorable so g of x really it's g of u at this point would become u plus nine and u plus four that's u squared plus four u plus nine u that's plus 13 u plus 36 that's the way the substitution works if you set this equal to zero and we're solving this now so u plus nine would equal zero and u plus four would equal zero okay that's i i suppose that's fine uh u would equal negative nine and u would equal negative four that also looks okay well uh but then we have to go back to our x's you see we start in terms of x's and you use our breadcrumbs to get back to our x's so if u equals negative 9 we knew that u equaled x squared x squared equals negative 9 x squared equals negative 4 and we run into exactly the same situation where we can take a square root with a plus minus and we get x equals plus or minus 3i square root of negative 9 is 3i and x equals plus or minus 2i square root of negative 4 is 2i and this gives us our four solutions degree four four solutions if you need this to be factored over the real number system um it's it's a little more difficult because we did substitution there's a different way you could go about it if you just recognize that this is a three-term polynomial and you can factor it then you'd get down to here and you'd go right back and say wait a minute that's really x squared and that's really x squared and this would be an irreducible quadratic in each of those cases so you could stop right here and say that is factored over the real number system and you'd be correct that's two irreducible quadratics is the case i just spoke about where degree four can certainly give you two irreducible quadratics over the real number system these cannot be factored anymore you can't factor x squared plus sign you can't factor x squared plus four if you wanted to go further and do complex from here that'd be fine you do x squared plus nine equals zero and x squared plus four equals zero and hopefully you can see that's the same case as this you'd subtract nine subtract four and end up right here get the same exact solutions so this would be factored over the real number system these are all of our solutions there's four of them for degree four if you needed to give these factors as complex factors well then we can create a factor from each of these solutions so we have x minus 3i and x plus 3i respectively this would be minus because you'd subtract 3i and plus because you add 3 that would give us two factors x minus 2i and x plus 2i that's four factors degree four four solutions degree four two factors over the reals because those are irreducible over the real number system now i mentioned to you what if this was not factorable like this then what you would do it would get a little more complicated what you do is you would from here you'd solve for u with the quadratic formula you would take you would take that and you would simplify it down now this of course would give us some really easy numbers but if it didn't what would happen eventually is you would get u equal to some sort of an expression that looks like this and then you'd say okay as soon as i simplified this all the way as much as i could then we'd do our substitution back and you'd say all right x squared would now equal this expression which i'm just modeling the form for you and then you take a square root and you take a square root with a plus and minus and you can see that this would get a little bit crazy you get x plus or minus some big square root that also has a plus and minus in it would look like that and so do you have four solutions here yes you do you take positive square root of number plus square root of a number then negative square root of number minus so that say that wrong on the second one you take positive square root of number plus square root of a number you take negative square root of number plus square root of a number then you'd say positive number minus square root of a number and negative square root number minus square root of a number you'd have four iterations here some of those are could be complex numbers so you have to really think about that it gets really nasty i don't foresee that you would see that many times but this is what you would do if you get there i can't think of an example that would be put in like a textbook for you but it could appear somewhere so anyway i hope that makes sense if this is not factor which almost certainly is then you do quadratic formula and when you get to here when you simplify this quadratic formula then you say oh yeah u is x squared how to get rid of x x squared you take a square root with a plus or minus and you get positive positive for one solution positive negative for another negative positive for one solution negative negative for another you get four solutions where we get crazy is for your factors uh so you'd write x minus each of those four really nasty looking solutions as factors so i hope it makes sense uh the next two examples we're going to start from scratch i'm just going to give you a polynomial that's not factorable we're going to go through rational zero step we're going to factor out with synthetic division we're eventually going to get down to things that we have to use a quadratic formula for or have some complex zeros i'll see you in a minute all right we're going to get to it we get just two more examples and they look kind of crazy we're going to find all the solutions to these polynomial functions we're going to start with rational zeros theorem we're going to factor out my synthetic division and eventually hopefully factor down and get some complex solutions as well so a couple things to understand is i'm going to be going as quick as i really can while explaining this well to you because everything that we're going to be doing on here we've learned already i'm just giving you two examples to wrap everything together that way when you get there you go oh yeah okay i know what to do now i know how to put it together put all the pieces together so let's take a look at these number one we have f of x equals x to the fourth and that's in order and this says that we have a degree four polynomial how many solutions we should get is four are they all going to be real i don't know could they yes the degree is the maximum number of real solutions you get it's the exact number of solutions you get if you talk about complex numbers as well so we should get four solutions because we're factoring for all solutions here four solutions four factors over the complex number system how we start try to look for factoring that's five terms we're done uh you're not gonna be able to factor five terms unless you have a gcf which we do not have here we have a constant which eliminates our ability to factor in x we have a degree coefficient our leading coefficient of one which says we're not going to have a a um a greatest common factor that includes some sort of a constant so so we're done as far as that goes the next thing we do is try to look for a zero there's none given we don't have a complex zero they're not giving us a real zero here so we're gonna have to go through and find a zero the best way to approach that is to get a list of numbers that you can sort of guess and check so we're gonna do that we're to say all right how we develop this list rational zeros theorem it says we're going to take our last term our constant figure out the factors first term constant sorry our constant coefficient leading coefficient find all the factors and then create a list of numbers that are potential zeros for our polynomial so for 75 that's our p we get 1 and 75 not 2 that's not going to work but 3 and 25 4 is not going to work but 5 and 15. six doesn't work seven no eight no nine no ten no eleven no twelve no thirteen no fourteen no fifteen yes so we're in the board we're done that's how you go through and do it as soon as you cross this sort of bridge and you get from one factor to one you already know then you're done this is all the factors 75 and we have to include the fact that they could be positive and negative one thing we might consider doing is to cartridge the signs right now to determine what if if any we can eliminate so when we look at this we have zero zero zero one sign change what that says is there will be one positive x-intercept well that's that's interesting because that's a degree four it doesn't even have to have one but we know for sure this is going to have one positive x-intercept so maybe keep that in the back of our head if we want to change the signs of our odds so make that a minus and that a minus then we'd have one two three three sign changes so there's either gonna be three or one negative x-intercept if you don't remember that maybe go back and watch the card rule of science because i explained all of that in there how to change your your odd exponent to terms and then counter signs again sign changes again so one sign change two sign changes three sign changes that's not a sign change so it would be three sine changes gives you either three or one negative x intercept so keep that in the back of our head honestly what that means though is that we have to keep both positive and negative because we're going to have one positive we have at least one negative so we're going to keep our positive negative as far as our first term goes the coefficient there's one and the only factors of that are one and negative one which means that our list of numbers we take the p and divide by the q and so every sort of um permutation of that we can arrange we're going to get some we usually get some fractions out of this but here's all the numbers we need to check positive negative one one over one three over three five over five fifteen over one sorry one over one three over one five over one fifteen over one twenty five over one seven pi over one gives us this list same list as our ps here's what this represents it represents all the possible rational zeros of that polynomial it does not include complex it does not include square roots all it does is the rationals it's a good starting spot now if we go through all of this and exhaust it really kind of out of luck as far as what we know in this class so far so we check and we start with one start with the easy ones if you have fractions leave those last so start with one uh okay so one plus two plus 22 that's uh that's 25 plus 50 is 75 minus 75 to zero how high we're having i'm looking we know that one is a zero because when we evaluated it when we evaluated it when we plugged in one you get zero what's that mean if you plug in x equals one that means that your function height is zero you're on the x-axis that's exactly what we're looking for we're looking for zeros x-intercepts in this case and so we know that one is an x-intercept and that's going to create for us a factor we always show what we've done we always show what our x-intercept is we always show our factor here because this is what we're going to use to factor this the first thing we're going to write is f of x equals x minus 1 something something something something whatever that polynomial is and then we're going to continue so we know x minus 1 is a factor then you choose to either use long division with this dividing into this or you choose to use synthetic division with positive one not negative one we're going to use synthetic division so synthetic division we use the coefficients of our polynomial and we use the x-intercept not the factor the x-intercept so we use positive 1. and how this algorithm works is you bring down your first coefficient you multiply and you add you multiply and you add you multiply and you add you multiply and you add and you should end with a remainder of zero if you have authentically found an x-intercept this has to happen here's what it means we've reduced because we're factoring out remember since the division only works with linears only and so it's always reducing your degree by one for your polynomial that you're finding your quotient so we have reduced that power by one this is now going to be x to the third so we know our function a couple things about it we're going to have a factor of x minus 1. notice how a lot of students put x plus 1 because they go oh i factored out the plus 1. it's right there positive 1 x 1. no this is why i have you do this x equals 1 is your x intercept and that's what you use for synthetic division but x minus 1 is your factor this is why i taught you all those times to create your factors so that you have that pattern in your head the remaining part of the polynomial is factored as x to the third plus three x squared plus 25 x plus 75. so let's talk for a moment about this this is going to be factorable and we're going to factor by grouping in just a second it's really quick if it's not factorable by grouping we we talked about this in the rational zeros third video where you'd go back to your list and you'd try you'd actually try one again you'd say hey can i can i factor out a one well one plus 3 plus 1 no that's not going to work so i get a 0. can't try a negative 1. no can i try 3 negative 3 well maybe one of those will work if it's not factorable you go back to the same list and you start going through it again until you find another factor and you use synthetic division again on this polynomial same exact thing keep this factor you get additional factors because this is factorable by grouping we don't have to do that so always check that's why the last two examples are there always check factoring it's much quicker so when we look at four terms in our head we should be thinking let's factor by grouping if we can let's factor out an x squared let's factor out a 25. hey that's perfect that means that we have another factor of x plus 3 and then x squared plus 25. we already know that we have a factor of x minus 1. this is factored over the real number system this is completely factored we have a linear done linear done quadratic but it's irreducible you cannot factor x squared plus 25. now had it been x squared minus 25 yes difference of squares had it been x squared minus five absolutely that's still technically a difference of squares if you use the square root of five so yeah you could or if this was x squared um let's say minus six x minus thirteen yes you could do that quadratic formula so with those quadratics you run into one or two one of two cases either you can factor it or do quadratic formula or it's actually that's all that's all you can do you can factor or do quadratic formula you're either gonna get real numbers or you're gonna get complex numbers so as soon as you see a quadratic here try to factor it i can't all right well then set it equal to zero and do what the situation necessitates in other words setting this equal to zero we get by the zero product property x minus one equals zero and x plus three equals zero and x squared plus 25 equals zero and this gives us two real solutions oh think about it what are those are those crossings or are those bounces you should have that in your head that that's a multiplicity one multiple c one those are real solutions those are actual x-intercepts and they have to cross and cross due to the multiplicity then we get this x squared plus 25 and move it up here we talked about this in one of the last examples that if you have x squared plus some number it's not factorable but you can isolate the power 2 and simply take a square root if you have a middle term in here and you can't factor it firstly try to factor it again but if you still can't factor then just use the quadratic formula and the quadratic formula will work for any quadratic that you can't factor whether it gives you real numbers or not it'll work if you get some i's in there by a negative discriminant a negative inside your square root well then you know that you have some complex numbers if you don't they need real numbers and you have four real solutions here we are able to subtract 25 take a square root and get x equals plus or minus 5i and that gives us two additional solutions 5i and negative 5i if you were kind of curious about what i was saying before if you had like x squared minus 6x minus 13. that's still not easily factorable so you go um yeah i don't know how to factor that use the quadratic formula you're going to get real numbers here what about x squared x squared minus 6x plus 13 i still can't factor it what would you do there quadratic formula again but you're going to get imaginary numbers in that case so that's the way that i would say go through and do that so factor as much as you can when you get to the quadratic try to factor it but if not then quadratic formula will give you whatever you want now if we do need to continue to show all the solutions we've done it we have a degree four we have one two three four solutions if we need to show it as factored over the complex we can do our x minus one x plus 3 x minus 5 i that's from this one and x plus 5i remember you can set this x equals 5i subtract 5i get a factor x equals negative 5i add 5i and get another factor this is completely factorably complex if you had to do the quadratic formula on this like with a middle term or something in there then your complex numbers can get a little bit more complicated and this can be sort of nasty but it's possible don't give up on it so that's about all i want to say as far as that goes let's go into our last example and i go through the same process okay so here we go we have a degree four we should end with four solutions we know know the solutions right now so we're going to find out we're going to do the rational zeros theorem we're going to take our p and we're going to look at this and go hey there's one sign change that's one positive x-intercept one two three sign changes there's either three or one negative x-intercept very much like that's that example if you looked at it here's one positive here's one negative and two imaginary solutions so we're going to take a look at this as we go through and make sure that works so we're always using the card's rule of signs sort of as a a work saver and a work checker and then we're going to take our factors of our constant that's the p and our leading coefficient that's our q so 18 has factors of one and 18 2 and 9 3 and 6 and because we have both positive and negative x intercepts we're going to have to include both positive and negative factors for that if uh decartel assigned said hey you have no sign changes you have no positives then we'd just be looking at negatives and make it a lot easier for q we have one and three those are the only factors and so our list of things to check is going to be 1 2 3 6 9 18 1 3 2 3 1 2 3 and 6. so we get a lot of repetitions here so those are the whole numbers when we do our fractions we get one over three we get two over three we get three over three but that's one six over three but that's two 9 over 3 but that's 3 and 18 over 3 but that's 6. so we don't need to include those twice that's just redundant and then we're going to check so we're going to check g of 1. we're going to plug in 1. there's no way that if i plug in 1 that's going to give me 0. we'd try negative one but that's not going to work we try uh two two's not going to work we try negative two actually negative two is going to work if we evaluate g of negative two it gives us zero i've done this ahead of time to save time so i'm not gonna sit here and play a calculator but i have i actually tried one and negative one and two and then negative two and i finally got to one that worked so g of two sorry negative two gives me zero now what does that say what that says to us is that x equals negative 2 is an x-intercept awesome we don't know yet if it's a bounce or a cross but we know it's an x-intercept that also means that x plus 2 is a factor so that's what we're going to factor out so how do we do that how do we factor that out if you have a linear factor man i'm really going to suggest using the synthetic division so we're going to take our polynomial with our coefficients and our x intercept it's got to be the x intercept not plus 2 minus 2. and we follow our synthetic division algorithm we bring down our first coefficient we multiply and we add we multiply and we add we multiply let's see and we add we multiply and we add together well that looks pretty good what that means for us is that we know we know one factor we know that we have a factor over the reals of x plus two that's why we wrote that right there we also know that synthetic division reduces the degree of our polynomial into uh by one into a degree of this inside factor polynomial so three x to the third minus x squared plus 27 x minus nine that again is factorable that's a that's a four term polynomial this is something we should check for grouping every single time now if it wasn't factorable by grouping then we'd go back to our list you would not try one negative one or two again you try negative two again just to make sure it doesn't work and then you go through your list the next one we'd find would be uh one-third so it would take us a long time to get there which thank goodness this is factorable by grouping so factoring out x squared you get three x minus one and factoring out nine you get three forgot my x three x minus one and this is perfect this is what we want to see for fraction by grouping we have three x minus one and then we have an x squared plus nine if we bring down that factor of x plus 2 this is completely factored over the real number system but that's not what the the question is asking the question is asking for all of your zeros and so because this is completely factored over the real number system we're able to set this equal to zero and by the zero product property say x plus two would equal zero and three x minus one would equal zero and x squared plus nine would also equal zero even though it's a quadratic that's fine you can't factor that anymore you try you would try if it was x squared minus nine you're good to go you just use difference of squares or x squared minus two even minus two x plus two and x uh minus square root of two and x plus square root of two that's fine or if it was um yeah pretty much that's it if it's factorable you could do that it had three terms and you factored you could do that but we'd without that you said all these factors equal to zero so x plus two equals zero that's x equals negative two and x equals positive one third we add one divided by three that'd be way over there good thing we have to find that one and then x squared plus nine for the last time there's a couple cases here if you have something like this where you can isolate the power 2 do it take a square root you just get a very simple imaginary number if not if you can't factor it no matter what use the quadratic formula it will give you all the solutions because you can factor this into linears and irreducible quadratics so linears very easy irreducible quadratics quadratic formula it will still give you complex numbers no problem so we're going to subtract 9 take a square root with a plus and minus and get positive or negative 3i that's x equals 3i and x equals negative 3i those are the four solutions that we have hey look at that there's two reals we know we know we had to have that there was one sign change here that's one positive here's our one positive right there one third uh we had when we changed our signs of the odd powered terms we had one two three sign changes that's three or one negative x-intercepts here's our one negative x-intercept so there's two x-intercepts one on the positive one and the negative both of which are crosses because of our multiplicity and then there's two complex solutions that don't give us x-intercepts one two three four if you had to show this factored over reals this is it that's an irreducible quadratic if you had to show this factored over complex we just write factors from every solution there's four factors for degree four one last thing and then we're done please keep in mind that if you were to somehow know that one-third was a factor and you did synthetic division with one-third firstly it's going to work secondly this can look a little bit different so i'm going to show that to you and then be done if you were to factor this by taking that one-third this is good practice because we rarely see it this actually works with synthetic division of fractions just most people never get there so it's never practice so when you run into it you go bring down your your leading coefficient and multiply one-third times three is one when you add that you get six one-third times six is two when you add that you get twenty-seven one-third times twenty-seven it's nine when you add that you get fifty-four one-third of fifty-four is eighteen and when you add that you get zero it actually does work and it works fairly well even though it's a fraction they kind of scary at first but it's it's almost always a case unless you have another fraction there that you you end up getting these very simplifiable fractions when you start multiplying so that's that's pretty nice what i mean by this is that this factor can look a little different this right here would be x minus one third instead of three x minus one those need to be the same in your head so x equals one third if i multiply it by three and subtract one i get three x minus one if i just subtract one third i get x minus one third those are the two ways that we can write that factor so you'd see it this way or like that where you have a 3 that's been forcefully factored out of that if you distribute you'd get 3x minus 1. which way is preferable probably that one because there's a fraction in it but it doesn't really matter in terms of what we deal with so i hope this video i know it was a long one oh it makes sense but it had to be long because it wraps up pretty much everything we've learned about polynomials in terms of solving for their zeros whether the complex or the real and now i feel like i've given you a very very thorough explanation of what you do uh when you get into this even to the point of hey what if you can't do that what if this is not factorable or solving for x squared using quadratic formula and i've shown you how to do that as well so i hope this made sense uh we're going to switch gears now we're going to start working on rational functions how to uh how to graph those it's going to be very cool we're going to use multiplicity to do some pretty neat things so see for that hope you guys doing well
