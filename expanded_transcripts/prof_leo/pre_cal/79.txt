Transcript for: How to Use the Unit Circle in Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 7)
welcome to another video so in this video i'm going to show you how to use this thing which is called a unit circle we're going to discuss many examples some that have a little bit of a little bit of math in them where we add and subtract some different things using the unit circle i'll show you how to how to deal with coterminal angles so what happens when you do more than one revolution or some negative measurements so it'll be clockwise angular angular movement we'll show we'll talk about what that means we'll talk about how sine is really just the y coordinate of a point on the unit circle and cosine of whatever angle we have is just the x so we'll deal with that the whole idea is can you find the angle identify your y for sine x for cosine and uh and divide them for tangent and then we'll find the reciprocals for our other trig functions so we're going to deal with that i'll show you exactly how to do it so this is what is called a unit circle and even though it doesn't look like it this radius is one one unit of measurement so what i've done here for you is created i think the best unit circle like ever that's why i use it all the time and there's a whole lot to it so i'm gonna spend the first about five minutes explaining how this works and what is what all is going on there's one that you can find on the internet pretty much anywhere any of them will work but one looks very similar to this i didn't make it up but it's very valuable so here's what happens i'm going to start by telling you that because this radius is 1 we can relate arc length and radian degree measurement of angles to sine and cosine very very easily as it relates to the y and the x coordinates of points on the unit circle respectively that's a lot of words but here's what it means in practicality if you look at any one of these points cosine of whatever this angle and sine of whatever this angle is is given by your x and your y coordinate i've color coded it so cosine is red sine is blue even as far as the sines themselves positive and negative go in each of the quadrants one two three and four i've also talked about what trig functions are positive for each of those quadrants all of them sine only cosine tangent only and cosine only and the reciprocals of those so cosecant cotangent and secant so that's how that's how this works i've also given degree and radian measurements for all of these angles these are the most common angles that we really deal with and if you just follow the color coding behind it it comes out really nicely in order to get tangent i've written this as sine over cosine that's x over y for any of these angles as well i've omitted the the angle so like theta or t because they're universally used and we have more of the idea here that sine is the y coordinate cosine the x coordinate that's why i did it like that so you can really see that so we're going to get right into it but we'll talk about firstly um how to find an angle on the unit circle and then what in the world we do what there's a definite order of thought and how to find all six of these standard trigonometric functions so let's get right into it let's look at 2 pi over 3 or 120 degrees now i am going to mostly use radian measurements versus degrees but they're interchangeable so whether you have sine of 120 degrees or sine of 2 pi over 3 as far as a unit circle is concerned they're interchangeable if you converted them you could convert between the two very easily that's what i mean by interchangeable so here's what we're going to do first we're going to find sine and cosine first for any of these angles that we're looking at then we'll find tangent and then we'll reciprocate all three so let's take a look firstly where 2 pi over 3 is 2 pi over 3 is in quadrant number let's see 2. in quadrant 2 so sine should be positive it says quadrant two it says cosine will be negative and sine with positive red remembers cosine blue is sine y look at where this point is at two pi over three when the angle sweeps that out the point is right here here's the point x's will be negative y's will be positive that's exactly what it says cosine would be negative that's x sine will be positive that's the y and so we're going to write those down so sine of 2 pi over 3 is exactly what the y coordinate of that point is for some reasons i explained in the previous video that's 3 sorry square root of 3 over 2. cosine of 2 pi over 3 is the x coordinate of that point for some reason i explained last video that's negative one half tangent takes a bit more work now there are other tables that you can just look at and that's fine but i really want you to understand where it comes from not memorize the table tangent is taking the y coordinate and dividing by the x coordinate remember this really creates a right triangle right here where the height of it would be root 3 over 2 that's the y and the let's say length of it i suppose would be negative one-half we use it with the sign dividing y over x would divide opposite over adjacent for a right triangle or root three over two divided by negative one-half or sine over cosine blue over red however you want to think about that that's what this does so at 2 pi over 3 tangent would take y divided by x or sine divided by cosine we can do the math really quickly you can use your calculator if it has the ability to give you back square roots the ones i recommend always do you can do in your head though kind of nicely with a lot of these common ones if we divide by negative one half so sine over cosine for two pi over three then we're going to reciprocate and multiply your twos are going to cancel you're going to get negative square root of three once we've done that now it's time to find the the reciprocal functions for sine cosine and tangent of whatever angle we've just talked about and it's really easiest to do it after you've done sine and cosine you just reciprocate them that to me is a lot easier than looking back here and reciprocating doing a lot of the math in your head so unless you have to find just one of them usually if you find all six find sine then cosine the tangent create a pattern for yourself that works every time so cosecant says take a look at sine of the angle and reciprocate it that's 2 over the square root of 3. normally we have to rationalize that denominator so you multiply by the square root of 3 over the square root of 3. so here's 2 over square root of 3 rationalizing we get two square root of three over three that's what cosecant of two pi over three would be it'd be two square root of three over three how about secant well secant takes a look at cosine and reciprocates it that's going to be negative 2. that's a kind of easy one and then cotangent does the same thing it reciprocates tangent so negative square root of 3 over 1 becomes negative 1 over square root of three by the same exact logic as this we're going to get negative one times square root of three over three that is how to find your trig functions stemming from the use of these these things called the unit circle now obviously you're probably not going to want to carry one around this big when you're doing like a test or your homework or something but print one out have it in front of you use it as little as possible what do you mean start trying to memorize these things not memorize why they work that's important to understand that but it will come to you a little bit better if you're not always looking at your unit circlemen oh i don't know what sine of pi over two is let me look at my unit circle seven pi over two we should pretty much identify that as one almost all the time sine of pi over two that's that is one the more that you memorize it the less likely they are to to make some mistakes um later on in math especially if your teacher does not let you have a unit circle on the test or something so use it until you get used to it and then try try to not have it right next to you all the time see if you can do it without it it's valuable it really is valuable make your math much more efficient that speed with accuracy okay so we don't we don't really want to be relying on it all the time for from here on out for now of course it's brand new and that's totally okay i generally let students use it on a test for trigonometry but as we get closer to like calc 1 calc 2 calc 3 it kind of goes away and you're just required to know it and so that's what i want to start training you on now we're going to deal with one more reaction i could do much about it but i want to show you something called the coterminal angle so let's say that we took a look at 8 pi over 3 eight pi over three it's not on my unit circle that's true it's actually more than one full revolution eight divided by three is well let's see think about this for a second eight pi divided by three eight over three is two and two thirds so eight pi over three says i'm gonna go to two pi and then two thirds of a pi that's what that means here's what it would do eight pi over three says you'd go all the way around this that's two pi and then two thirds of a pi one two thirds of one pi you can count like that if you wanted to count thirds you can do a different way i want to count eight thirds or eight one-thirds of a pie just count the denominator of threes so here's one two three remember three over three is one four five six six over three is two 7 8. that's the same thing as 8 pi over 3 or 480 degrees take 480 subtract 360 you're going to get 120. the sine cosine tangent cosecant secant cotangent of 8 pi over 3 is going to be identical to the sine cosine tangent and the reciprocal functions of 2 pi over 3. the 480 degrees works out the same exact trig functions as 120 degrees does so most of the time what we do is we try to figure out what these trig functions are on one rotation if we get more than that it's just going to match up to something that we already know in one rotation and that's something that we can do so i want to point that out to you i'm not going to redo it because we get the same exact things here so no matter whether you make one rotation or 50 rotations where you end up is what matters as far as sine cosine tangent are concerned now that is going to be very important when we get to graphing because when we get to graphing we're going to notice how it oscillates it repeats every so often it's called a period so every so often you're going to get a repeating graph and a repeating graph and a repeating graph and the outputs will repeat themselves time and time and time again and that's what we're noticing here going more than one full revolution let's get right after it again we're going to take a look at pi over 4 and find all of our six standard trigonometric functions from that pi over 4. remember pi over 4 and 45 degrees are exactly the same so you can see written both ways sine of 45 degrees can be exactly the same as sine of pi over four i just have that on there so we get used to it mostly we're using radians as we continue so i'm going to use that the most often but please don't let that sway you please understand that either way you're going to get the same exact relationship amongst the point and the angle so sine of pi over 4 we're going to locate it first pi over 4 is in the first quadrant in the first quadrant all of your trig functions are positive why because both x and y are positive and because the trig functions relate to the points x comma y they're going to retain those same signs and so we're going to look at pi over 4 say hey that's right here that's 45 degrees sine of pi over 4 or 45 degrees is the blue one that's y that's root 2 over 2. that's also true of cosine you see cosine is the x coordinate that's also root 2 the red one in this case and we've seen that right there well what's going to happen with tangent well tangent of pi over 4 it's not shown here it's shown here tangent says you have to take the y and divide by the x well the square root of 2 over 2 divided by the square root of 2 or 2 is 1. so tangent of pi over four is one let's move on once we've done that found sine cosine and tangent of the appropriately given angle whether 45 degrees or pi over four in this case quadrant one we're going to move on to the reciprocals but i do want to show you something notice how all of them are positive it says both x and y are positive sine and cosine are positive and dividing a positive by a positive will also give you a positive when we reciprocate that none of the signs are going to change although these should also be positive this will have the same sign as this this is the same side as this this for this for anything that's not a quadrant angle i can't say that about quadrant angles because some of them become undefined at that at those values but for anything inside of a in a quadrant you're going to have the same sign so let's reciprocate cosecant reciprocates sine notice how it matched up for you i want you to make those connections cosecant reciprocate sine so 2 over the square root of 2. we're going to rationalize very quickly 2 over square root of 2 gives you 2 square root 2 over 2 or just the square root [Music] two for the exact same reason because these are identical you're also going to get the square root of 2 for secant so secant would say reciprocate cosine of whatever the angle is so secant pi over 4 is reciprocal cosine pi over 4 we're going to reciprocate and rationalize well 2 over square root of 2 we'd rationalize and get the square root of 2 again they are identical for pi over 4 sine cosine cotangent is a reciprocal of tangent or whatever angle you have 1 over 1 gives you one over one notice this divided by this or well actually this divided by this for cotangent either way we'd get one i hope you're able to follow me i hope you're seeing that it's not all that hard but it's very easy to make mistakes on it so we need to be very used to our unit circle and starting to really get what's going on here let's take a look at 7 pi over 6 or 210 degrees let's find out on the circle let's find sine cosine tangent the reciprocals and then move on from that one so seven pi over six let's find it first seven pi over six you can count you should be able to count them here's one pi over six two pi over six three pi over six that that simplifies to pi over three and pi over two four five six pi over six six pi over six should give you pi it simplifies and seven pi over six and that's where it is but think about how we're counting i'm gonna start training on how to count the pi over 6 as pi over 3s so that way when it's not on a circle you don't get stuck and so 7 pi over 6 yeah we can find it but count it make sure you know how to do that if we want to find sine cosine tangent the reciprocals of seven pi over six well then we're going to start with sine sine is the first one we come to right here that's the blue one that's the y coordinate it's negative why is it negative really think about this at this particular angle it creates a point on the unit circle that's in the third quadrant in the third quadrant x's are negative look at the x-axis y's are negative look at the y-axis both sine and cosine therefore because x's and y's are both negative those should both be negative but tangent tangent should be positive why well a negative divided by a negative which is what tangent does to x sine divided by cosine will become positive that's what this says says sine is negative cosine's negative but tangent here is the only one that's positive and cotangent will be as well so let's go ahead and do it sine is going to be the y-coordinate so for us sine is going to be negative one-half cosine is the x so negative root 3 over 2 tangents going to divide them in the particular order sine of cosine y over x opposite over adjacent remember this would be that opposite is y over the adjacent which is the x if we simplify that remember they're both negative so negative divided by negative is a positive if you reciprocate and multiply this reciprocate and multiply the twos will cancel the negatives will cancel but you'll get one over the square root of three we really shouldn't leave it we're going to rationalize by multiplying the square root of three over three not sorry square root of three over the square root of three we're going to end with the square root of three over three our reciprocals can be nice for things that don't have square roots in them but for square roots we typically have to rationalize so cosecant notice i'm not going to look at the unit circle i already have that down at y of x i've got the division of those two things reciprocate don't change the sign we're going to get negative 2. reciprocate don't change the sign we're going to get 2 over the square root of 3 negative can you tell that you're going to get really good at rationalizing denominators multiply by square root of 3 over 3 negative 2 square root 3 over 3. and lastly cotangent don't reciprocate this one don't do that because you have to rationalize again you know what you're going to end up with just that if i reciprocated that i get the square root of three which is exactly what you'd get if you took this reciprocated and rationalized you'd end up just getting the square root of three i think i actually did that on a previous example so you could follow the steps but let's be smart about it if we're just reciprocating pick one that is one over something that's kind of nice hope that makes sense we're going to come back we're going to start looking at something in quadrant 4 and then some negative negative angles so swept out clockwise all right let's take a look at just a couple more before i give you some special cases and how to do some kind of arithmetic with some sine functions and cosine functions so let's take a look at 5 pi over 3. let's locate it identify the quadrant whether sine and cosine can be positive or negative identify sine and cosine the tangent then the reciprocals 5 pi over 3 or 300 degrees here's 1 pi over 3 2 pi over 3 3 pi over 3 four pi over three and five pi over three so we're counting thirds that's of course in quadrant number four 300 degrees is also quadrant number four now if we identify that we can easily see sine and cosine so sine is going to be negative square root of three over two and cosine is positive one wait positive y positive look at quadrant number four where this is in quadrant number four our x's should be positive that means cosine should be positive our y's are negative i mean sine should be negative associate that sine with y cosine with x tangent should be negative why because a negative divided by a positive is negative the only one that's positive here is cosine and secant because that's the reciprocal of cosine and that's what this says cosine is positive in quadrant four cosine's positive signs negative tangent will be negative also so let's go ahead and find that because sine deals with the y coordinate and 5 pi over 3 that's negative square root of 3 or 2 and positive 1 half for our x and therefore cosine for the point that's on the circle at that particular angle tangent divides them in that order y over x sine over cosine for that angle the two and the two are going to simplify when i multiply and reciprocate that gives me negative square root of 3. now the reciprocals of those are going to give us our other functions so negative 2 over square root of 3 you probably have recognized this is going to be negative 2 root 3 over 3. so don't be afraid to reciprocate quickly in your head you're going to get very used to these secant is going to be positive 2. we already talked about how secant was going to be positive and cotangent reciprocate that negative square root 3 that's negative 1 over the square root of 3 or negative square root of 3 over 3. those are the six common trig functions that we have for that particular angle all right i'd be remiss if i didn't put in a negative angle of some type so i'm going to do that even have it on at least a fourth quadrant negatively just give you a kind of a head start on what to do here so let's take a look at negative 3 pi over 4 or negative 135 degrees um so one way that we can do deal with this is to sweep this out by counting like pi over fours or counting and taking 360 and and subtracting off that that 135 and what's going to give us is some sort of an angle positively so we can we can do that i i prefer just to count them to get used to it so negative 3 pi over 4 is here's negative 1 pi over 4 2 and 3. negative three pi over four it's coterminal with five pi over four you're going to get the same exact sine cosine tangent all these trig functions as if you had five pi over four or 225 degrees so that's what we're going to be looking at again that's one two three soaked out clockwise that's negatively and it terminates right there so that's what we're really looking at that just like five pi over four it's actually going to lead to some identities later on we're going to see that oh there's certain things we can do with negative conversions to positive types of angles for our trig functions so let's go ahead let's do that if we look at five power four or 225 degrees notice what i said ones of 360 subtracting 135 is going to give us that 225 degrees as well so let's look at that sine should be negative root 2 over 2 cosine is negative root 2 over 2. this is in quadrant 3 not quadrant negative 2 or something quadrant 3 it's going to have sine and cosine both negative tangent positive what negative divided by negative is going to be a positive that's showing that to us so negative root 2 over 2 for both sine and cosine of the angle positive 1 for tangent can you see why hopefully you can dividing y by x or sine divided by cosine for those particular angles is positive 1. that's kind of nice we just deal with cotangent the same way reciprocate that now for our cosecant and secant we're going to reciprocate they should end up being the same also shouldn't they because they're reciprocating the same exact value so negative root 2 over 2 becomes negative 2 over square root of 2. we've seen this before when we multiply by the square root of 2 over square root 2 you're going to get negative square root of 2 after simplifying the twos that end up coming up so just negative 2. and because of the same reason we have that as well i hope i made it make sense on how to use a unit circle basically i'll deal with some some kind of unique or or different sorts of examples in just a little while we'll talk about what would you do if you got just tangent of six pi or something that'll be our first example um so when we're dealing with that we don't necessarily have to find all six trig functions it takes a little bit of time especially you have to rationalize everything so we'll come back for that in just a little bit okay last little bit any less big bit i don't know let's see how fast it goes let's go ahead and we're just going to practice as quick as i can about how to find some of these trig functions i don't need to find all six maybe more than one revolution or negative angular measurement i will also talk about some some of these arithmetic sort of math problems that involve some trig functions so not all that bad i'm also throwing some degrees up there just to get us used to it to make sure that we can do the same thing so let's take a look at something like tangent of 6 pi tangent of 6 pi that's not on here obviously just count your pies count from zero positively which would be counterclockwise one pi two pi three pi four pi five pi six pi so pi is half a revolution that's going to be tangent of same thing as 0 or same thing as 2 pi y divided by x so we've made our rotations we understand that we're coterminal with 0 degrees or 0 radians or whatever you want to consider that as you're going to look at your y divided by x that's what tangent does is sine over cosine y over x is 0 over 1 or just 0. how about secant of negative pi at this point the reason why i correlated your your trig functions for you is that you should start identifying that cosecant and sine are reciprocals cosine and secant are reciprocals so i'm going to do it this way i'm going to think negative pi that's negative half of revolution that's right here the same thing as pi coterminal pi so i'm looking here i'm thinking that well let's see cosine would be negative one secant is a reciprocal negative one over one reciprocate that would be negative one still i hope that makes sense to you i hope you're seeing that we're co-terminating with something that's on our unit circle we're just measuring in a certain different way and then we're looking at our one of our original three trig functions and then maybe reciprocate so secant that's x that would be cosine and then reciprocate that how about oh man sine of 11 pi over two you know you can also do something else this is going to get to our properties of tree function a nice segue to our next video that you can do things like just subtract multiples of 2 pi all of these things repeat themselves on an interval of 2 pi at at minimum that so if we think about that subtracting 2 pi let's see 6 pi minus 2 pi is 4 pi minus another 2 pi is 2 pi minus another 2 pi is 0 gets something between 0 and 2 pi subtract 2 pi until you get there and you will end up getting that so we can do that so if i do that well that's uh be zero if i tangent of 0 is still 0 or secant so subtract or add 2 pi even adding 2 pi is going to say negative pi plus 2 pi is pi that's exactly where we terminated same thing here 11 pi over 2 if i subtract enough two pi's i'm going to end up at some sort of coterminal angle it's on my unit circle you can also count them here's 1 pi over 2 2 pi over 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11. this is where that's going to terminate at 3 pi over 2. if we subtract 2 pi enough we're going to end up right here as well so we're trying to find sine of 11 pi over 2 that's the same as sine of 3 pi over 2 or 270 degrees that's going to be negative 1. sine is our y coordinate for any point on that unit circle we can do something very similar with degree measurements you'll also notice i put parentheses around some of these and the reason is it's absolutely useful when you have math like in equations to put a parenthesis around any sort of angle degrees or radians it doesn't matter it's really nice to do that also if you have negatives we don't want to accidentally infer that subtracting somehow even though secant by itself makes absolutely no sense uh without some sort of an angle there so when we do this we like parentheses so let's take a look at sine 45 cosine 60 and then add them together it's all that same so we're going to go quickly through it sine of 45 degrees says i'm in quadrant one here's 45 degrees sine is the y coordinate on a unit circle that's square root of 2 over 2. plus cosine of 60 degrees here's 60 degrees quadrant 1 cosine is the x-coordinate that's one-half conveniently they both have a denominator of two so we could write that as one plus square root of two over two you could also find a decimal approximation i'm not going to go that far but this is an exact answer for what that represents now when we deal with things like cosecant of 45 i really need you to understand that cosecant relates to the reciprocal of sine so what we're going to do is we're going to find sine of 45 degrees we're going to reciprocate it and that's what this is going to be so here's 45 degrees or pi over 4. sine is square root of 2 over 2 but i'm going to reciprocate that so if i multiply by the square root of 2 over the square root of 2 what we're sorry if i reciprocate that i'm going to get 2 over the square root of 2. if i rationalize the denominator that's 2 root 2 over 2 or just square root 2. so this becomes square root of 2. i hope you followed that i hope you followed that hey this relates to sine it's the reciprocal of sine so find sine got it reciprocated got it rationalize it okay that is what cosecant to 45 degrees is they do make tables for this that's fine if you want to have one but i want you walking through the mouth now because that's being multiplied tangent of 60 degrees tangent of 60 that's a little bit harder too that is take your y divided by x square root of three over two divided by one half we're going to get the square root of 3. multiply by the reciprocal we get the square root of 3 all together that's the square root of 6. that's an exact answer for what that represents because we multiplied those they both had square roots i hope it's making sense to you i hope you're seeing where this comes from trying to make some connections between what these are and what our basic functions are and what our unit circle is doing for you all right just two more maybe try them on your own see if you can figure out what cosecant of pi over 3 is remember that cosecant relates to the reciprocal of sine so we locate pi over three quadrant one we find sine root three over two we reciprocate it then we rationalize it that's going to be the square root of 2 square root of 3 over 3. so this whole thing says look at sine i got it find it for pi over 3 we got it reciprocated we got it rationalize it we got it three times that thing is what this represents that's it plus so we're going to add cotangent of pi over 4. now this one's a little easier cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent so let's look at pi over i four a force here well let's see tangent would be this divided by this or 1 tangent of pi over 4 is 1. cotangent is the reciprocal of 1. well that's also 1. so if we simplify we get 2 square root 3 plus 1. okay our last one we're going to take sine of pi over four multiply by two tangent of pi over four multiply by three and then add them together so sine of pi over four we should be fairly confident in doing this at this point sine of pi over four says look at your y that's root two over two plus 3 times tangent to pi over 4 says take your y over your x that's going to be one simplify them and we get the square root of 2 plus three well i hope i've made that make sense for you i hope that you're really seeing how to use a circle it takes some practice of course and some of these things like cosecants can kind of mess you up a little bit but make it go down or think about it in terms of its root function its reciprocal function figure that out reciprocate and rationalize it typically it goes okay now the last thing last question is what happens if you have some of these angles that aren't on your unit circle like 28 degrees well that's not on here how are you going to figure out sine and cosine from that that is what your calculator is for so if we have sine of 28 degrees and you cannot locate sine of 28 degrees or pi over 12 or one degree or one radian on your unit circle use your calculator that's absolutely fine just make sure that you're in the right mode you see on your calculator you'll have something called degrees or radians dag or rad you want to make sure that you're in appropriate mode before you start plugging stuff in so try it right now try plugging in psi or press sign and press 28. if you're in degrees it's going to be the right thing if you try to do sine of 28 radians it's going to be completely different so if you're trying this on your calculator right now notice that these are approximations they're not going to be exact for you sine of 28 degrees is about 0.47 why well 28 degrees is just less than the hopefully you have a circle in front of you right now 28 degrees is just less than 30 degrees sine of 30 degrees is one half so sine of 28 degrees is just below one half and that's exactly right that's what it is now notice i talked about degrees and not radians because we're in terms of degrees when we start talking about radians well we're going to have to switch our calculator so you can do things like sine of 20 degrees in terms of degrees sine of one degree one degree is one degree is about 0.02 why so small now picture this in your head one degree is just like that just barely up there sine takes the y measurement the y value it's it's almost it's very close to zero because it's so close to that x axis it's barely lifted up so your y coordinate doesn't have time to move very far with that that motion when you see a lack of a degree you are talking about radians and your calculator must be changed into radians so what we're going to do is go into your mode and click on radians and then plug this in so cotangent some calculators have cotangent some do not if you don't what would you do we plug in tangent of pi over 12 and then hit one over that and find the reciprocal of whatever you're getting in this case try it out make sure you're in radians and you should get 3.73 now let's look at this let's look at the difference with that is there a difference between one degree and one radian absolutely we know one degree is one rep one 360th of a revolution one radian is the angle that would take to make an arc length equal to a radius of one well that's way up there there's only two pi radians in an entire circle well two pi radians that's like close to six six point two something all six point three so there's only six point three ish total radians in one circle that would be almost one-sixth of that circle that's gonna be much more well what this would work out to is sine of one radian is going to be the y-coordinate of whatever that swept up angle is in our case 0.84 that's fairly close um fairly close to pi over 3. not exactly but close all right last thing so what about the point negative i think i said last name like five times but last last last last thing uh so the point negative three comma four that is not on a unit circle kind of obviously right because the radius would have to be one and this is way more than one wait a minute how much is it actually could you find the radius because that's what it's going to take in order to find sine cosine tangent trig functions of this um yeah you can if we understand that this would make a right triangle our height is 4 or let's say our opposite consider that opposite would be 4 and our adjacent would be negative 3 or 3 in terms of a measurement there you can use pythagorean theorem really nicely so leg squared plus leg squared equals the hypotenuse squared that's going to be 25. if you take a square root r equals by rights it equals plus and minus 5 because you took a square root of both sides you should have a positive negative but because we want our radius to be positively defined otherwise you're going to be in the wrong quadrant positive radius would be here negative would you do this and then flip it over we know that our quadrant is in two so we want a positive radius to be in quadrant two we can do some other things with negative measured radius but that's that's usually reserved for like polar coordinates when we get there so our radius we're going to say is 5. so we know this is 5. if we want sine cosine and tangent of that angle then all we really have to do is take the y over the radius x over the radius for cosine or the y over the x for our tangent notice how the signs still match up our sine needs to be positive our cosine will be negative and our tangent will be negative all students remember sine should be positive in quadrant two and it is cosine should be negative and it is tangent should be negative and it is so if we wanted to find this this is the reason why i've showed you that triangle the very beginning of talking about a unit circle is that you would understand that we can make a triangle out of it and the only reason why we get just a y on the unit circle is because the radius is one it really should be opposite over hypotenuse well that's we're going to do but in terms of sine and cosine of tangent our opposite is four it's the y we just have to divide by a radius that's not one so divided by that radius sort of shrinks down into a unit circle idea so we're just going to divide it by that five cosine theta same thing would be adjacent or the x over our radius make sure you use the negative tangent is going to divide your y by your x you can divide sine by cosine the fives will cancel get negative four thirds or four over negative three is negative four thirds i'm going to leave it to you to be able to find the cosecant secant and cotangent be very easy just reciprocate reciprocate and reciprocate but i do want to i did want you to see the signs that sine is still positive cosine tangent is still negative i did want you to see that you're still taking y for sine and x for cosine and y over x for tangent but if we do not have a unit circle if we have something off of the unit circle you basically have to divide by that radius so find it and then we'll convert it to something that's similar to a unit circle so we're dividing by five and you're going to see right away the connection between trigonometry on a unit circle or not a unit circle and the triangles i drew at the at the beginning so i hope i made it make sense i hope you really seen the interplay here i've done my best to explain it to you in several different ways hope you're doing well and i'll see you for another video
