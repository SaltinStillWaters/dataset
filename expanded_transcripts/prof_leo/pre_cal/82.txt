Transcript for: Pythagorean Identities for Trigonometric Functions (Precalculus - Trigonometry 10)
welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the even and odd identities of trigonometric functions and we're going to talk about the pythagorean identities stemming from the pythagorean theorem of a right triangle as it as it is on a unit circle inscribed in a unit circle so let's let's get right into it now if you never thought about even and odd functions before this might be kind of new for you you should have seen them somewhere but you might have never thought about trig functions as even or odd and they are so let's think about what even odd actually mean what even means is if you think graphically even means symmetric about the y-axis that means function wise that opposite inputs should give you equal outputs that would create symmetry about the y-axis and that's exactly what even means opposite inputs give you equal outputs what odd means graphically is that you have this symmetry but it's not about the y it's not about the x it's about the origin which means you can take and rotate your graph 180 degrees if you will or pi and you'd get exactly the same graph out here's what that means function wise opposite inputs give you opposite outputs well we're going to consider that and hopefully you can see that that would create for you this symmetry about the origin we're going to see whether sine and cosine do that we're going to consider several different angles remember how sine and cosine all these tree function works your inputs are angles your outputs are x or y coordinates so it's a slight shift and that's why i've shown you this here even means opposite inputs equal outputs your your inputs though are angles so your inputs here are opposite thetas equal outputs f of theta f of negative theta those are outputs here well the same thing happens with odd but opposite let's give you opposite outputs here's opposite inputs negative theta and positive theta those opposite inputs are giving you opposite outputs that is what odd does this is what even does now let's consider these inputs on a unit circle if i start taking a look at what's going on when my angles are opposite remember that our inputs are angles so let's take a look at what happens with my x coordinates and my y coordinates when my angles are opposite all the way around the unit circle one thing i want your head right now is that x is cosine theta remember that this is well x is mapped to cosine theta sine is y and so when we take a look at this let's look first at our x coordinates our cosine thetas let's look at positive 30 degrees negative 30 degrees or positive pi over 6 negative pi over 6. look at your x coordinates they're in red so that's square root of three over two and square root of three or two wait a minute we have opposite angles one's positive one's negative counter-clockwise and clockwise respectively we have opposite angles opposite inputs and equal outputs does that continue here's pi over four negative pi over four opposite inputs opposite angles are giving us equal outputs let's let's go to pi over 2 and negative pi over 2. here's pi over 2 negative pi over 2. opposite inputs opposite angles are giving us equal outputs that continues we can go all the way to 5 pi over 6 and negative 5 pi over 6. that's opposite inputs opposite angles giving us equal outputs for x for cosine so if we look at our x's these opposite angles are always producing equal outputs opposite inputs are giving us equal outputs for x so therefore for cosine cosine then by definition what even means is an even function and so if we take cosine theta and cosine negative theta opposites they're going to be identical that's exactly what it says cosine pi over six cosine negative pi over six you have identical outputs that's great cosine is an even function and that's what this says opposite inputs are giving you equal outputs that's what that is here's what it means practically if you see cosine of negative 30 degrees it is equal to cosine of positive 30 degrees you can just change the sign why magic no because they're they're even and we just saw that on a unit circle it makes some of our math really convenient to know that cosine is even graphically it's important too we're going to see that cosine does this about the y-axis now what about secant because secant is the reciprocal of cosine it's also an even function so whether you plug in negative theta or positive theta to secant you are going to get the same exact output opposite inputs equal outputs for even functions cosine and secant are your only two even functions that means you basically just change the sign of your angle and be right um this is also only true for of course where secant is defined we have a couple places where it's not uh one over x where x is zero that would be pi over two and three pi over two so those two places are are not defined anyway and so of course this would not hold now what about odd let's look at our y coordinates if i start taking a little quicker here if i start taking opposite inputs opposite angles our outputs for y are also opposite so pi over 6 negative pi over 6 one half negative one half and that follows all the way around the unit circle for opposite inputs i'm getting opposite outputs for y therefore for sine beside is y what that means is that sine is an odd function opposite inputs are going to give me opposite outputs that's going to create on our graph this function that's symmetric about the origin it's going to look like this as we go through no it's not a cool dance move it's exactly what sine does so when we take a look at the definition of what an odd function is by definition sine is odd opposite inputs give us opposite outputs well therefore if opposite inputs give us opposite outputs then we can change the sign of our angle and it changes the sign of our function that's what odd means because of that cosecant is also odd and when we compare them um when we have an odd function and even function in ratio when you have uh sine over cosine of theta in both cases it's it's the oddness that prevails um so an odd function divided by an even function every case i can think of is going to give you an odd function out and that's what happens with tangent as well you can see it if you wanted to here is tangent of pi over four would be one tangent of negative power four is negative one those are opposite inputs giving you an opposite output so tangent's odd same thing for cotangent so it organizes for you the only given functions you have are cosine and secant for odd you have sine cosecant and then tangent cotangent those are odd here's what it means very quickly it means that you can change the sign of your the sine positive or negative of your angles but you have to do it in relation to whether they're even or odd remember cosine and secant are the only even ones the rest of them are odd and you change the sign of your function cosine and secant you don't so if i want to go down here to cosine of negative 30 degrees cosine is even opposite inputs equal outputs that means i could just write this as cosine of positive 30 degrees and that's absolutely true now is it any easier to find on a unit circle sometimes yes sometimes no but when we're dealing with identities and a lot of times in calculus and if we're dealing with inverses you have to have a divide defined specifically where your inputs can only be in a certain interval and so this is very very helpful for us so if i have cosine of negative 30 degrees i say hey opposite inputs didn't have equal outputs i can just change the sign and get the same output opposite it's same output then i know cosine 30 degrees is going to be the x that's square root of 3 over 2. now i could have done cosine of negative 30 degrees still square root of 3 over 2 but i'm showing this for you to practice so that when we get there it's going to make sense so this would be square root 3 over 2. now how about sine well sine is not even sine is odd and so we can change the negative 60 degrees into a positive but to do so we've got to realize that opposite inputs are giving you opposite outputs for sine so change the angle change the sign of your function that's what odds do even say change your angle that's an input don't change the sign of your function so sine of negative 60 we certainly could have done sine of negative 60 degrees and got negative square root of three over two but now maybe it's a little bit nicer to do quadrant one so a negative sign of 60 degrees and here's how this works you go to sine of 60 degrees you say okay sine of 60 degrees is square root of three over two and it says make it negative yes we get the same thing either way but often times it's nice to be able to manipulate that angle to use in other identities we'll see that after we talk about pythagorean identities in just a little bit how about cosecant of how let's see let's get secant secant of negative 30 degrees if we did secant of negative 30 i need you to remember that cosine and secant are even so secant of negative 30 degrees is the same thing as secant of positive 30 degrees so what's that mean let's go to 30 degrees here's positive 30 or pi over 6. secant says i'm going to take 1 over cosine that is cosine so i'm going to take 1 over cosine or reciprocate cosine so cosine of 30 degrees is square root of three over two secant therefore is two over square root of three if we if we rationalize the denominator that's two square root three over three i hope it's making sense to you i know i've thrown some degrees up there just so we can kind of refresh that those actually do happen as well most of the time we're going to use radians in this course but we need to be used to both how about cosecant of negative pi over 6 so we're thinking cosecant the only two even ones that you don't change the function for when you change the sign of your angle are secant and cosine everything else you do so cosecant is odd we're going to change the sign of our angle we're going to change the sign of our function for those of you who have seen this before i hope i hope i make it easier i hope that you're seeing oh that's that's actually not that hard if i just remember the evens everything else is odd i can just change the sign it's fantastic okay so cosecant of pi over 6 let's think about this in terms of its reciprocal function cosecant in your head must be paired with sine so i'm going to go to sine of pi over 6. here's pi over 6. here's sine now i'm thinking cosecant is the reciprocal of that so again i've said my angle i'm going to think of positive pi over 6. i'm going to go to sine because that pairs up with cosecant sine is one-half cosecant is 2 over 1 therefore and then i'm going to say oh i want negative two over one i don't show a lot of work on these um because because i i have in my head this this process of how these things work together and i've built that for you over the last several videos so you can use it that's okay if you need to show more work absolutely do it but in most cases when you get to it it's not going to be that necessary for you how about tangent of negative pi over 4 because tangent is an odd function i could certainly go down to tangent of negative pi over 4 and get negative 1. that's what we're going to get out of this but to practice these odd identities and even identities we're going to say tangent's odd why because it's not cosine secant therefore if i change the sine of my angle i change the sine of my function that's what odds do so tangent of pi over 4 says all right uh here's pi over 4 tangent would be y over x that's 1. but this says okay this part would be 1 now make it negative that's just negative 1. i hope that makes sense that's where i'm going to leave you uh with even and odd as far as sine and cosine is concerned so we understand hopefully that even that's only cosine and secant odd is the rest of them sine and cosecant tangent and cotangent so what we're going to do is come back with what the pythagorean identities are we'll practice in conjunction with even and odd we'll put the two together and see what we can do so let's take a look at the equation of a circle now the equation of circle lines missing something up there is x squared plus y squared equals r squared in general but on a unit circle it's x squared plus y squared equals 1 squared because the radius would be 1 or 1 squared is just 1. now this is quite interesting because we also know on a unit circle that cosine of theta is x and sine of theta is y so here's what we're about to do we're going to say because cosine theta is x and because sine theta is y we can substitute those into that equation of a circle why because we're talking about a unit circle here and we're going to get what is called a pythagorean identity why that is is because it's based on the pythagorean theorem which is the equation of a circle or the equation of how a right triangle described on a circle works or any right triangle really so what we're going to say is if that's the equation of a circle specifically the unit circle because it has a radius of one then we know that on a unit circle that's why we had to have that one on a unit circle sine of theta is y and cosine theta is x we understand that what that means is we can make that substitution so if x is cosine theta and y sine theta x squared plus y squared equals 1 can change into x squared plus y squared equals 1 squared but 1 squared is 1. now we write powers of trig functions a little funny um we don't we can write them in parentheses for sure but we can also write it a different way to get very used to it where we can write that power is well we don't really want to just erase parentheses and do like cosine theta squared because that looks like the angles being squared remember all these trig functions have angles with them that's very important to understand we don't want to write that because we can square angles sometimes but it doesn't this is not what we are intending to do we're trying to say the function itself cosine theta with the angle in the function that value is being squared the x value is being squared how we write that is instead of having the power 2 here we actually put it here that means cosine squared theta or cosine theta squared these two things must become interchangeable in your head sine theta quantity squared is also written as sine squared theta also keep in mind because of the commutativity of addition you can write this differently you can write this as sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta equals one that right there is called the pythagorean identity for trigonometric functions or at least one third of them now there's some corollaries to it correlation means follows directly from this um things like this could you start like hey subtract cosine squared theta from both sides yeah you really could and this would be just like a corollary the pythagorean identities here now what's that mean to us well later on we're going to start using that so if you ever needed to change sine squared into a cosine you can do it or cosine squared into sine you can do it or if you ever have sine squared plus cosine squared of the same angle you can change that to 1. that's fantastic that's what man that's what makes identity so valuable um a lot of students are like i hate identities you really shouldn't i know they're difficult sometimes but with those identities they actually make your math way easier and sometimes even possible especially when we get to calculus we deal with this system all the time so what we're going to do now is i'm going to talk about two other pythagorean identities that we can get i'll show you the the derivation of them and then we're going to go through and practice them a little while all right let's take a look at the other pythagorean identities you can get along with their corollaries which may or may not show up in your textbook i don't know if you even are following one but i want to show them to you here to make sure at least two of them will to make sure that you understand that there's lots of things we can do without actually having to look up angles and simplify some expressions so i know i've written the same thing here no i'm not going crazy i'm going to show you some other trigonometric identities that you can get with the pythagorean identity that we started with so what we should understand from what i showed you just a minute ago is that sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta if your angle is the same is going to equal one and we have some corollaries just by subtracting respectively cosine squared theta or sine squared theta and we get okay a way to convert now let's say that we did something else let's say that we took our original pythagorean identity and divided all three of these terms by sine squared theta first and then cosine squared theta for this one and see what we get out of it so if we divide both sides by sine squared theta we're going to get not zero we're going to get one we're going to get cosine theta over sine theta squared remember we can this really is cosine theta squared and this is sine theta squared so we can we can kind of factor out that that factor out over division here that exponent we would get cosine theta over sine theta squared but cosine theta over sine theta is cotangent theta so this will become cotangent theta squared we'd write that cotangent squared theta now what about one over sine squared theta well one is the same as one squared sine squared theta is sine theta squared so this we can think of it as one over sine theta quantity squared but one over sine theta is cosecant theta this therefore is cosecant theta squared and we write that as cosecant squared theta so by dividing all of our terms or both sides by sine squared theta we get 1 cotangent squared and cosecant squared that gives us another pythagorean identity 1 plus cotangent squared theta equals cosecant squared theta and by doing the same exact thing we did here by adding or sub well by subtracting some some of these terms we can also get let's subtract one cotangent squared theta equals cosecant squared theta minus one that's just subtracting one or if we subtract cotangent squared from both sides we'd get cosecant squared theta minus cotangent squared theta equals 1. so we can see those come up these are mostly what you find but the correlations are very valuable especially later on let's do one more let's divide everything by cosine squared theta well if we do that and for the same reasons here we have sine squared theta over cosine squared theta that's tangent squared theta sine of cosine is tangent and so squaring that says yes you factor out the power 2 by over division and then sine theta over cosine theta is tangent and we have tangent squared here we get 1 and here we get secant hopefully you see the secant 1 over cosine secant and so we'd write that as tangent squared theta one and then one over secant that's one over cosine squared theta is secant squared theta that's our third and final pythagorean identity now let's write out a couple of these corollaries we can get we could subtract 1 from both sides we could subtract tangent squared from both sides and get a couple more namely by subtracting 1 we can get tan squared theta equals secant squared theta minus 1 and by subtracting tangent squared theta we can get secant squared theta minus tangent squared theta equals one and those come up quite often um sometimes if you're not shown these you have to manipulate your original pythagorean identity it's not that hard but the reason why i'm giving these to you is not to memorize them but to understand that you can use them different ways and that's very valuable so let's start taking a look at some of these these examples on simplifying i know i've covered up some of them because i want to use the unit circle for this one but i want to show you that we don't really need to for the rest of them we're going to use our identity to simplify but also i want to mention that i gave you a very basic way to start simplifying some of your your angles that go more than one rotation around your unit circle i'm going to start showing you a more advanced technique using the period of your trig function in which you're dealing and the remainder upon division of your denominator times that period i'm explain that as we go on it's a little more advanced it deals with kind of a mod of numbers a little bit of number theory in there on very much like how i if you're familiar with measuring numbers repeats every so often well the same thing happens here because we have that repetition running in a circle let me show you what i mean by that as we get into it so let's take a look at tangent tangent of negative 37 pi over 4 i don't like negative i don't like dealing with negative angles let's change it because tangent is an odd function we can write this as negative tangent 37 pi over four that's obviously a lot of times around the unit circle how many how many times and then where would you end after you made those revolutions well that almost is a division concept isn't it so i'm going to show you kind of something kind of special um this is the way it's a little bit more advanced of a way but i want to start showing it to you i've given you a basic way i've given you the way if you understand the period of tangent that you can just subtract pi over and over and over and over again until you end up needing a circle you can totally do that so if you subtracted pi you'd say okay that's 4 pi over 4 that's pi the period of tangent is pi remember the period is sine and cosine or 2 pi so if you take this and just start subtracting pi eventually you're going to get something on a unit circle you do it several times by understanding that process here's what i like to do i understand for tangent that the period is pi i'm going to put one pi specifically this is how i determine where this is going to lie i take the period that's 1 pi multiply your denominator by that well it's going to be 4. remember that that's kind of like saying 4 pi over 4. and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to divide this number by that period times that number ultimately you're taking 37 pi divided by four high your pi is going to cancel you're gonna get 37 over four that's how that works 37 divided by 4. now i don't care how many times the 4 goes into that because that's just going to be repetitions of pi around your circle so i don't care how many times it goes into that what i care about is the remainder so 37 divided by 4 4 goes into 37 9 times that would be 36 it has a remainder of 1. so that would be subtracting 9 pi's and you're going to get a remainder of 1 pi over 4 that works every time again take this number 37 pi divide by denominator times period the pi's are going to cancel you're going to need 37 over 4 and look for the remainder the remainder here is one that would be one pi over four remember what you do with remainders with remainders when you divide you take that remainder you divide by what you divided by that'd be one remainder one divided by four that was your what you're dividing by so can we find tangent pi over four easier than we can find tangent of negative 37 pi over 4 yeah way easier here's pi over 4 tangent is 1 so y divided by x and then make it negative this is negative 1. now what would you do for sine or cosine well the period is not 2 pi oh sorry not pi it's 2 pi so you take your numerator like 37 pi divided by 4 times 2 pi that'd be 8 pi pi's cancel 37 divided by 8. figure out how many times 8 goes into 37 without going over that's four times and then whatever your remainder is you put that over uh your your denominator and then what you'd end up getting is something on the unit circle so that does work i hope that makes sense to you what we're going to do now is we're going to talk about why we don't necessarily need to use an unit circle and deal with some of these identities so let's take a look at them how about sine squared 40 degrees plus cosine squared 40 degrees now that looks oddly familiar because that is the pythagorean identity there for sine and cosine sine squared plus cosine squared of the same angle always equals 1. i don't care what the angle is there's no work to do here there's no i've got to look that up on the unit circle they don't no that's why we have identities to make it easier whenever you have sine squared plus cosine squared of the same angle you are going to equal one what about secant squared 18 degrees minus tangent squared 18 degrees well that doesn't look like that no it doesn't but it's also the reason why i made sure to give you some corollaries here so this this could be manipulated back to tan squared plus tan squared plus one equals secant squared theta you could do that but check it out because i wrote down these corollaries here i know that secant squared theta minus tangent squared theta where your angle is the same will also equal one here's secant squared tangent squared minus and the same angle this equals one does it matter that that's 18 degrees now it could be 18 could be whatever could be 19 degrees could be pi over 4 or whatever this is always going to hold true for that now how about things like this when you have tangent pi over 4 sine pi over 4 cosine pi over 4 it might be very tempting to try to look these up like well that's one that's square root two over two that's square root two over two two square root two over two divided by square root two over two is one so one minus one is zero that's true but sometimes it's easier to use some of our identities to get there for instance do we remember that sine of an angle over cosine of the same angle that is how tangent is defined so this is tangent pi over 4 minus that is tangent pi over 4 sine over cosine make tangent with the same angle this is tan now while you certainly could have used the unit circle here what if that wasn't pi over four but pi over five well then we can't do that and so that that that's why we want to get very good at the identities i hope you caught that this is a very special angle but if it wasn't on the unit circle you would mightily struggle with this unless you had the identities now that we do it says i really don't even care what pi over 4 is tangent minus tangent of the same angle you're subtracting the same thing that's zero let's take a look at a couple more so imagine we have secant of negative pi over 18 cosine 37 pi over 18 you that's another unit circle that's true and that's why these identities are very important so what we're going to do is try to make these as simple as possible some key thoughts i'm trying to train you on how to deal with identities now these are what are called basics there's some basic identities we're going to deal with one ones that are much more hard more difficult but when uh when you go through them there's some key thoughts number one can we simplify the angles at all can we put those angles on a unit circle by using some of our basic identities like even odd or if it's more than one revolution around the unit circle can we translate that into an easier type of an angle then after we do that we try to get everything to sort of match up if we have sines and cosines put everything in sines and cosines if we have tangent try to put everything in tangent or try to make a some one of these identities that we're sort of building work even their corollaries like we've seen before so i'm going to start showing you that firstly secant of negative pi over 18 i don't want to deal with the negative angle so let's use the fact that secant is even and changes to secant of positive pi over 18. now i don't really like cosine 37 pi over 18 either so that goes more than one revolution around that unit circle we understand hopefully that the period of cosine is two pi so here's how i like to do this take your denominator multiply it by your period that's 36 pi take and divide them so 37 pi divided by 36 pi pi's cancel 37 divided by 36 37 divided by 36 36 goes into 37 one time and has a remainder of one i don't care about that one i care about that one that remainder divided by that number will be exactly what this changes to after you subtract those revolutions so this is going to be cosine of 1 pi over 18 not 36 not 36 but 18 because the period is 2 pi not 1 pi now that's true well now take a look at this in a different lens we've already simplified our angles as much as we can they look really good and they're the same that's great because then we can use other identities so i don't want to look up pi over 18 on a unit circle it's not there so instead we think okay we have secant we have cosine if r if we have sines and cosines write everything in terms of sines and cosines if you can so here's cosine here's secant i'm going to write that in terms of sines and cosines we know that secant is one over cosine and because we have one over cosine times cosine of the same angle since we simplified our angles that equals one okay last one so i've got sine negative 20 degrees cosine 380 degrees plus tangent of 20 degrees our first thought is simplifier angles so i know that since sine is an odd function sine of negative 20 degrees can be written as negative sine of positive 20 degrees change your angles sine change your functions sign for odd functions so we'll write this as negative sine 20 degrees now have the cosine that's more than one full revolution 380 degrees so let's subtract 360 degrees so that's going to give us 20 degrees well that's very convenient now we take a look at it there's two options here i know i just mentioned to you that you can write everything in terms of sine and cosine you could write this as sine 20 degrees over cosine 20 degrees and you could see that negative plus positive the same thing is going to give you zero with tangents a lot of times we want to see if we have other tangents somewhere in there so in our case we have sine divided by cosine that is tangent of 20 degrees but negative tangent of 20 degrees and of course negative tangent 20 degrees plus tangent 20 degrees how do you care what tangent 20 degrees is that's going to be zero i hope that you've got a feel uh for how these identities start to work we deal with a lot more of them but this is just our jump off point i hope i've made it very clear on how to a slightly more advanced way to change some of our angles into something simpler something that's on a unit circle i hope that you've understood everything we talked about in terms of pythagorean identities so next time we're going to go on to something a little bit different for now we should really should be practicing changing our angles into something on a unit circle and really getting a feel for how to use our even odd and pythagorean identities have a great day you
