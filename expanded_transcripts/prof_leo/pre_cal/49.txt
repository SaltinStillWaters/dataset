Transcript for: One to One Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 50)
hey there hope you're doing well and i hope you're ready to learn about inverse functions uh but before we get there we're going to learn about one-to-one functions so in this video we're going to be talking about what a one-to-one function is i'll tell you what they do and why we need them so what you should learn is that a one-to-one function is just one input giving you one unique output and why we need them is so that inverses can happen that's our next video why we need inverses so that we can explore exponentials and logarithms so we're gonna get right into it to be pretty brief there's not a whole lot here besides you just need to know what a one-to-one function is so that you can tell when a function is going to have an inverse and when it's not so a function it is a one-to-one function firstly if if it's a function and secondly if that function gives you one unique output for every one input you see if we just cover up this one word right there that's what a function is so a function is where one input gives you one output but a one-to-one function says okay okay it is a function for sure so one input is giving you one output but that output is unique unique means doesn't happen again like we're all unique we don't have an exact replica of someone of ourselves floating around somewhere hopefully but that's what a one-to-one function is it's where one input gives you one unique output it doesn't happen again and so we're going to explore that a couple times to see what it looks like the reason why we have to have one-to-one functions for inverses to work remember this is not just a video about one-to-one functions it's a video about one-to-one functions it's supposed to teach you something else about inverses so here's why you need it in an inverse what we're going to find out is that we are going to switch the x value with the y value in general for every inverse that we we deal with so we need functions to be one to one in order that their inverses are also functions we're going to explore that when we get to inverses for now one to one function means one input one unique output doesn't happen again so we're going to take a look at that let's imagine we get this this scenario here so we've got some employees and they have an id number so there's mark joe ty jane and mark has an id number 325. and joe has an id of 184 tai has this double 07 and jane has 291. so what are inputs and what are outputs our inputs are the names mark joe ty and jane and their id numbers are our outputs 325 184 007 291. one idea that i like to say that one-to-one functions have to maintain is this idea of mapping forward and backward so if i say a name goes to an id number the id number has to be mapped backward to that same name well that's the case here if i say mark you know the id is 325 if i say id of 184 you know i'm talking about joe if i say 07 you know that that's tie and if i say jane you know it's 291 they're mappable both ways so inputs determine one output and outputs determine one input you see if we didn't have a one-to-one function it'd be something like this now that one worked too well if we were trying to assign id numbers to employees because if i was trying to punch in my code and i'd be like all right 325 i know that's mark 184 i know that's joe double of seven well here if both tai and jane have double o seven um well then they both they would both have an id number notice it would still be a function every input has one output even tie and jane they both do have an output the problem comes in if i'm trying to put in my double 07 it doesn't know who to go to it doesn't know from where it came and so we'd be punching in zero zero seven and then the computer whatever we get confused like well who is that is that chi is a jane that doesn't make that doesn't make any sense this is a non one to one function right now so before we had a one to one function this is not this is not one to one because in inputs giving us a unique output yes and here but not here this input is not giving us a unique output maybe argument who's writing double 07 i don't know even if i do this i said well that's all everything now you now you're you both have double seven well well that's the same thing um that's just listed the output twice but they still have the same output it's still not mappable backwards and forwards in order to be a one-to-one function every input has to have a unique output it can't occur again and again the reason is when we get to inverses your outputs become your inputs so if my outputs become my inputs then one input is giving us one output that's a function but the reverse would not be true if these were inputs it would not be a function i'd have the same input giving me two different outputs and we know that's not possible for functions that's why we need one-to-one functions to exist so that our inverses actually make sense so let's explore this now that we have just kind of an idea down on what one-to-one means this is not one-to-one the previous example was let's look at now some relationships and then some graphs and then we'll start talking about some functions in the next video so let's take a look at f and g these are just relationships that have four points and five points respectively and if we know anything about points we know that our inputs are x values so 1 3 negative 7 and 18 and our outputs are negative 2 4 1 and 12. all we have to check to see whether this is a one-to-one function is this are your outputs repeated if they are you do not have a one-to-one function if your inputs are repeated you don't even have a function at all so and we saw that on what was called the vertical line test well now we're not really looking this way we're kind of looking this way it's going to lead us to something called the horizontal line test in just a moment so what we look for is hey 1 3 negative 7 18 none of those are repeated none of our inputs are repeated that means this represents a function then we look at our outputs negative 2 4 1 12. oh none of our outputs are repeated that means we had a function now this is a 1 2 1 function every input is giving us a unique output negative 2 4 1 and 12. those do not occur again this is one to one now let's look at g if we had to read through our inputs and it's pretty easy to identify which is why this is such a quick video our inputs are 2 11 negative 5 6 and negative 1. we can tell right there none of our inputs are repeated what that means is that g does represent a function we just need to classify and say is it a one-to-one function why well because with one-to-one functions i can find an inverse why do i need an inverse inverses are the only way mathematically that we have to undo a lot of the things that we have such as we need subtraction why so because it undoes addition uh we need division why because it undoes multiplication we need a square root why because that is a power 2. we need logarithms why because they undo exponentials exponentials we're going to find out are a one-to-one function and therefore have to have an inverse and we're getting there so is f gonna have an inverse yes because it's one to one is g gonna have an inverse we're about to find that out we know it's a function for sure because our inputs are not repeated and now we check our outputs 6 9 negative 2 negative 3 and 6. oh that's a problem if our outputs are repeated well then what that means is that we do not have one input giving us a unique output and when i get to inverses and switch them around my outputs become inputs i don't even have a function anymore so while g is a function it's not a one to one function two gives you six and negative one gives you six every input is not giving you a unique output this is not one to one all right in the next video we're going to find out that this would cause you to be able to find inverse this one wouldn't for some of the reasons that i mentioned we will explore a lot more in the next video now we can finally look at this graphically just to understand that if our x-axis is our input axis and our y-axis is our output axis here's what we're looking at firstly we want to determine whether these are all actually functions so we're going to use what's called the vertical line test vertical line test says your outputs look this way so for every input if you wanted to find the output you would look vertically and so we imagine a whole lot of vertical lines and we say all right if a vertical line were to intersect our graphs at more than one point then what that would signify is that at that input where we have two different outputs and functions do not allow for that so vertical line says these are all functions they're all functions they all pass a vertical line test every one of our inputs on all of these graphs is giving us one output now we check whether it's a one-to-one function wait one-on-one functions say are your outputs repeated because outputs are along your y-axis we'd say okay it's it's like this does this graph have an output of let's imagine three does this graph have an output of three i would be looking not vertically i believe it horizontally because that is the level at which that would have that particular output so if i'm looking for more than one output to occur graphically i'm actually looking horizontally i'm saying okay these are my output levels kind of like a ladder go up and down and just check to make sure at that level you only have one output so this if i imagine all these horizontal outputs all these horizontal levels it's only going to be hitting my graph at one time that means that all of our outputs are unique they don't happen here and then happen again later they're only happening once every input is giving us one output yes that was that's a vertical line test one unique output that's the horizontal line test that's why you need both of them vertical says function horizontal says okay now he determines a function now you have a a one to one function this because every level is giving us every output is giving us exactly one intersection with our graph that says that we have only one output at each of those out of those y values each of those levels if you will this is one to one so is the next graph so if i imagine all of these values along the y every possible output we could have and imagine some horizontal lines because that's the level of which your outputs would be well at those horizontal lines i'm only intersecting a graph one time that means there's only one output for each of the or one point that represents those outputs at each of those values so this is a one-to-one function as well now the next graph a parabola and in general every parabola unless we start restricting the domain and we'll see that in our inverse functions that we can't do that sometimes but if i take a look at this and say well okay let's imagine let's imagine all these y values all these output values and i'm going to think output values are are a horizontal thought it's this level so if i'm looking at at this level of an output am i touching my graph twice if i am then there are two inputs which give us the same output and that's not allowed we have to have unique outputs so here's our and there's there's lots of them but there's there's two outputs here that are the same that means there's two different inputs that are giving us the same output well that's not unique what would happen is that when i try to find inverse my outputs become my inputs and then i would have the same input remember that's the same height right the same value that one output value becomes my input value i'd have the same input giving me two different outputs we would see that so this right here this is a non one to one function this is not one one it's still a function but it's not one to one because we have the same output twice and multiple times actually if you think about a lot of these horizontal lines you can probably look through the rest of them hopefully you can identify which one of these next two is a one-to-one function which one's not if we think about the horizontal line test well we already determined vertical they're all functions horizontal line test says at every single potential level on the y-axis every single potential output i need to have at most one intersection with my graph notice we can miss it and that would actually be okay but if i think about every potential level it's only hitting my graph once and that's signifying that these outputs are only happening one time they don't happen again later there's only one inputs giving us that one output and that is mappable backwards and forwards which is going to lead us to inverses this is one to one the next one's clearly not if we think about some of these horizontal lines in this case we're intersecting this graph three times that means that we hit the same output three different times for three different inputs that is certainly okay for functions but not okay for one-to-one functions now we talked about the horizontal line test right we said if you imagine horizontal lines if those horizontal lines hit your graph more than once you do not have a one-to-one function because that would represent multiple outputs that are the same not unique well if it's called the horizontal line test then a horizontal line can't pass the horizontal line test we'd have no outputs until we get to right here let me say oh hey we have a whole bunch of the same output that's what the horizontal line means it's constant so this right here cannot be a one-to-one function either at lots of different inputs we're getting the same output and that would be a failure of a one-to-one function so again why did we learn it we learned it because we're going to find out the next video that only one to one functions have inverses and every inverse comes from a one to one function so if a function is one one it has an inverse if a function has an inverse it's also one to one so we needed this to determine that functions have inverses and then we're going to find them in the next video so i hope that made sense i know it was pretty brief so yeah we got a brief we had a quick one but hopefully you now understand when a function is one to one and when it's not we'll talk about some algebraic um looks of functions a little bit later have a good day
