Transcript for: How to Sketch Polynomial Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 31)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to put together everything that we've been learning in the last i don't know how many videos we're going to put together end behavior maximum attorney points the degree uh we're going to put together y intercept we're going to put together x-intercepts multiplicities whether they bounce or cross off the x-axis and we're going to get some sketching of polynomials now this is a very very important concept because when we get to rational sketching we're going to be doing the same thing with this we're just going to add to it and so it's really important to learn now how multiplicity works with x-intercepts and how to get a graph out of it when you get to calculus you're going to be rehashing this but going a little bit further like hey where are your turning points how do you find that because we're going to be estimating right now that's why it's called sketching and it's not straight up graphing because we need more information to do that frankly you need what's called a derivative be able to set it equal to zero and then you find these critical points and then you analyze whether or not their maximum or minimum in in sort of their little neighborhood so that would be a turning point and that's what you're gonna learn in calculus one for right now we're getting a basis down uh so that when we get there you don't have to learn everything just a little bit more so let's put together i have a crazy example here for us where we're going to do kind of the ground work i'm going to make it as hopefully difficult as you'll ever see as far as identifying what all these things are we're not going to sketch this you're going to see why when we get to right here why we're not going to sketch it the y intercept is going to be like what i'm going to alter this a little bit tell you what you would do if that was a x squared minus 9 and then we'll uh we'll actually graph about five examples after that a very basic one and we're going to kind of make them more difficult to the end where you should be able to graph any factored polynomial now i said that and i want to explain that for a second i am going to be giving you only factored polynomials right now and the reason is is because many of these are degree 3 degree 4 degree 5 and so forth you have not learned how to factor those yet and so i'm going to have to teach you a little bit more in the next few videos on how you would factor polynomials if you don't have a general form like a quadratic formula so that's what we're going to get into so let's start with our first example if you have a factored polynomial that looks like that first thing you do is kind of go ah and then once the shock wears off that's crazy there's a a set number of steps that you take in order to get from this to a picture of it the first one i want you to do every time you see a factored polynomial is find the leading term i've taught you sort of how to sort of fake distribute this so that you can find a leading term i'll refresh your memory on that in just a bit but that's really important you do not have to distribute all of this garbage in order to get a picture of this graph so if you have a factored polynomial leave it unless you're absolutely required to distribute it which i don't know why you ever would leave it so i'm going to show you right now just kind of refresher on how you would go about finding the leading term that leading term is going to give us a lot of information so we're going to find leading term find the degree from it the maximum turning points that says max tp when you use tp take it to the max that's not what that means uh this is finding the maximum number of turning points that you can that you have in a graph we're going to find the end behavior then y intercept and x-intercepts with their multiplicity and whether they bounce or touch the x-axis and whether they cross so how we define a leading term is we look at every one of these factors every one of the factors including that coefficient and we multiply the highest power of the variable that we would get if we were to distribute it what that means is we take negative 2 if we were to distribute this there's no exponent here we would only get x to the first power out of that factor if we were to distribute this we would actually get an x squared out of that factor remember that this is not as simple as saying oh x squared plus one fourth that's not what we're doing what we would have to do to distribute is x plus one half times x plus one half but if you think about that if you were to distribute that you would get x squared as your largest power of x and upon distributing the whole thing you really would get just the largest powers of x that you you would obtain in order to find your leading term and that's what we're doing here so you'd say all right if i were to distribute this my largest power would be x squared here if i were to distribute this i would get x plus 4 times x plus 4 times x plus 4 and if i were to distribute the whole thing my largest power of x i would get would be an x to the third power so is it as simple as just taking the exponent here and multiplying it times there yet yes it is now you can't distribute that way but that's what we're going to end with our last one if you were to attribute that that's x squared plus nine times another x squared plus nine x squared times x squared let's see two plus two is x to the fourth power yes you can multiply two times two and get four these are all the largest powers of x that we would get from every one of those factors if we were to distribute it and distribute the whole thing basically comes down to take your coefficient whatever it is multiply it by all of the largest powers of x coincidentally it's 1 2 3 and 4 that you would get and remember to add the exponents here so let's see four five seven eight nine ten that's negative two x to the tenth i guarantee it if you take the time to fully distribute those two things are gonna happen you're gonna spend about 10 minutes you might make some mistakes in there because i know i do when you have that much to distribute but secondly you're going to end with a leading term that is negative 2 x to the 10th for sure that's really all you need to know from distributing this on what you're getting that's it that's the only reason to distribute it is to find your leading term and your y intercept i'm going to give you some workarounds the first one i just gave you is pretty nice so our leading term is negative two x to the tenth we're going to use that to find out several things about this number one is the degree if you remember the degree is the largest power of your ex largest exponent that you have in your polynomial so you look at all the terms you go okay what's the largest power it should be in the leading term the one that's right out front because you should have written this in order so when we look at our leading term it automatically has our degree in it it's 10. the reason why we want to identify the degree is because the maximum turning point you can get now you might not get this many turning points but the most you can get is always one less than that degree and we explored that concept in a few videos ago so you can have at most nine turning points here's what that means you can change directions on your graph from increasing to decreasing or decreasing increasing at most nine times so you could go one two three and you could do that nine times uh so this also gives us an interpretation of our end behavior so when we we learned about power functions a few videos ago we learned that even always kind of pairs up your infinities it has to it has to have that same sign in your end behavior so evens either do this if they're positive evens or this if they're negative even power functions and because our end behavior is based on the power function that we get from our leading term that leading term will tell you your end behavior this says the 10 is an even power function that's like this but then negative 2 says yes but that would be reflected and probably a little narrower because that coefficient in absolute value is greater than one and that's what determines the narrowness or whiteness of your graph that vertical stretch or vertical compression so again we think about it we go all right uh that says even sure that means that we we have either upward opening completely positive infinity positive infinity uh or downward over negative v negative infinity so we look at that and go that's even but that's negative so that makes a end behavior that would do this sort of a downward opening graph if you kind of zoomed out a long way so we're going to draw like just a little picture of that our end behavior should be pointing downward as we get to uh x approaches negative or positive infinity should be doing this and it's going to be doing it very steeply because of that power and because that's a negative two so it's it's going to be very dramatic that's really what we use our leading term for leading term gives us number one the degree from there we subtract one we get the maximum number of local maxima or minimum we can get those are turning points so where we change increasing decreasing or decreasing increasing and then it gives us a picture of our end behavior this right here is what our graph is going to look like outside of all the junk that's going to happen in the middle which is why we sort of leave that empty we don't know how many turning points we're actually going to get but it can be at most 9. but we don't know what that looks like it's just kind of a zoomed out approach of what this graph is going to look like at the ends alright the next two things that we do is we find our y-intercept now had you distributed this your y-intercept would just be your constant term well can you get that without distributing yeah we know the defined y-intercept you just evaluate for x equals zero so you plug in zero so plug in zero here and here and here and here and you're going to get let me do that quickly in my head um 18 144. i didn't do that quickly in my head i did a long time ago but that's why we're not graphing this so our y intercept would be eighteen zero comma eighteen thousand one hundred forty four that's like way up there and this is the reason why most of our our sketching is based on fairly simple things because you just can't graph that at least not very accurately and that's not even the highest point on this graph most likely you'll probably have something higher than that that would it'd be impossible so we're not going to do that the main idea on this particular problem is to get how to find the leading term what that is used for how to find the y intercept without having to distribute in order to find those two things and then to take our x-intercepts and understand what they're doing so let's move on to that right now our x-intercepts are found for basically every function by setting that function equal to zero which is really convenient if we have it already factored and that's great so when we set this equal to zero we can now use the zero product property and what we're going to do is we're just going to set every factor that has a variable in it equal to zero now now listen your coefficient makes no difference as far as your x-intercepts it does not matter so you never set this coefficient equal to zero it doesn't have a variable it's not going to change your x-intercepts all that does is stretch out or compress your graph and possibly reflect it that doesn't make any change on the x-axis because when you reflect about the x-axis your x-axis doesn't change it's just kind of rotated maybe but that doesn't change the value so you don't have to worry about that so take every factor that has a variable in it and set it equal to zero let's do that now that's what the zero positive property says so once we've done that we have some basic solving to do to find our x-intercepts like x equals seven and subtract one-half x equals negative one-half if we subtract four x equals negative four and wait a minute x squared plus nine equals zero we'll wait a minute if i subtract nine i would get x squared equals negative nine if i take a square root that's going to give me a complex number if you think about it more closely we really should have all of these factored as much as possible before we set these factors equal to zero but this is factored as much as possible this is what is called an irreducible quadratic it's something that you cannot factor over the real numbers any more than it is right now there is a theorem that says that you can factor any polynomial into linear or irreducible quadratic factors it comes from a couple things like the factor theorem and the fact that every odd function has to have an x-intercept in it and so because of that you can always reduce a cubic um and there's a lot of theory behind it i'm not going to get into the whole thing but let me just say this if you have a cubic function you can factor it if you have a quadratic it might be near useful so you can have these irreducible quadratics here's the sort of the punch line to it this is not going to give you any real x-intercepts so if you factored your polynomial and you better make sure you infected it and you can't factor any more this thing right here for your quadratic any irregular quadratic is not going to give you any more x-intercepts this does nothing as far as where we cross the x-axis so what does it do what it probably does in a lot of the cases is it gives us a turning point that that doesn't have anything to do with an x-axis so we could have some crossings maybe a bounce and then we could have a loop down like that that right there comes from something like an irreducible quadratic and so that probably is what is going on here we would find these things out with calculus so we're not going to get into it right now you don't really need to we're sketching but that's most likely what's happening with that as far as our x-intercepts this gives you nothing this would be no real solution right you cannot factor that if you solve it you get imaginaries no real solution says this is not yielding any x-intercepts at least not from that factor so once we've done that once we've managed to find our x-intercepts and we only have three in this case we've got the negative four the negative one-half and x equals seven what we're going to do is we're going to assign them the multiplicity from their exponents where we got the factor from so when we think about that okay let's take a look back at x minus seven and let's look at the exponent the exponent on x minus seven that factor was one what that means is that this x-intercept has a multiplicity of one the x plus one-half had a multiplicity of two the x plus 4 has a multiplicity 3. you should remember that the multiplicity really just came from the exponent uh upon the of the factor upon which we got our our x-intercepts this x squared plus nine don't worry about the multiplicity for right now it really doesn't do anything for us because that multiplicity had to do with x-intercepts and since this yields none we don't really worry about it for now in calculus yeah you'd worry about that and i will show you if i change this problem just a little bit that it really does matter but for right now it doesn't so the last thing that we're going to do is we're going to understand that every even multiplicity at that x-intercept causes the graph due to its its little neighborhood having uh above and below that x-intercept would have in the neighborhood around it a the same sign either both positive or both negative and the same thing would happen with um with every even power that you get and for odds it would cause the graph to cross so having the little neighborhood uh different sign or the left and right of that that x-intercept causes different signs that's above and below the x-axis we talked about that multiplicity the main thing here is understand that every even multiplicity is going to cause this to be a touch or a bounce it's going to sort of just bounce off the x-axis at that x-intercept so this would be a bounce sometimes we call it a touch you'll use those interchangeably these are going to be crosses every odd multiplicity x intercept will be a crossing so the graph will cross the x-axis due to the reasons that i kind of just explained again and that is about it with that information we can get a very clear sketch of a graph what would make this better is some additional points to show just how dramatic this is the y-intercept is a good one but between our x-intercepts typically we would plug in a point i'm not going to do that for the sake of time on this video but you can certainly do that also just be aware that with a lot of these polynomials when you start plugging in values between your x-intercepts you're going to get some very very large or very very negative numbers it makes it pretty hard to graph which is why we call it sketching that's that's the whole thing so long story made hopefully a little bit shorter fake distribute find your leading term find your degree subtract one for your maximum number of turning points it will give you a picture of your end behavior in this case even but reflected so draw that picture plug in zero you do not have to distribute to find your y-intercept and then because it's factored yay we can set every one of those factors that has a variable equal to zero solve it usually really really easily because they're all going to be linears or they'll be irreducible quadratics which you can't do anything anyway with then find your multiplicity and let that interpret whether it's crossing for odd multiplicity not odd numbers i don't care about the numbers you care about the multiplicity or bouncing touching for even multiplicity that's about it so now let's move on to the next example this of course is as much oh you know what i forgot to say something about that if we i told you that i would change it if you made this an x squared minus 9 before you did any of this you could certainly find your end behavior just fine and your y intercept just fine but before you went and did your x intercepts you would need to factor that so all of these all of this multiplicity idea comes from the fact that you have factored everything and so you would take the time and say that this would be x minus three x plus three do the nature that being a difference of squares but these would both be to the second power this is x minus three x plus three and the whole thing's being taken to the second power which would instead of this you would actually get x minus three squared and another and an x plus 3 squared and that would give you two additional x-intercepts now on your head right now you should be thinking yeah that's two additional x-intercepts negative three and positive three and they would both be bounces or touches it would not change your end behavior you'd still have this negative even sort of function so this would just make a little bounce bounce and then you on two different sections x axis and then you'd still match up that end behavior the last comment i did want to make is that all of this has to mesh so if you run into like well i can't do this and get that end behavior with that y-intercept then something's wrong these things all have to work together and if one of them's off then uh then it'll show up when you try to sketch it you'd be like well i have to go up but i have this end behavior that says i should be going down either your end behavior is going wrong or you might have forgot like a crossing or or a bounce or your wider shift is wrong so so double check that it's not meshing together something's off okay now let's go on to the next example this is a little bit simpler of course because it's our first one that we're really going to sketch but we're going to go through the same exact process that we did on this so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to find our leading term so step number one our leading term is well we take every factor that has a variable and the largest power that we would get when we distribute that would be x squared times x so our leading term is just x to the third power our degree would be three the maximum number of turning points is two that means that we can have at most two changes in direction do we have two not necessarily but typically with a cubics you will if you have specs in if you have more than one x intercept you certainly do and let's see our end behavior our end behavior look back at your leading term and just check out that power function whether it's odd reflected odd even or reflected even since that's an odd it starts like this there's no negative associated with it so this is an odd power function that means this end behavior is going to look like an odd now some things are going to happen in the middle of that function namely our x-intercepts our y-intercepts things that make it curve a little bit more or less but all in all it's going to end up looking like this at the end behavior okay so once we've done that now we move on to our y-intercept your y-intercept is always found by setting this equal to sorry plugging in zero evaluating for zero you could distribute and look for a constant this one's actually not that hard but if you notice that if you try to distribute there's no constant you would get x to the third minus three x squared there's no constant there which means that your y intercept would be zero and you can do that if you just evaluate for zero so zero squared is zero zero times i don't care what that is it's going to be zero so y our y intercept is 0 0 and the last thing we do is we find our x-intercepts so our x-intercepts come from setting every factor and that's factored that's great and in fact you know what we should have checked it it's factored completely x squared is irreducible really that's irreducible quadratic you can't just factor x squared i mean you could do x and x but that's a repeated factor and then x minus 3 is a linear so we're good what we're going to do is we're going to set every one of those factors equal to 0. now keep in mind i did this when we first started multiplicity i said that if you have variables that are raised to a power think of the factor as x not as x squared so x is the factor the exponent of it is 2 which means x equals 0 sure but its multiplicity is 2. and that's important because we don't want to say well x squared is 0 x is 0 done no we want to say x is 0 and it's a repeated factor multiplicity 2. so we do x equals 0 and x minus 3 equals 0 and it's pretty easy to solve this one is done if we add 3 we get x equals 3. those are the only two x intercepts that we would get we have x equals 0 we have x equals 3 then we look back at those factors and say you know what that x equals 0 came from the x factor and it has a power 2. that's a multiplicity 2. and what that means is that every multiplicity that's even gives you a x-intercept where the graph bounces or touches so i'm going to put balance and then the x equals 3 well x equals 3 came from the x minus 3 factor that's right here and that factor has a power 1. that says that's not really repeated that's a multiplicity 1 x intercept and every odd multiplicity x intercept creates this crossing for your graph and all there is to it right now is to put this stuff together so we go kind of the same order we don't really draw the end behavior we just have in the back of her head so in the back of her head here's what this should do for you the end behavior says that you're going to start down here and you're going to end up here it should do something in here but that's the general trend of this graph is to start low and high the maximum turning points say yeah we should only change direction twice at most you don't even have to change that many times sometimes but you would change it at most twice so where we really start graphing is with our y-intercept and our x-intercepts and i'm going to show you a little known as a trick maybe a tool on how i think of bounces and crosses so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to make my y-intercept my y-intercept is at 0 0. now when you think about that you'll wait a minute then we also have an x-intercept at zero yeah and when that happens when you don't have a constant or when your y-intercept is zero zero you really need to plug in a different value to get something off of the x-axis otherwise you cannot be assured of your end behavior it's there's no way to check your work your y-intercept checks that for you it says oh yeah i have to match my end behavior with my x-intercepts if you don't have anything off the x-axis it's really difficult to do that so we're going to be plugging in a different value in just a minute to check that but when this happens use this but know that you're going to have to plug in another value so we've done that we've said okay x equals zero is a multiplicity two oh it's a bounce so here's x equals zero but we know that the graph is going to bounce here's how i show that this is not in a textbook or anything but this is what i do i always put a little dotted line and the reason why i do that it's kind of what an asymptote would do where it says well you don't really touch it here we're going to touch it it's just a sign for us to bounce it's not mathematical really in nature but i do this i put a little dotted line there because it accused me when i'm graphing like hey uh i can't cross that like there's no way i'm gonna cross that so i'm either gonna come down and bounce this way i'm gonna come up and bounce this way since our end behavior said we have to do this we're going to come up and we're going to bounce off that without the dotted line i've seen a lot of students just cross and go my graph doesn't work of course it doesn't work because you need to bounce here and not cross there so just a little tool that i use when i see bounce i put a dotted line at that x-intercept plain and simple now at x equals three i'm not going to put a dotted line so in my head i know that's a bounce that's across and now i have to make this fit i also said one one thing to you a little while ago that because we don't have a y-intercept that's not on the x-axis we really should be plugging in another value i'm going to plug in one y well it's between two x-intercepts and that's a really good way to find out where this graph goes and so i'm gonna plug in one if we do that one squared is one and one minus three is negative two 1 times negative 2 is negative 2. so 1 comma negative 2. now when you do that please do not assume that you have found like a local minimum or something that point is not a local minimum in fact the local minimum actually happened so if you plugged in two and got negative four how do i know that well because i did the calculus on a little bit earlier and i found out that that right there is actually a local minimum you would find that out in calculus one so how to do that for now really you just need this this and that and your end behavior i'm going to use that one to give you a better picture of it and to show you that this is not your not your local minimum it's not a turning point for you so don't assume that the point you plug in magically is just some some turning point if you plugged in two let's see 4 times negative 1 is negative 4. this right here is but i did i i only know that because i went a little bit further so now we're going to go ahead and sketch it so we take everything it's got to work together we know that our end behavior is down here to up here so we're going to start down here we're going to sketch to make it better you plug in more points we're going to sketch up we know it's got to bounce okay that makes sense because my next point is here i got to go down i'm going to go down a little bit further i'm going to come up hit this i'm going to cross oh that makes sense because my end behavior ends up here that's how we get a sketch for these polynomial driven functions and then we make sure everything works before we move on and make sure that it has at most two turning points it does here's increasing decreasing decreasing increase and that's two turning points it matches our end behavior looks really good we had a bounce at zero awesome we had a cross at three that's fantastic we have another point off of the x-axis to give it more of a shape otherwise you could just make it real flat if you don't have any points off the x-axis you go yeah it looks like this no not really it's a fairly dynamic graph so we wanted to show that as much as possible so that's putting everything together of course a pretty basic example but we're going to come back with about four more just to make sure that i can give you a very very thorough slender explanation of your graphing back in a second all right let's get going a couple other examples so we're going to do things fairly quickly i'm just going to walk you through this four more times to make sure you're seeing the little details making sure that we're really understanding the concepts so number one thing we do is we find the leading term that's typically done by distribution or if you use my technique of that sort of fake distribution idea it can go pretty quickly so what we're going to do is we're going to take the negative 2 this x to the first power and x to the third power the largest powers of x that you would get and the coefficient if you were to distribute this that would give you negative two x to the fourth and that's our leading term now that leading term gives us a lot of information number one thing you write down is what your degree is it's going to be the exponent of your leading term that's the largest power that you would get if you were to distribute this and write the polynomial in order if you subtract one from that you get the maximum turning points the maximum number of local max or min in this whole entire graph that'd be three and also gives you a picture of end behavior if you know about those power functions so the power function says that leading term is a power function that power function will either have an even or an odd exponent even exponents for well even power functions are symmetrical about the y axis and odd power functions are symmetrical about the origin since that's even it has to either do this for a positive coefficient which is why we include the coefficient or this for a negative coefficient which is why i include the coefficient this says this is even that would match up or sort of be symmetrical and downward opening this graph itself would be symmetrical this one doesn't have to be so this is downward opening and even so we're going to sketch that and that is what our graph has to do as x approaches negative and positive infinity it's got to do this in the middle we're going to get some other things like the y-intercept x-intercepts things like that okay so let's uh let's find the y-intercept this is done by either distributing and taking the constant or plugging in zero evaluating for zero so if we do evaluate for zero it looks like we're going to get positive 32 so 0 minus 2 is negative 2 negative 2 to the third power is negative 8 0 plus 2 is 2 so that's negative 16 and negative 16 times negative 2 is positive 32. our x-intercepts here are very convenient and it's kind of a manipulated problem because i'm giving it to you in factored form in general it's not that easy you'd have to find your own x-intercepts but in doing so you'd have the leading term already because you have to factor it but this is really nice if something comes factored so don't mess with that don't distribute this these are really easy to find your x-intercepts so we set this equal to zero and then for x-intercepts we only need the factors that have variables so we don't really care about the negative 2. what we care about is x plus 2 and x minus two and by the zero product property we set them equal to zero we solve them pretty easily we'll subtract two and add two respectively and then just just be careful in this case it doesn't really matter because we have both odd exponents that means the multiplicity is both odd and there's going to be two crosses however you want to make sure that you're looking at the right factor it's pretty easy to go oh x is uh negative two that comes from here it doesn't it comes from here so be very careful go back to the factor from where you got your x-intercept and then look at the x-coordinate so my negative two came from x plus two i'm looking x plus two look at the power 1 and then say okay that's why that's a multiplicity 1 odd multiplicity that's a cross same thing here the two came from x minus two as the factor i look back at x minus two the multiplicity is three because the multiplicity is odd we know that that graph is going to cross the x-axis at x equals 2. and now we just put this all together so what we're going to do is we're going to say all right starting with our idea of end behavior and behavior says we're going to have to be down here do some junk and then end up down there so that has to be the case we also understand that our maximum turning point is three so we can do it most one two three changes do we do that many i don't know but that's as much as we could have then what we know is our y intercept is 0 32 we're going to graph that first our x-intercepts are both crosses so i'm not going to use that little dotted line because i know that my graph has to cross so i'm going to do let's see negative two and positive 2 and we're going to cross here now this is a sketch and i'm not quite sure what happens in here without doing some other math on it so can you assume that that right there is like the peak of your graph you really can't assume that we're going to draw it sort of that way because it is i mean appears symmetrical it doesn't have to be that way but this is also a sketch to be more precise you'd want to do something like plug in 1 or negative 1 some value between the y intercept and your x intercepts so if we plugged in 1 let's see 1 minus if we put in positive 1 1 minus 2 is negative one third power is negative one uh one plus two is three that'd be negative three um negative three times negative two is positive six so we're up here somewhere like right about there so we know that this is going to drop down somewhere in there this of course my scale is pretty far off because i want to make sure we could graph with 0 32 but i'm going to just sketch this i know my end behavior comes up i hit my x-intercept and cross it i hit my y-intercept come down hit my x-intercept cross it and then i'm going to end with my appropriate end behavior now we need something about like that at least that's a decent sketch again to be more precise we want to plug in some additional values here or use derivatives when you get to calculus that clear a lot up for us so i hope that makes sense on that example next we're going to move to this one and do basically the same thing but there is something i want to point out as far as setup we really need to make sure that these polynomials just like when we have them in standard form they're in order um everything is has uh has been distributed for a standard form polynomial well here with factored we want to make sure that everything is factored appropriately if you remember if you've been watching my videos for a while you know that when you factor you factor so that your first term is positive and what that does is creates in every factor your first term positive in order first term positive this is great and this is not great it's not horrible you still get the appropriate look but it's a lot easier to to make sure we write this appropriately so that we get the appropriate leading term and then the appropriate end behavior from it otherwise i've seen a lot of students mess up the sign on that and so what i'm going to show you is that when you factor this this is fine you might want to spend some time on that factor out the negative here's what i mean if we wrote that in order we'd have negative x plus one but we don't like a first term being negative it leads to a lot of sign errors so if we factor that we get negative x minus one also if you notice something that's most people when they do x-intercepts after you finish this little section you're probably going to look at that and go oh x-intercept's a 2 x-intercept's at negative 2. x-intercept's at negative 4. yeah great x-intercept is negative 1. no that's because that's the wrong sign and so by writing this appropriately it's really easy to switch your sign and get it right rather than accidentally switch your sign and get it wrong so our x-intercept here should be positive 1 not negative 1. what that means is that if we write this function a little different form from what originally was if we factor appropriately we should have a negative floating out front so we have our negative we have our x minus 1 and we have our x plus 4 squared that's a better look for it that helps us to find end behavior a little bit easier that helps us find x-intercepts a lot easier and not make a sign ever accidentally if you're not going to show some of this work that i'm showing so let's move on our leading term comes from any coefficient so that's negative one the largest power you get if you were to distribute that's x squared and that's x so our leading term is negative x to the third power because it's so easy to find degree we just write down the exponent maximum turning points we subtract one and the end behavior you need to know about power functions that's an odd so it's like this but it's been reflected so our our end behavior must match up with that sort of look everything has to work to make sure that happens once we've done that we go ahead and we evaluate for zero you can do it anywhere you can do it in the original you can do it here it really doesn't matter where you evaluate for zero so be a value from zero at the beginning hey zero plus four that's four four squared sixteen uh 16 times one is sixteen or here this is sixteen this would be negative one times the negative one as a coefficient that give you positive 16. either way we go we get positive 16. and the last couple steps we take and we set this function equal to 0 and after doing that by zero product property we take every factor that has an x that's x plus four equal to zero x minus one equal to zero and when we solve it we get x equals negative 4 and x equals 1. now's the time when we take that exponent from each factor we say what the multiplicity is and then how that's interpreted so the x equals negative four that comes from x plus four and that has a multiplicity two in your heads you need to be thinking hey that's a bounce or a touch x equals 1 that came from the factor x minus 1. since x minus 1 has an exponent of 1 for that factor that's a multiplicity 1. it's not a repeated root and that's going to be a cross now we're going to graph it so we're going to fit our end behavior our y intercept or x intercepts with the multiplicity across these bounces all on that graph and we're going to start with just the idea like hey i need to start here and end up there if that doesn't happen i've made a mistake i need to have a maximum of two times i change direction if i do more than that i've made a mistake i need to have a y-intercept of 0 16. that's right there i need to have x-intercepts at negative 4 and at positive one i need to understand that at negative four i have a bounce i'm gonna show that otherwise it's just too easy to cross this and be like wait a minute i imagine that imagine if you accidentally crossed so end behavior says you start here you go down if you actually cross and then you cross again you miss your y-intercept and you'd have to have a different linership to make that happen that would be a real strong clue that you made a mistake so we go oh wow how did i mess up oh shoot hey that's a bounce so that means i have to bounce off of the x-axis here and cross it there that's why i use that that that notation so our end behavior says i'm going to start it's probably going to be fairly dramatic because i'm going to have to come down bouncing and come way up here also it's probably not the case that that is your vertex it would be a really funny looking graph if it did well a local maximum let's say it'd be a real funny graph if i came up and then hit that and went sharply down it's probably and you should double check this it's probably the case that if i were to plug in negative 1 i did something above 16. we can try it right now if you want to so if i plug in negative 1 evaluate that for negative 1 let's do it here uh negative one plus four negative one plus four is three three squared is nine one minus negative one is two nine times two is eighteen hey that's above sixteen this point is like right sorry about this scrunchy probably right about there which means that this peaks somewhere between here and here and it's coming down that way in order to find where that is you have to plug these values in for right now later you use some calculus but my point is is that this is not a local maximum so this probably goes way up come back down and cross this is why it's a sketch because i have not taken the time to actually find out what those points are should i it kind of depends on how specific you need to be for right now we're just getting a look of the graph so we understand our end behavior says down and down i end like this i have to have at most two turning points i have them here and something up there if i plug in negative two it's probably going to be higher than negative one or that might even be equal i haven't taken the time to do it then we have our y intercept and we cross so that's a fairly decent sketch for the amount of time that we put in i hope that's making sense we have two more examples and then we're going to call it a day all right let's wrap this up we have two more examples we have some factoring to do i'm going to change the last one just a little bit to show you a tweak on it and that's about it so f of x negative 5 x x squared minus 4 and then x plus 3. if you are going to graph these polynomials that are factored you need to make sure they're all the way factored we've seen it a couple times but just be careful with it so if you have this negative 5x that's good but the x squared minus four if you have quadratics make sure that they're all the way factored if not that's fine they don't give you any x intercepts they might give you some turning points that are sort of hidden with this technique this is sketching but you want to make sure they're all the way factored so we would factor x squared minus 4 as that difference of squares now we get that negative 5x x minus 2 x plus 2 and then x plus 3. now what we're going to do is make sure that we have all of our factors that have x's in them we have all of our exponents we can see them right now and then we can go ahead find our leading term our y intercept and our x-intercepts so our leading term comes from all of the factors including the coefficient that have x's in them and all the largest powers that we would get if we were to distribute so we get negative 5 x to the first x to the first x to the first and x to the first that's one two three four that's negative five x to the fourth with a leading term of negative five x to the fourth tells us a lot about it this says our degree is four maximum turning point of three so we can go one two three different changes and that's probably what happens here well we have at least um three or one we have to have at least that because we have a downward even so the four says we're even the negative five says we're downward and the five says we're pretty pretty narrow because this would have sort of a vertical stretch in it so at least we have a model for that when we get to graphing it we're also going to take care of our y-intercept so the y-intercept comes from evaluating this function or any function for x equals zero that's where the y axis is so when we evaluate for zero we notice right here that negative five times zero is zero times anything else is going to give us zero it's really nice when we have this factored even over here if you want to plug it in here negative five times zero it's going to zero everything out that means that we have on these two things number one we know that we have a y-intercept of zero zero if an x-intercept is zero zero but we also have to plug in another point because we'll have nothing off of the x-axis and you have to have something to make sure that you're following the pattern of your end behavior and to make sure that you have sort of the dynamics of this graph at least sketch and now for our x-intercepts so we're going to set all the factors from here that have zeros equal to sorry they have x's equal to zero and after solving them we get x equals zero we get x equals two we get x equals negative 2 and we get x equals negative 3 and all of them have a multiplicity 1. so whether you want to write that or not you probably should power one power one power one power one every one of those factors that had an exponent of one says we have no repeated zeros we cannot possibly be bouncing these are all multiplicity one they're all odd multiplicity they're all crosses this graph is going to cross the x at every one of those points and now we're ready to graph it so we're going to start with the idea that if we have an end behavior we're going to be coming up and we're going to be coming down we also have a y-intercept of 0 0 we have our x-intercepts we're going to be showing those in just a minute but we are missing something let me show you why you need to point out the x-axis here so if we start graphing this with our y-intercept and all of our x-intercepts one of what you already have right because that that origin that's an x-intercept and a y-intercept but we have x equals two x equals negative two and x equals negative three and we know that all of those are crosses so i'm not gonna be bouncing anywhere i'm to have to follow my end behavior come up cross come down cross come up somewhere cross make a turning point cross and then go back down so that fits our model the problem is is that we really don't know how dynamic this is without a point that's not on the x-axis you could make a super shallow graph that follows that and it's gonna look nothing like the real picture so this is minimum okay really what we should do we should probably be picking a point here and here and in between in between any two x intercepts and outside of the furthest ones that's really what we should do it takes a lot of time to do that so if that's what's required great do it it's nothing more than what i've taught you it's just saying here's how to make it a little more exact i'm not taking the time because it does take a lot of time to do so you'd be plugging in negative two and a half you'd be plugging in negative one you'd be plugging in one you'd be plugging in three and you plug in negative four and figuring out those values what i've done i've plugged in negative one i evaluated this for negative one and i got negative thirty so the point would be negative 1 negative 30. that's way down there and let's see if this fits our model so we're going to come up we're going to cross don't know exactly how high we are but what i'm going to try to do here is i'm going to try to to mimic the dynamics of this point up here so i know it's a fairly dynamic graphics i have to go way down here then way up that's pretty cool so way down way up this is probably pretty high now i'm going to probably run out of white board before i graph the top of that if i were to plug in one i think i got 60 when i plugged in one which is why i played a negative one so 60 is way way up there so this would go way up and then come back down make my point bigger it's a super dynamic graph which is why they're so difficult to graph on one sheet of graph paper because you need like this much of it which is why we are sketching here and i hope that that makes sense i hope you don't think that i'm trying to cheat you out of something i have given you the the main points and i've told you how to make this more specific you plug in the values that are between your x-intercepts usually right in the middle hopefully it's a whole number or at least an integer and then you plug in them some values that are outside of your furthest x-intercept so again you plug in negative four that's left of your furthest left x intercept you plug in two and a half hopefully it's positive otherwise you made the same negative two half you plug in negative one i did i got negative thirty you plug in one i actually did i got 60 and you plug in three it's going to be very very negative that is the way to get a better picture from this thing after that what you'd have to do is some calculus to figure out exactly where those turning points are to find local max and local men okay let's talk about our last one uh well the first thing hopefully you notice is that there is some factoring that has to happen we've got to factor x squared minus 16 first at the very end of this problem i'm going to say what if that was x squared plus 16 what would you do and we'll eliminate some things from it but i'll show you that so we'll factor we don't have to factor x minus 1. that's done for us but what we do get out of this is that we have a a 2 an x squared an x and an x those are the largest powers of x including our coefficient that we would get if we were to distribute this and multiplying them together we have a two x to the fourth hey the degrees four looks really good maximum turning points is three our end behavior that's a positive power function a positive even power function that means it's upward opening it's basically a reflected picture of what this end behavior is it has to do that from here we'd start coming downward we'd end going upward and that's how this graph has to look our y intercept well it's not going to be zero because we don't have any factors that are just x so we're going to have to plug in zero or evaluate for zero and if we do that evaluate for zero it looks like we're going to get negative 32 so zero minus one is negative one negative one squared is one two times 1 is 2 0 minus 16 well that's negative 16. 2 times negative 16 is negative 32. you can also do it here it really doesn't matter it does not matter where you get that y-intercept from the only reason why we do this is to make sure that we're spot-on with the next thing make sure we're spot on with our x-intercepts that's really why we do that so now that we have this all factored ready to go we would set that equal to zero and then use the zero product property now that sets every one of those factors that has an x in it not the two but the x minus one the x minus four and x plus four all equal to zero and when we solve that and look back into the our totally factored polynomial function we're going to take the exponent the multiplicity for every one of those factors from where we got these x-intercepts and determine whether we're going to cross or bounce at that x-intercept so the 1 comes from x minus 1 that has a multiplicity 2. that means we're going to bounce at that point the x equals 4 comes from x minus 4 that's here and that has a multiplicity 1. because that's an odd multiplicity we are going to cross the x axis of that point and the same is true for x equals negative 4 that comes from x plus 4 is a as a factor that has a multiplicity 1 that's also a cross and now we're ready to graph this as much as we're able to again we are sketching so it doesn't have to be exactly perfect it's not going to be because we don't know exactly where the turning points are but we do have to model all of this in our graph so we're going to start with the idea of end behavior i'm dropping and i'm climbing i'm decreasing and increasing on the end behaviors here i have a y-intercept of 0 comma negative 32 i've got a x intercept of 1 multiplicity 2 so it's a bounce and i'm going to show that that is just a cue for me so that when i'm graphing this i know oh yeah i'm just going to bounce off that it looks like i have a cross at 4 and negative 4. so that's the case then what i'm going to do is match all of this to this graph it is probably not true that this is a local minimum this probably goes way down here it comes way back up you'd have to plug in some values to determine that so you plug something like negative two um it's probably the case that this also is pretty far down here you wanna plug in something like negative two something like positive two or positive three i remember like 5 or a number like negative 5 to verify where those points are if you need to be more specific generally we don't we're just sketching here but if you have to be if you want to be plug those values in and see what they do something like like negative 2 oh man let's see uh negative two minus one is negative three that would be nine that's eighteen so you'd have two times nine and then 2 squared that's 4 4 minus 16 is what negative 12. so 18 times negative 12 really down there so that's really that's negative hey at least you know it's negative but it's way down there that's through my floor by a lot so we're we're not going to really graph it but but what does it do it gives you a picture that this is a super dynamic graph this is not something that goes oh yeah i'm just going to come down here bounce and come up this comes down here goes way way way down there hits this y intercept on the way up bounces probably drops way down here again and then comes up and hits that four and continues to positive infinity that's probably what this does again if you need to be more specific yeah plug in some values like i've told you but just be aware that it's going to exceed your graph paper it's going to give you a really really crazy graph in most cases or you have to really adjust the scale to make it work just keep that in mind so i'm going to be sketching it i know we're coming down very drastically coming up bouncing probably coming down way down there and coming up you're going to want to know what that value is if you need to be more specific so this is purely a sketch it gives you a shape of what this graph is doing to be more specific you either plug in a lot of points or do calculus one to figure out derivatives so but we have fit our model we know that our end behavior matches we know that we have a cross a bounce and a cross we've hit our y intercept we set uh let's see three turning points one two and three and it's a fairly decent graph for minimal work again this is minimal work right if we wanted to be perfect we'd plug in all the points but this is sketching and we're getting a shape of it i hope that makes sense to you virgin i'm just trying to prepare you for how calculus one is going to treat this stuff this is like the first four steps and the last step is not hard it's just a basic derivative set equal to zero and then you plug in the values of critical points not bad now i promise you something i said what if we change this to a plus if we change that to a plus then this no longer factors what's that mean if we change that to a plus our end behavior well let's see our end behavior would still be x squared times x squared times 2 that's 2x to the fourth we'd have the same end behavior what would be missing though is we would not have that factoring in fact the only x-intercept would be one this would not give you any x-intercepts this wouldn't be here anymore which means that we would not cross the x-axis at all this would purely be a bounce none of this would be here you would no longer cross the x-axis at all let's see your y-intercept would now be positive 32 and not negative 32. so we probably would come down here very steeply maybe have a turning point in there somewhere that's usually what irreducible quadratics do they have a turning point somewhere that's above or below the x-axis a couple of actually a pair of them above or below the x-axis it probably would come down here bounce if it certainly bounce at one and go back up you'd still fit your end behavior this would be a positive 32 you would only have one x intercept with your balance so probably a pretty dynamic graph but we'd be sort of guessing at some turning points there without calculus one you'd have to be guessing well i hope that this makes sense as far as you're sketching as far as how to put this together this factored polynomial into a graph and i honestly a really good graph i know we're just sketching but it is a really good graph what we're going to do later is take these concepts and sort of fill it in with what asymptotes do vertical asymptotes horizontal asymptotes and oblique or slant asymptotes i'm going to teach all that stuff to you so that when you get to calculus one it's not even going to be a big deal you'll be like yeah i know that wait the only thing i have to do now is derivatives yeah it's not even hard in a lot of the cases especially for polynomials so i'm preparing you for that so that your graphs are really really solid when you get to like a calc 1 level i hope it makes sense i hope you're enjoying it i know graphing is sort of like ah for a lot of people but by understanding what they look like and how they work i promise it's gonna get easier you might even enjoy it i kind of like doing this especially in calc one because it it goes fairly quickly like you're not having spent a lot of tedious time on it so i'll see for the next video what we're going to do next is we're going to start talking about real zeros so that if you don't have a polynomial that's factored you can factor it so i'll see you for that you
