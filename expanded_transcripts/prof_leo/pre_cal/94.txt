Transcript for: How to Solve Trigonometric Equations (Precalculus - Trigonometry 22)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about how to solve some equations with trigonometric functions in them they're honestly not that bad there's just really two things we need to understand about them number one three things number one is that in order to solve equations you need to isolate something and so we're going to use techniques to isolate our trig functions number two once you've done that try to use your unit circle the third thing because we are not using inverse trig functions do not restrict your unit circle so we're isolating using your circle if at all possible if it's a weird sort of thing that your your function is equal to then no we can't but if it's anywhere on the unit circle man we're in good shape and number three is that do not restrict this like we did with inverses you don't need to do that because we are not using those inverse functions to do this we're using unit circle and we get more available uh solutions that way for this on that unit circle the last one kind of hidden thing is that most of the time we're finding all the solutions between zero and two pi so on one revolution of that unit circle we can find a general solution i'll show you how to do that in the first example but normally we find all the solutions within a certain interval because these things are cyclical they go forever and ever and ever we really don't find all solutions all the time just on a certain interval and that also leads to one more thing that's like five things sorry about that is that if ever the argument of your trig function is different from just theta we're going to have to manipulate our period a little bit i'm gonna show you exactly how to do that too so let's get right into it so number one thing whenever we're solving any equation normally we're just isolating a variable well in this case in order to get to that variable in order to get to theta we have to isolate our trig function so think isolate your trig function first we're going to do things like in the first example like subtracting 3 and dividing by 2. so if we subtract 3 we get negative 1 divide by 2 we get negative 1 half now once we've isolated our trig function use your unit circle now you can you can go ahead and think of this like an inverse but do not restrict your domain so i know that sine inverse is only from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 that's true but normally we're looking on 0 to pi for our trig function we're going to answer this question like what angles cause us to have a y-coordinate of negative one-half on the entire unit circle on one revolution and so there's going to be two solutions here so we're thinking sine of theta equals a y coordinate on the unit circle let's find that y coordinate of negative one half and how many angles give me that so if sine has a y sorry sine theta equals our y coordinate and we're looking for negative one half that's there and there so our y coordinate is negative one half here and here so sine of seven pi over six would give us negative one half and sine of eleven pi over six will give it negative one half notice what i'm not doing i'm not using negative pi over six this is almost always from zero to two pi that's typically what we like to do so we're not using it like sine inverse that's probably the biggest thing that students get confused because we just talked about inverses for a really long time and now we're going back to yeah let's use the whole unit circle and that's exactly what we're doing so we're going to say hey in order for sine of theta to equal negative one half theta would have to be 7 pi over 6 or 11 pi over 6. those are all the solutions on this interval of zero to two pi all that means is that those are the two angles on that one rotation that one period of sine for which we're going to get this y coordinate negative one half and it's pretty clear sine of seven pi over six is zero in half sine of eleven pi over six is negative one half those are the two solutions now if you need to show all solutions we know that every time we make a full rotation all of our y coordinates repeat all of our sine thetas repeat for every period that we we traverse and so if we wanted to show that for all general solutions all we really have to do is take these two values both of them i just want to take those two values and add 2 k pi to them what that means is that you're going to hit 7 pi over 6 and if you add 2 pi you're going to hit it again just after one full revolution and then again and again and again and same thing 11 pi over 6. you'd be here add 2 pie you're going to go around again at the same place around again be the same place and we can show it like this just take your solutions and add 2 pi now we throw a k in there say yeah you could you could go positive revolutions or negative revolutions and still end up at the same exact point on your unit circle so those are the two angles on one revolution in the circle that give me this y coordinate of negative one half then if i add rotations to that or subtract rotations that's what the k does says you can add a certain number of rotations full rotations or subtract them and you're going to end up at the same point this would be our general solution so this is all of the values every one of them forever that would possibly give you a y coordinate of negative one half when they do circle that would solve that equation that's really all there is to it so we're isolating using the unit circle typically what we do is we normally just stop here because that's usually what they ask for is finding all solutions from zero to two pi and that's pretty much all that we're we're going to be doing here so let's move on to the next one uh let's let's actually do that one so four cosine squared theta minus three isolate your trig function as much as you can so we're going to add three we're going to divide by four so if we do that we add three and divide by four remember we do have to isolate so cosine squared equals three fourths that's our first step but cosine squared means cosine to the second power how in the world do we undo power twos well we take a square root and we take it on both sides and we use a plus and minus so square root of power two those things cancel we're gonna get cosine theta when we take the square root of three we're going to leave that but the square root of four is 2 we also have that plus and that minus and so we're actually going to get four solutions here now this is a little weird most of our trig functions are going to give us two solutions on the unit circle do you remember that power twos typically give you two solutions like usually for polynomials now this is not polynomial but it's it is going to bear out that way because that square root yields a plus and a minus we're going to get two solutions for cosine theta equals positive square root of three over two and two solutions for cosine theta equals negative square root of three over two so we've isolated and now we've we're solving we're in the process of solving so once we've isolated our our cosine we're going to have cosine theta equals positive and negative square root of three over two use your circle so we're going to take a look at cosine theta equals square root 3 over 2. remember that cosine theta is equal to the x coordinate so all we have to do is go to our unit circle do not restrict your domain to 0 to pi that's not the idea here on the entire interval of 0 to 2 pi find out what angles give you a x coordinate of square root of 3 over 2 cosine theta equals x coordinates we're just going to find that so x coordinate of square root 3 over 2 is here and there so not negative remember one's zero to two pi so x coordinate is pi of square root of two gives us pi over six and eleven pi over 6 cosine theta equals square root 3 over 2 on two angles here pi over 6 and 11 pi over 6. we do exactly the same thing for cosine theta equals negative square root of three over two we understand that cosine theta equals the x coordinate let's look for this particular x coordinate it's going to show up two spots here that would be negative square root of three over two cosine that equals x coordinate look just at your x here it's negative square root of three over two and negative square root of three over two so what angle gives us that x coordinate and that's what that that cosine theta is asking cosine of what angle gives you an x coordinate of what's listed that would be 5 pi over 6 and 7 pi over 6. those are all the solutions to that equation on the interval from 0 to 2 pi because we looked at the entire the entire unit circle we didn't restrict it we're not really using cosine inverse here we don't have to create a one-to-one function this is not one-to-one uh what this is is giving us two two inputs that give us that particular output for this and that that's okay these are all the solutions that are going to solve that equation we can't really afford to be one to one here because we've been missing some of the solutions on the interval of zero to two pi so i hope this makes sense i hope that you're understanding isolate your square iso your trig function use your unit circle on the entire 0 2 pi this will give you all the solutions for that interval don't forget to do things like a plus and minus when you're taking square roots because that's going to lead to more solutions we don't want to miss them all right let's take a look at one more for now 3 squared theta equals 1. let's start all of these by isolating our trig function if we can now we are going to run into some where we need to factor or do a substitution or use an identity and we'll get to those in just a bit but the basic ones where you're only seeing one trig function or where you can combine your terms do it in this case since we only have one trig function we're going to isolate it directly we're just going to divide by 3. now we're also going to take a square root every time we do every time we put the square root on the paper we really need to be putting a plus and minus now sometimes it's not relevant but it certainly is here so we're taking the square root of both sides we're going to get tangent theta on the left hand side and positive and negative 1 over the square root of 3 on the right square root of 1 is 1 square root of 3 is square root of 3. you can leave it like that if you can find the angle that way and some people can some people it's really nice to do that if you're using a table typically this will be rationalized as square root 3 over 3. i hope you can see that we're getting four solutions again so we're gonna find the two angles on zero to two pi where tangent theta equals the square root of three over three that's y over x and the same thing for tangent theta equals negative square root of three over three my opinion it's perfectly acceptable to use a table for this if you're going to look at this and go hey tangent of what angle gives me this particular y over x relationship this ratio that's fine if you're really good at unit circle it's not horrible so when we take a look at this so we just need to understand that we're going to really i really want to think about it this way but you might you see that on your table that's why i give you both of them so we want to take a look at what would give us 1 over the square root of 3 or when you rationalize square root of 3 over 3 y over x gives us gives us that well that's going to be for positive two different angles we're going to have here one half divided by square root of three remember y over x one half divided by square root of three over two is going to give us one over square root three so this is going to be pi over six it's also going to be the negatives negative divided by negative gives us a positive so that'll be negative one half divided by negative square root of three over two that would also give us one over the square root of three and rationalize it would accomplish this for you so there's two angles pi over six and seven pi over six i hope that you just saw so i hope you see some right now i hope you see that if you take pi over 6 and you add pi half a rotation you're going to get exactly the same thing y well with a period of tangent is pi and so we should be expecting that and that that's exactly right so these values are all the same on quadrant one and four if you take pi and just add to it you're going to get the same exact tangent every time even the signs are the same positive and positive for tangent same thing would happen here we're going to be in different quadrants we're going to be in two and four so we're thinking of this all right now tangent of what angle is going to give me this y over x that yields negative one over square root of three from here or negative square root of three over three if you rationalize it uh well that's going to be the same thing that one half divided by square root of three but we need opposite signs to get the negative so i'm thinking one half divided by negative square root three over two and then negative one half divided by positive square root of three over two and notice those are also pi away so pi radians away from another so five pi over six is going to give me that as is 11 pi over 6. i think tangent is probably the most difficult because you have to compare y over x it's not just a y coordinate or an x coordinate it's y divided by x for our coordinates so i hope that's making sense i hope you're seeing the isolate use your unit circle do not forget to take plus and minuses when you take a square root uh that's that's gonna that's a real big deal so we're gonna come back i'm gonna start making them progressively a little bit harder we're gonna do a ton of examples um but i'm gonna make them very concise so i'm gonna go quickly through them just to instill the proper techniques for you let's keep on rolling so uh we're going to continue solving some of these trig functions i'm going to show you what to do when the argument of your trig function is not just theta so how do you deal with that we'll talk about exactly what that means and how you fix it we'll use a substitution and then i'll tell you that that three if you remember from our graphing that cuts well your period it cuts your period into three parts it makes it shorter and so it's going to cycle more often on the unit circle we're going to think of this as cutting a unit circle honestly and then we'll we'll add to it or not add to it depending on what that value is the other thing is what we're going to do for the rest of our examples is just find the solutions that are on that interval from 0 to 2 pi that's what we did in the last few examples just before i also think i had a mistake if i'm thinking back to it i think i actually had an equal sign right there if i did that was an error and the reason why it is is because 0 and 2 pi will yield the same exact solutions on that unit circle and so what we don't want to do is have this issue where 0 and 2 pi give us the same exact solution so we're excluding the two pi typically so we go yeah said equals zero include that but not the two pi that that would double up some of our solutions we don't need that so anyhow let's go go on and solve some of these so sine of three theta equals negative one what in the world you do with that use a substitution so what we're going to do is we're going to trick this problem a little bit we're going to say hey let's call that 3 theta let's call it alpha or something so just something different and let's solve it as if it's just a typical angle we'll use the circle won't be that bad then once you solve this on that particular interval what we're going to do is we're going to divide everything by three so we'll substitute back just a basic substitution and it solves it really nicely so step number one make sure that we can substitute for whatever that angle is to give us something easier to work with something we can find on the unit circle so i'm going to call this three theta something different like alpha so we can say sine of alpha equals negative one now let's treat alpha like our angle and do exactly the same thing here so sine of alpha equals negative one what that's asking for is give me the angle so that the y coordinate is negative one sine of what angle gives me a y coordinate of negative one that's going to be just three pi over two so in this case we don't get two solutions here that typically happens with our quadrant angles because we're not in a particular quadrant right in the middle we don't have this um like symmetry going on that we do with cosine our x extra coordinates and sine are our y coordinates so we don't have that there we're just going to get 3 pi over 2 sine of 3 pi over 2 is negative 1 that's exactly what we're talking about now here's the here's the thought process because that 3 is going to cut it's going to cut your two pi it's going to cut this unit circle in thirds it's going to make it shorter this is going to cycle three times on that period and so what we really if you you can picture it you can pick your sign doing this and if we if we shorten it over the same period it would hit negative one more times because it's cycling faster that's precisely what's going on right now hope that makes sense it's going faster it's going to hit this this value more times because of it so here's what to do whatever number this is just add two pi until you get that many cycles so we want three cycles here so this is one of them add 2 pi 2 why because one full rotation would give you back the same y coordinate add another one because one full rotation is going to be back that same y coordinate and this will cycle three times dividing two pi by three three times within that interval of zero to two pi because we want to find all the solutions from zero to two pi we're going to have to do that so whatever number this is add one less 2 pi then to that one less iteration of adding two pi so three pi over two cool i'm going to add two pi i'm also going to add 4 pi to it so this is going to create one cycle 2 cycles 3 cycles on that 0 2 pi we know that's going to happen because you took 2 pi you divide it by 3 it's going to cycle 3 times on that particular interval 0 2 pi because we're looking for all the solutions there just add 2 pi until you get 1 2 3 to match the 3 right there that's the easiest way i can explain it one two three for that number add two pi until you hit whatever that number is three or two or two or don't add at all for that one actually it's going to be something we have to cross out so we're going to show that so if i take 3 pi over 2 and i add 2 pi to it that's like 4 pi over 2 well that's going to be let's see 3 pi over 2 plus 4 pi over 2 is 7 pi over 2. now don't let this confuse you i'm talking about adding 2 pi to this number and 4 pi to that number so you can do it this way you can add 2 pi go back to here add 4 pi or just add 2 pi and then add 2 pi again so another 4 pi over 2 would give us 11 pi over 2. now if you're thinking wait a second that's way outside of that interval that's exactly right and that's because we're not talking about theta what's going to happen in just a moment well we're going to say hey remember like that one time like five minutes ago where we set alpha equal to three theta well this alpha we're going to replace that with three theta and then we're going to divide everything by three and what that's going to do is pull all of these back under zero to two pi it'll also give us all the solutions from 0 to pi if we hadn't have done that if we had not have added those and got these things well then what would happen is that we would be missing some solutions on 0 2 pi we cut we sorted actually we shorten the period we shorten that cycle so it's going to happen more often on zero two pi add up until you get that many cycles and then do your substitution again so replace it replace it back so now that we have that we can say three theta equals all of those values alpha is three theta so three theta equals all three of those if we divide all three of those by three we're going to solve for theta that's that's kind of cool so we we kind of trick the problem we call this an easier angle to work with we solve it understanding that that's shorter than this it's going to happen more often on 0 2 pi how many times more often whatever that number is so once twice three times just add to until you get that now divide everything by three and if we do that remember that dividing by three is like multiplying the denominator so when i divide by three we're going to get 3 pi over 6 7 pi over 6 and 11 pi over 6. yeah we should simplify that so 3 pi over 6 is really like pi over 2. just check your work just check it real quick just make sure you get it if i plug in pi over 2 this would give me 3 times pi over 2. well that's 3 pi over 2. that's right there and that is negative 1. notice how all of these solutions are between 0 and 2 pi so even though these were outside of it when we divide by three it pulls it right back down furthermore these are all the solutions on zero to two pi this is it this is our entire solution set and that's kind of nice that's really all that we do we're gonna do the same thing with tangent of two theta so tangent of two theta equals negative one we're going to go through the same exact process let's call the angle something different call it alpha so tangent of alpha equals negative one it's still an angle we're still using the same thing we're using the inner circle actually so we're thinking about it tangent of what angle gives me negative one use your table uh use y over x on unit circle i like it that way i'm just used to it you can do whatever you want so i'm thinking what angle tangent what angle gives me negative 1 comparing y over x that's got to be in quadrants 2 and 4. that would be that's negative 1 square root two over two divided by negative square root of two over two is three pi over four and also seven pi over four now we're going to go look back just a moment we're going to look back and say okay what what was this what did that do um that shortened this interval of 0 2 pi by 2. that's what that did now we do understand that the period of tangent is pi i get i get that so it's shortening that 2 but because we have two periods on 2 pi of tangent it's just shortening both of those really and so we're going to add our 2 pi to both of our solutions just make sure that you have that many cycles so add it until you get that so i'm going to go ahead and add 2 pi to both of our answers here so alpha's going to give us three pi over four see three pi over four plus two pi that's three pi over four plus eight pi over four that's eleven pi over four and seven pi over four let's see seven pi over four plus eight pi over four is oh man 15 pi over four now there's a couple of those that are more than zero two pi and they are a little bit out of order it's not such a huge deal but we do want to try to put them in order if we can't it's one of the largest but what's gonna happen well because we used alpha here and not two theta we're gonna substitute back so we said tangent two theta now let's call it alpha let's solve this as if that's our angle okay there's two answers there but because we know we're shortening that zero two pi in half what we're going to do is we're going to take and add up until we hit that many cycles so here's one and two for each solution one and two that's one this is the two for this solution two cycles and two cycles for that solution so there's four total quasi solutions here we're not we're not to theta we're still in alpha now we're going to do our substitution so we're going to say hey alpha really is two theta let's call it that and if we divide everything by two we're basically just multiplying our denominator by two if we divide so it's going to be three pi over eight eleven pi over eight seven pi over eight and fifteen pi over eight now you need to simplify that's fantastic these two are out of order but that is the largest solution that you have it is just less than 2 pi 15 pi over 8 is just less than 16 pi over eight which would be two pi so this is all the solutions from zero to two pi hope you're seeing why it's working i hope you've seen how it's working firstly but then why it's working because that two cuts that zero two pi in half really or both periods of tangent and half we're going to get more solutions that qualify in that interval when we're all said and done it's gonna cycle faster and this is really the best technique i found that'll do it we just have to make sure that whatever solutions you're getting if that number's more than one that you're adding up to that many cycles so for two make sure you have two for three just keep on adding until you hit three here's one two and here's one two and do it for every solution then when we substitute back we're dividing or solving for that theta it's kind of nice all right cosine of two theta equals negative one half and tangent of theta over two equals negative equals square root of 3. i had those on the board before we just ran out of room so i had to erase them so now we're going to solve in the same exact way they're already isolated trig function that that's fantastic and we're going to sort of combine these ideas in just a moment but whenever you have this argument this angle that is not just theta just substitute it solve the equation like normal and then put it back the only caveat here is that that number is going to shorten your period so it's going to happen more often on that interval for which we find all of our solutions on so let's call two theta alpha cosine alpha equals negative one half is asking what angle is going to give you an x coordinate of negative one half well x coordinate of negative one half would be two pi over three and four pi over three so x coordinate negative one half here and here two pi over three and four pi over three now because our our theta or our sorry alpha is equal to two theta that two is shortening this we're going to add until we get that many cycles that many site that many repetitions of this particular the function on zero two pi so that shortens your period therefore it's going to happen more often on zero to two pi and so we're gonna show that so we're gonna add two pi so here's two cycles on that particular solution what that one is is that's right here so that's going to say i have this solution if i go again i'm going to hit back that same thing here here's my my solution if i go again around there i'm going to hit right back at that point so that's two cycles for each solution that you do not two total those are two unique solutions we don't say oh there's two cycles no no this is on the first cycle around you hit the x same x coordinate twice you get negative one half on two different points in the unit circle on one revolution we're going to go an additional cycle to make that 2. so here's 1 2 and 1 2. we're just going to add that to pi so 2 pi over 3 plus 6 pi over 3 that's 8 pi over 3. there's two cycles that we want it matches that make this match that mini and four pi over three let's see four pi over three plus eight pi over sorry six pi over three would be um ten pi over three now that we have that we're going to be very comfortable setting 2 theta equilibriums and just dividing by 2. it's going to take everything that's outside of 0 2 pi and pull it right back in so when we divide you also notice these are really easy to put in order because our denominators are all the same so i put these in order just to make it a little bit nicer you don't really have to it's just nice to see that and then divide everything by two or multiply your denominators by three so two pi over six four pi over six eight pi over six ten pi over six essentially we're just really dividing you could have done that too dividing your numerators same exact thing or simplify those are your four solutions that you get here that now notice all four of the solutions are between zero and two pi there's nothing larger anymore because we divided by two that's how we add these extra cycles because we know we're going to pull them back down so this makes sense to you if you don't do this if you don't add that then you're gonna be missing some and it's really frustrating students oftentimes go i got them then why am i missing some where those come from it's because you have to add those cycles because you're shorting it and it fits more cycles on that particular zero to two pi period you're looking for that's that's why it is let's take a look at that one one thing to notice is that this is this is theta divided by two not times two what's going to happen here don't add any of this in fact this is lengthening this is a length in the period it's going to happen less times on zero to two pi in fact some of the solutions we get here are going to be outside of that are outside the interval we're gonna have to really look at it and say yeah this doesn't fit you can see the spear out for a second same technique works with isolator trig function we're gonna call the inside alpha so tangent of alpha equals square root of 3 says what angle is going to give me this y over x relationship of the square root of 3 well that's going to be a square root 3 over 2 divided by 1 half so the 2's cancel that only happens where y is square root 3 over 2 and x is one half positive both positively or both negatively for for the the positive square root of 3 that we get so it's pi over 3 or 4 pi over 3. so those are the two solutions that we have there from our unit circle typically what i'll do if i'm adding other periods to it is i'll show that these are two different alphas or well i'm sorry two solutions to the same alpha but i'll show that differently so i don't forget to add cycles to it in this case i'm not doing that which is why i wrote the way i did but maybe it's better to do this way so should i add anything to it no not if you really understand what's going on that is making more of them fit shorting remember this is a horizontal compression it's making more of them fit into zero to two pi that is divided by two it's a stretch it's lengthening this there's gonna be less of them that fit and so i'm not gonna be adding anything to this um in fact this is it as far as our solutions for alpha we don't wanna add more because what's gonna happen is we're gonna start multiplying all of these by two even some of the ones that fit in zero to two pi now are not going to later and so we really have to be careful on that one so if you have something divided something less than one don't add any cycles to it if you have something more than one yes adds at least one cycle to it to all your solutions so we're saying less than one don't add any cycles to our solutions now we're ready to set this equal to our our theta over two now we're not dividing by two we're multiplying by two that's going to be two pi over three and eight pi over three oh pay attention to that one how much is 2 pi over 3 well 2 pi over 3 is right there that's fantastic that works just great but 8 pi over three let's see three goes into eight like two times with a remainder of two that's two pi over three plus sorry so that's two pi plus two pi over three that that's a problem because this is outside of that interval so if you're just looking for the solutions between 0 and 2 pi you need to see that that's more than 2 pi 8 pi over 3 is like 2 pi plus 2 pi over 3. this is outside of that range or the well the domain for what we're say signifying that theta is so i hope that makes sense to you hope you're really really getting that if we have a number in front of theta that's more than one you're adding cycles just match up with that number if you have one that's less than one you're not doing that do not do that because you're already probably going to cross some out there once you start multiplying it's going to grow this it's going to make them outside of 0 2 pi so hopefully explain that well enough for you we're going to come back and do some a little bit more complicated getting our a real good handle on this let's keep right on going so we've got secant of three theta over two equals negative two don't be afraid to use reciprocal functions so if secant of three theta over two equals negative two use use cosine uh there's there's no problem we're not dealing with the inverse functions right now we can easily do that cosine is a bit easier to deal with because it directly matches to most unit circles that we have you can use a table too that's fine typically what i'm going to encourage is yeah just just go ahead and use cosine for this so if secant of 3 theta 2 equals negative 2 then cosine of 3 theta over 2 equals the reciprocal of negative two or negative one half now we're set now we're going to call this alpha we're going to solve this just like we normally did so cosine alpha just letting alpha equal that that weird angle in there equals negative one half this asks since cosine is related to the x-coordinate what angle gives me an x-coordinate of negative one half we've done this a couple times already that's going to be let's see two pi over three and four pi over three what the hell would you do with three theta over two evaluate is that more than one or is that less than one in front of that theta so three over two well that's that's one and a half so if you're really smart about it you add one cycle to this but you don't do that now that's confusing what in the world why why not that's the bigger one the next one is going to be outside of 0 2 pi if that's too confusing add it to both of them but understand that you're probably going to get something outside of 0 2 pi so that's not yet 2 it's not shortening enough for 2 cycles to fit into 0 to 2 pi this one's going to that one's not going to i'm gonna show you that right now so anything more than one at a cycle if it's more than two add more than that two and two cycles if it's more than three at three cycles so i'm gonna add 2 pi and 2 pi that's another cycle around that unit circle so 2 pi over 3 and 4 pi over 3 that's fine that's what this angle would be for cosine theta equals negative one-half i'm saying that's more than one i'm going to add one cycle i really don't need to do that one but i'm adding it again anyway so our alpha is going to be 2 pi over 3 let's see 2 pi over 3 plus 2 pi that's 6 pi over three the same thing as two pi that would be eight pi over three and four pi over three that would be ten pi over three if i add that two pi that's that's like six pi over three plus four pi over three is ten pi well not over six ten pi over three now some of those are obviously more than 0 2 pi but we haven't substituted back yet so we're going to say hey because alpha is 3 theta over 2 these are all equal to 3 theta over 2. so i did switch these so but notice something we're going to solve this for theta we're going to multiply everything by 2 divide everything by 3. this one and this one and this first one are all still going to be in 0 2 pi that one's not that's going to be just outside of it and so we're going to cross it off because it's not going to fit the interval for what we're defining our theta as and that's what i was saying for numbers that aren't integers well whole numbers uh like two or three it's like one and a half between one and between one and two well then you have to add one cycle but it's typically just to the smaller of those two solutions that usually works if it's there is obviously some breakover so if it's just barely less than two well then you're probably gonna add it to both so a fail safe is if it's more than one add one cycle if it's more than two add two cycles and that will that will keep it very nice just be careful check your work and cross out anything that's outside of the inner interval for which you're trying to find solutions so here we're going to multiply everything by two and divide everything by three so four pi over nine eight pi over nine sixteen pi over nine twenty pi over nine that's less than two pi that's less than two pi that's just less than two pi that's not that is let's see nine goes into twenty two times with remainder two that is more than two pi and this is what i was talking about this is what we want to cross out i hope that makes sense i hope it's you're seeing that i need to add cycles um like i was saying for stuff like one and a half edges just the first one but if if you're very if it's a weird number and you're not sure just add a cycle to both understanding that you might have to cross them out later just check your work just make sure that all of these are within the interval you're trying to find solutions for let's go ahead and do one more so square root three cotangent theta equals one or plus one equals zero solve it for your trig function isolate that first and then start doing your reciprocals if you have one of these functions you don't really wanna work with all that much so cotangent theta equals negative one over square root of three i'm just isolating that trig function now before you rationalize reciprocate for tangent we don't want to rationalize and reciprocate and then have to rationalize again that'd be kind of silly and so if cotangent theta equals negative 1 over square root 3 then tangent theta equals negative square root of 3. this is kind of nice we don't have any odd angle in there nothing that we have to alter the period for so we're just going to look on our unit circle and say tangent theta equals negative square root of 3. so what angle gives me a y over an x that yields negative square root of three it's got to be oh man i hope you see it it's got it in quadrants two or four tangent is negative in two and four not one and three so in two and four we'd say i want the square root on the numerator i want a one-half of the denominator that's got to be positive square root of three over negative over sorry positive square root of three over two over negative one-half two pi over three or negative square root of three over two divided by one half five pi over three so two pi over three or five pi over three there's no manipulating our angle here these are all the solutions between 0 and 2 pi because we found it we literally looked at the unit circle and found all of them so i hope this making sense to you uh we're going to come back to a few more we'll eventually start getting into something that we have to use identities for all right two really quick ones uh we're going to do this one solo for sine really really quick and then we're going to take a look at what what the world you do with 3 theta plus pi over 18. it's going to end up being the same thing but just be careful on some of your some of the times you run into issues with uh adding too many cycles or too few because of what you're what you're adding there so you have to massage that a little bit so whenever we're solving something no matter what it looks like like awkwardly this is why i'm giving this problem is if there's only one trig function you can isolate it if there's not try to combine it and if you can't then you need another technique so no matter how ugly that looks if there's one trig function isolate that trig function so we're going to subtract 3 square root 3. that'll be negative 2 square root 3. if we divide by 4 we're going to get negative square root 3 over 2. this is kind of nice this says what angle gives me a y coordinate remember sine is y what angle gives you y coordinate of negative square root of 3 over 2. y coordinates are 4 pi over 3. and five pi over three because we haven't altered that at all our angle at all those are all the solutions on the interval for where we're looking for for our solution so that's it we're done one trick one trigonometric expression solve it correctly isolate that trig function now what about some of those angles that look really really weird try the same thing so i was saying just a minute ago that sometimes we run into some issues where we will miss a solution or or we'll get an extra solution with a certain interval if we add three cycles because of that plus pi over 18. most times doesn't happen but if it does then you can always try adding an additional cycle and seeing if that's going to give you another solution in zero to two pi so let's try that here so alpha equals just call that whole thing alpha man that looks a lot better so sine of alpha equals 1 says hey find me the angle that gives me a y coordinate of 1. that's going to be pi over 2. and that's it there's only one solution on 0 two pi that has that particular y coordinate of one so alpha equals pi over two now because that is a three we want three total cycles if that had been a four we'd want four total cycles this is one one solution on that first cycle we need another solution on another and then another cycle so two additional cycles we're going to add 2 pi for that then we're going to add 2 pi again or add 4 pi to our original solution so let's try that now all right so we got pi over 2 if we add 2 pi that's 4 pi so 5 pi over 2 if i add 2 pi again or add 4 pi to pi over 2 either way you want to go it doesn't really matter so 2 pi to this is that one 4 pi to this or 2 pi to that so it'd be an additional 4 pi over 2 that's 9 pi over 2. now that's way outside 0 2 pi but remember we're about to subtract pi over 18 and then multiply it by three so since we solve for alpha we know what alpha is and now we're going to remember order operations we're going to subtract pi over 18 before we divide by 3. so when we subtract pi over 18 so pi over 2 that's that's like 9 pi over 18 so 9 pi over t minus 1 pi over 18 is 8 pi over 18. 5 pi over 2 would be like 45 pi over 18. uh that's 44 pi over 18 if i subtract 1 pi over 18. 81 pi over 18 for nine pi over two so nine pi over two is like 81 pi over 18 minus 1 pi over 18 is 80 pi over 18. now of course all of these are going to simplify so we can do that now we can do it later it doesn't it kind of matters it's a little bit nicer to multiply by the denominator by three once you've simplified so i'm going to do that now and divide everything by two and lastly we're going to divide by 3. so multiply our denominators by 3 that's going to be all over denominator of 27. so 4 pi over 27 27 pi over 27 40 pi over 27 and that's it now one thing can happen i was just talking about this a little while ago is that if you have a large enough angle that's subtracting you could fit another because that's a phase shift right what that is a shift of sign to the left it's to the left uh pi over [Music] 54. so it's it's really it's a really small shift but this is shortening and shifting and so what's going to happen here is you might fit another solution in zero to two pi if that's the case what you would want to do is add an additional cycle to that if that's a large enough shift you might get that you might actually have a negative here too if you shift far enough so just be careful on that one typically this works just fine remember that number is how many cycles you want in general adding a phase shift to it or subtracting any phase shift can alter that just a bit just just mind that just be very careful that you can be outside of zero two pi you might have to add an additional cycle that's that's really all there is about it that's about as hard as i can make an angle uh there for you i hope that that is making sense to you i couldn't resist i had to do it so i added another cycle just to show you that this is pretty close but it's it's it's too much so if we add one more cycle we have 13 pi over 2 if i subtract pi over 18 i get 1 16 pi over 18 and then if i divide both by 258 pi over 9 and then divide everything by 3 we get 58 pi over 27. 27 goes into 58 two times and then sum but just a little bit had i subtracted a bit more than that then i would have been able to fit another cycle in there so i hope you're seeing that so if this is large enough and you're not sure you know i don't know then add an additional cycle so just hey here's one two three you go well i don't know about that one add another one it doesn't really hurt all that bad it just means that you'll get an extra solution there and it doesn't fit inside the interval that you're looking at and that's really all there is to it these two are tricky and i throw them in here because a lot of students mess these up a lot of students really have a problem understand why there's two solutions when cosine inverse only gives you one solution and sine inverse only gives you one solution so if you need to find all the solutions on that interval 0 to 2 pi cosine inverse and sine inverse will not do it completely they'll give you half they'll give you the one-to-one solution it'll give you the solution for cosine from zero to pi for sine it'll give you the negative pi over 2 of pi over 2 it'll give you that remember what inverses do inverse functions are one-to-one functions they will give you one solution here so if you need to find both there's a way around that so i'm going to show you how to find both solutions to cosine theta equals 0.6 even though 0.6 is not on a circle how to actually do that so let's start off with the thought that cosine beta equals 0.6 i would look for a unit circle solution it's not on there for 0.6 so how do we solve for theta if we're not underneath a circle well we'd use cosine inverse so cosine theta equals 0.6 if theta equals cosine inverse of 0.6 or cosine inverse of 0.6 equals theta that's the same thing now your calculator will give this to you but you must remember that inverse functions only give you one solution out they have to so cosine inverse of 0.6 is going to give you around .927 and you go great i'm done not really what this means what this is is this says oh man i hope you remember it it says what is the angle that gives me an x coordinate cosine is always an x coordinate so cosine of what angle gives me an x coordinate what angle gives me x coordinate of 0.6 where is 0.6 where is an x coordinate of 0.6 if that's 1 0.6 is about right there on a unit circle that is the angle they're giving you why is it that angle well because cosine inverse man i hope you're making this making sense this is the biggest thing here is cosine inverse only works from zero to pi that's it it's just going to give you that one angle this is an x value or x coordinate of 0.6 about that's the angle they're giving you what .927 radians this is 0.927 radians that's exactly what that is it's uh it's less than one radian it's less than pi over two radians it's 0.927 radians roughly but look at this there's another point on the unit circle that would have that x value that x coordinate of 0.6 this would be 0.6 comma some y and this would be 0.6 comma some y therefore there's another angle there now how do we find it these angles will have symmetry so this right here would also be theta however we can't have a negative angle on zero to two pi can we because that's 0 is the smallest value i don't want a negative angle that's outside my interval so here's what to do with that if this angle's theta and this angle has symmetry it's also theta take 2 pi minus your angle so imagine you go all the way around and go oh i went too far back up how much would you back up you back up theta so cosine inverse will give you a solution an angle out on the interval that it's defined for for cosine inverse that's 0 to pi so it's going to give you that angle no problem use your calculator you're good to go but then draw a picture of it because cosine is talking about the x coordinate x coordinate will be the same here and here remember it's on the it's the x value here and here so we go here great calculator okay imagine we go all the way around and we've gone too far back it up that symmetrical angle this would be found by two pi minus whatever that angle is well what's that angle you found it 0.927 is the number of radians wait a minute 2 pi is in radians so 2 pi minus 0.927 is going to give you another angle specifically it's going to give you this angle that goes all the way from here to here that's the other angle that we would have it's about 5.36 now 5.36 radians notice that that's just under 2 pi radians 2 pi radians like 6.28 or so radians so that's below that that's exactly this angle less than that so i hope that makes sense it's a little weird i know that it's weird just remember what inverse functions do they're only going to give you one solution and only on the part where it's divided so for cosine inverse that's zero to pi we need to understand that cosine deals with the x coordinate there's always going to be two x coordinates on the unit circle that are the same that's positive quadrant one and negative quadrant quadrant four uh uh me is better we say is above and below the x-axis in quad one and quadrant four and then we say all right let's just subtract that symmetrical angle to find it something very similar happens with sine theta equals zero point four um so when we're thinking sine theta equals zero point four we try to get in a circle and point four is not on there so what angle gives me a y coordinate or point four i have no idea i i don't know but i do know that we can do an inverse so if it's not a new circle use sine inverse now what in the world does that mean well if we're thinking about this a y coordinate of 0.4 a y-coordinate of 0.4 would have to intersect this horizontal line at point four that again is going to give me two angles but check it out sine inverse will only give me oh man i hope you remember sine inverse only gives me answers from negative pi over two to pi over two so it will give me this angle this is from negative pi over two to pi over 2 it'll give me the one solution that's on that interval that has a y coordinate of 0.4 it'll give me that particular angle i hope that makes sense to you sine inverse says the angle that gives me this y coordinate on this particular interval so right there is theta and this would give you this it'll give you this angle of about 0.41 radians so this angle is about .4 0.41 radians but we're smarter than that we understand that hey a y-coordinate will happen twice on a circle if we're not on a quadrant angle so y-coordinate would have been 0.4 here it also happened 0.4 here this would have a y coordinate 0.4 that same height only how do we find that angle well the same a very similar way is this this will have symmetry on that angle so this is also theta so how in the world would we make it to this particular angle going from an initial side to that terminal side that's the angle that we want well imagine going a little too far you go oh i'm going to go all the way to pi oh i went too far what would you do if you went too far you'd subtract some how much would you want to subtract theta so if we said this is not as far as pi it's just theta less than that we went too far go back a little bit so we have one angle of 0.41 radians and another angle of pi minus about 0.41 radians that's approximately 2.73 radians here what's 2.73 radians remember what pi is pi is 3.14 this would be 3.1 approximately 3.14 radians we're not quite there yet or 0.41 radians less than that 2.73 so that's a it's a little weird just remember what sine and cosine do cosine is x coordinate you probably have two of them this way subtract two pi minus that angle sine is y coordinate you have two of them this way take pi minus the angle for the ones that are not on the interval for which sine inverse and cosine inverse are defined for tangent all you really have to do is add pi so that's the period of tangent is pi so if you run into that you're like okay i have one solution where's the other one just add pi to it it's usually pretty good to go so we're going to come back and start using some identities to solve some of these equations it's kind of fun some substitutions and things where you can't isolate the trig function exactly so we're going to deal with a few problems that you can't isolate the a trig function because there's more than one of them or the same one that's raised to a power you just can't isolate it directly if that's the case you need another technique so here's the things to look for number one thing you look for is can you factor it if you can factor it if you can use a substitution or logic factor if it's already factored that's great we can use the zero product property if not we're probably going to have to have an identity so the number one thing you try to do is isolate your trig function or combine terms to isolate it let's check that can you combine those no because one's got a power two and one doesn't that'd be like x squared plus x you go i can't add that you can't add those trig functions either but what you can do you can do a substitution now some of you who are very good at factoring you can factor just like that it's not even a problem but if you're struggling with this a little bit remember that every time you have a power one here and a power 2 there you can make a substitution of the inside thing the inside thing here is cosine remember that this means cosine theta squared so if we let let's say u equal cosine theta that lets us do this substitution so if u equals cosine theta all we're looking for for a substitution is this thing and this thing to be the same where this is 2 times that thing that's all we really need so let's go ahead and let's make that then cosine squared theta would be u squared because cosine theta is now u we'd get cosine theta squared well no we called cosine theta u so u squared plus u equals 1. now when we're factoring we want to get everything on one side we want to get in order first term positive and now that we have u instead of cosine theta it's nice to do that so we'll subtract one this is something that's really nice to factor so we can do this there's a lot of different ways i've seen people factor any way that works is fine with me i don't really care this is going to be let's see if i do it my way i always like to put my middle term here first and last term multiply that's negative two add to the top multiply to the bottom and then take your a and divide and simplify and this will give you your factors this is one u remember this is not x or anything one u plus one two u minus one and we could continue to solve this is what is beautiful about factoring is that it creates a zero product property something's very nice for us so we know zero product property says if you get a couple factors or several factors and they're equal to zero every one of them equaling zero has the opportunities to to be a solution so u equals negative 1 and u equals one-half are you done no you are not this is just in u you don't want u you want you want a cosine theta so because cosine theta is u then cosine theta equals negative one and cosine beta equals one-half we don't have any awkward angles we don't have to manipulate that but if you did at this time is when you'd say if that was like two theta call that alpha then solve for alpha and then you divide by two you give my you get extra cycles in there we don't have to do that this by solving with your unit circle is going to give you all solutions on 0 2 pi so cosine theta equals negative 1 says on what angle is my x coordinate negative 1 that's pi cosine theta equals positive one half says i'm on what angle are my x coordinates uh is my exponent one half well there's two of them it's going to be pi over three all the way around five pi over three those are the two angles where you have an x coordinate of positive one one-half these are all the solutions of that equation on that particular interval and that's really all there is to it so so number one is try to isolate your trig function combine some like terms if you can if you can't look for factoring if you don't you can't actually factor this by subtracting one then going right down to here well you'd have cosine squared and cosine squared you have cosine and cosine here if that's too difficult that's it's okay if it is do a substitution just call the inside part u factor it and then put it back we've done a lot of substitutions in many many videos this is just another one that we can now utilize so get everything on one side factoring then putting back your substitution just remember that if your angle is different you have to manipulate that a little bit just add your cycles if you have to now next one tangent theta minus one secant theta minus one multiplied together equals zero do not distribute this i'm making it please don't distribute that if you have two factors which you do multiplied together which they are equal to zero you win this is fantastic because you can set each of those equal to zero by the zero product property the exact same thing that we did right here don't substitute definitely don't distribute this is easier than that so tan theta minus 1 equals 0 by the zero product property and secant theta minus 1 equals 0 again by the same property and these oh wow now that we've done that these are some basic trig functions you can actually isolate that trig function just like here where factoring lets you isolate the variable easily using zero product property lets you isolate the trig function easily so adding one in both cases where tangent theta equals one asks on what angle is your y over x giving you positive one that's pi over four and that's five pi over four so here pi over four and there five pi over four you can use a table for secant theta so secant theta equals 1 that's fine i will use a reciprocal and say secant theta the reciprocal of that is cosine theta so cosine theta would equal the reciprocal of one that would also be one uh well where is the x-coordinate one that would be on zero so an angle of zero gives you an x-coordinate of one right there there's a little blurb i said that i made a mistake at the very beginning of the video that i accidentally had an equals there notice how i don't want that because 0 and 2 pi would give me an x coordinate of 1. i can i only really want one of those to be on that interval so i'm gonna choose the zero and not the two pi that's why we don't want it equals one then so cosine is zero equals one that's fantastic so i have three solutions pi over four five pi over four and zero hope that's making sense to you factoring is really nice don't distribute if you already have the zero product property all right we're going to do three examples right now that illustrate the important use of identities now in trigonometry when students hear identities go oh my gosh they're horrible they can be they really can they're tough i'm not going to sit here and lie to you and say oh they're a piece of cake if you understand them they're extremely useful and when you get to calculus like calculus 2 especially we use a ton of identities the better you are now the easier that class is going to be i promise also some of the substitutions have already shown you and i will show you later trigonometric substitutions are a big deal for calc 2 you're going to get something called an integral and you're going to have them by trig sub integrals by trig7 a lot of students hate them i'll teach them to you very very well in calculus 2 but it's a lot of your trigonometry things that you do in calculus stem from identities and so i'm going to start illustrating how you use those so next few videos we're dealing with identities just purely identities for a long time it's a huge video but right now we're going to start because we really only know a couple of them we know some even and odd identities we know the pythagorean identity we're going to use that right now we use even and on in the next example and then tangent equals sine over cosine and the one after that so sorry spoiler alert has revealed the whole thing that's what we're going to do but it's important for you to know where we're going so here's how we start with identities number one we try well and this is using identities not exactly proving an identic uh identical relationship we're using them to solve an equation but number one look at the hard side what side looks harder well that that side looks harder start start with that side try to make one fraction if there's fractions try to write everything as sine and cosine if it's not it is there's no fractions try to identify some identities that work with what you have up there so i have sine squared i have cosine squared theta what do i know about sine squared well there's only one identity that i that i know of the last one is this last one is if you have all of one type of trig function see if you can make it into that type of trig functions or the majority is like sine make everything in the sign if the majority is cosine make everything cosine if you have cosine squared plus sine squared that's one and that's fantastic we're not there yet but we do have this sine squared i see a cosine i see a cosine squared see a sine squared this is kind of the odd guy out i want to change this guy see that's a cosine squared and a cosine those work well together that's fine we can maybe factor that but this does not and so what we're going to do right now is we're going to we're going to look at that and think what identity do i know that deals with sine squared theta well there's really only one that we have right now and this would be the pythagorean identity we did have many videos ago but this this is one of them so i'm going to solve for what i want to get rid of that's how identities can be used so i want to get rid of sine squared or at least change it and so i'm going to solve this identity which i know is true for sine squared let's subtract cosine squared theta from both sides so if this is true which is then this is also true which it is which means you can substitute it so i'm going to do that right now i'm going to say hey sine squared theta is 1 minus cosine squared theta so i'm going to change this piece down to that so sine squared theta now changes to whatever this is based on the pythagorean identity that we use to do it so this is now 1 minus cosine squared theta i had already a minus cosine squared theta now it might seem like how in the world did you know how to choose that one experience and it will get better for you as you go you'll start seeing some patterns you'll start seeing oh right okay i have a cosine squared and a cosine it looks like i'm probably going to factor that in order to factor stuff i need to make sure we all have the same type of term so i want to change the one that's not cosine uh how do i do that look for something that has a sine squared so i pull out my identity sheet ah well pythagorean identities that does it that would change that into a cosine squared something or other hey that would match the other cosine squared and cosine that i have so so let's do that and that's sort of the thought process i go through that's what i'm modeling right now so i modeled that that thinking for you on how you you'd make it down there now with that in mind now we start trying to combine whatever we can so if i combine my negative cosine squared theta minus cosine squared theta that's minus two cosine squared theta i can also subtract one from both sides and those ones are gone one track that students fall into is they try to divide um do not divide by things that can equal zero so cosine theta can equal zero right if we divide then we're actually breaking a domain rule we can divide by things to equal zero it's going to eliminate some solutions it's not good math and we're breaking some rules so instead of dividing right here we're going to try factoring so let's add 2 cosine squared theta on both sides just to keep everything positive so cosine beta plus 2 cosine squared theta this is where we can factor so the whole idea was hey this looks like factoring to me so i see a cosine squared and cosine i'm going to try to factor that this would not be great for us so i'm going to try to change that into this thing use the pythagorean identity okay solve the thing i want to replace i got it let's replace it no problem this combines in my terms all right hey my ones cancel cool oh i see some factoring now now we can factor out cosine theta and now it's magic because we have a zero product property we have two factors that are multiplied together equals zero we're going to set both of them equal to zero so cosine theta equals zero and one plus two cosine of theta equals zero we're going to solve both for zero that's done that we're going to subtract one and divide by two and now we use our unit circle there's no funny angles going on we don't have to add a cycle or anything cosine theta equals zero when that when that angle is pi over two uh it also at negative pi over two or three pi over 2. so why not negative pi over 2 because you're trying to keep in mind with that so from 0 to 2 pi so our x coordinate is zero here and there pi over two three pi over two our x coordinate is negative one half at two pi over three and four pi over three and that's it we're completely done provided that we don't have any fractions where these solutions make zero on our denominator you're going to watch for that we're done these four solutions are within our our domain of zero to two pi this is all the four solutions that satisfy that equation i hope this makes sense to you i know that this can be tough the first time you see it you look at it you go oh don't worry you're going to get it you're all very smart if you've made it this far you're doing great so don't worry about it right now this is an introduction into how to use identities okay so just bear with me i'm trying to get your brains wrapped around this concept you will get it and i'll we're gonna crush some identities in my next video but for right now this idea of oh i can change what's here into something else by using identities is extremely powerful so i'm going to show you two more examples on how that works in the next video we're going to talk about some pretty major identities let's talk about this one it looks fairly straightforward but there's there's some interesting things that happen here and so we're going to take a look at it so cosine theta equals negative sine of negative theta now when we're taking a look at solving these things of course we're going to try to isolate our trig function and we have we have two of them so we can't really do that there's no factoring right now it's not apparent it's not really cool that way so we're gonna have to use some identities so if you can't isolate your trig function if you can't straight up factor it or use a substitution you're going to use something to change what's there use identities the only way you can do it is by using identities to change what's there now how do we do that most of the time we start on a more difficult side that's more difficult than this so let's take a look at that negative sine of negative theta can we make it easier that's the first thought to go in my head make it easier well every time we have a negative angle you can change it you see all of these functions are even or odd sine happens to be an odd function what that means is that opposite inputs give you opposite outputs so sine of negative theta is equal to negative sine of theta that was due to the oddness of sine cosine was even we could just basically drop that negative inside there really it's opposite inputs are equal outputs and so cosine of negative theta equals cosine or positive theta that'd be easy but this says you can change this part into negatives sine theta can you see how a lot of students probably make a sign error right there that negative is there sine of negative theta is negative sine theta so what's a negative negative opposite of negative is positive so we have cosine theta equals sine theta when does cosine theta equal sine theta now you could actually look at the unit circle and say pi over four where is the y coordinate equal to x coordinate x pi over 4 5 pi over 4 you could do that but there is a different way to go about it if we go ahead and divide both sides by cosine one idea is if you have sines and cosines sometimes you want to get away from tangent and sometimes you want to get two tangent i'm going to show you an idea right here that if we divide both sides by cosine we can get tangent theta on the right hand side that's another identity for us so dividing both sides cosine theta divided by cosine of eight is one provided that we don't allow that cosine theta to be zero that's the only issue with this so that that issue is where is where's cosine theta zero that would be pi over two and three pi over 2. now fantastically the function that we're about to get if i would have written this right the function that we're about to get is undefined exactly where cosine is 0 why because it comes from that and that's fantastic so sine theta over cosine theta now why in the world did we do that so i was looking at this thing and let's make this easier we did using the identity using the evenness there then i looked at this and said i could probably do this but it's easier if i make a function i'm used to so i'm going to divide both sides by cosine understanding that sine theta over cosine theta is tangent theta that's much easier for a lot of students to look at and say okay hey oh hey look at that i can use my table i use my unit circle tangent theta equals 1. so on what angle do i have y over x being equal do you understand that that's exactly the same thing i asked right here like where what angle is my y coordinate equal to my x that's exactly what this is asking you on what angle is my y over my x the same that would be pi over 4 and it would also be 5 pi over 4 because those both give you positive 1 square root 2 over 2 divided by square root 2 over 2 or negative square root 2 over 2 divided by negative square root 2 over 2. those are all the solutions on zero to pi over two zero to two pi that satisfy that equation so i hope that makes sense um i know that identities can be tough but i'm trying to kind of build that in your head that's possible to change stuff to make our lives a little bit easier so we'll come back with one more and then we're done all right last one so tangent e tangent beta equals two sine theta now when we take a look at solving these things isolates trig function we have two of them try to factor there's nothing to factor um make everything sines and cosines is a good i or make everything the same trig function if you can if you if you think you're going to factor so if i was to do that if i said here's my sign here's my tangent what one can we change easily for sine i don't really have an identity for that but for tangent theta i have an identity we just use it remember that tangent theta is sine theta over cosine theta this is another kind of kind of rule of thumb for identities is if you're getting stuck change everything into sines and cosines and see what you can do after that so i'm thinking this side i'm not doing much without sign there's no identity for just sine theta uh they're the sine squared yeah but i don't have that for tangent we do have an identity so i'm thinking i can't isolate i can't factor right now i have an identity for that one not that one let's change that one and inherently we're going to change it to sines and cosines so tangent theta is sine theta over cosine theta another idea is if you can factor it's nice to do so let's get everything on one side so i thought isolate no factor i can't use identity cool let's use identity on tangent i've done it now i have some signs here when we're solving equations we like to factor things so we get everything on one side that's great and now we're going to try to factor can we factor anything well sure we can we can factor out sine this has sine theta this has sine theta there's only two terms if we factor out sine beta we get one over cosine theta minus 2. and we can verify that by distributing this would give us sine theta cosine theta hence the tangent and minus 2 sine theta and this is beautiful this is why we like to factor because this now created a zero product property for us we have sine theta times this other term that equals zero let's set both of them equal to zero now you can change that one couldn't you you could change that to secant if you really wanted to this would be one over cosine theta oh that's secant theta that's the reciprocal function you could do it but you'll end up changing back to one over cosine or reciprocating that so at some point you'd have to change it back so i'm going to show you both kind of both ways here so sine theta equals zero no problem uh one over cosine theta minus two equals zero let's solve both of them for their trig functions so sine theta equals 0 is done that looks really good this one well we have to solve for cosine let's add 2. if one over cosine equals two then cosine equals one over two just reciprocate both sides now what if you had done a different way what if right here you said this is secant theta remember one over cosine theta is secant theta that's an identity for us what have you done that well then you would get secant theta minus 2 equals 0 by the zero product property then you would add 2. and then you'd say oh secant theta equals 2 if cosine theta equals 1 over 2 the reciprocal of that and that's exactly where we find ourselves whichever one of these looks easier to you do it it doesn't really matter you're doing the same thing so whether you want to solve it directly for cosine cool you're going to get what happens when you use an identity for secant theta and solve it and use a reciprocal of the cosine anyway now we're ready to use our unit circle we're almost done so sine theta equals 0 says give me the angle where the y coordinate is zero that's at zero and that's at pi y coordinate zero y equal to zero at zero and pi cosine theta equals one half says give me the angle where the x coordinate is one half that's here at pi over three that's here at five pi over three x coordinate with positive one half so there's four solutions that's all the solutions that's on that interval there was no interesting angles to work with no extra cycles to add i hope this has made sense i especially hope you're seeing the utility of of these identities they're extremely helpful i know they're challenging um remember that that like when you when you start learning this stuff it's going to be frustrating frustration's okay frustration is our brain trying to cope with new information and you're trying to make it fit that's fine you should expect that a little bit when you start getting angry at it like you break your book in half that's not okay um and you're gonna get that way but at some point i i know i do sometimes when i'm working on something just not making sense that's when it's it's time to take a break so take a break step back from the math um let yourself calm down uh what happens is when our brains get too wrapped up in that it's like when uh you're having a conversation with somebody and and you're you're arguing and then someone starts yelling and you go ah at that point no one's listening you're not really learning uh and that's what's happening here if you get mad at it so once that happens and it will happen it's okay take a break come back a little bit later so frustration is okay anger take a little break so i hope it's making sense to you i hope that that helps you in some way next video we're going to come back and it's going to be very long we're going to talk about how to use identities to prove relationships so i'll see you for that have a great day you
