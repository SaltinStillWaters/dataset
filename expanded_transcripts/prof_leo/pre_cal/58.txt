Transcript for: How to Expand Logarithms (Precalculus - College Algebra 59)
hey welcome to another video so in this lesson we're going to talk about how to use the properties of logarithms to expand logarithms now why would you want to do that well when we get to calculus 1 maybe calculus 2 depends on when you get derivatives of logarithms it really helps to be able to expand logarithms and to take a derivative after you've expanded them so when you get there you're like oh that makes sense for now sometimes we expand them we're solving equations we need to do that once in a while sometimes it puts them in a better format for us so a few reasons why we'd want to do it honestly in this video we're just practicing this so we're going to be using these properties to take logarithms that have multiplication division or exponents and expand them make honestly as many logarithms as possible using these to get these that's the idea separating multiplication into addition of two logarithms division into subtraction two logarithms of the same base and using that power property to move that exponent as a coefficient in the next video we'll go backwards we'll take logins or added or subtracted or have a coefficient and change them into more condensed versions of the same thing they do mean the same thing we're just using properties to show them a little bit differently because it benefits us on certain occasions so let's get right to it here's the process what i would want you to go through whenever you have to expand a logarithm number one take a look at your logarithm make sure a couple things have happened firstly make sure everything's factored so if you have an expression like we see in a couple of this one where we can factor this we want to make sure that's done first because when we're expanding logarithms we want to fully expand it and anything that has a product needs to get expanded or a quotient needs to be expanded also because radicals really can be represented by exponents that are fractions we're going to write all of our radicals as exponents and finally we're going to show any sort of product there is we're going to explicitly show the little dot that certain things are being multiplied together so we know to expand them so let's take a look at what i mean in this example what we're going to do first we're going to take a look at this this is a logarithm oh the base should be e we know it's e we're going to take a look at first factoring so is everything factored we know that it is is it necessary to write this in x first and then factor out a negative you you can it's not super necessary for what we're doing some occasions would call for it so we're not going to do that so everything is considered factored the next thing we're going to do we're going to write that radical as a one-half power because that is a square root we're also going to explicitly show that there is a product here now here's the order in which you undo or expand these logarithms i can't say you always separate products first you always move your exponent to the front first i can't say that because it really depends here's how to know what to do first this is not in a textbook you just have to look at it and figure it out here it is what operation is connecting the entire argument of your logarithm what's holding it together at this moment is it an exponent is that exponent holding all this together or is it the product there's only two things going on there's a couple exponents and there's a product here so we factor okay it's factored we make sure our radical is written as an exponent if we have one we show products and or quotients everywhere we can and then we look and see what operation is connecting this thing right now what's holding all of this together is that product there's no quotient but that exponent is not applied to the entire argument neither is this one so it's got to be the product that's holding together separate that first so we look over here how do we separate products well we know that we can make two logarithms that are added together with the same base since our base is e we're going to write ln and we know that logarithms are added together when we expand our multiplication or product within our unit of our logarithm and then we do the same exact thing we take a look at this now these should be factored of course and all of our radicals are still written as exponents that's only it's only done one time then we're good for the rest of our expansion here but then we consider what is holding this together what is holding that argument together is anything i can't expand is there a product a quotient or an exponent it's only three that we really look for well there's an exponent and that is on top of all of this argument if you will or applied to the entire argument that's something we can expand so we look down at our power property we understand that any sort of an exponent can be written as a coefficient so we're going to move that two likewise this argument or this factor i suppose has a one-half power applied to all of it so we can move that that's an exponent we can move it as a coefficient and we're done expanding now you might ask what about that one can't you expand that no you can't the only things in logarithms you can actually expand into additional logarithms or moving exponents to the front is with these three properties there's no way to expand subtraction or by addition so if we see a minus or plus you're done do we have to put parentheses here yes absolutely we need to show that that that logarithm has a one minus x as its argument we can't we can't miss that because otherwise it's very confusing if we did ln of one minus x that would be zero times one half minus x we want to make sure that we understand that's the that's the thing that's inside that logarithm so this is as much as we can do we've looked at it we've made sure it's factored our radicals our exponents we then look at what is connecting the entire argument we separate that one piece and then we continue to look inside each argument say what's connecting this one okay an exponent what's connecting this one okay an exponent's on top of all that then we start undoing as much as we can when we get down to the point where we have individual factors individual term factors or factors that have more than one term in them you're done that's as far as we can go let's take a look at the next example so the first thing we're understanding is that this is a logarithm it's got a base of five and wow there's a lot going on in here number one thing in your head is when you see expansion of logarithms i need you to factor stuff so this is factored x squared plus one you can't go anymore that's an irreducible quadratic you've seen it many times but x squared minus 1 is certainly factorable and we need to factor that right right away the other thing we're going to do is every single time we see a radical we're going to write that as an exponent that allows us to notice in our power property usually at the end here that we can move that as a coefficient so we've looked you said yep factor x minus 1 x plus 1 we know that that was written a power one half but it's x squared plus one that entire thing is inside that radical there's an inside parenthesis and then it has that exponent to it now what we do is the most important part we look and see how this argument is connected so what is joining this together is it an exponent or is it multiplication and division so we're going to show as much as we can we know that this is division that's pretty good we know that that because it's already shown we know that that's multiplication and we know that that exponent is connecting just to this numerator so the thing that's joining this is multiplication and division the overarching operators here are multiplication division we're going to undo those first notice how the exponent is not applied to everything if it was that would be the first thing we're doing but it's not here it's just being applied to the numerator multiplication division is connecting the rest of the stuff so we're going to explain that first now listen real carefully you can do all of this at once if you follow a very simple principle things or factors on the numerator are positive or added logarithms and things on the denominator are subtracted logarithms those factors on the denominator create subtracted logarithms that's really important because what happens is sometimes when we try to do this in multiple steps it gets way way confusing and we start making sign errors so i've seen it from time to time where where teachers or textbooks will say okay now first thing you do is take this subtract the logarithm of both those terms well because those terms are multiplied you would show addition and then you'd have to distribute a negative through that's much more confusing than what i'm about to show you here so what i'm going to show you is look at all your factors that are connected by multiplication and division the factors on the numerator are going to get positive logarithms to start and add it for every factor that's on the numerator on the denominator we're going to subtract logarithms that contain each of those factors so what that looks like here is we're going to start with our numerator factors we're going to go okay well we're going to have a log base 5 and we're going to take the first numerator factor that we see well there's only one of them there's x squared plus one it's an irreducible quadratic ratio to the one third power so that's a positive logarithm that's great now since we've exhausted all of the factors on our numerator we're going to look at the factors on the denominator but we're going to understand something very very important every one of those factors that's on the denominator is going to create a subtraction of the logarithm it's going to do this for every factor that's down here so if we want to extend this a little bit let's say that this also had maybe a k we would have log base a of m minus log base a of n minus log base a of k you subtract a logarithm for every one of those factors and the reason that that would happen is because if you did it a different way i'm going to kind of show this down here if you showed it this way and you did log base a of m minus log base a of n times k well you could separate that by addition but that would be inside this big bracket and that minus would eventually distribute i hope you see that i'm going to show that here in just a moment but that's true so let's continue now that we have these bro all factored up and we know what our numerator denominator factors are all our numerator is positive now we're going to subtract for each factor so log base 5 of x minus 1 that's one factor on the denominator minus log base 5 of x plus 1. we are almost done the last thing we've got to do is reevaluate all of our logarithms and see if we can expand them further so log base 5 x plus 1 you cannot expand addition minus 1 you cannot expand subtraction there's no exponent holding any of those arguments together this exponent does need to move to a as a coefficient when we're expanding so we want to undo as much as possible using these properties so we're going to take that write this as 1 3 and then a log base 5 of x squared plus 1. we need parentheses and we need parentheses on every one of those arguments that's as expanded as we can get now i did say that i would show you it a slightly different way as i mentioned this if you want to understand a little bit more about why we're subtracting a logarithm with each of these factors on the denominator and and you didn't quite follow what i said i can show you right here explicitly what would happen is that if you were to subtract numerator minus log containing denominator looks like that and if we further understand that well because that's a product we can expand that as well via two logarithms being added now this is obviously different from this that's a problem and here's why it's a problem when you subtract this logarithm well you're subtracting everything that that becomes as well so really what we would have is this bracket around that and by subtracting each one of those terms you end up getting this exact thing this is why i teach it the way that i do just look at the factors on the denominator and subtract logarithms containing each of them because that that puts all of this in summary and lets you kind of make a shortcut instead of having to show a bracket and then a distribution when in fact you can get the same thing by understanding what's really happening you're just subtracting logarithms that contain the factors on the denominator and you're adding logarithms that contain the factors on your numerator that's really all there is to it we're going to come back we're going to do that one i'll show you something quite similar all right let's go ahead and do one more so we're taking a look at this we know we want to factor everything it is factored we have x plus one x minus two quantity squared x minus one nothing can be additionally factored but we are going to do is write this radical as a one-half power and then we're going to show all the products and quotients that they're not already shown so we have a product here and here the quotient we can clearly see so then we look and this is the most important part just look at the operations that are connecting this argument because these exponents are just on these individual factors it's multiplication and division that's holding this together well we're going to separate that first every factor on the numerator is going to create positive logs or logs that are added together every factor in the denominator we're going to separate those by subtracted logarithms so log of x cubed plus log of x plus 1 to the one-half and then minus these factors inside these logarithms so log of x minus 2 to the second power and then minus log of x minus 1. so since that's all done in one step there's really only one more thing we need to do we re-evaluate each of these logarithms and look to see if they have anything else holding that argument together that can be expanded in these cases just a few exponents so x minus 1 is factored you cannot expend subtraction x minus two to the second power we can move that two this one half yeah we can't move that to the front as a coefficient and so can a three and so we moved to all of them we have that 3 as a coefficient the one half is a coefficient of 2 is a coefficient and that looks pretty good this is as far as we can go so this is what we would call fully expanded every product and every quotient has been expanded as addition and subtraction respectively and all of our exponents have been moved as coefficients i hope it's making sense to you i hope you're seeing it's not really that big of a deal um not really that hard as long as you're following these these properties that i've given to you again the main thing is write out factored versions of your expression once you've done that make sure that all radicals are written as exponents then look at what is connecting your argument usually it's products and quotients which we can expand all at one time factors on the numerator create positive logarithms or ones being added factors on the denominator create negative logarithms or ones being subtracted usually i deal with the numerator factors first and then the denominator factors after that we move our exponents as coefficients and then we're done all right let's go through two more examples quite quickly so the first one we're taking a look at that is a natural logarithm so it is a log we're going to firstly make sure everything's factored it looks like it's factored just fine we're going to change every one of those radicals which is only one of them into a 1 3 power in this case and then show our products between there the reason why we're doing this example is we can't forget that 4 and 5 are actually factors and they do need to be expanded even though they're constant factors they do need to be shown as ln of 5 and ln of 4 somewhere so we're going to show that so we've got 5 times x squared times seven minus two x and that's being raised to the one third power all over i'm gonna show this explicitly four times x plus one squared so what that lets me do that says that we've got really one two three four five different factors some of them have exponents but they're all connected by multiplication and or division so i've shown that i've shown that it's all factored i've moved this as a radical into a rational exponent i've shown my multiplication so we're going to do is understand that because this argument is connected by multiplication division i'm going to choose to expand that first i really don't want to be dealing with those exponents because they're not applied to all the factors that has to come later with individual logarithms that are being added or subtracted in this case so every factor that's on the numerator all one two three of them i'm gonna write that as a positive ln five and then plus ln for every one of those factors so ln 5 and then plus ln x squared and then plus ln of 7 minus 2x to the one third well that was all divided by two factors here four and x plus one squared so for every factors on the denominator i'm going to subtract a logarithm containing that factor so all numerator 1 2 3 became logarithms which each with each of those factors inside and then added or positive and each of the factors on the denominator created logarithms with those particular factors but being subtracted and now we're going to take a look at it see if anything else is connecting each of these logarithms this is fully expanded you can't do anything more with that but this has an exponent we can move that to the front of this coefficient so does this one and so is that one this you can't expand we're done that's as much as we can expand out of this logarithm that's a lot of them that's what five different logarithms there's no more exponents that's really nice because that means that things that we do with this are a little bit easier when you don't have to deal with a cube root instead that's just a one-third as a coefficient that's nicer to deal with in a lot of cases also don't expand pluses please don't do that or minuses you can't do that we've done as much as possible to expand this particular logarithm and that's it also the order of our factors doesn't really matter as long as the signs go with the appropriate factors from where they came from so denominator factors need to have negative logarithms uh numerator factors you need to have positive logarithms and that's that's what we need to just understand out of taking this and expand it as fully as possible i hope that i'm making sense to you i hope that you're understanding that the idea is just following those rules that we've shown and looking at what is connecting the argument in your logarithm expanding that first all right last one for now well this is a little bit different in that because we've got that two-thirds power that's on the entire argument that logarithm base 10 logarithm and it's not factored so when we approach these things and we need to expand this for whatever reason you're asked to number one thing to do factor everything first thank you that is true all the time for these logarithms we're trying to expand them so don't do anything without ex without factoring first so we're going to do that we're going to factor x squared minus 9. we're going to check that x minus 4 is factored and it is we don't have any radicals explicitly written but i do want you to notice something do you notice that a two-thirds power is a radical i could have given this to you as a really big cube root of all this junk squared now that'd be pretty nasty to me to do that but i could have done that and then you would have written it as instead of a cube root as that two-thirds power so i've given it to you like this but that is possible now at this point you have an option before you do the option i do want to say something if possible you can simplify these so if this had been x minus 3 you could have simplified this before you it now we have a domain issue there but we have domain issues here anyway so that that would be something that is possible to do so check in the in your logarithms to see if you can you can simplify your factors that's possible legal and you should do it so here we can't simplify but we certainly could have checked that after you factor or later on when we're combining logarithms what you combine can be simplified some of the times so now that we've done that you have options here are your options number one option you can look at this as one expression that's raised to the two third power because this here's the key you gotta look at what's connecting the entire thing because this is over all of this argument you can move this to the front of your logarithm first and be fine that's true you can do that in fact i'm going to do that that's option 1. option 2 is because exponents distribute across multiplication and division you can apply that exponent to every one of those factors okay if you do that then multiplication and division would now be connecting your logarithm and you can separate by by addition subtraction and then move your exponents later either one works i can show you both so i'm going to do option one first let's move that as a coefficient now because we've moved the exponent that's no longer there the rest of this logarithm is connected by multiplication division which we're going to separate by addition and subtraction of respective logarithms depending on where they came from the numerator denominator so log of x minus 4 squared minus a log for each of these factors however i'm hoping you see it there's something missing here you see when we have that two-thirds in front of this logarithm and we expand the logarithm much like the minus in front of a logarithm that we're expanding it's going to distribute and so we show that because all of this junk came from that logarithm that two-thirds also goes to all that junk so we're going to do that but we're going to fully expand before we do that so that's done we can't factor you can't separate it that's done you can't factor you can't separate there's no exponent this you can't factor or separate it but you can move that exponent to the to the front of the coefficient and lastly we can distribute that two-thirds so two-thirds times two is four-thirds and everything else gets a minus two-thirds and a minus two-thirds that's what we call fully expanded so there's nothing else that we can possibly break up everything's been distributed there's no exponents there's no multiplication no division inside of any of those logarithms this is what we mean by expanding logarithms so i'm going to show you the different way here and say well what if you what if you want to distribute that through first would you get anything different no and some people prefer it so i wanted to give you both to give you options the main point is look at what is connecting the whole logarithm and deal with that first whether you have to distribute the exponent or move it to the front that's fine but you have to deal with that first so let's take a look at what if i were to distribute that well because exponents raised to exponents as multiplication you would get a log of x minus 4 to the four thirds over x minus three and x plus three both to the two thirds because one times two-thirds of both cases is two-thirds you might be able to see right now that we're going to get exactly the same thing you see now that we've distributed that everything's connected by multiplication and division we would show our multiplication whenever you have it and every one of the factors of the numerator is going to create a positive or added logarithm all the factors on the denominator create a subtracted or negative logarithm so we have positive and then subtract subtract for those factors on the denominator and then we're going to move our exponents so that's about it that's fully expanded just like what we thought we would get it doesn't matter which order you go again the idea is factor everything make sure your radicals are exponents and look at what is connecting your logarithm just deal with that first somehow whether it's an exponent you want to distribute or move to the front or multiplication division where we want to separate that into addition and subtraction respective logarithms i hope this makes sense to you very useful for a lot of things that we do in math i'm going to come back with another video on how to combine so basically going opposite what we've just done
