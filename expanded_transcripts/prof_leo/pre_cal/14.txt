Transcript for: How to Graph with Transformations (Precalculus - College Algebra 15)
now that we understand transformations and our basic graph shades it's time to practice them so I'm going to show you I had a letter way to approach graphing with transformations what we're gonna talk about is basic graph shape we'll talk about key points will talk about labeling all of our transformations and then using our shifting of our x and r y axis to create this sort of new XY axis put in our new key points how to modify those on the new XY axis and get a really good graph will talk about axis of symmetry if there is one we'll talk about how to use that and then we'll talk about how we had to make the graphs with a little bit better so let's get started let's take a look at f of x equals negative 1/2 absolute value of x minus 3 and then plus 2 one of the things that we need to do every time we're graphing the transformations identify what our basic graph shape is get a picture of what it looks like in our head identify our key points and then identify what transformations are happening so when we look at this absolute value in your head that's got to make a V now what we do it that V might reflect it yeah but the basic graph shape is a V then after that we go K that basic graph shape because it's a that's absolute value type of graph it is even in its most basic form and then we're going to talk about our key points so our key points are 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 positive 1 because that's based on an even shape and even graph shape so we've identified our V would have identified our basic graph shape and then we're gonna see what these transformations have done so number one we've got this plus two that plus two happens after the absolute value that plus two says your output is being affected so all this stuff is over with all the multiplication would happen before you add all that absolute value happen before you add that 2 so that plus 2 is affecting your output only so it says I'm gonna affect my output this is gonna be a shift up so we can put a whole lot vertical shift up two units then I look inside ok inside that I'm affecting my input that input of X is affected by subtracting 3 now we know that inside the function the horizontal shift the affecting the input is kind of opposite we want to think so minus 3 it does not move left 3 it moves right three now we look out front that OUTFRONT idea is also affecting the output not the input the only thing ever fix-it input is stuff that happens inside the function before you let the function take over so we looked and said that's an output that's a output that's plus two that's affecting the input that's minus three so up to but right three now we look out front say okay that's also affecting the output but in a little bit of a different way that's affecting the output value multiplicatively so it's affecting it by multiplying the output by one half and a negative now practically we treat those as one thing so we're going to multiply this output in just a minute by negative one half both of them together but but really technically that's two different transformations the one half takes your output value doesn't change your input that's already happened here takes your output value for the given input whatever you have and then it's going to cut them in half that's going to be a vertical compression vertical compressions go ahead and make our graph look whiter that's what's going to happen also we're multiplying our output by a negative so we've shifted up two we've shifted right three we've cut the output in half now we're going to take the output values and we're going to reflect them we're going to reflect them about the x-axis so it's going to take the output values and change their sign that's a reflection about the x-axis altering the values of our outputs those would be the four different transformations going on this graph so if you want to write them out we have up to a vertical shift up two we have a horizontal shift right three we have a vertical compression or shrinking our values we have a vertical reflection above the X practically though what we do with it if you look the shape of your graph is that that V and you know what your key points are then if we shift them up to we're going to move this axis we can we can kind of pretend or axis moves if we ship this up to we're gonna move our access up to units we're gonna move our other actions over twice over three units then we're going to take those outputs and say wait then they can one have effects or output values only the shifting affected our input values but the this they don't have affects your output values only our key points we take those key points we see what's happening here I'm finding an output I'm multiplying by negative 1/2 my input value won't change but one times negative 1/2 would give you a negative 1/2 do you see this do you see how by multiplying your output values by the negative and the 1/2 you're doing both a vertical compression shrinking the output and it's also reflecting it's changing its sign this you're gonna zero is never going to change by multiplying but negative one one becomes negative one still you never affect that input unless you started to multiply your input by something either the last example we do in this video but your 1 times negative 1/2 is also negative 1/2 so here's the way that I like to do it I like to do this in the same order we wrote them down so we're gonna shift our horizontal axis up to we're going to shift our vertical axis right three we're gonna get this new XY axis and then we're gonna graph our new key points how do we get our new key points we multiply it our outputs times whatever is there this said multiply your output of your function times this number we just did that here's our original key points and we did that so let's grab them so let's see up to and right three I showed you this in a previous video that when we would we move our X Y axis it's not this is not really there but it gives us a really good place for us to put our new key points so this is you're gonna ship your graph up to great let's let's show that you're gonna shoot your graph right three let's show that this is like our new origin not really there but if we graph our new key points on our new X Y axis is going to show us where our graph actually is please keep in mind our key points when they're graph from our quote-unquote new XY axis they're not the points of 1 comma negative 1/2 I understand that but it's where those points will be on your graph and then you can interpret that and say all right this would actually be the point 4 comma 1 and 1/2 that's fine and that's important but this gives you a very good way to do it so 1 comma negative 1/2 using the same scale that we had as our original XY axis our key points would be 1 comma negative 1/2 so from here this would be like our 1 comma negative 1/2 is about right there we still have 0 0 right there we'd still have negative 1 this would be like our negative 1 our new X Y axis comma negative 1/2 that's about right there so what we've done we've looked at we said this is a V I've got that in my head I know what my my transformations are so I know my key points where I know transformations are I've shifted up to I got that shifted right 3 I get that I am doing a vertical compression I multiplied my outputs by 1/2 I'm doing a reflection about the x I'm multiplying my outputs by a negative we did that one time now we grab those key points on our shifted axes and we recognize this is not a parabola it's not a square root this is a V it's just been reflected so draw the V and then if we want to make it a little bit better that's a sketch I want to make it a little bit better understand that we can do things like find the Y act y-intercept pretty if we plug in x equals zero so plug in x equals zero zero minus three is going to give me a negative 3 the absolute value of negative 3 is positive 3 positive 3 times negative 1/2 is negative 1 and 1/2 if I add 2 it's going to give me positive 1/2 so I found that value by taking 0 and plugging that into my function that's going to give you a better graph so my graph is a little off right now because I was curving a bit ok that's way off that gives you a better look for my graph the other thing I can do because this is an even function you have an axis of symmetry that runs right through where that that change from increasing and decreasing is on this graph that's why I like this technique so much of drawing your like new y-axis where that would shift to because it automatically gives you an axis symmetry it's really nice you don't get that if you don't do that well if at this level of 1/2 or how many units are like 1 2 3 and it's away from axis symmetry then 1 2 3 units away from the axis enter other side will also have this height of 1/2 so 1 2 3 1 2 3 we have a height of 1/2 as well that gives you the ability to graph much more accurately than just a sketch it gives you a really nice looking graph for minimal work you get the plug in a lot of points to get that graph as accurate as we just got it by using our shifting so one more time although a 3 you're looking at you're looking at what your basic graph shape is you're identifying your key points you're identifying your your transformations there's four of them here practically we kind of do three of them so we do a vertical shift if there's one we do a horizontal shift if there's one then we talk about an output affectation this number in front here that's multiplying your output we do this at the same time then we use our axes we shift them up down left right we have this new origin we plot our new key points after affecting them we plot our new key points on that that axis or on the Nuestra axis if we need to find like a y-intercept do it just plug in 0 to your original function no problem that is a point on your graph and then you can use your axis symmetry which you automatically show by using my technique to give it a kind of a three-point so anyway that's the way that this graph would look for sure it is the V it has been reflected it has been squashed it's made it a little bit let so vertical progressed has made a little bit wider and we have our vertical shift and horizontal shift correctly let's go ahead you should be trying that line on your own see if you can identify what the shape of that graph would look like is it a parabola what is it what's it look like is it a V see if you can write down two key points based on the fact that it's odd see if you can write down to four transformations that that has up-down left-right compress stretch reflect whatever that does and then see being graphic so I'm gonna start right now this isn't cubic so it's gonna look like originally like this power three curve that we're hopefully getting used to after we understand what that looks like is odd we know that our key points are going to be one one zero zero and negative one negative one that's how every one of our odd basic graph shapes that's the key points for every one of our basic graph shapes with the exception of the one over X function it doesn't have a zero zero but they all have one one negative one negative one why office tuplets give you all this sort of opposite inputs give you opposite outputs that's how it works now we'll go ahead and identify our our transformation so we have our key points down we've identified our function we're going to say all right well let's see this -1 happens after the function it's affecting the output it's saying I want you to add or subtract here subtract one from every output that's a shift down inside says I want to affect the input I want you to add one to every input before you put it through the power of three that means that in order to undo that that change of input I would have to give myself smaller values as a shift to the left one I'm looking out front this is two things this says I want you to squash the output values I want you multiply the 1/3 to cut them in 1/3 so cut them down that's shrinking that's a vertical compression this multiplies by the output of whatever your function said so I'm multiplying that's shrinking and cutting by a factor of 3 so shrinking it into 1/3 that's a vertical compression the negative says I'm taking your output again but not changing its sign so are you thinking through that are you seeing the shift down seeing this left one seeing them I'm thinking the output is squashing it for a compression there will be a horizontal stretch are you seeing that making the output change sign it's not in putting signs an output change signs can reflect about the x-axis reflect X now practically what we can do that down one takes our x-axis and shifts it down one unit is it really shifting down one you do know but we're graphically we can use that we're shifting our wives left one unit is it really shifting left no but we can use that as an axis of symmetry and so now that we've shifted down one unit and left one unit we're gonna take a look at our key points and understand what in the world is happening here our key points are being affected as far as their outputs not influenced there's nothing multiplying dirt input can't change but your output values to be multiplied by negative one third yeah it's going to shrink them and reflect them so our inputs don't change that's one but negative one third because one times negative one third is negative three zero zero I'm going to change all three times anything is zero negative one doesn't change but negative one times your new multiplying your output idea gives you positive 1/3 look what your outputs are doing it's shrunk it and change the sign it's shrunk it and change the sign in absolute value shrunk it and then change the sign so 1 comma negative one third but from our new XY axis right here so from that new sort of origin idea I'd go 1 and negative 1/3 so here's one and negative 1/3 is about right there then I have negative 1 comma positive 1/3 so from the same scale this would be one unit and that down 1 be like right here so 1/3 of that that gets a little more kind of here so 1 comma negative 1/3 and 1 comma positive 1/3 is about right up here that's really taken a cubic and squashed it it's also reflected so normally the cubic would look like this like coming through through those points but now I've reflected it and squash it so our cubic according to the reflection we had according to birth compression we had a quarter of ships that we have has a 0 a 0 a 1 comma negative up there based on our dimensional axis it's very squished it's been reflected we have a y-intercept so we can't find that you could make it better by plugging in a value like positive one and seen actually where that is so you plug in any okay 1 plus 1 that's 2 2 cubed would be 8 negative 1/3 that would be negative 8/3 so negative 2 and 2/3 and it added 1 be negative 1 and 1/3 so we know that this would go through late so this is off because it should get a lot of flatter than this but we have a value of that for that input value of 1 so you can make you graph a lot better I plug in some extra points around that but what you don't do you don't start by just plugging in the random points you'll miss some key feature to this you'll definitely miss your transformations so I hope that makes sense I hope that you understand that that the first thing I want to do is understand this shape then we want to understand our key points we want to take our vertical shift then our horizontal shift if there are those then we want to take these if there's one or two transformations write down what they are and compression in this case and a reflection about the x in this case then use this in conjunction to multiply your outputs that's the way we go about doing it I'm gonna come back with two more they're slightly more difficult we'll talk about how we reflect about the Y in the last example before that we'll talk about the reciprocal function we haven't done anything with that yet so hang on all right let's continue a couple of these are a little bit more difficult and the reason why they are because number one when I was used to working with square roots and with the reciprocal function as we are with some like an x squared or X to the 3rd graph so that's a little bit more difficult the second thing is that sometimes you really have to modify what's given to you to sort of see what transformations you have and so here's I'm going to tell you to do with some of these functions number one what we're trying to look for is on the inside of your function so in the parentheses in the square root into whatever you have in the absolute value we really want to have X first and we need X to be positive in order for us to really see the transformations that are taking place so when I look at this you okay well but what's the inside the inside here is the inside of the fraction is X positive yes is next first yes that's what we're looking for this is going to give us an accurate transformation however we also want to see the original function in this now this isn't an x-squared this doesn't look like a cubic or a square root it looks like a fraction the only thing on our library functions as a fraction is Juana Rex make it look as close to that as possible so what I mean by that is the three is kind of messing this up sometimes it's a little bit better for us to write this as 3 times 1 over X minus 2 plus 1 what well let's you see that's the reciprocal function it's based on the reciprocal function but it's having to subtracted from its input it's having something obviously a plus 1 adding to its output I see Oh three times the output value so that's going to be vertical or whatever that happens to be this is the way that we should kind of approach it make sure that you're the inside of your function has a positive x and that it's first try to make it look like the function that based on so this is if this is one of rex trying to make instead of three over something three times your original function is just being modified that helps a lot of students that i hope that helps you too so we're looking at it okay that's the reciprocal function the reciprocal function has only two key points it's odd but the key points are 1 1 and negative 1 negative 1 is an odd function all odd functions on our library function have those two key points 1 1 negative 1 negative 1 now we're going to go through and identify what's going on with this function we need to look at it okay based on the fact that is a reciprocal function what's the pulse want to do that +1 say shift up 1 unit you could write out the for the three transformations we have here that's totally fine this is a shift up one so I'd probably circle that and go up that's up one now I'm going to look at the minus two and say all right well that's affecting the input that says take your input value and subtract two from it what would I have to plug in to get the same input value that I really wanted to well I have to go to bigger so that's a shift to the right two we talked about why that was in the last video and you can write those transformations out if you require to list them so right - and I'm creating this idea of a new XY axis no it's not really on the paper but it gives some really good Keita I kind of a graphic organizer on which we can put our new key points when we find a figure those out so we've shifted up one we've shifted right to you and now we're going to do with that three that three says I want you to take the output of your function and multiply the output by three not the input has nothing to do with multiplying the input there's no negative multiplying input no number multiply the input this says just take your output value multiplied by three so what's it going to do is it going to reflect them no that's not negative is it going to stretch them yes it's taking your output the same that three what that does you're gonna get one comma positive 3 and negative 1 comma negative 3 it does not change your inputs but it multiplies your outputs by positive 3 stretching this functionality that's what's gonna happen here so we're going to graph that if you want to write the transformations you have a vertical shift up one horizontal shift right - and you'd have a vertical stretch of a factor of 3 it's taking up with values and multiply every single one of my 3 okay so 1 comma 3 as it relates to this idea of a shenmue shifted XY axis says yeah the point 1 comma 3 is not really there but if i graph it according this 1 comma 3 is like way up here the real point is 3 comma 4 yeah that's that's true and the other point negative 1 comma negative 1 - 3 negative 1 comma negative 3 of you down here that's also true and stretch this out the real point would be 1 comma negative 2 but if we graph this according to our new XY axis gives a really good picture of the graph so we're gonna graph it understanding it gonna be a little weird and we're stretched it out here now what would make this better firstly maybe the point secondly I don't know where this crosses the y axis do i it's it's not going to be very clear maybe find the y intercept they give you much clearer picture what's going on so if I want to find the y-intercept of this graph I would plug in x equals 0 take a plug in x equals 0 go away the cancer on the bottom you won't because you're subtracting 2 from it so 0 minus 2 is negative 2 1 over negative 2 is negative 1/2 that'd be 3 times maybe we'll have is negative 3 halves plus 1 is negative 1/2 so I know this is crossing the y axis at negative 1/2 hope I did that right now to have +1 negative 1/2 so this graph is going to look like something like that it's not going to be perfect if you wanted to find the x intercept it takes a little bit more work to find an x intercept you have to set this equal to 0 and say all right 3 over X minus 2 equals negative 1 we could multiply both sides by X minus 2 make sure you distribute subtract 2 this would cross at negative 1 and we'd get a better picture that so this graph has been shifted up one right - we've affected our output to stretch the graph that looks pretty ugly but that's the way this graph sort of looks as far as your sketch is concerned all right the last one this gets a little bit funky and the reason why it is I just told you that you want things to happen number one you want to be able to identify your basic crashing that's a square root we know that square roots look like this just like the original reciprocal function looks like this that's exactly what we got well our square root is going to have some things happen to it but to understand what they what actually happens we really want to know what this looks like if our X is first inside your square root inside the purple you said whatever but you have and if it's positive so we have a little bit of work to do for instance I really don't like the fact that X's ii really don't like the fact that x is negative it's gonna give us a misinterpretation of what this is this is not a shift to the left but wait a minute I thought plus was left yeah it is if your edge is positive so what this does this says all right I have my function I have my two if i factor out the negative that is what you want if you want that X to be positive even if you have to factor out a negative what that negative does that changes the sign of your input is what that does that's going to reflect this about the y-axis that's what happens this is actually shift to the right and then we reflect about the y-axis so when you're organizing your thoughts on this try to see the the basic graph shape no problem we're going to get our key points in just a minute but when we organize the inside of our function to see some of the reflections we want our X to be in order we want this to be in order but we need or X to be positive as well that sounds a lot this sounds very familiar like a factory because it's kind of based on the same idea so let's go ahead and do it we now know the square root we know our key points for square roots originally are 1 1 and 0 0 but we have a few things happening and now we can see what happens because we've structured it correctly we can see this as a shift of 3 units so we're going to graph that we know this has a shift so this would be up three this says a shift not left one right one that gives a great place from which to plot our new key points so our key points were one one but what happens to them well there's two things number one we have shift up that's a first transformation number two we have shifted right that's your second transformation we have two more things going on this negative inside our square root that's affecting the input inside input it's changing the sign of your input if you change the sign of your input you start swapping on opposite sides of your y-axis that's a reflection about the y and it's going to affect your inputs so what this does is says okay if I'm going to think my inputs by changing the sign instead of one I have negative 1 instead of 0 well I'd still have 0 now what's the to do the 2 does not change the sign of your output it says hey look at you look at your output this is your square root you have some numbers coming out of that now multiply them all by 2 so take your output value and multiply it by 2 so instead of 1 just multiply by 2 there are 4 transformation to one's a shoot up 3 ones a shift right 1 1 is reflecting about the y-axis that's what that does it affects the input change the sign of your input about the y-axis and one is a vertical stretch by a factor of 2 you will find all your outputs by 2 can you see that in the in the app in the new key points can you see that what this has done is change the sign of our input and that's this is multiplied or outputs times 2 that's stretched it out so we have our shift up 3 nailed it got a shift right one we've got it we're gonna plot our new key points key points were 1 1 now it's negative 1 2 key point 4 0 0 it's still 0 0 yes the real point is 1 comma 3 I know that puts a great way to do it so that you get a good picture now negative 1 comma 2 according to this new XY axis negative 1 comma 2 is right there it's right there yeah the real point 0 5 you know what if you plugged in 0 we turn a little better than 5 let's plug in 0 1 minus 0 is 1 the square root of 1 is 1 2 times there's one plus three is five look at that we have it right if you plug in one we should be getting out 3 1 minus 1 0 square 0 0 times 2 is 0 plus 3 is 3 this is the proper graph but understanding how these transformations affect your original graph is crucial to a lot of things we do in graphing specialty calculus and trigonometry understand the picture I promise you you do not want to go plugging in lots of different values to a trigonometric function trying to graph it it's insane alright I'll plug in negative PI over 6 be my guest sine of negative PI over 6 is what that make it's very challenging to do that and plot a graph it's not challenging to get an output it's challenging to plot a graph with those outputs that can be very difficult so understanding that this after a function means you're adding or subtracting and that means that your vertical shifting up and down respectively and getting this organized so that your X is first and your X is positive and now understanding that minus ones means a shift to the right when I'm effecting an input that's a shape to a right if I want you to and that that negative ensign is affecting the sine of our input making it positive versus negative that's reflecting about the Y and then they get this 2 outsides multiply an output and stretching that or compress it in the previous exam so we have and negative will be reflected about the x-axis that's so important for what we're doing so our graph finalizing this says yep it's a square root but I reflected this way I'm still gonna graph my square root function that's about how that graph looks that's a at least a good sketch of it I hope that makes sense I hope it explained the nature of our transformations and put them together in such a way that you really understand what's going on it's a big deal we really need to know what causes a graph to shift up and down we need to understand that that's affecting the output and that would be after the function is kind of done and after parentheses square roots all this stuff we need to understand how the how to shift left and right horizontally that that's affecting the input but then adding to the input is a shift left and sorry that left and and from input as shift to the right we need to get that it has to be in order with your next positive to figure that out you can factor negative we do understand that reflecting about the x-axis is right I change the sign of my output value the outside the function we don't have one here from the previous two examples that was what happened we didn't understand that outside the function when I multiply it is stretching or compressing because it's multiplying out the Y value we understand that reflected about the y axis is affecting the side of the the input so those things have to kind of be there we need to list our transformations I hope I've explained in such a way that you know how to do that now so we're done with crafting for kind of before plow until we start talking about quadratics in just a little bit so I hope that um you enjoyed the video I hope it made sense I hope to see you for the next one you
