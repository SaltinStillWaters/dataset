Transcript for: Finding the Domain of Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 4)
hi welcome to another video in this video we're going to discuss domain and how to find it for functions that are defined over real numbers so let's get right to it the last video we sort of explored domain a little bit I gave you a definition for it we looked at what we can have for inputs they give us a real number output now right right now when we say that a real numbered output we can have functions that have outputs that are imaginary numbers or complex number to find over the complex but for things that we normally graph we're going to restrict this to functions that are defined over real numbers and that gives us a pretty clear definition of what domain means so let's check it out what the domain is for us is the set of inputs of a function so these numbers that I can plug in that give us a real number output something that's not imaginary and something that is defined so not the function divided by zero and that the function can handle and that's that's the later in the class when we talk about some functions it can't handle like negative numbers so we're gonna discuss that today we're gonna look for the two main problem areas that we're gonna focus on and then there's a third one that we get down the road so when we talk about domain you got to keep that in your head so the set of inputs that give us a defined real number output for a function there's two problem areas that we really look at now down the road when we start talking about logarithms and we're not quite there yet well we'll get there in a little while logarithms are gonna add one more sort of problem area that we have to consider it's not really a problem it's just something that we have to consider that hey there's some numbers that I am NOT able to plug into logarithms there's also some numbers that I can't plug into square roots or in general even roots or denominators so when we think about square roots and denominators something in our heads got it again we might have some issues with these things so let's explore those today we'll look at a few examples on how to find domain what to be thinking about and what not to get confused on so again one more time we got this thing called domain it's a set of inputs that give us a real number but for a function and for now there's two areas that we will look for later on we'll add logarithms to this but for right now we're going to really be concerned about square roots and we're gonna be concerned about denominators of fractions so in square roots if you remember this when you have a square root it can be zero that's what we explored in the last video when we evaluated and said hey can you plug in some number that gives you zero inside of a square root yes that's fine can you plug in some number that creates the inside negative the answer's no so when we see a square root in our head we think the inside has to be positive it's really optimistic function it's all going to be positive what that means is if we plug in numbers that make the inside the radicand of our square root that make that negative those are problem numbers so what I'll always like to tell students is that a square root is going to tell you what it wants to have so it's going to give you this this range of numbers as interval of numbers this domain of what numbers it wants to have a denominator when we think about that but denominator just says what it can't have it can't have numbers that make the denominator equal to zero so when we're filling this out square roots the inside must be positive it's telling you what numbers it wants to have it says give me these numbers so I can maintain my positive inside denominators well they're not they're not about positive we can have fractions that are positive or negative or zero on the numerator there's only one thing that we worry about with fractions it's that the denominator cannot be equal to zero and if we keep that in mind we'll have a much better shot of finding domain right now I just need to warn you students get these things confused a lot because they really they see it a couple times but they never really understand why it is that that you need these cases met and therefore they they confuse us and they see square roots and they go oh man I gotta I gotta set that equal to zero and then solve it no no that's not what we're talking about or they'll see a denominator and say oh I need that positive why that doesn't make sense so let's understand really what is going on here when you have a square root if you end up with a negative inside of that square root that's going to be an imaginary number and since we are talking about functions over real numbers that's a problem for us so how do we avoid real numbers is it by making it equal to zero well no no how do we avoid imaginary numbers and complex numbers is so how we avoid that instinct with real numbers is that we find numbers that when we plug it into the square root it keeps the inside of the square root zero or more in other words positive and zero so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a look at our square root and say okay that's a function I'm looking for the inputs they give us a real number output I'm gonna say I couldn't give a rip of this thing equals zero that's fine having a square root equals zero is okay so if we plugged in let's see like five fourths and we'd have five minus 4 times 5 fourths would be five minus five and give you zero that's totally fine but we can also have numbers that make it positive so we're not looking at the idea that let's set it equal to zero we're really thinking about what a square root needs to have what a square root needs to have it needs any numbers that are gonna keep this positive and so how we find it is really we take the inside of the square root and if you let it be what it wants to be the inside of your square root it wants to be positive it wants to be greater than 0 greater than zero and math is the way that we say positive we also know that we can have numbers that let it equal to zero equal zero so in general we set the inside of our square root greater than or equal to zero please don't ever set this thing equal to zero and solve it you're confusing a denominator idea with a square root idea now some teachers might have taught you to do that and say well then you got to go back and make it inequality that's really bad form because sometimes when we divide by negatives our inequality has to change I've seen a lot of students miss that so long certainly a real short there's two problem areas there's square roots and there's denominators for now later on going to add logarithms to that that list of domain issues we've got to deal with so for square roots we're trying to tell the domain what it needs to be to keep the in set of square root positive to find that we say well what does the inside want to be the inside wants to be greater than or equal to zero the inside wants to be positive let's find the range or interval of numbers it does that you know I mentioned to this to you in in the first couple videos that part of this this series is reviewing some concepts that we often forget one thing we often forget is that when we're solving inequalities there's one time when you have to reverse the inequality it's not when you add or subtract someone you get a negative it's when you multiply or divide by not even when you multiply or divide just when you multiply or divide by a negative number so when we're solving this and we subtract 5 and get a negative 5 that's totally fine we get a negative 4 X greater than equal to negative 5 there's no reason for us to reverse that inequality but as soon as we divide by that negative no matter what we get over here when we divide by negative that action reverses already quality so greater than equal to becomes less than or equal to notice something real quick if this had not been a negative we would not reverse that inequality even though we're getting a negative on the right-hand side that does not matter so dividing by the negative or multiplying by the negative which we see much more rarely we don't really see that a lot because of the way that we structure solving equations but if we divide by a negative negative 4 divided by negative 4 is X negative 5 divided by negative 4 is positive 5 fourths but because we divide it by a negative don't even have a positive number we are going to reverse that inequality and here's what this says to you if you really think about it internalise what's going on right now the square root wants to be positive the inside wants to be positive or greater than or equal to 0 so we say let's give it what it wants let's let it be grand equal to 0 let's solve it and when we solve it it says as long as you meet this condition here you're going to have numbers inside your square root that are positive that's what we want so with a square root maybe this makes more sense right now a square root tells you what it wants to have that denominator is going to tell us what it can't have so it's a different logic there and when we say hey the domain is this there's a few ways to write it before we go any further I want to make sure that you understand one one more thing about this notice that there are be a lot of negative numbers to satisfy this so X is less than five for the set means like well 1.25 and less than that so one would be a valid number here zero is fine you plug in 0 square root of Phi that's totally totally fine when you plug in one you get one screw one is one when you plug in negative one well five minus negative four would be nine square root of minus three so negative numbers are fine to plug in notice that we saw last video too that if you can plug in negatives into a square root that's okay as long as the result that you get inside of it is positive or at least zero so this includes a lot of negative numbers that's not the point of square roots you don't say a lot of plugging positives sometimes that doesn't work like if we plug in 10 10 is a positive number but 5 minus 20 well that's negative 15 sorry that would be 45 minus 40 that's negative 35 square root of negative 35 is an imaginary number we can't have that square roots tell you what it wants to be so it wants to be positive we solve it and then this right here is the interval of numbers that are going to give you a real number output for that function so because yeah it wants me this solve it down that's going to give you real numbers and that's exactly what the domain is for us the two ways to write this are you can write like this but more appropriate than that it's set builder notation it says I'm going to tell you that the set of numbers that works in my function or that the inputs will will give you a real number output are based on the independent variable X that vertical line is pronounced such that so X such that X is less than or equal to 5/4 and this right here gives you a set of numbers that works as inputs do you see it do you see that says hey if you replace your X such that X as anyone of any anything in this range of numbers so less than or equal to 5/4 it's going to be a positive number and we know the square roots of positive numbers are they okay those are all real numbers that's what we're talking about the other way that we can write this is with interval notation interval notations where we use those brackets in the parentheses we say well you know what if I had an interval of numbers with 5/4 it says X is less than that 5/4 that's this way because it has that equals I include the number 5/4 with a bracket and this says any number between negative infinity that's way over here to 5/4 this will be an input that's going to give me a real number output we always use parentheses for infinities because you can't actually obtain that number we always have these in order from left to right just like a number line is so we start small number and big number even if this is verse from that way we start 5/4 and end it positive infinity the equal sign determines whether we have a bracket or not that's got to make sense right now so inputs Manor domain we want square roots to be positive we solve it down um there's two ways right the domain the next one so that doesn't have any square roots but it certainly has a denominator this is the other place that we look we know that denominators can never have zero on the bottom or a fraction sorry fractions can have zero in the denominator we can't ever divide by zero and get a real number out that's an undefined situation so this really takes care of the two problems that we have number one well we can't deal with imaginaries number two we can't deal with undefined numbers in functions to graph them now that does determine some things about graphs but there's not going to be a point there that we can get out and that's what we're really that's that's really the point is that what does your output for all of these numbers well there's going to be some numbers where we don't have an output that's a real number or don't have an output that's even defined it's going to create a vertical asymptote for us when we get to graphing level later and talk about graphing a lot so when this happens when your denominator is equal to zero for some numbers it's going to create this thing called a vertical asymptote in logarithms and square roots it just says you you can't even get a number out it's not that it's undefined it's not even valid for this function so that that's a different story and that's why we handle them different again square root tell you what you want to have you want numbers that are positive so rule logarithms actually with denominators go I just can't have this equal to zero so when we approach it we think about it like well do I care if the numerator 0 you know what if the numerator is zero what that actually means is that so that's where if we have any x-intercepts it's gonna appear there where your numerator equals zero is your 10 ourselves your domain on the other hand is really only a one problem for fractions if your denominator equals zero so how we approach it we look at again you know what I'm gonna have problems if I set my denominator equal to zero that's gonna be a problem the one problem we can even have is if t cubed minus 16 t actually ends up being equal to zero so we're going to set this equal to zero understanding something about it that the numbers I get here are bad numbers there are numbers that I cannot use their numbers that will be outside the domain because they're going to create a zero on the bottom sort of idea that's an undefined value for an output so we can't include them and we'll deal with that in the domain right now so let's solve it whenever we're kind of reviewing what you can do whenever you have a power to power three expression that's equal to some numbers or some some equation here you might try to factor it so factoring says put your polynomial in order and it is our exponents are descending factor out a GCF so think about a number and/or a variable that divides all of your terms like t t divides both of these terms after that out alright well and then you keep going factoring something like a one-and-done sort of thing so we factor out the T no problem we have this can you factors T squared minus some number of answers always yes I know that we're taught that you can only factor these if that is a perfect square that's not true if this number is a perfect square it does make it easier and that you can factor this as t minus or the square root of sixteen and t plus the square root of 6 over and that's true but if that number is not 16 some people will take this and say i cannot factor that and that that's not true in this class so when typically when i teach like a intermediate algebra over the class before this I'll tell them that this is possible it's just that we probably have not covered square roots at that point once you covered square roots we didn't understand that this can represent that T squared minus 5 because if you square the square root of 5 you're going to get 5 well then if that's the case then we can factor it and that's perfectly acceptable in this class so if you have T squared minus some real number you're going to factor that moving on so once we once again this down so we looked at this we said there's no square roots that great so but I'm not thinking positive I'm thinking I know that with fractions my denominator cannot be zero so I'm setting it equal to zero understanding that what I get out of this are numbers that I'm going to exclude because those numbers these one two three values that are going to give us zero on the Donata they're they're bad numbers for our domain in that I will not be able to get a real number output so using the zero product property it says you got three factors they're equal to zero if any one of these factors equals zero it's going to create a true statement in that equation so T equals zero no problem T is zero and then if either these are I don't even care zero times whatever is going to give us zero if t minus four equals 0 or in other words if T equals four for this factor 0 I don't care what these are because 0 times any other two real numbers going to give a zero and lastly for the same reason T equals negative four all these things right here and you see it if I let these T values be evaluated in that function then this is going to be some number either 0 or 20 or negative 20 but for each of those three values my denominator is going to be zero that is not okay we can never divide a number by zero even zero over zero is an undefined value what that means is that you're going to have a hole in your function would be and that's that's that's going to be 30 videos from now 20 years from now that when we get a 0 over 0 idea it's factorable and cancelable you're going to get a hole so your function is going to be going along it's gonna get a hole and then continue that's what that number does for you the other two numbers these numbers you just can't plug in any of them you can't have a zero that's bad number denominator zero gotta kick that one out if T equals four at a uniform your numerator is gonna be some either positive or negative real number and your denominator is going to be zero that creates what's called a vertical asymptote what the fourth is a vertical asymptote a vertical asymptote happens when you have this wall like a force field and your function goes up to it and says up I can't I can't cross it I can't touch it it's like MC Hammer man doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo can't touch this that's what that vertical asymptote does it says your function cannot cross that Y what because at that value your function is not even defined there is no point at the value T equals 4 and likewise at the value T equals negative 4 now I don't know whether it's going to go to positive infinity or negative infinity but it's gonna go to one of them that's what these values do I know that's a lot of stuff in a short amount of time but there's so much to learn about our domain most of the time we just figure out a process and we go with it we never really get it and then later on it really keeps her but because you'll get into some other stuff where domains extremely important and frankly it kind of hasn't been until we get to like this level and further in calculus domain readily important what you can which you can't click in because sometimes we get answers and if we assume that domain is all real numbers we're going to be very very wrong so I'm gonna give you a little recap to make sure that we're okay even though it might seem a little basic right now it's super important to understand these two issues very very well so number one domain is a set of inputs that form now because we're talking about real numbers must give us a real number output that means square roots because they have the potential to give us imaginary numbers or a problem area for us to look at and denominators because they have the potential to create an undefined area sorry undefined number value are a problem for us to look at notice cube roots are fine you can have negatives in humans or v roots or 7/3 or odd roots even roots like square roots four through six years those are all going to have that same issue those will be problems we're gonna have domain issues there no there's a difference between square roots and denominators square roots we we solve these domains or we find these domains by letting this be greater than equal to zero because we think about it a square root needs to be this it needs to be greater than or equal to zero notice that needs to be it wants to be this this is the the definition of what makes a square root work over real numbers is set a greater than equal to zero it's going to give you an interval of numbers that is going to work for you that's going to create the inside positive it's going to give you a real number result output then now there's our backwards developers don't deter don't aren't given by what you want to have it's given by less you can't be so with a denominator it can't be zero so we said equal to zero and solve it down and say these things are not okay if I let those happen I'm gonna get some bad situations for us as far as the domain now graphically they do help us so we we need to use this to graph I already told you that's going to be a hole those two gonna be asymptotes if you have zero over zero that's a hole a little removable discontinuity something that's just a missing point these two things are vertical asymptotes we're gonna learn a lot about it but as far as domain is concerned those are problems that we must exclude notice this says what I can't have what I must have to make it work this is what I must not have to make it work do not confuse the two so for our domain we can say X not X why is that wrong why is X wrong remember that this first thing in set-builder notation is an independent variable so my variable changes I need to change that and say look for T's okay what can t be T can be all real numbers except for but or and and then we list our exclusions and we say you know we've got to exclude some values because they're gonna create some undefined results for us that's T equals 0 and T equals negative 4 and T equals positive for those three numbers are the only numbers in the world power 3 says we have at most three results our three says these three numbers are the only numbers in the world that they're going to create a denominator equals zero and therefore an undefined result for us in this function it doesn't matter about positive or negative it's a fraction they can be positive or negative don't confuse a square root with the denominator idea how we'd ahead man how we do this for the mineral notation is it's fairly ugly you see when you exclude one number how we do that in math how we do that with interval notation is we say all whole numbers would be this check it out all real numbers would be that's all real numbers from negative infinity to positive infinity no problem if we want to exclude values from that then we're going to insert 4 little exclusions well how do we do it we insert an exclusion by putting this order and saying you know what I can go from negative infinity all the way up to negative 4 but parentheses exclude values brackets include them parentheses exclude them so this would be like negative four point zero zero zero zero zeros zero zero zero zero for a long way there with one and say you have a negative force not included and then we start up again at negative four but a little bit more than that so this says hey go from negative infinity up to negative four but just before you get there now just after you've left negative four and that's what excludes this this point negative 4 then you can go all the way up to zero notice it's in order but you gotta exclude the zero and then you can go up to four but then you've got it excluded before but then you can continue on square roots give you an interval says what you can't have denominators say here's an interval and it says what you can't have done two different ways that's got to make sense before we go on any further so we need the idea of inputs this domain we need the idea that it's the set of values that's giving you a real number output and if you think about that it really should just follow directly that square roots want to be positive because negatives give you imaginary can't have those it's got to follow that denominators can't be equal to zero because if that happens we do something that's undefined we're going to come back with just a couple examples to be pretty quick going through and exploring these ideas a little more remember that later on we're gonna add one more scenario to this for this class and that's logarithms logarithms fall into the same category of square roots and that they the inside the argument wants to be positive so if you're dealing with that right now all we need to do with the inside of a logarithm is set it greater than zero it can't even equal zero so logarithms the inside has to be positive because of the way it comes from an exponential when I take a number to an exponent a positive number to an exponent I always get we always get positive numbers out of that and since our basis for Exponential's are positive or our output for Exponential's has to be positive and therefore input for logarithm since they're inverses have to also be positive so that's that's the other domain assuming we deal with it much later and I'll explain it thoroughly when we get there so I'll come back a little bit with two examples okay so I lied I said two and then three examples because I really want to deal with that one two we just talked a long time about what inputs are as far as our domain and that these inputs need to give you a a real number output for your your function and if that doesn't happen well then you're you got to exclude them somehow or tell tell the domain what it has to have in order to make this dysfunction work for you and we looked at two problem areas we looked at square roots and denominators and I said there's gonna be another one logarithms I'm gonna kind of hide it for now we're talked about later when we get to logarithms and really really explore those so what happens if your function doesn't have square roots and it doesn't have denominators and it doesn't have logarithms in it well then your domain is all real numbers for every polynomial that you have every polynomial with it without that's things without square roots that's things without fractional exponents there are radicals like square roots that's things without fractions where you have a variable on the denominator notice I don't mean fractions like this fractional coefficients like three bits that is not we're talking about talking about fractions where you have variables on the denominator you don't have square roots you don't have fractions on the denominator where variables on the denominator you don't have logarithms your domain is going to be any real number all real numbers so if you look at this ago hey no fractions at all no square roots no logarithms your domain is all real numbers so help me write that we can say X set to X is a real number or X such an X is all real numbers or X such that X is that's you can use a block letter R for all real numbers or we can say interval notation negative infinity to positive infinity that's another way that we can say all real numbers and what that says is plug in anything you're going to get a real number out and that's true for that function if we move on to something like this though man is nasty there's a lot of stuff going on there don't be confused when you see both fractions and square roots what we deal here is each of those issues independently so you don't have to put them all together we're going to on that one I'll show you it's a nice little little trick we can we can use but you don't have to do that we can think okay well I have a denominator and I have a square root let's think through both of those so let's do the denominator first what do you know about denominators well we know that denominators equaling 0 is a bad thing for us I could put in any number here for the denominator as far as the denominator is concerned as long as it does not equal 0 so when we do this when we see a de number it's telling you there's numbers that I can't be okay so there's numbers and I'm plugging in here that might be issues so we're gonna set this equal to 0 with the understanding that it's a denominator if it equals 0 I'm gonna have problems so when you add 4 and say hey that number for obviously is going to create a 0 on the denominator I mean care what's on the numerator right now if that not if this function we allow if we allow this function to have x equals 4 as an input we're gonna have an issue right here that's a problem issue so we say we must exclude 4 so setting the denominator equal to 0 not greater than or equal to equal to 0 says you're going to have some bad numbers here or numbers that you can't have your domain and that one of those numbers for now we look at our square root and we understand that something's switching we're not worried about 0 so much or worried about keeping it positive because we need real numbers oh yeah real defined numbers this would create an undefined number let's think about here I need values of x that keep this part of my square root greater than or equal to 0 they keep it positive or 0 well what's that going to be we solve it it's gonna give us a range of numbers some interval that's gonna keep the inside of my square root positive and that's what I need to have happen to get a real number out of that square root so if we add 15 we do not switch any quality ever when we're adding or subtracting and divide by 3 we do not switch the inequality unless we divide by a negative this says that as long as you have numbers greater than or equal to five you're going to keep the inside positive as long as you keep the inside positive you're going to get real numbers out of that square root and that's what we need do you see the difference between how we treat denominators and how we treat square roots you've got to see the difference one is about keeping it positive so that you get a real number the other one the denominators about not letting equals zero so you don't get something undefined and understanding that understanding that we need real numbers out that are defined is how we approach dealing with square roots and those fractions now we'll put this in a well we will put this in the domains all right set builder notation X such that and we're gonna put both these up there right X needs to be greater than even with 5 and X cannot equal 4 and we're done and your teachers probably to go think about this for a second and not that you're wrong all right not that you're wrong but that it's redundant look at how this says X needs to be greater than 5 and look at how that says X can't be 4 then you go all right so we know right we know that this has to happen we have to have that in order for this to even give us real numbers but then it goes oh yes but make sure you don't get a 4 in there isn't this already excluding the 4 so our X says you gotta be more than 5 and I said yeah but make sure you don't get a 4 oh well that's a redundant thing so we really would not have this X is not equal to 4 for this scenario we don't we don't need it that's a redundant no I'm gonna play around a little bit Oh what would happen what would happen if you know what I'll do this to our interval notation would be here's 5 here's greater than that so we'd go from 5 to infinity parenthesis on the infinity a bracket on the 5 because we can actually equal that value so this would be our two domains for this scenario now let's let's play around what if I made this not 15 but 12 well that's all friends if we end with hey in order to make that square root positive you need numbers bigger than or equal to 4 all right any numbers bigger than equal before is this now relevant absolutely because this says ID numbers that are greater than or equal to 4 and this one says you can't equal 4 now instead of writing this it's a little bit easier to write these together if we say that X cannot X has to be greater than equal to 4 and this one says X can't before then this is one way to say it but maybe more importantly or more appropriately we can say what if we just exclude that equal sign that says that X has to be greater than or equal before but not equal to 4 it just takes out that equals part of it and so what we get here is this this domain so X must be more than 4 or using a parentheses X must be more than 4 can be written in interval notation just like that ok last iteration of this let's change this to 9 so 9 9 9 3 3 3 what now is this one relevant yeah absolutely this says you need numbers that are greater than or equal to 3 to keep this thing happy and since 4 is now in that interval you need to express it separately and say I also can't have 4th that makes sense say hey you know what you need numbers more than 3 at least equal to 3 but make sure you exclude 4 because that number is gonna make this denominator not work for you that's what's happening here on interval notation we hits it's pretty awkward to show with interval notation we would say we do this because 4 is up here right before is this problem so we'd start at 3 with a bracket you can include the 3 and you need to we go up to 4 we'd say you know what you need to exclude that 4 but then after that you can keep going forever that's how we write that for interval notation man I hope this makes sense I hope you're seen the the ideas behind domain really producing for you understanding real numbers here being positive defined numbers here being not 0 and that is how we approach find a domain the last one I'm going to go through very quickly obviously we have the fraction we also have some square root so let's really think about it there's two issues right we know that the denominator has a square root in it we know that square roots want to be positive so when we write this you go let's talk with a square root first let's understand that in order for us to get real numbers I would have to have X minus 8 being greater than or equal to zero that's the square root I did just the square root of says it keep me positive or most deadly 0 so I want this to happen so that this guy's happy gives me non imaginary numbers 15 real numbers but it's on the denominator do now to say I get that you want to be greater than or equal to zero because your square root or I get that but remember denominators are not happy if they equals 0 so what if we just don't include the zero part of it now we've excluded the only value that can possibly make zero and that would be 8 so 8 minus 8 is 0 the square root of 0 is 0 so if we exclude the the 8 it would exclude that idea that hey I can be equal to 0 here then we're excluding the only number that's gonna let that denominator be 0 so we kind of put these ideas together sometimes and say cool but we know what we can't have that actually equals 0 so we're just gonna take that away from that inequality if we add a nothing changes as far as reversal equality we get X is greater than 8 that's our domain we can set this up with set builder notation we can say hey X is X is positive and more than 8 but it can't include the 8 so our interval notation says let's start at 8 with the parenthesis we cannot include it because that would make zero on the Danai gurira fraction and we go to infinity I hope that this has made sense there's only one more thing that I want to touch on sometimes you'll get some fractions like let's say 5 over x squared plus 1 and you go alright great can that dénouement let's think through it does it have any of the problem areas that we know could cause issues for us well it doesn't have any square roots it does have a denominator and so you go through the process and you go you know what I know that if denominators equals 0 I've got problems but then you think about it and go can that actually equal 0 and the answer is no not over real numbers and that's what we're talking about so I take any number of the world that's a real number and I square it which gives me a positive or at least 0 and then I add 1 to it there's no way it's going to equal 0 that's impossible positive numbers plus 1 can't equal 0 and so this says there's there's no solution to that no real number solution that's fine what that means is that there's no real solution that's gonna make your denominator equals 0 and there's no problem there's no domain problem here your domain would be all real numbers that even here I take the square root of that oh man and no square roots have to be positive so you think about this one say all right the square root of x squared plus 1 has to be greater than zero not equal to zero because it's on the bottom of fraction you go well what numbers are going to make this greater I can't solve that oh geez what do I do well if you square a number and add one is it always positive is it ever negative it's never negative it's always has to be positive or real numbers that's all that's all so it's telling you the domains are real numbers so sometimes we really just have to sit there and think about it a little bit and understand the ideas behind the square root and the denominator if you have something that cannot equal zero on the bottom of your fraction your domain is all real numbers if you have something in a square root that cannot be negative ever no matter what you plug in then your domain is all real numbers so I hope that you'll get this from time to time I hope that makes sense to you I hope also you understood my my comment about with fractions we're really only concerned where your denominator has variables in it so like X minus 2 over 4 that 4 is a constant it can never equal 0 on its own so your domain here would also be all real numbers we're gonna stop there we've explained what domain is again we've talked about how to find the square roots and with denominators and the interplay between those later on we'll talk about logarithms hope makes sense and we're gonna come back a little while with with how to how to find operations of functions and their domains so I'll see you for the next video on that you
