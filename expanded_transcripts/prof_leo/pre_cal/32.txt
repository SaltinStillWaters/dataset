Transcript for: Descartes Rule of Signs (Precalculus - College Algebra 33)
hey there i hope you're doing well hope you're ready for another video we have kind of a short video on a not simple but easy to understand concept that is very very useful is it uh imperative not really but you're going to find that descartes rule of science can really save you a lot of time in the next concept that we're going to learn which is how to solve uh rational functions sorry polynomial functions using the rational zeros theorem so factoring creates the ability to solve by the zero product property and that's what we're getting to but i wanted to throw this concept in there because i'm going to be referencing it in the next video and it's important for you to understand because i want to save you time i don't want you to waste a lot of time checking things that you don't need to because they don't exist it'll give you a better understanding of what is going to happen when you start factoring these polynomials so we're going to get right into the descartes of science i'm not going to prove it for you i will tell you the idea behind it though so as we go through it i'm gonna explain to you why is it that you can have three positive x-intercepts or one but not two and not zero or two or zero but not one or three why it decreases by an even number and so here's what you're going to learn in this video you're going to learn that if you have a polynomial in order and you just count the number of sign changes from left to right it will tell you the number of positive x-intercepts you have for real it's going to tell you either have like three or one or that's it or maybe six or four or two or zero well that that might not be that powerful it's powerful when you start combining it with rational zeros theorem when you start finding zeros it'll tell you how many are left or maybe it'll tell you there's no positives or no negatives and that's very important because we can eliminate checking checking values that would not be x-intercepts anyway and so that's what we do then we change the signs of our odd exponents why because you're going to evaluate for negative x all it does is change the sign of your odd exponent terms and do the same thing only this time it's going to tell you the possible number of negative x-intercepts that's what the decart's rule of signs basically does so we're going to get right into it so what we're going to do we're going to put your polynomial in order every time now if we're going to count number of sign changes that's very important you want to make sure they're in order we do that anyway for basically everything we do but it's super important here so make sure your polynomial is in order before you start any of this stuff then we're going to count the number of sign changes from left to right so let's look at our first example from well first we check order order means your exponents are decreasing until you have a constant if you have a constant it should be a last so seven three two zero that's fantastic that's what we want then we count the number of sign changes from left to right so we go okay well what is what does that mean you look at your signs so i gave you starting with a negative so that you can see that that is a signed term if that negative wasn't there we would consider that to be a positive and we might even write a little plus in front so that you can see what's going on so this is a negative that is a plus a minus and a plus so as you're counting from left to right you say okay that's a negative we have not started really counting changes yet because you start somewhere so we say that's a negative what's the next sign is it the same or we can say is it is it could it be written as a negative or is it a positive or a plus so we say that's a negative that's a plus this counts as a sign change you go okay think of this as negative or minus think of this as positive or plus this would be negative two positive that is a sign change one positive to negative that's two negative to positive that's three there are three sign changes here one two and three so here's what we're gonna say we go right there are three sign changes what that means is that in this polynomial if you were to graph it or you were to solve it you were going to have either three that's what this says right here it's very wordy now when you read the first time you have decimate intentional um you're going to have this number of sign changes or an even number less than that amount what does that mean even numbers are two or four or six so all you really do is you count the number of sign changes hey there's three you could potentially have three sign changes or keep subtracting two from this number until you hit either one or zero and then stop and you will have a list of the number of positive x intercepts you could get so we said all right and i know that this can be confusing the first time you hear it um so i'm going to kind of repeat myself several times in slightly different ways so that it clicks in your head put it in order we got it count the sign changes that's the most important thing besides interpretation so okay once i change two sine changes three sign changes you write that number down that number that we write down represents the number of positive x-intercepts or any even number less than that represents the number of positive x-intercepts so there could be three positive x-intercepts if you remember this is the x-axis and this is the y-axis this would be considered the positive x-axis and the negative portion of the x-axis what this says is there will be three or one positive x-intercept it's either going to cross or bounce one time or three times not two not zero one three or one now how to where to get the one from so there will be three or one positive x-intercepts where do i get the one from that's where this comes in right here that or an even number less than this so you write down the number of sign changes like three you go okay start subtracting two from that two is an even number and every multiple of two is an even number so you go okay if i have three sign changes there's three or subtract two one positive x-intercept let's say you started with seven if you had seven sign changes you go okay there there are either seven positive x intercepts or five take away two or three take away two or one that's the potential number of positive x-intercepts that we would have now it's not going to be all of those it's going to be one of those either seven or five or three or one what if you had like six like six sign changes well you'd have either 6 positive x intercepts or take away 2 4 or take away 2 2 or take away 2 0 so you come up with sort of a list of how many positive x intercepts you could get so count the number sign change is three write that number down and just subtract two until you get down to one or zero depending whether you have an odd number of um sign changes or even number sign changes so what this says is that we can either intersect the x-axis on the positive portion of it one time or three times three times or one time that's it now here's why that's important we know for sure that we're going to have at least one positive x-intercept so when we go check numbers uh in the next video i'm like what numbers are going to work we would want to include positive values because you are going to have one this is why we can't get to zero this is why we don't put zero up here because one minus two is it surpasses zero you can't just subtract one and go oh it's three or two or one or zero you're going to have either three or one right that's that's your guarantee you're gonna have either three or one positive x intercepts you're gonna have at least one of them possibly three of them no more than three no less than one and you're not going to have two so it's one or the other so you would want to include those because you know you're going to hit somewhere over here at least one time possibly three times but that's the only options for you now a common question is why in the world do you subtract two why why two or four um what that has to do with is irreducible quadratics so irreducible quadratics like x squared plus 25 you cannot factor that that does not give you any additional x intercepts but what it does is subtracts from your your degree so if you remember this and you do need to know this your degree represents the total number of x-intercepts you could possibly have so this says you could potentially have seven x-intercepts are you going to have that many not necessarily why well because irreducible quadratics give you complex zeros but no x-intercepts they do things like they create these these local maxima and minima is somewhere above the x-axis where it doesn't cause an intersection or below the x-axis and so what that does is this counts for if this is a factor up here i don't even know but what this would do is this would take away two from your degree if you start factoring it but give you no x intercepts and for that reason that's that's basically the reason why you subtract two from this number sign changes because if you're going to miss one x-intercept you're going to miss two at a time you're never going to just miss one x intercept at a time because of those irreducible quadratics that's why we subtract two from the number of sign changes i hope that makes sense i might mention that one more time as we go through so all right i'll run down one more time put in order we gotta count the sign changes cool you're gonna have that many or two less than that as and you write the whole list so three or one positive x-intercepts then what we do is what we we evaluate for negative x kind of like evaluating for an even or odd function we say all right what about f of negative x now some people get really confused on this you know i'm really bad at evaluating i'm going to give you a trick for this don't even worry about it don't even evaluate don't even plug in negative x just change the signs of your odd powered terms and here's why if you evaluate negative x into an even negative anything squared gives you a positive it's not going to change that sign constants never change sign you can't you can't evaluate that but odds when you plug in a negative there it will change the sum so if i plug in negative x to x cubed it'll give me negative x cubed and i'll change that sign if i plug in negative x to x to the seventh power that'll give me negative x to the seventh power and we'll change that sign so how to evaluate this easily just change your odd not your even not your constants your odd powered terms change the sign in front of them so if i want to evaluate f of negative x i'm going to this is an odd powered term i'm going to change this to positive x to the 7 4x to the 7th this is an odd power term i'm going to change it to minus x cubed i won't change this even power term because even powers don't change signs when you plug into positive or negative they're even i'm not going to change my constant because there's nothing to evaluate there and so i just look at it change my odd power terms the signs of those odd power terms and then i do the same thing but what we're going to get here is we're going to get the number of potential negative x intercepts so positive cool gives you a number positive that's pretty convenient change the sign of your odd power terms that's evaluating for negative x and then do the same thing the number of sign changes here are and this is what i was saying earlier maybe write a little plus for the positive that way you can see the sign change that's a positive or we can think plus that's a minus but we can think negative the sign change positive 2 negative oh that's 1 negative 2 negative that does not change so positive to negative that's 1 negative to negative that did not change do not count that negative to positive that's two there are two side changes here what does that mean because we evaluated for this negative x and we repeated this we counted from left to right we said all right there are two sign changes then this number represents the number of negative x intercepts or an even a number less than that will represent your negative x intercept so here's what this says it says if i have two sign changes after evaluating negative x i will have either two or so start subtracting two and get two lists down to either one or zero i will have either two or zero two minus two is zero two or zero negative x intercepts that's it that's all we can possibly have now why am i teaching this to you well because if you use some beautiful thinking this can really help you later i want you to think about this what's the degree of your polynomial right now you should look up finger that's seven that says potentially the most we could have are seven x-intercepts that's it seven x-intercepts are we gonna have that many no and i guarantee it here's why we did the cartoon assigns and it says are positive x-intercepts there's either three of them or one of them notice how we subtracted two to get that list so we stopped at one because you can't subtract two past that so we have either three or one positive x-intercepts we change the sign over power terms and essentially evaluating negative x and we did it again we said okay there's either two or zero negative x intercepts you are either going to have positives or negatives you can't factor out an x and so there's no um there's no zero there's no x intercept right at zero that doesn't that's not going to work so you either have three or one over here two or zero over here you could potentially have no x-intercepts and negative x-intercepts none of them but you definitely don't have seven look at this at most you could have three positive and two negative that's only five that's only five so if our degree's seven and we say we can have at most five then what's the other two the other two something like x squared plus twenty-five it will give you an irreducible quadratic that does not give you x-intercepts that's valuable to know so we know that when we factor this when we get down to factoring that one we're going to end with at least one irreducible quadratic again the irreducible quadratic because that is a power two that starts taking away two at a time from your degree and the same thing would happen two at a time from your positive and or your negative x-intercepts that's why you subtract two to get this list it sounds really weird to say subtract some even number less than that well what they mean is yeah subtract two then subtract two again what do you subtract four subtract two then two then two would you subtract six that's why it says an even number it basically what it does it says just give me a list start with the number sign changes give me a list by subtracting two until you get to one or zero like this or that and then you're done this is the potential of positive x-intercepts through one or potential of negative x-intercepts two or zero it also says one more thing if you find a negative x-intercept you know for sure that you have to have another one because you're either zero or two so if you find one of them there's gonna be another one because you know you have to have zero or two you can't find one they go i have zero doesn't make sense you can't find one ego i guess i have one it was wrong no no it's going to be either zero or two so if you find one negative x intercept there is going to be another one there according to at least this polynomial so that's the main idea that's the cultural science as we move forward to the next section i'm going to be refreshing your memory on this we're going to do it every single time someone say hey remember to cultural science let's make this easier let's see what we could potentially have i'm also going to refresh your memory that in the last video that you watched we had those two examples and i hope that you remember uh what we got out of them you might pause and go back and just kind of think about uh what those what those were when we uh when we checked started checking with long division and synthetic division on what we got out of them so i'm going to refresh your memory as we go through but this is going to be interesting because i'll put this in the into play for you so let's go ahead and let's practice the cartoon sign two more times just on these last two and we're going to call it good so g of x hopefully you see what's wrong with this before you start checking the cartridge signs or anything that i tell you with polynomials you have to have it in border you see if we go right from here go oh hey yeah this is a negative that's a positive that's 1 that doesn't change two sign changes hey there's two sign changes that means i would have remember i had not evaluated negative x i would have two or zero positive x intercepts that's wrong why well because this is not an order and in order might change some signs around and so when we put this in order when we put that in order it is different so let's think through everything i want you to know about polynomials at this point number one they should be in order number two uh well when you look at the degree that's like the first thing we look for is the leading term which has your degree has your end behavior has a lot of stuff in it that we've talked about already but your degree also says there will be at most three x-intercepts total i need you to get that that the degree gives you the maximum number of x-intercepts so when i say hey three this will have at most three x-intercepts is it gonna have all three i don't you don't know without doing a little bit of work and we're gonna do that work right now but the cultural signs will answer that question for us and it's pretty cool so this will have at most three x-intercepts what if it doesn't have three then pairs of two will be wrapped up in irreducible quadratics and pairs of two will be complex solutions we're going to talk about exactly why that is when we get two complex solutions let's say why do they come in pairs why do they come in conjugate pairs as do the quadratic formula and you have plus or minus and negative inside of a square root well then you get the same value but plus and a minus you're going to get a conjugate pair they always come in twos let's say that one more time this degree tells you the maximum number of x intercepts it tells you the total number of solutions if you have complex numbers so we could potentially have three x intercepts if we don't have three x intercepts then we will have one x intercept they will have they will be in pairs of twos if we don't have them so let's go ahead and let's let's go through our rule signs so i'm going to put a little plus here so you can find that i start with a positive positive to negative that's one sign change negative to positive that's two sine changes positive to negative that's three sine changes what that means for us is that we are going to have three x-intercepts on the positive side of the x-axis or subtract two from that number create a list that goes down to one or zero we'll have three positive x-intercepts or one positive x-intercepts nothing else those are the only two options that you have here so over here we either hit it once or we hit it three times no two no zero we know for sure that we're going to have a positive x-intercept at least one and so what we do in the next video is we would start checking positive numbers see which one works um if you remember we did that actually and we plugged in i think it was positive one we said uh two minus one is one one plus two is three three minus three is zero oh yeah hey one worked one one is a positive x-intercept and we said that was a zero therefore gave us a factor and we did long division on that and i taught you synthetic division on that so we knew we had one positive x-intercept now what we got out of that well you know i'm won't ruin suspense if you if you watch it back what we got out of that was in not gonna ruin this events it was an irreducible quadratic when we got that if you take that and you do synthetic division and just divide out one uh use one as your x-intercept what you're going to get is an irreducible quadratic wait a minute do irreducible quadratics give you x-intercepts no that's the whole point of subtracting two it was an irreducible quadratic that gave you no more x-intercepts so we found one positive x-intercept what we did is we divided it and we found an irreducible quadratic that had no other x-intercepts so you can't have 3 here 3 is the maximum but we got an irreducible quadratic that was fascinating now let's go ahead and finish this thing off if we had evaluated g of negative x what we would do is we'd change our odd powered terms change the sign of those things so we're going to have negative 2x cubed we leave the x squared alone minus 2x we leave the constant alone and you'll please think about a second negative negative negative how many sign changes do you have none zero sign changes now this is where i think the cartoon of science is very powerful this is my opinion this is where it's most powerful if you have no sign changes then that tells you something huge that tells you in this case because remember we're on negative x here this is talking about negative x-intercepts you are going to have how many none not potentially two not potentially four none you will have zero negative x intercepts hundred percent guaranteed now if you're curious as to why that's so important in the next video you're going to be learning something called the rational zeros theorem where i tell you how to find a list of numbers that are potentially or that contain all of your rational zeros well um if you know that you have no negative x-intercepts don't check negatives that's huge that saves you half of the work that you would otherwise do because you got to check negative and positive normally if you know you don't have negative x intercepts you eliminate half your list of numbers to check that's fantastic that saves you so much time because you're just going to be focused on the positives so wrapping this whole thing up with this example we put in order we checked our sign changes you say you have three or one positive x intercepts you change your odd power terms by evaluating negative x and you have zero side changes this says you will have no negative x intercepts so you either touch once or three times here you are not going to cross over here that's that's good to know and then you start dividing you all right when again when we divided out that that one or that x minus one is the factor we got an irreducible quadratic what that means is that we are not going to have any more than one positive x intercept we found our one right it was one but when you divide that out and get an irreducible quadratic it says well you can't have you can't go to three you can't have two that irreducible quadratic is why this happens while you go you're either gonna have three or one because that irreducible quadratic while it took two away from your degree if you were to divide it it doesn't yield any more x-intercepts that's pretty interesting i hope that that makes sense to you it's very powerful and as we continue you're going to see this thing play out right now it's just kind of a introduction on how it works and you're going to see it in the next video let's do the last one so h of x is 3x to the sixth plus 82 x to the third plus 27. it's in order that's really good and so the first thing we do with the cartridge rule of science is we count the sign changes the way that it is and that will represent a list of positive x-intercepts you go wait wait a minute uh that's a positive that's a positive that's a positive there are no positive x-intercepts what that means is that we have sorry no sign changes that means we have zero positive x intercepts none this graph guaranteed will not intersect the positive half of the x-axis then what we do is we we evaluate h of negative x essentially that leaves your even power terms and your constant terms alone it changes your odd power terms due to the reasons we already talked about so i keep my positive 3x to the sixth that's an even power term i change my 82x to the third i change the sign because that's an odd power term so even doesn't change odd does change constant was plus 27 i'll leave it constants do not change and so we now check our sign changes again uh positive to negative that's one sign change negative to positive that's two sign changes now what's it mean i hope you were listening to the whole video i gave you a lot of explanation about why this stuff works how it works i don't just want you to be able to do it i want you to understand it once you understand the interplay between irreducible quadratics the degree and why we subtract two i want you to get that so two side changes means we will have either two or subtract two from that number until you get down to one or zero so two minus two is zero two or zero negative x intercepts now if you remember back to the previous video we evaluated negative three negative three was an x-intercept remember that negative 3 if you don't maybe go back and look at your notes look at the last video negative 3 worked we we factored out x plus 3 remember at negative 3 would give us x plus 3 as a factor or synthetic division we used that negative three and we got another another polynomial it was a power five it was a degree five polynomial that we got out of that we know for sure that odd poly polynomials have to cross don't they they have to somewhere at least once so let's wrap this whole thing up this last thing i'm going to talk about that's a degree 6. it potentially has 6 x intercepts that's the most it could have does it have six of them well no this has zero positive this has two or zero negative so the most it could have is two now what did we learn in the last video we learned that negative 3 is an x-intercept here so wait a second we found an x-intercept that was negative so it's not zero therefore it has to have two exactly two did you get that if we found one negative three then it can't be that one it's got to be this one there will have to be another x-intercept um on this besides the negative three and we we kind of sort of knew that because we ended with a degree five polynomial if you factor out x plus three from here maybe try this on your own synthetic division or something then you're going to get an x to the fifth uh 3x to the fifth something something something something well that is still odd that means it would have another x-intercept and so that bears this out no positives we found one negative x-intercept negative three we know there's another the degree five says that but after we find it we're going to be done why because there's no positives and there was at most two negatives maybe listen to that that last explanation this a couple times until the interplay between degree most number of x-intercepts zero positives and zero or two negatives and what we found makes sense we found negative three that's a negative x-intercept that means you can't have zero you have to have two we also if you divide it out we get x to the fifth power what that means is that we would have at least one more x-intercept because that's an odd it has to cross and then that would say yeah that's your other one but after that you're done there's no zeros and there are no more negatives than the two that you would find that's how the cultural sign is going to work for us um you we're going to use this a lot as we go go forward into the next video every every example that i do i'm going to reference this so you're going to start seeing it as we as we uh work it out as we actually do the long division or synthetic division so i hope it makes sense uh maybe watch the last section a couple times until you really get that to click if it hasn't already if it has awesome and i will see you for the next video
