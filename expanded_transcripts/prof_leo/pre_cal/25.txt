Transcript for: Applications of Quadratic Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 26)
hey welcome to another video so i always hated it when i learned something and never learned what you would ever ever use it for um so now i gotta tell you with quadratics there's not a there's a lot we can do but not a lot of really really really neat stuff you like differential equations really really cool stuff and higher math and that though and calculus but we can i can give you a couple examples show you how this would be used or some very basic things to say this is actually useful so we're going to go through three very quick sort of quick examples on when you can use the idea of parabolas to solve some equations one business one area real life example there and then one like projectile motion so here's the main thing that you need to understand though this is it if i asked you what the maximum value of a downward opening parabola where that would be located you would hopefully understand that a maximum value of a downward opening parabola would be located at its vertex and the minimum value of an upward opening parabola would again be located at its vertex so what a vertex does if you ever asked to find the maximum height of a downward opening parabola use the vertex formula if you're ever asked to find the minimum height of an upward opening parabola use the vertex formula of course we really can't find the maximum height of an upward opening that's infinity or the minimum height of a downward opening that's also infinity but the vertex will give us the minimum for upward or the maximum for a downward opening parabola we're going to use that like three times in these examples so let's take a look at at the first one uh we're gonna talk about business for a little bit so let's say that you have this business and you've done some some product research and looked at your economics and determined that well revenue is pretty easy but revenue is determined by how many items you sell times the price of each item so if my price is ten dollars it never changes and i sell 20 items 10 times 20. i'm going to have 200 in revenue this is not talking about cost so we're not doing profit it's very basic revenue is this idea of if i have x items x times the price of each item is going to give you what's called revenue how much money i'm bringing in let's imagine that your price changes the more items that you put out there now now this is oftentimes true if we flood the market with stuff that we're making the price is going to decrease because we have to lower the price to sell it depending on supply and demand so let's say that the price for our items is negative one-third x plus 100. so for every item we sell this is what you see it oh man you see the date or slope like this is a downward sloping linear price decrease so every item we sell lowers the price of the items just a little bit and i go that's that's crazy uh why would we why would that why would we ever sell stuff the price decreases you're still making money here so you're still making stuff but you're lowering the price it's kind of the idea would you want to make a product that's super expensive and sell a few of them or make a product that's super cheap and sell a ton of them there's a trade off there right we we might not want to make this super expensive product that we can only sell one of because what if you don't sell it or or you know you've cost a lot of research and development you might not recuperate all that or we might not want to make it items so cheap that we sell a billion of them but then maybe we're not making anything because we're spending all our money making our products so anyway there's a trade-off there so let's say that for our price every single item that we put out in production causes the price to have to decrease what we're going to try to do here we're going to try to find out the maximum revenue so let's put these pieces together if revenue is x times the price and we have a price of negative one-third x plus 100 hopefully you see that i can do a very simple substitution and say hey revenue then if i want to find my revenue i just need to multiply the number of items i'm selling times the price of each item number of items i'm selling times the price of our item that gives us a very nice look at a revenue function now what would we do let's see what we're trying to do number one what i want to understand is is what this looks like so let's distribute it let's see what it looks like oh there it is so our revenue is negative 1 3 x squared plus 100 x in your head right now you think this is a downward opening parabola would i be able to find the minimum value no no the minimum value is going to be practically zero you wouldn't continue to make items and go into debt just making item actually businesses do that all the time but we would want to do that so there's no finding the minimum value of this downward opening problem but you could certainly find a maximum we really wouldn't want to minimize our revenue we want to maximize our revenue that's possible here's what this says as i keep creating values what's going to happen my revenue is going to climb it's going to peak it's going to fall again that's what's going to happen because my price is decreasing as i'm increasing the product but i'm selling more products so i'm getting money from that eventually there's going to be this peak that's the idea of using parabolas to find a maximum or a minimum so we have that now one thing you might be asked is what's the domain like what do we what would the domain be well we would want our revenue to be positive and so we'd find two x values to keep our revenue positive we would want this is going to go back to the last section our domain is we want our revenue we want that to be above zero we'd want to at least break even by doing this but that would be that negative one third x squared plus 100x would be greater than or equal to zero okay well how would we solve that the same exact thing about quadratic inequalities on the last video we'd say well that's a downward opening parabola we're trying to figure out where it is above the x-axis that's what we're looking for if we're able to find our x-intercepts then we can determine between what two x-values our revenue will be positive so we can do a couple things we can do something like let's um let's multiply everything by negative three we could do that we could factor out the negative and then not have to change the inequality by keeping the negative there just find our exit the x values we can do that too it doesn't really matter i'm going to divide out the negative but i'm going to multiply everything by positive 3 as well to make our fat i'm going to factor out negative x actually so negative x and take a 1 3 x plus 100 that's probably the easiest way to go if i take a look at this the zero product property says that one of my x-intercepts i just think of this as negative x one-third x plus 100 is equal to zero i know that the x-intercepts where this parabola would actually cross x-axis i want to find that and determine where i'm above or below it x would equal zero and one-third x plus 100 would equal zero if i subtract 100 oops gotta fix that that would be bad if i didn't mention it the first time check your signs so i made a mistake here i've factored out the negative it happens all the time i factor out negative x because we have a gcf i screwed this up so factor out negative x i've got a positive one third then i have a minus one hundred so i keep that i use zero product property zero would be set equal to x or x equals zero one third x minus 100 sets equal to 0. if i add 100 multiply both sides by 3 between these two x values 0 and 300 is where my revenue would be positive we do not want to produce less than zero items that's impossible anyway we don't want to produce more than 300 because according to our price our price would start getting so our price would end up price times uh times our amount that we sell would end up being negative we don't want to start losing money on this and so our domain would be 0 to 300. if you produce zero items well then zero times i don't care what the price is you're not going to make anything your revenue is gonna be zero if we produce 300 your revenue is also going to be zero i hope that makes sense we have this downward opening parabola we said where is our revenue going to be positive that's what our domain needs to be we don't want to be losing money here so because that is a quadratic that's downward opening we can determine where we are above the x-axis this goes right back to the last section i hope that you're seeing it i did a little different this time and factor the negative x in correctly the first time fixing my sign and then saying hey we would cross the x-axis at zero and at 300 and we're looking for where this downward opening parabola is above zero that's between these two numbers that's our domain for this this problem could you do something like find out how much revenue you would make if you sold 100 items that means that we'd go up here and just plug in 100 so if we did this if we figured out the revenue for 100 items we would just plug this in and figure out what that would be what i got out of it was six thousand six hundred six dollars and 67 cents hopefully i did my math right squared 100 multiplied times negative one-third then added 100 squared so if we sold 100 items that's what we're going to be making out of it now let's move on what would our maximum revenue be that is the idea of understanding that if this is our revenue function and it's a downward opening parabola where would our maximum revenue be minimum would be zero because we cut that off at our domain if we went outside our domain would make negative money we don't want that so zero would be our minimum we don't want minimum we want to make maximum we're going to go into business and try to provide something good for the that people are going to really want well we want to make it worth our time so we want to make the matching revenue at least that's what business people want to do so how do you find the maximum for a downward opening parabola that's got to be at the vertex so we're just going to use the vertex formula so we're going to use negative b over 2a figure out that x value plug it into our revenue and that's going to give us the maximum revenue and how many items we need to sell to get that so negative b if we go back over here we look at our revenue function our revenue function is negative 1 3 x squared plus 100x even though this doesn't have a constant or a c we have an a and we have a b so for our vertex we'd have negative b all over 2 times a don't forget that's negative 1 3. you cannot change those signs not with the vertex formula so what in the world is that going to be um one thing because we're we're because we have a complex fraction here we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3 or negative 3. if we do that multiply by three over three then we get maybe negative three it doesn't matter negative or negative should be positive anyhow we're going to get 300 over two and that gives us 150 so when we take that 150 and we evaluate our revenue function at 150 this says if we sell 150 units that's what the x means how many things you're selling if we sell 150 units then we're going to get this amount of money this amount of revenue from it so take your 150 and we're going to plug that in to right here so take your 150 and put it for your r of x function that says we'd have negative 1 3 times 150 squared plus 100 times 150 that looks to me like we got about 7 500 so what that says to us according to this model if we take our amount of items we're selling times the price of each item that's called revenue we know it's a downward opening parabola we can figure out where our revenue is positive that is an inequality that's a quadratic inequality type of an issue uh find out where your x-intercepts are determine that this is saying where are we above the x-axis but where our maximum is for downward open parabola is the vertex so we find our vertex this tells us two things this says how many items we need to sell to make our maximum revenue and how much revenue we actually get now the last thing what is the price that you would need to charge to get your maximum revenue so we already know when you sell 150 items but because we have a price function we can plug in our 150 and it's gonna tell us what price we should put these at so this is our price for maximum revenue we take our negative one-third times 150 plus 100. let's see uh one-third of 150 is 50. so that'd be negative one-third times 150 is negative 50 plus 100 is 50 dollars so our price would be 50 what we determine here is that in order to get the most amount of money we'd be selling our products all 150 of them for 50 each i hope that makes sense that you understand the nature of downroving parabolas the vertex is the maximum that's it all right let's move on so i need to make a really nice garden and i have three thousand feet of fence it's gonna be a big garden here's what i want to know if if land is not limited to me which it is but if it wasn't limited to me let's imagine that i wanted to get the biggest area possible how would i do it well if we have 3 000 feet of fence for a rectangular area we need to find the maximum area here's the idea what we're going to do is we're going to call one of these sides x one of these sides y we're gonna find the formula for a perimeter now since we have three thousand feet of fence that is our perimeter like we're going to use all three thousand then we're going to find a formula for area the perimeter is going to act as our constraint we can't get above 3 000 feet of fencing or below three thousand feet of fencing and our area is the thing we're trying to maximize so this is gonna be this way we're gonna draw a picture we got it we're gonna make one of these sides x and one of these sides y because we don't they're they might not be the same here dimensions we're going to find our constraint and the function we'll try to maximize and then do a substitution so what a constraint does a constraint says what are you limited by so constraint has the idea of you're limiting something we are limited by not the area we want to find the maximum area that's not a limiting factor we're limited by the perimeter so if we can put that in a function in a formula or an equation and we'd say all right what are we limited by perimeter how much perimeter do we have three thousand feet and find a an expression that represents that perimeter so i know that three thousand feet is going to make up all four sides of my rectangle that's two x's plus two y's so i hope that makes sense that our perimeter 3000 feet is taken up by two x sides and two y sides this is called your constraint because it's what's limiting your ability to make more or less area now we can automatically do a couple things like simplify that we could divide everything by two that's totally fine but that's going to show up when we when we make our substitution well that basic question what substitution are we are we making the way that these problems these maximization and minimization problems which you're going to get a ton of in calculus is find a constraint we've got that the thing that's limiting your problem find a formula for what you're trying to maximize well what are we trying to maximize area do you know the formula for maximize for for the area of a rectangle yeah sure we know that area is x times y so we've labeled x times y we don't know if they're the same length sides we don't know how they're related we don't really care but in order to figure out an equation that has two variables you need two equations one is a limiting equation called a constraint the other one is the one you try to maximize use your constraint to substitute into the the formula or function you're trying to maximize so because the circumstance limits us we say hey our area is x times y we need to substitute for one of those variables it really doesn't matter which one we substitute for just one of them so take your constraint and solve it for a variable you want to maximize in this case we're going to be all right i'm going to solve this for y why because i like solving for y if i do that i would subtract 2x and divide everything by 2. this right there 1500 minus x equals y that is what we can replace inside the function i'm trying to maximize so instead of a equals x times y i'd say a equals x times y but y equals 1500 minus x if we distribute and write this appropriately like in order we get sort of the same exact look as what we got in our revenue problem we have this downward opening parabola that represents our area all we're trying to do is find the maximum so if you think about this what where does the maximum happen on a downward opening parabola it's got to happen at the vertex all we're going to do is find the vertex we're not going to worry about the domain here the domain would kind of be a natural domain of you got to be greater than zero you can't have a side length of a fence that's negative so it's kind of an obvious statement but what we're going to do is and we can't have an area that's negative so it'll limit us but anyway we have this demo open parabola we're going to find our vertex that'll give us our maximum area so let's let's do that based on the fact that we have this negative x squared plus 1500 x our a is negative one and our b is 1500 our c is 0 but that doesn't matter for a vertex so negative 1500 divided by 2 times eight two times negative one that looks like seven hundred fifty to be so fifteen hundred divided by two seven fifty the negative is simplifying to a positive one and now the actual area we're going to be more space than that the actual area what that says is that your x your x is going to be this side length is going to be 750 looks like feet long well according to our area function we can plug in 750 it will tell you what the maximum area is so take your 750 and evaluate a of 750. make sure that when you do this you plug in 750 you square that first and then you change its sign the the there's no parentheses around that negative so 750 gets squared and then made negative and then you're going to add 1500 times 750. and it looks like we get 562 500 square feet so with a dimension of our x side being 750 we're going to get this as our maximum area this is our x because that's the variable that we had this this area in terms of this is our max area now you're probably going to be asked to find the y as well just take your look at your constraint your constraint should be solved for the variable you are missing so hopefully it's not surprised to you that the area that's the greatest type of a rectangle is a square a square develops the greatest area for its perimeter so 750 subtracted from 1500 is going to also give you 750. so our dimensions are 750 feet by 750 feet and sure enough if you take 750 times 750 you get that right there so that's the way we'd find the maximum area for some sort of a measurement like this one thing that people often will do here to make it a little bit more interesting is imagine you only have three sides you need a fence because you have like a river here well the same exact thing would happen it's just your constraint would change if you had a river on one side where you didn't need fencing then you would just have two x's but only one y it's actually easier to solve subtract your 2x make your substitution do your distribution and then you'd find your version actually the vertex formula that's about it just remember that that's going to be an x measurement and your maximization this is your max area you are finding the vertex of your your area function that gives you a dimension of one side and the actual area if you plug it into your function okay in our last example i'm not going to do much with it i just want you to take a look at this it's going to be pretty nasty but that would be the projectile the the height of a projectile h is our height for some sort of projectile starting with at 45 degrees with a 2 000 foot per second launch so if we wanted to find out a couple things about it i'm just going to talk you through this if you want to figure out how far it goes so this is the according to how far it is away from where you launch it the height according how far you wait where you launch it if you want to figure out how far it goes what it's uh let's say effective range is what it's ranges we'd set this function equal to zero so set this equal to zero you want to figure out when it hits the ground right so when it hits the ground is the distance of its trajectory so if you set this equal to zero and solve that's a quadratic you can do quadratic formula you can factor a whole bunch of things to do there but anyhow that's how we figure out how far this would go set the height equals zero so function equals zero and solve for x if you want to figure out its maximum height well then we would say find your vertex if you want to figure out the maximum height this projectile reaches then you would have your a is this nasty thing and your b is one so on your vertex formula you would have negative one that's negative b over two times negative thirty-two over two thousand squared that is what your vertex would look like as far as your x-coordinate and then you would figure that out and plug it into your function to figure out your height and your height would be right there i just want to talk through that because that's that's a somewhat common problem for for people to encounter much more common as an area or like a business type of problem so i hope that makes sense i hope you understand the nature of minimums and maximums on using your vertices for parabolas i hope i've gained some interesting examples for you and i'll see you for the next video
