Transcript for: Average Rate of Change of a Function (Precalculus - College Algebra 11)
hey welcome to another video in this video we're gonna discuss and you'll learn about the average rate of change of a function and if you learn why it's important a lot of times we just kind of teach a you know what's that for well if you don't teach calculus you know calculus that's not going to make a whole lot of sense on how that's why that's used so we're gonna talk about average rate of change we'll talk about why we do what we do and what it's trying to get you to learn so what the average rate of change looks for is basically cuz I hate suspense in math you shouldn't have it you should know what you're gonna be learning you're gonna learn that average rate of change it's just a slope between two points on curve what they call that a lot of times is called the secant even though we're not really used to a secant being two points in the curve kind of a circle ideas more what's it's it's used from but we call this anyway it says this this suppose that you have this curve this this function of X looks like the black curve here and you want to find the slope of that curve well well roll would you find the slope of a curve can't can't you bad racket and so you go yeah yeah you can't you can't really do it so can you find the slope between two two points on that curve yes okay so if a slope is a rate of change and I can't really find it at a point on this curve well we can find the average rate of change but fine so between two points in that curve so we say all right well here's a point here's a point and I would find the slope of that line that's connecting that we call that a secant line then the slope of that line would be the average slope of the curve between those two points that's the idea and somewhere is pretty cool but somewhere between this point and that point the slope of the curve will actually equal the slope of that that secant line now why why would you learn it well the main question there was hey can I find the slope of a curve at a point and the answer is yes you can using calculus and so what this idea is is man if I can find the slope of this line and I really I'm looking for the slope of this curve at that one point does this slope of the line represent the slope of what we call the tangent line does it represent it yes this is represented well no because this is much steeper than that so this slope of the secant line would be much deeper than the so glow tangent line can I make it better answer is maybe what if I start moving this B value closer to this a value well then this point would be closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and closer closer and closer and notice mathematically I can make it as close as I want without actually touching that a value and the one of the theorems of calculus are our derivative is that when we make that close that points so close as to be negligibly different then the slope of that secant line that we're getting is actually by definition of slope of the tangent line that we're trying to find and so that's what we're stemming from in this it all starts with your idea of can you find the slope between these two points and find an average rate of change yes and then later on we'll be making this closer closer to find an instantaneous rate of change and not an average so the slope of a curve at a point slope of the tangent line to that curve at a point so then I'm trying to change in long story maybe little short it's really just the slope between two points I want to prove that to you right now so if I'm trying to find the slope of this original secant line and I say well here's a point it has an X value an input of a well it will have an output of F of a yeah sure because the point here would be X comma Y and we're so used to doing our notation now that we understand that that's just input/output well but this is also just an X comma Y and input an output but wait a second wait a second what what this formula does it says you have an output - an output over an input - an input and this is one point and this is one point so so this is this is an x value and it's corresponding Y value this is a different x value and it's corresponding differ why value and if you look it like that you say this is so wait a minute FOP this is an output - okay f of a another output over the input that relates to that output - input that relates to the other output the average rate of change just gives you a slope formula it's just a different way we look at it output - output over input - input one point another point y2 - y1 up that's subtracted over x2 - x1 input subtracted it's just the slope so the the reason why we have the term average rate of change - slope is that because when we're looking at this particular situation we're saying I can't find the slope of a curve we're gonna do that in calculus but I'm just kind of finding out what is the rate of change between these two points on the curve in average and that's why they call it average rate of change and not just slope but essentially you're just finding the slope of a secant line and so the slope formula is practically the same now how we how we do it well this is just the slope formula and we're just subtracting the Y values and X values we can find the average rate of change of any function if we have two inputs so so what's the idea the idea is if I want to find average change that's a curve yeah it's a parabola much like this one is but if I want to find the average rate of change between two x-values let's find the points first and let's just do the slope formula that's the same thing well wait a minute how do I find points and we spent a long time doing that so if I have a point where my x value is three and a point where my x value is five can you find the Y values yeah sure we just plug them into the function the function gives us outputs for any input so if this is my output for an input of three would be let's plug in three if I plug in three I'm going to get three square that's 9 minus 6 is 3 if I plug in five so we're just finding F of 3 we're finding F of 5 notice how this kind of makes this formula nice for us F of 3 is the output value and the final output and three and five over input value so we're gonna be putting output a five output of three and then five and three it's gonna be the same thing it just looks it's slope formula so we plug in five to our function to find the output for that course one input let's see 25 minus 10 is 15 those are the two points you gotta see it these are two points on that curve we plug in three to find out what we plug in five define output and now we're going to find the slope between those two points of a secant line that's connecting them that is an average of change of that prevalence saying this is the way the function is changing slope wise on average so our average change is really just slope how I do slope is the same every single time I make up my slope formula I know the slope formula subtracts outputs and then subtracts inputs I know that this has to stem from one point and so does this so when I do this slope formula I just find one point like five comma 15 I make sure I put five comma 15 outputs on top I put three comma three outputs on top so here's my one point five fifteen there's one other point 3 comma three my outputs are on top on my numerator so that gives us the slope form and very easily let's make sure this works so is this f of five is this f of be our F of whatever the outlet input is is this F of five yeah that's that's our F of five this right here is f of three that's the output value from that point and then we have over five minus three so it does work just the slope so ever average rate of change here 15 minus three gives us 12 5 minus 3 is 2 that gives us an average rate of change or slope of 6 that's the slope between these two points that's a slope of two points that are on that graph which is averaging the rate of change between those two points for that particular function that's that's about all there really is to it if you wanted to find the equation of the secant line this right here would act as your M and you choose one point that they give you like three comma three and we can say okay Y minus y1 equals M X minus x1 it's just the equation of a line and since that we're talking about a secant line here we'd use this slope with one of those points so Y minus let's say three because that seems like a smaller so I values equals six and then X minus three thanks buddies and why these are the same there so Y minus three would give us 6x minus 18 and let's just add three so Y would equal 6x minus 15 so if you were to graph this and you were to graph this that line is going to intersect that graph at exactly those points and the slope of that line is six which would be the average rate of change of that graph that's what a majority change means I hope I explained it well enough that it's just a slope of a secant line that's touching the graph of two points and it's averaging the rate of change of that function it just it's it's just the soak formula kind of made fancy so hope that makes sense hopefully you understand why we're learning it so that eventually we get down to to a calculus idea when you when we get there so hope you're with me every day you
