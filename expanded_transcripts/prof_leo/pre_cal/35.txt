Transcript for: Creating Polynomials from Complex Solutions (Precalculus - College Algebra 36)
hi welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about how to create some polynomial functions if we know a couple complex zeros that sounds really familiar because we've done this before with real zeros we said well wait a minute if we know that an x-intercept is say like x equals four and we can say x minus four equals zero and x minus four would be this factor of a polynomial that we're creating and we're going to do something very very similar but now with complex zeros here's the main thing that you want to learn in this video is that if you have one complex zero or complex solution then you automatically have another by this this theorem that says that complex solutions always come in conjugate pairs and so if you have one you have two if we have two what we can do is create two factors and when we multiply those factors so distribute we're going to get what's called an irreducible quadratic factor and that's part of this function that we're going to build so we're going to discuss that we're going to see what it is one of the the main things i want to teach you in this video is how to multiply uh factors linear factors that have complex values in them an easy way because that's probably one of the main things that students get confused on is how in the world you do that so i'm going to teach you how to do that because we use that in the next few videos so let's get right into it let's talk about what degree means again let's talk about if we have one complex we have another one create some factors like we did before and then i'll show you how far i would like you to distribute and then if you have to distribute all the way i'll show you how to do that as well so let's go right into it if we have a degree 4 polynomial what that means is that we are going to have four linear factors across the complex number system so polynomials can always be factored into linears and irreducible quadratics across the real number system but if we go into complex numbers like we have right there we're going to have four factors now some of those factors might be repeated so that's like a multiplicity idea but in general for every degree we have that many factors and that many solutions in complex numbers not necessarily all real real numbers we have at most four real solutions but we have exactly four solutions of our complex so what we're going to do here is we're going to find four factors and some of that's going to be wrapped up in a multiplicity the second thing we're going to hopefully understand is that if we have one complex solution we also have another one that's sort of hidden but they always come in complex conjugate pairs so 3 minus 2i that's great that's one solution for us it's giving us that this has 0 is a 3 plus 2i and 4 with a multiplicity 2. we could build a couple factors from that if we have 3 plus 2y we can get an additional factor by understanding that 3 minus 2i the complex conjugate also has to be a solution that was due to this the quadratic formula working on an irreducible quadratic here's what the whole thing is if you can factor a polynomial into linears and irreducible quadratics over reals then that irreducible quadratic is only unfactorable because it has complex numbers in it and that plus and minus gives us a conjugate pair for complex solutions that was in the last video that we talked about so if we have 3 plus 2y we have 3 minus 2i also basically by the quadratic formula and so here's what we're going to do number one we're going to match up and make sure that we have four solutions for degree four we have one we have two we have three but this says you basically have four twice as a solution that's where the multiplicity comes in then what we do is we start building our factors please please don't skip what i'm about to do it's very common for even teachers to say hey just go straight to your factors or do you like x minus four easy just switch to sign don't do that and the only reason why not is because what i want you to do with your complex solutions is very specific and it will i promise help you and it's much easier to understand if i have you start the way i'm about to show you so here's what i want you to do i want you to make each of these solutions an actual solution for instance i want us to say hey x is going to equal 3 plus 2y and x is going to equal 3 minus 2i and x is going to equal 4. start that way list out all of your solutions because by adding or subtracting respective of what signs we have we're going to get factors set equal to 0. it's going to make a lot more sense that we can use a zero product property or reverse to create factors of some polynomial also what i'm about to do especially with our complex solutions here is to build them in a certain way that makes distribution easier otherwise you have three terms and you have to foil oil it it's really annoying so i'm going to do this so that it's structured easier and if you go straight to your factors you're going to have a sign error at least i see that like 95 percent of the times i teach this and i go straight to the factors students mess up a sign and does not work out well so we're going to say hey degree 4 we have four solutions well one of them's repeated do that multiplicity 2. so really we have three solutions one of them just repeated all right list them out x equals 3 plus 2i x equals 3 minus 1 because complex always come in conjugate pairs we have x equals 4 and now we're going to build our factors so let's start with the real uh the real solution here if i subtract for x minus 4 equals 0 that's fine and here's what that says and i'll start building my function right now what that says is that if i have x minus 4 equal to 0 then x minus 4 is going to be a factor of some polynomial with an x-intercept of 4. it's going to be a factor for us and if this looks familiar it should because we've done this before but we had all real solutions now a couple things i want to say this is where your multiplicity comes in so if x minus 4 is a factor and it says well check out what your multiplicity is x equals 4 was a solution sure it was a zero sure but it had a multiplicity too what that really means is that x kind of equaled four twice you know what's what's that mean that means that really we're not showing it but you would have this other factor x minus four and you have x minus 4 and x minus 4. you would have a repetition of that solution well we all know that if i combine that i would get x minus 4 squared and that's really how we use our multiplicity you don't have to show this this is this is uh redundant because multiplicity wraps up this idea and says uh yeah you're repeating that factor twice so we would have x minus four two times and that multiplicity stands for the power of the factor from where you get your solutions that's what that is and so when we really go okay here's uh here's x equals four cool here's x minus four equals zero okay by the zero product property sort of in reverse i know that's a factor of some polynomial where four is an x-intercept and it's told me that's a multiplicity 2. that stands for two x-intercepts that stands for two of our degrees so we need to we need to have this kind of add up to four as far as our our degree the last thing we've seen this already i'm not giving you a point here um i wouldn't say there's no point but there's a point to this which means that you can't say that this is the only polynomial that's that's creatable with these solutions and so we put an a out there even if i had given you a point you'd still put the a because we'd use that point to solve for a later and i'll talk about that when we get there so we go okay real solution we've done this before x equals 4 cool we have this factor of x minus 4 multiplicity 2 says you've got power 2 on it and this could stand for a lot of different functions that have these x-intercepts but we don't have a point so we can't really solve for a even right now now the complex this is where it gets i'm going to get this more complex it gets a little more complicated so we're gonna solve this for zero just like we did right here we're gonna subtract three we're gonna subtract 2i i want you to do it that way i don't really wanna see x minus three plus 2i in parenthesis that is what you would have if you went straight to your factors you'd say all right this is x minus 3 plus 2i and you might have seen that you might have topped that before but in order to distribute well you actually have to redistribute the sign and then regroup x minus three it's a little more difficult to do than what i'm gonna show you so solve for zero subtract three subtract two i so we get x minus 3 minus 2i equals 0. now this right here is a factor just like x minus 4 was a factor but we're going to think of it a little different here's how i want you to think of it i want you to think of it as x minus 3 is one factor and so we're going to group that notice that when we group the first two terms we're not affecting this sign there's no redistribution of a sign or anything we just want to think of this as x minus 3 minus 2i here's why so you get there when when or you understand when we get there we're sort of treating this like two terms because we know that distribution with two terms is a lot easier than distribution with three terms and three terms so two and two is easier than three and three also our first two terms are going to be the same here why because with complex conjugate pairs your first number is always the same 3 and 3. the second one has the change of sign so if we group the first two terms we're basically going to get x minus 3 times x minus three and we know how to do x minus three squared it's not that hard but that's why we're thinking of grouping them and that doesn't really show up very well if you try to distribute three terms on three terms or if you go straight to your factors which is why i'm teaching you this let's do the next one we're still going to solve this for 0. so x minus 3 plus 2i so we're setting that equal to 0. and again likewise we're going to group the first two terms this is the factor that i want you to have in your polynomial so long story made sure if you have a degree 4 you're going to have to have 4 factors now some of those might have a different multiplicity which counts this counts as two factors so we have one two three four and since these are all set equal to zero we can use that zero product property say hey this would be some polynomial with these three factors set equal to zero based on the fact that you have those three solutions i can't say x-intercepts anymore i can say zeros but i can't say x-intercepts anymore and the reason why is because that is an x-intercept these ones are not that's a that's an x-intercept that bounce if you remember at x equals 4 we balance either this way or that way because we don't have an a there's no really way to know but that is an x-intercept these are not x-intercepts they're zeros they're complex solutions so we're going to say hey there's one factor in multiple c2 and we have two more factors so we're going to write with some brackets here's the first one x minus 3 minus 2i and x minus 3 plus 2i these are all the factors that we have based on our degree so we have x minus four here's one two here's three here's four factors it's a degree four and that always matches up there's four solutions uh one's just repeated so here's four and we would have repeated that twice i showed that already here's another one here's number four now we gotta distribute i'm gonna give you the minimum distribution and sort of the maximum distribution of what you would do here the minimum distribution is you have to at least distribute your complex factors you've got to get it into linears and irreducible quadratics well we don't have that we have basically a repeated linear and we have two sort of linear factors of complex numbers in them because we have a degree one we have degree one so we lose some of that terminology but that's basically what we have this is not acceptable to leave for like anybody even me who's sort of loose on uh distribute that whole thing because i wanna punish you it is punishing if you have to distribute like with a degree seven or something that can get pretty nuts um so at least distribute the complex factors and that's really what i'm giving you these for is because in the next few videos you have to know how to do that in order to find all the solutions if i'm giving you a complex solution so you have to know how to do that so let's practice it this is the whole reason why i want you to write this solve it for zero entry this is your factor with the first two terms grouped the reason why is because you're going to start here when you distribute not here start with your complex that's the the least you need to do right so start with the least you need to do and when you distribute it we're going to treat this like two terms and two terms so when we distribute because we've grouped those first two terms in each factor we're going to think of this as x minus 3 times x minus 3 but what is that really well that's x minus 3 squared now notice what else happens because we group this sort of intelligently because we grouped it instead of three terms and three terms you you have this sort of difference of squares idea do you see it like you have the same you basically have conjugates you have the same first two terms x minus three that's we're treating that as a term and then minus two i and plus 2i what's going to happen when you distribute well i'm going to show it one time but i'm never going to show it again if you were to continue to distribute you would get x minus 3 times positive 2i and you would get x negative 2i or minus 2i times x minus 3. even though they look weird remember that those would be your middle terms and they're going to cancel every single time that's the second reason why i want you to write it this way is because you create for yourself and this will always happen with conjugate pairs you get sort of this difference of squares or conjugate factors where your first two terms are the same uh in both cases you have a different sign and your last term is the same and so when you distribute your middle terms will always cancel out and that's that's nice so setting up this way is really convenient we have x minus 3 times x minus three oh okay x minus three squared plus and minus the same thing we really never show that and then lastly we just need to distribute the last two and be careful with it this will be minus 2 times 2 is 4 i times i is i squared you need to know how to multiply this complex so i times that would be an intermediate algebra class but i times that would give us i squared what we need to understand about i is that the square root of negative 1 gives us i and because of that i squared is always negative 1 so whenever you see i squared you go oh that's negative 1. essentially what's that do so if i squared is negative 1 it doesn't really change the value of 4 multiplying 4 times 1 is going to give us 4. but because i squared is negative 1 it's always going to change this sign to a plus so here's some truths about complex numbers think about these maybe write these down number one complex solutions always come in pairs for polynomials always because they're always from irreducible quadratics and they're always by the quadratic formula going to give you plus and minus the same thing so same thing plus and minus the same thing well that always creates for us these sort of conjugate factors which means two things for us number one when you just maybe three things when you distribute your middle terms are always going to cancel that's great it also means you're always going to get a minus here no matter what no matter what because you'd have a conjugate idea minus and plus when you multiply that's going to give you a minus every time different signs give you minus you multiply you're also always going to get an i squared so if this is always a minus and that's always going to be i squared the i squared is negative 1 it's going to essentially just change that sign so you should always end up with some sort of a linear factor that you have to square so you're gonna do x minus three times x minus three that's uh x squared minus six x plus nine but you're always going to end up with plus some constant if i squared is really negative 1 then this would really be negative 4 and subtracting negative 4 would give you plus 4. those are some facts about those uh those complex complex solutions i always give you this idea middle terms are going to cancel you get minus something with an i squared the i squared is negative one it'll change that sign to a plus every time check that check for that so uh this is really what we want to distribute now so off to the side maybe we do x minus three times x minus three you can do this in your head what you can't do is you can't go oh yeah uh x squared plus nine or x squared minus sign that doesn't work what we get is this x squared minus six x plus nine and don't forget that we have this plus four that plus four is this tacked on thing because this is still in this sort of factor like this is what we're creating we're creating an irreducible quadratic factor and that's it so we end up getting x squared minus 6x plus 13. and that actually is an irreducible quadratic if you try to factor that you can't do it quadratic formula is going to give you oh wait a minute uh complex so basically we're going up we're going opposite of that so the last thing that we need to do as far as the minimum work here would be to bring down our linear factors that came from our reals even if they're repeated so like x minus four multiplicity two bring down our a because we really don't know uh what that is and then that's that's good enough for me that's fine now some of your teachers or instructors or maybe you you want to distribute this a little bit more so what you would do here and this is the only time i'm going to show you this but what you would do here is you would distribute this x minus 4 times x minus 4. very similar to what we did over here you'd get x squared minus 8x plus 16. and then you'd spend the time to distribute three terms onto three terms notice if you don't use my technique that's exactly what you'd have to do up here if you didn't group those and that's that's a pain in the rear see lots of stuff flipping around lots of sign errors happen lots of little mistakes happen so hopefully you agree with the distribution complex numbers when i'm doing it it's easiest way i've ever come up with to do that then you distribute this what i'm going to do is just give you the final final answer what you would get for your polynomial so some math magic happens and you get you get that after you distribute so we take this term times all of these and then this term times all of those and then this term times all of those and combine like terms and that's what you would end up with so what do you do with a number one don't distribute a not right now at least what you would do is if you're not given another point you're done this this is a polynomial that would have the this would be a degree four degree four this would be a degree four polynomial that would have these zeros and that's a the only real zero with a multiplicity two this is it if you had to refactor it you have to go through all this work again so don't do that so if you don't have a point you're done here if you get a point so if someone gives you a point like hey i'm going to make this up this is not a point for us you would say if we had one point that's not on the x axis so you can't use something we already have let's say it's like one comma negative three if it was 1 comma negative 3 what'd you do here you plug in 1 for your x's you'd plug in negative 3 for your y or your f of x you'd simplify this divide and a would equal whatever you have so x goes for x y goes for y or f of x and then you solve for a once you have that number then you can rewrite it with a whatever the a happens to be then you could distribute that a through it even if it's a fraction it can be very nasty but that's something that you could do i hope that makes sense i'm going to leave it here this is the basically for a polynomial here if you had a point you'd have to go through and do that you could leave it here and do the same thing like put in one here here and here simplify put negative 3 here and divide you can still figure out your a from that part so that's fine as well this would be the very minimum of what you'd want to do this is factored into linears and irreducible quadratics with an a in front you could if you had a point you could plug it in here even and still suffer a by the technique i just showed you if you have to distribute this is it so you want to go all the way down to that okay let's move on to the next one we're going to go a bit quicker on these because i've already sort of given you the whole idea so we have two more examples this one and then a degree five on work through with a different multiplicity so we see a degree four and what that means is a few things number one we would we will need to have four factors some of which will have some complex numbers and we need four solutions so they've only given us two well what that means is that we're going to find the other two and build some factors from that so when we look at them and go hey they're both complex we know that complex numbers our complex solutions come in conjugate pairs so let's work on that if they give you 1 plus 2i then 1 minus 2i also has to be a solution by the quadratic formula if they give you positive i the negative i also has to be a solution remember that positive i really is 0 plus i there's no real part here there's just an imaginary part the conjugate would be 0 minus i or just negative i because you wouldn't have to write 0 for the real part now as i mentioned before we really really need to write out those those solutions as x equals that so that we can get an appropriate factor much like we've done over here it just makes it a lot easier to see otherwise you have to sort of manipulate signs we all know sign errors are real kind of a bugger uh for us so we want to do it this way to make sure our factors are just perfect so we're going to write out that x has to equal i and negative i x has to equal 1 plus 2i and minus 2i so that represents our four zeros we have i negative i 1 plus 2i and 1 minus 2y so i'm just checking my work i'm going to make sure that i have 1 2 3 4. it's a degree 4 there's no multiplicity at least not with these complex solutions so we're we're good then what we're going to do is we're going to set all of these equal to 0 and that's going to give us our factors so subtract i add i subtract 1 and subtract 2i so x minus 1 minus 2i equals 0. subtract 1 but add 2i and x minus 1 plus 2y equals 0. then what we're going to do is these look pretty good if you notice because there's no real part this is going to be a little easier to distribute there's really only two terms and two terms you don't have to group anything we grouped over here because we had a real part that was the same so three and three we grouped it with x minus three so that we could get x minus three squared when we distribute that was really nice because we don't have that real part that's not really an issue for us so we're gonna have two factors x minus i and x plus i because both those factors equal 0 by the zero product property we know those are two factors of a polynomial that has those things as solutions i can't say x intercepts because those aren't x intercepts but they are solutions now for our other complex solutions we're going to create some factors by just grouping the x with the real part and like we did before what that does for us because the real part's always the same in the complex conjugate pair that is going to create an x minus 1 squared when we distribute we treat this like one term and distribution so we have two terms two terms we're going to treat this like two terms and two terms so let's go ahead let's write out our polynomial we are going to give us an a because again it's not giving us a specific polynomial it's saying find me a polynomial that has these solutions you're all right well all i have to work with is factors i really don't have a point to work with but because i have all these factors set equal to zero i know that i can create this polynomial that's going to have those solutions by just using those factors if it's a degree four you should have four factors that includes some multiplicity but you should have four factors so this was each of these factors that equals zero i could have created a polynomial equal to zero by the zero product property or just gone straight to my function said this is a function that would have these solutions because by the zero product property i get all those factors equal to zero there's one two three four of them for a degree four it's looking really good all we have to do now is go through the same process and distribute our linears that have complex numbers in them these are these conjugate pairs so we're going to distribute that we're going to leave it there if you need to go further you'd have to keep distributing so i'm going to start with this over here i always like to attack the the hardest looking ones first so i'm going to distribute and think of these as two terms times two terms we notice it basically is a conjugate right here if you think of this as one term this is same thing same thing with a different sign between them that creates like this difference of squares idea for us where we're going to get first term times first term x minus 1 squared if you went ahead and distributed you'd get plus and minus the same exact thing they're gonna sim they're gonna simplify what they're gonna cancel out i don't even write them what we do have to realize is that because these act like conjugates you're always gonna get a minus some imaginary number squared so you're gonna get negative 2i times positive 2i well well that's minus 2 times 2 is 4 but i times i is not just i you're going to get i squared and we walked through this before where what that i squared is that i squared is negative 1. so 4 times negative 1 is negative 4. subtracting negative 4 is really just adding four it's exactly like this even down to the number so that's plus four if we do that x minus one you could do in your head just don't give me x squared plus one or x squared minus one remember that this is x minus one times x minus one so that's going to be x squared minus 2x plus 1 and then we also have the plus 4. let's not forget about that that needs to be added to that constant so we've distributed this it was this piece but then remember we have the plus 4. and that right there is an irreducible quadratic over the real number system that's the irreducible quadratic for our factored polynomial all of this would be in some sort of factor and then we're going to do the same thing here it's just be a little bit easier because we don't have this distribution of these two terms squared so when we distribute this you can really see this as a conjugate if we distribute we're going to get x squared but we get plus ix minus ix well when you add those together they cancel out so we don't write them that is a conjugate the middle terms are gone and then minus i squared notice negative i times positive i is negative so we write minus i squared but what is i squared well i squared is negative one uh so this would be x squared minus negative one that's what i is it looks like this sounds weird that is that's what i is so you're really subtracting negative one the same exact idea over here this is not a really awkward thing this is saying what you're really doing is subtracting four times negative one that's what we're doing here we're subtracting or subtracting negative 4 that's what we're doing here so we're subtracting negative 1. and that creates this other factor it's also an irreducible quadratic it has to be that's what these irreducible quadratics create is factors over the complex so uh well factors with imaginary numbers in them over the complex so these linear factors are complex so if we have two linear factors of the conjugate pairs and we start distributing them it's going to give you something that's an irreducible quadratic over the reals if we put our a down here and say hey this is a function that would have those four solutions this is actually a degree four think about it x squared and x squared would be a degree four polynomial just like we said with these as zeros they're not x intercepts but they are zeros these are two irreducible quadratics we're done if you have to distribute after this you'd start and just take your two terms times your three terms combine your like terms after that and leave your a in the front just like we did here if you wanted to solve for a you could certainly do it here but you need a point to do that so if we had an x and a y plug in your x's here your y here simplify the side and then divide to solve for a then put your a right back do the same thing if you distribute uh you just put your a in front and then distribute the rest of the way so i hope that makes sense i'm going to come back with one more example dude it's quite similar but i just want to make sure that we see it one more time all right let's give it a shot actually what i strongly recommend is that you pause the video and you try this on your own so try setting up these factors try getting the one real factor that we have creating the the uh or one real solution we have created a factor for it using the multiplicity creating it as part of our polynomial function then check out your conjugate pair take and set those equal to to x and then make it a sum factor equal to zero use that distribute those complex conjugate factors that you have and then see as far as you can make it with your distribution remember we have to at least distribute so that we don't have any more complex numbers in there we need an irreducible quadratic from those so let's go ahead and get started if we have a degree 5 that means we're going to have 5 factors and multiplicity might count for a couple or three of those factors but we definitely need to have five added up together if you will we also notice that we have one complex solution one complex solution always comes with a pair so right off the bat we're going to say this also has a solution of 1 minus 2 minus i now let's go ahead and set these equal to zero so our solutions are x equals one x equals one plus i and x equals one minus i that's really it that's all the unique solutions that we have now why we don't set this equal to one three times is it's just redundant multiplicity says yes you do have three factors each of which would give you the solution of x equals one but we know a little bit more than that that that multiplicity really just stands for the exponent of our factor because that's the same thing x minus one and another x minus one another x minus one would be x minus one to the third power and that's exactly what we're gonna get here so we set our our x is equal to our unique solutions that are given to us and then we solve them so x minus 1 equals 0 that looks pretty good we're going to solve both of these x minus 1 minus i equals 0 and x minus 1 plus i equals 0. but we're going to be smart about it because these are going to create some complex factors for us we're going to group the x and the real part because that real part doesn't change for your complex conjugate it can't change so that when we distribute and this and this are factors x minus 1 gets multiplied by x minus 1 increase x minus 1 squared it's a lot easier to work with that way you're only thinking of two terms times two terms and you can use a lot of the advantages of the conjugate pairing that we saw otherwise you're doing three times three it's way over complicated so now that we have these three factors we're going to start building our function we know that this is just one of many functions like a family curves they could have these as solutions so we're going to say what each of the factors is we have an x minus 1. we have x minus 1 in parentheses minus i and likewise plus i you can see it right if we set this equal to zero we get this and this and this equal to zero by the zero prime property we're just going backwards the only thing i've left out hopefully you you notice it is that that x minus one that came from a a zero that had a multiplicity of three so so what that says is that if this x equals one has a multiplicity three really there are three factors that each of which would give you this x equals one it's still a crossing of the x-axis but we need to represent this as a power three we've gotta make sure our degree matches so this factor counts for one two three factors it's just written more concisely that's what exponents do four five factors looks really good here's one solution two solution and because it has a multiplicity of three that really counts for three solutions because you could have written out x equals one x equals one x equals one it'd be redundant but you could have done it now what we're going to do is distribute at least the factors that have complex numbers in them because we wrote these appropriately and grouped our our x with a real part it makes it really nice because these are these are legit complexes or sorry conjugates right now so we think of this as one term and we get x minus one squared again this idea is used a lot in the next video or whenever you have to multiply some complex factors together and we're going to do that and then do long division in the next few videos so x minus 1 squared great we get plus and minus the same exact thing and what we've come to expect we're going to get minus some sort of imaginary number squared now what that imaginary number squared does is gives you negative one okay well if we have a constant associated with that like four times i squared that'd be negative four here this is literally just negative one so we are going to get this x minus one squared minus negative one or x minus one squared plus one that's really what we have when we distribute this and combine it with plus one we get x squared plus 2x sorry minus 2x plus 1. that's going to give us x squared minus 2x plus 2. that's going to be our irreducible quadratic factor at the end of our problem we really don't have to distribute that unless you absolutely have to and they say you must distribute then what you really have to do is do x minus 1 times x minus 1 times x minus 1. which gets really tedious distribute this one get some sort of a quadratic not irreducible some sort of quadratic and then distribute another x minus one across it and combine some like terms then you'd have to take a three term sorry a four term polynomial times a three term polynomial you get 12 terms then you have to combine them and you're going to have some like terms but that becomes quite tedious for me it's not necessary if you have to then you have to personally i like this because i've already taught you how to find a leading term by doing that sort of fake distribution thing i've already taught you what to do with our linear factors with multiplicity that's going to have an x-intercept of one multiplicity it's across this is an irreducible quadratic it doesn't give you any additional x-intercepts there so this is a factor that would have the solutions as they told us it would again if you had to distribute you do this then distribute this don't distribute a if you have a point this is when you plug in plug in your x plug in your y over here and solve for a then put it back then you distribute that a through after you distribute all of this stuff that's about as far as i want to go on that i hope it makes sense especially the how we write these complex factors and distribute that's the biggest thing i wanted to show you and to make sure that our degree actually matches for instance if we did this we know our leading term is going to be x to the third times x squared fake distribution we talked about that already that's going to be an a x to the fifth that's the leading term of this polynomial it matches the degree that they've told us and depending on the a we have an end behavior that is odd or odd or negative odd so i hope you're with me i hope you're enjoying the videos next time we're going to do is we're going to start talking about how to find all the solutions of polynomial functions including some complex so sort of some similar ideas here we're just going to really flesh it on out and make sure that we really understand how complex works polynomials so i'll see you for that
