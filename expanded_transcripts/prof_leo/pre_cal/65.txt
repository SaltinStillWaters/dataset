Transcript for: Exponential Growth and Decay (Precalculus - College Algebra 66)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about exponential growth and decay or natural growth and decay uninhibited growth or decay this deals into something called differential equations it's just a very service level but how we can use some exponential modeling to deal with populations population growth population decline exponential growth models a lot of population growth even money which we saw in finance and then exponential decay that's stuff like half-life so we're going to talk about about that or newton's law of cooling that'll be our last example we are not going to get into the logistic modeling that happens more in differential equations and i i couldn't do the service here so if you're interested in that i do cover those topics but that's that in my opinion you need to understand a little bit more about this in order to really make that make sense otherwise it's just a formula and you can do it with a formula but it's much better if you really understand it so this we can understand because it's based on exponential so we're going to get into it we'll talk about what it means we'll take a look at it as an exponential function we'll notice it's very very strongly related to continuously compounded interest it's the same and then we'll deal with three examples on on working through this so firstly the the look of it this looks just like continuously compound interest it gives you a present value or an initial amount it says you are adding to it all the time just like continuous accommodates every moment very many very secure day this population is growing or declining based on some sort of a rate that k is your rate and some time period now the t does not have to be years maybe minutes can be hours should be whatever we want it to be but it is a period of time i hope that you're seeing that this is just like continuously compounded interest it's just we're growing population instead of money a population of whatever it is instead of just a population of dollars and cents very very valuable for us now one thing that we're seeing i've just already defined them but a sub 0 is your initial amount it's like your principal or your present value t is a time period not necessarily years and a is your future value or how much is going to be in that population after a certain amount of time after whatever that time is the issue here that we have is the rate you see in compounded interest your rate is positive meaning you're always growing money well for population growth or decay or decline we have to have the ability to have a downward or decreasing graph and that would be exponential decay that depends on whether the k is positive or negative positive k's mean growth negative k's mean decay so why why would that be the case i really want you to focus here because if you put a negative right there what does it actually mean check it out if this had a negative k then this piece right here you could move that to the denominator of some fraction or you could create a fraction itself do you remember i showed it to you one time before that if i want to change the value of an exponent i reciprocate my fraction i can actually do that here so if i think of this instead of e to the negative kt i think is 1 over e to the positive kt i really need you to make this connection do you remember that with exponentials if bases are more than 1 2.7 we get climbing graphs if bases are less than 1 that's 1 over 2.7 we get declining or decreasing graphs this is why a positive k means grow it's this or a negative k means decay decline decrease that's because it's this that negative exponent creates that base that's less than one i hope you're seeing it we don't really show this very often but i wanted to make that connection otherwise you know why is negative k actually do that because it creates a fraction because it creates that that uh that fraction that's less than one giving us an exponential function with a base less than one that is a decreasing graph that's why a negative exponent here decays hope it's making sense to you so we're ready to go through a couple examples we'll go through a very basic one one that i've contrived for you here and then we'll go ahead and come up with a couple on our own one with growth one with decay then we'll do newton's law cooling which is kind of cool and we'll be done so let's suppose that we're given some sort of an exponential model of the population this in this case was bacteria i think it starts with 100 units of bacteria and it says that you have this .045 what's that mean for a certain amount of time let's say it's in hours can we figure out a few things about it number one can we determine whether this is growth or decay if you look at your rate positive rates mean growth for some reasons i just explained to you negative rates rates mean decay because they would create a base that's less than one this is a base greater than one because that is positive if that's negative we could could create a base less than one that would give us a decline so positive rates cause us to grow so this is definitely growth and you could write the rate the rate is .045 or 4.5 percent growth per time period and let's say that if our time is hours that would be 4.5 growth an hour so every hour this bacteria is growing 4.5 4.5 every single hour that's happening now how about the initial amount the initial amount is always that number in front of your e think about man just think about doing the the continuous compounded interest how your initial amount was your principal or your present value it's the number in front your initial amount is 100 whatever this is units of bacteria or grams something like that so i'm going to leave this unit let's put units how about the amount after five days well because this is asking you for a certain amount the colony size after five days time oh you know what it says days so our hours is wrong so we always have to match this up this would be a mistake and i'm glad i put it i want you to really learn from it whatever unit of time they're telling you so this would be days you need to match that so if i say 4.5 per hour that really conflicts with our days so make sure that your units of time because they can be hours or minutes or days or weeks or whatever make sure they mesh together i actually meant hours here which is why that was i just wrote day so good thing we got this i'm going to change that to hours so that i can match that up so 4.5 per hour 100 units initially it's called our initial amount that's like the present value for talking population how much after five hours well because this is the calling size after a certain amount of time all it's really asking you to do is plug in five so c of t well or t is five hours now just plug in the t of five so on our calculator we'll put 100 second ln and then we'll have our parentheses of 0.045 times 5. i get about 125.2 units whatever that is if it's grams it'd be 125.2 grams or sometimes you do call it units of bacteria we would get that many after five hours oh that makes sense have you seen that this is very much like compound interest what about a different question what about how long would it take to reach 140 units or 140 whatever these these are well that's different isn't it that's saying if you start with 100 that's that's a given that's there for us this is our formula how long is it going to take to reach 140 well 140 is a future value of this population size let's let's make it that let's consider this to be what would be in the future well how long is the future well that's what we're trying to find out we're trying to figure out the t how many hours would it take to reach that so we're going to take our formula and say i want it to be 140 but i don't know what the t is i hope that this looks a lot like doubling an investment because we're going to do that next but in this case we're not doubling it we're just reaching a goal we're saying we're start with 100 how long is it going to take to reach 140. 140 would be the idea of that's going to be a value in the future let's solve for the t in your head right now you should be thinking i'm going to be using a logarithm at some point i have to because that's an exponential equation i'm solving for t that's a must but before we do that before we're able to use logarithms you must isolate the exponential so we're going to divide by 100 so dividing by 100 140 divided by 100 is 1.4 now we have an exponential equation it doesn't matter if it's a decimal or not we're going to do a logarithm on both sides for this just a man just like always use ln please use ln especially when we're dealing with exponential growth and decay because you're going to get a lot of simplification so we're going to take a natural log of both sides and because we match up our bases we compose an exponential onto a log in the same base this is going to simplify we get ln of 1.40 equals point zero four five t it should look just like doubling uh your compound interest when it was continuously compounded last video we're doing the same thing it's just that we're not doubling we're reaching a certain a different goal if we divide both sides by .045 and understand that this is asking for for the number of hours so rt is in hours as it said here and as it said right there number of hours well we're going to plug this into our calculator we're going to evaluate just make sure when you press your ln that you do 1.4 and end your parentheses before you divide that way your calculator knows what you intended to know yeah roughly 7.48 hours now does that make sense does it make sense that if after five hours we had 125 units then it's going to take a little bit longer than that for us to get 140 units well that makes sense to me five hours give us this sentence to be more than that to give us 140 but not like three times as much remember it is growing exponentially at a rate of four and a half percent per hour whatever the time unit is okay last one this is just like doing our continuously compounded interest if we're going to double something and we actually know how much we start with then we're going to deal with the same exact idea doubling means multiplying by 2. when we divide we're not going to get 1.4 like we did we're going to get exactly 2. so let's see how that that plays out how long to double this well if i start with 100 doubling would be 200 and i'm still looking for a time i'm still going to do a natural logarithm on both sides but in order to do that i have to divide first let's divide both sides by 100 isolate your exponential you have to do that before taking a logarithm so 2 equals e to the .045 t that is an exponential there's no common bases we have to use a logarithm and in general we just use ln almost all the time this naturally composes your base of your logarithm of the base of an exponential a function of this inverse cancels we get ln2 equals that .045 t where we divide both sides by .045 we have parentheses after the ln 2 that's really important for your calculator and it should be a bit more than 7.5 so i got 15.4 hours and that makes sense to gain 40 units cost us 7.5 hours to gain 60 more units on top of that would be an additional almost double well little over double that but we're gaining 60 additional units so 100 to 140 was seven half hours 100 to 200 was 15.4 so it makes sense it's not way way out there like a hundred hours or something remember this should be gaining faster and faster and faster it is positively increasing exponential growth hope it makes sense i hope you're seeing all the interplay between this and i hope i'm really making the connection between exponentials this stuff and the finance that we just did i'll come back with another one that we're going to start from scratch and create a formula that models exponential growth then we'll do a half-life for decay and newton's law of cooling all right we're ready for another problem let's give it a try we're supposed to find a formula for a population bacteria that doubles every three hours so let's take a look at this and model this with an exponential growth formula in order to do it we just have to understand a couple things about the process here what's going to happen is we have to find a rate first so it's going to give you enough information to plug in everything and solve for your k that is your first thing to do once you've found your k you can ask any other question that you want on this thing so it's all about finding the k first and then plugging that back in then you answer the question so let's take a look at it find a formula for population bacteria that doubles every three hours there's a lot of information there number one it's saying there's a time period we have three hours so we're in time unit of hours and saying after three hours we're gonna put a three here this should be two times that now what is that who cares it doesn't matter we dealt with this in doubling an investment and doubling bacteria it doesn't doesn't matter where we start if we start at one this would be two start at a hundred this would be two hundred it doesn't really matter and it also doesn't matter because we divide in the very first step to try to solve for our k so let's plug into a few things we know that we're trying to solve for k it's not telling us the rate we need to understand that but it's telling us after three hours that's our three hours this future value or the the population will attain this amount that's double what our initial amount was if that's one that's two that's ten that's twenty that's a hundred that's two hundred the very first thing we would do is try to solve for k by dividing the isolator exponential we divide both sides but whatever initial knot is you're gonna get two equals e to the three 3k this is what doubling looks like all the time once you have isolated your exponential a couple other things about this i would like to mention you can see a few different different things they could say something like hey your population of bacteria is growing at a rate of 5.2 percent per hour if they tell you that 5.2 per hour well that's a k of .052 you can always find that that is your rate so if they're telling you the rate you don't do any of this you say hey that rate would be whatever percentage you're telling me as a decimal you can always do that the other thing i can tell you is instead of doubling i just want to make sure that that's fresh in your head i could say a population of bacteria started with a hundred units after three hours it had 170 units or something and so in that case you'd say i started with a hundred after three hours i had 170. it's the same exact thing i'm just telling you a double because students tend to have a harder time with the double if i say you start with 100 and after three hours you have 170 sure you can divide by 100. we saw this in the first example and it gives you something very very doable very similar to this it's just a different way to look at it if you wanted to see them the first wave right now if i told you that the increase was 5.2 percent and they said you start with 100 units and your rate of increase is 5.2 percent then you are done there's your initial value and there's your rate of increase it's a rate of decrease well then you would have negative point zero five two percent so there are other ways to look at it i'm giving you the most common though all right so we're down to here we gotta solve for our k we need to take a natural log on both sides so we're going to do that because our bases match on our function and our the inverse of the function we end up getting ln 2 equals 3k divided by 3 we get k equals ln 2 over 3. so i got k is around 0.231 now i'm going to encourage you to not round that number very often those can be very very very small numbers very close to 0 and if we end up rounding them a lot that's a problem you might actually choose to leave it ln 2 over 3 and just put that here it looks a little awkward i'm not doing that because i want to show you the rate the rate of increase here is 23.1 0.231 is 23.1 per hour that is how fast this colony of bacteria is actually growing so what does that mean for us now that we have our k and our k is a constant it's like the rate in finance your rate doesn't change every day i mean it can we can but if it's a fixed rate it's going to stay the same all the time we're assuming this is a fixed rate of growth for this and we can see with that k that that is positive that should be exponential growth this is modeling this bacteria and now i can ask a whole lot of questions so i can ask something like if your colony started with 50 units or grams or whatever let's say you start with 50 how much will be there in 10 hours we put 50 here and 10 there i said how long would it take to triple this colony of bacteria that i put one here and three let's go ahead and do that one how long would it take to triple this better be more than three hours right because three hours is how long it took double it but how long would it take to triple this how long asks for a time triple says if you start with one you'll get three that would be triple i start with 100 i get 300. your first order of business would be to divide so we're going to end up getting 3 equals 0.231 t if we do an ln on both sides and we divide by 0.231 we get about 4.76 hours i hope that makes sense i hope that if it doubles in three hours it should triple in 4.76 hours that should make sense in your head that it's more than three it's not way way out there but it's definitely positive in more than three again if i had said suppose you start with 50 units how much would you have in 10 hours you could certainly put a 50 here and a 10 there and figure that out as well this is just designed to give you an understanding of how exponential growth and decay work from an original question like that one i decided to do two examples because they're slightly different and i know i would get questions on that one so i'm going to put up there to make sure that we we understand the differences between them so we're going to talk about exponential decay right now half-life is a really good way to to look at this because if you think about something that's radioactive something that's constantly losing stuff it's going to lose a lot of stuff at first because there's a lot of it to lose but as we get closer and closer to having none of it it's gonna still lose at the same rate but there's less to lose well you lose everything not according to exponential decay you have a horizontal asymptote don't you so can you ever lose all of a substance theoretically no you'll get closer and closer to zero but you never lose all of it so there'll always be some left and that's a decent way for us to date certain items so how in the world do we do these these things the same exact way as the last example but we're going to get exponential dk because we'll have a negative exponent and that would create if we use that negative to reciprocate a fraction a base less than one giving us a decreasing exponential graph that's what's going to happen so let's take a look at it the half-life of radium is 1690 years if 20 grams are present now how much will there be there in 50 years for all of these examples where you have to make your own formula your primary goal is to find k first so let's start with our our function we're thinking half-life means declining our case should be negative so that's important now half-life here's what that means if you're not familiar with it what half-life means is there will be half of whatever you start with after a certain amount of time for radium that there will be half of it after a certain amount of time that time is 1690 years so if you started with a hundred grams of radium after 1690 years there would be 50 of it left the other 50 will have radiated away and that's what radiation does it these particles emanate uh from whatever substance that is that's radioactive so the half-life of radium is 69 years but that gives us something doesn't it it says if you have 20 grams now what a half-life says is there will be half of this after that much time and we're still solving for k notice i could give you the rate of decreasing the rate of degrees decreases whatever percentage that'd be negative so like let's say negative 15 percent that'd be negative 0.15 as your k or if we say decrease 15 negative 0.15 for your k most of the time though they tell you how much you have and how and what the half-life is as far as a length of time so let's say we have 20 grams now there will be half of it that's 10 in this amount of time do you see that will let you solve for k in general they don't have to give you this to find out half-life i'm going to erase this just please watch this what if what if they said the half-life as a rating of radium is 1690 years they don't tell you how much is present now well what could you do couldn't you say imagine i have one one gram how much would be present in 1690 years half a gram or half of whatever that number is you're gonna see this when we go back to our hey you have 20 in 1690 years that's the half-life you'll have 10. what's the first thing you do well if we have to solve for k we're going to need a logarithm to undo the exponential but you have to isolate the exponential first if we divide both sides by 20 it should be very familiar at this point if we divide both sides by 20 10 divided by 20 is oh look at that one half this will happen every time with half-life that's what half-life means there's half of it left after that time now that we have an exponential isolated ready for an ln we're going to do a natural log on both sides and lastly because we simplify here we can simply divide by 1690. i hope this triggers some of your brain i hope that that when you look at this you go oh yes natural logs or any logarithm of fractions less than one should give me negatives do you remember that logarithms increase with basis that are greater than one which we have that's basically logarithms increase and they are negative until x equals one at that point one zero they cross and then are they positive so if you plug in anything between zero and one your logarithm will give you a negative here divided by positive it's still going to be a negative be careful with your calculators make sure you have parentheses after that one half you want to press ln one half in parenthesis and then divide by 1690. i got negative point zero zero zero four one if you get that e to the uh well sorry uh the exponential scientific notation notation just remember that moves your decimal to the left if it's negative so we move left four spaces and we get this point zero zero zero four one that is the rate of decrease this this radium is decreasing at the rate of 0.041 percent per year that is what that means not very quick that's why it takes 1690 years to lose half of it so what that means for us we can put this back into our formula i'm leaving this blank intentionally for a second on purpose to show you that this really did not have to be here in order for us to figure out our k our half-life has always done the same amount you will just have one half of your amount that you started with or 50 0.5 of wherever you started with that's going to come in right there 30 after that you're able to find your k you put it back in your function and then it can ask you any sort of question like suppose you start with whatever amount find this or how long it would take here suppose you want to find this amount however long it would take uh you can you can solve for that we can do lots and lots of different things with these equations we just have to solve for k first now in our case this says that we have 20 grams of radium present how much will be there in 50 years all we're looking for is this evaluated for 50 years you see this gives you the rate of decrease it tells you how much you started with we're saying how much will be there after 50 years has passed so we just plug in 50 and evaluate i got about 19.59 grams so what this means is that the amount that's going to be left after 50 years has passed is 19.59 grams considering you start with 20 grams that's not much well i'm sorry that's that's not much decrease well that's true but if you lose half of it in 1690 years that mean that there would be 10 grams left after 1690 years right that would take 600 years to lose 10 grams well 50 years is not even close to 690 so you're not gonna lose very much in that short amount of time you're losing it is decreasing but the rate is very slow hope that makes sense you hope you're seeing the idea of hey half-life means one-half i can solve for k even if i tell you don't tell you what to start with you can still suffocate then i can ask you a number of questions after that i can have you solve for how much would it would take to get to a certain amount how long that would take all sorts of different questions on that all right we're ready for another example so c14 has a half-life of 5730 years stop right there with just that information you should be able to solve for k and that's exactly what we're going to do first we're going to solve this for k almost right now i'm going to read the rest of it just to get an idea about where we're going but that first sentence lets you solve for k that's a must if we want to answer any of the questions so we're going to we're going to pause right there now if a dead tree has 30 percent of the c14 it originally did when did it die that 30 that is used after you have found kate some students they really want to make the k .30 that's not what that 30 percent is i understand that because you're like oh that's a rate it's really not if i had given you a rate i would say the rate of decrease is 30 and you could say oh okay that's negative 0.30 for my k that's not what's happening here what's happening is we're going to use our half-life to figure out our k and then this next sentence says now that you've done that tell me how long it takes to achieve 30 percent that's a different story and it comes in later it asks something like how much is going to be present in 50 years but a little bit differently it has to solve for a time so number one you got to find your k first the half-life statement up there is enough to do it the half-life statement says if you start with any amount let's call it one and you give it five thousand seven hundred thirty years how much is going to be left half of it i don't care if you start with 10 and you want to put five start with 100 put 50. start with a thousand put 500 the first thing you do is divide and then you'd end up getting one half because that is isolated or exponential for us we just have to take a natural log of both sides you probably should see at this point that half-life is going to look a lot like this a lot of the time because if it says how half-life is this many years well then we know that 0.5 or one-half is going to equal e to the whatever the number of years is times k it'll let you solve for the k so let's do that let's divide by 5 730 okay try to be as precise as possible don't round this as much as you're able to so we because we have to deal with a really small number we really want to be as precise as we can be so what that means is that we have this rate of decrease why decrease well it's negative that negative exponent would make this 1 over e to some other power that is a rate of decrease it's decreasing at let's see 0.0121 percent per year that's how quickly this carbon 14 is decreasing that's the rate of decrease right there so what we're going to do now is going to rewrite this formula that we have but using this information i also hope you're seeing this as a several step process this isn't just you plug in all the numbers and you get it you first have to use your your information to figure out your k and then on your second step like after you've found your k and after you've played in your formula then you can answer anything else now the next question is a little bit confusing for a lot of people to go wait a minute what do you mean 30 i don't know how much i originally had how am i supposed to find 30 of it well here's the point no matter what you originally had if there's 30 percent of it remaining this is going to end up being 0.30 equal to whatever your exponential is why well because how would you do this you start with some amount let's call it one now i don't care because if it's one or a hundred or a million well it doesn't really matter if we know our rate of decrease and we know that the tree had 30 percent of its original carbon-14 so if we start with let's pretend it's one gram how much would be left 0.3 grams that's 30 of what it started with now what if it wasn't one gram if it was uh 10 grams well then what's 30 percent of 10 3 what about 100 grams what's 30 of that would be 30 but the very first thing that you would do in any of the cases is you'd have to self-exponentially you had to solve for t so if you did that you'd isolate it if you isolate you have to divide both sides by 10. but wait a minute if in this case if if you are going to find 30 of this number and then divide it by this number you're going to get .30 or 30 or whatever percentage is every time so if i divide 3.0 by 10 or 0.30 by 1 or 30 by 100 i'm going to end up getting 0.30 no matter what as i isolate that exponential i guess that's just to say that when they give you a percentage it's much like doubling it's actually like half-life if you did if you remember the half-life this said you have half of what you started with 50 of what you started with after that amount of time it lets you solve for k now it's saying okay uh you have 30 percent of what you started with 0.30 of whatever you started with really call it one doesn't really matter because what's what's it saying is you have 30 now figure out the time that it took to get that 30 so same exact idea it's just now you're looking for the time it's taking and since we have the k we're allowed to do that let's do a natural log of both sides and i'm just working that down we we do an ln of course this composes a function's inverse cancels if we divide both sides by that negative 0.00121 hopefully you recognize i have an ln of some value less than one that's a negative divided by another negative should give me a positive that makes sense time should be in the future here or some positive value that's saying this is how long ago this tree died i ended up getting 950.2 years ago is how long ago this tree died and what that means is that that long ago this tree would have died and it would have 30 percent of the original carbon 14 that it had back then and so they go backwards to try to date that the last thing i'm going to mention is this number is is definitely off and the reason why is because i rounded pretty heavily right there it didn't look like it went to like the what sixth decimal place but i cut off a lot of numbers so when you do that you're going to really affect this outcome so i'm saying about 950.2 because i didn't want to write out a whole bunch of digits but in actuality you probably shouldn't round this at all to be honest with you um but that's that's just what i had to do to make you understand what the rate was here so i did that but this is probably off by i don't know two or three years so anyhow i hope that makes sense i hope that you're seeing that half-life takes a percentage after a certain amount of time solves for k and that's exactly what this is doing it's saying what is the amount of time for which you to get that percentage so i hope i've cleared that up what we're going to do in your mind at least what we're going to do now is come back with one more example kind of fun one and then then we'll be done last one we're going to talk about a newton's law of cooling problem i kind of like these i also want to tempt you to get into differential equations because we cover this much much much more at length we talk about where this actually comes from it's pretty neat uh so newton's law of cooling is kind of cool obviously this comes from how long it takes fig newtons to cool once they take them out of the oven um so anyway newton's law of cooling says how long is it going to take if something that is a different temper temperature from the ambient to reach a certain temperature so let's imagine turkey i don't actually like turkey comes out an oven but some people do and i am always responsible for carving the turkey i don't know why but that's just my job i guess so a turkey comes out of the oven 100 degrees celsius and it's 80 degrees celsius in five minutes when will it be 50 degrees celsius so that i don't burn my fingers when i cut it and i keep my house at 30 degrees celsius so i'm going to time this so that right when i cut it i cut it i can serve it it's nice and hot people tend to enjoy it and if you don't think that i actually go through the math to figure this stuff out in your head you're dead wrong because i would certainly do this on thanksgiving day to make sure that it's just right so anyhow let's go ahead and figure out what all this stuff means when we deal with newton's law of cooling there's a one more variable that you really need to understand it's the t t stands for ambient temperature and so what we do whether something is higher than or lower than newton's law of cooling will tell you a relationship for how long it takes to reach a certain temperature or what the temperature will be after a certain amount of time now what about if that's negative well if you plug in something less than your ambient then it's colder than that like taking something out of the freezer well that's reverse cooling it's called heating but newton's law of killing will still work for that so it compares the initial temperature of your item with the ambient and then that is also your ambient temperature so we're going to fill out a couple things right now to make sure that we understand that when they say ambient that is the surrounding temperature to which you are exposing this thing that you want to heat or cool so when we read about the turkey the ambient temperature would be the the temperature of the house so the temperature after a certain amount of time is given by the ambient temperature plus the difference between the thing that you're heating or cooling in this case the turkey and the ambient temperature i'm going a little slower here because it's newer so here's what we would say we'd say the ambient temperature is 30 when i initially take out my turkey it is 100 degrees so the difference would be 30 100 minus 30. it's going to give us 70. now keep in mind what we need to do we have to solve for k first it's a must you got to find the rate of cooling or anti-cooling heating in the situation first so we're not there yet i'm just cleaning this up a little bit so we would get 30 plus 70 e to the kt now comes in this this next statement so we've said the initial temperature the initial temperature right here is 100 degrees minus ambient gives us 70. okay ambient was 30. we knew that here we knew that here now this next piece it's 80 degrees in five minutes oh that relates a future value with a time that is how we go and solve for k that's how it's been every time with extrusive growth or decay so in five minutes so our time unit is minutes in five minutes this stuff will equal 80 degrees that's all there is to it so it's going to be 80 degrees in five minutes you still have to obey this right you still ambient temperature still 30 the difference is still 70 in five minutes it will be 80 degrees we're going to solve for that k right now of course you have to isolate the exponential right there's just one more step subtract your 30. if we divide by 70 and we take an ln on both sides and lastly if we divide by five we have a good expression for k now if i wanted to be very accurate i would approximate that i would leave it i would put it right there and then when i multiplied what i saw for t i'd have a very awkward thing to use but it would be more accurate i'm going to write a decimal right now even though i'm going to lose some some exactness i want to show you the rate so that's why i'm doing that so i got k is about negative point zero six seven three what that says is that there's a a negative 6.73 percent decrease in temperature every whatever the time period is every minute 30 minutes losing 6.73 of its temperature well as based on a scale of 100 um so what that allows us to do though that allows us to put this right here and then solve for the time it's going to take to reach 50 degrees so we've understood it we've put some numbers in the correct place we've used another piece of information to solve for k and now we have a formula that's usable for us so now we're going to answer the last question how long will it take in order for it to reach 50 degrees so all this is set how long says what's the time when our future temperature is now 50. so how long does it take for it to hit a future value of 50. that's based on our original equation that we got we just put our k in there and now we're going to solve for that t so subtracting 30 dividing by 70 taking a natural logarithm on both sides and finally dividing by negative point zero six seven three all right i got 18.61 now remember this is minutes that's what was given right here to us so in 18.61 minutes this turkey will have dropped from 100 to 50 degrees celsius according to my ambient temperature so i can cut into it and not burn my fingers like i do every year so anyhow um one more thing doesn't make sense does it make sense that it took that long because it took it took only five minutes to drop 20 degrees why would it take that much longer to drop another 30 degrees well it does make sense because exponential decay it drops quickly and that drops slower and slower and silver silver silver some sort so imagine this if you're losing point seven point three per percent of your your temperature let's say then there's a lot of temperatures start you're gonna lose big amounts but as you start losing temperatures six point seven three percent is less than it was at the beginning because you lost some it's like the opposite of compounding interest you're losing and so you're making less and less and less or taking less and less and less away so it should take longer it should take longer to lose the same amount of temperature as you start getting cooler or heating up theoretically will this turkey ever reach 30 degrees ever will it ever get down to the point where it's equal to the temperature of my house theoretically practically yeah theoretically no and i need you to see the last thing i point out look right here this is an exponential this is an exponential with negative so a downward exponential decrease in exponential this is a vertical stretch and this right here is a vertical shift i'll see it that's a vertical shift of 30. that's a horizontal asymptote shift of 30. this has a horizontal asymptote it will never theoretically reach 30 degrees it'll always lose but it'll never never get down to that isn't that interesting so that's that's all that interplays with this i hope that you've seen the exponentials that explain it to you i've really tried to make it as though as possible without giving you a background of differential equations because that's just not the scope of this class so hopefully it's interesting hopefully it made sense to you and we are now we're really done with our exponentials that's about as much as i can teach you we're going to move on to something completely different we're going to want to do sequences and series now they do relate to exponentials but they are a different idea so we'll talk about those i'll give an introduction to sequences an introduction series we'll talk about arithmetic and geometric sequences in series and then a proof of induction and and that um and then we start talking about some systems of equations for a little bit before moving on to trigonometry hope you have fun you
