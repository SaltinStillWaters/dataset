Transcript for: How to Find the Area of a Triangle with Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 34)
hey there welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about the area of a triangle and you go yes but i already know that i know but i'm going to make this a lot easier for you you see when we talk about the area of a triangle you need to know a couple things about it you need to know the base and you need to know the height if it's not a right triangle you'd have to know what this distance is in order to find the area of a triangle until today after today we're going to be able to find the area of a triangle without knowing the height if we know two sides and an angle between it or if we know all three sides this sounds a lot like the law of cosines yes it does for a very good reason because we're going to use a substitution that takes into account this right triangle right here we're going to simplify the area of a triangle into using two sides and angle between it because of that or all three sides because of that reason and so if this if your triangle satisfies law of cosines you can find the area without explicitly knowing the height so we're going to talk about a few things uh we'll prove the area of a triangle here really quickly we'll do a substitution to figure out the angle area if you know two sides and angle between and then we'll use something called heron's formula to find the area of the triangle if you know all three sides so let's start with this how in the world do you find the area of a triangle well the idea behind the area of a triangle is if you can make the area of a rectangle it's pretty easy to find so let's suppose we have this triangle with a height of h and a base of b and the b goes all the way across this then maybe we double this triangle and make a rectangle double this triangle make a rectangle the area of the full rectangle the whole dotted thing with this base would be base times height so that would be the area of the entire rectangle however how did we figure out that area well we doubled this triangle put it here we've doubled this triangle put it here so the area of the rectangle is twice what this triangle would be and so if we divide by two or multiply by one half we're going to get the area of that triangle how we use what letter we use to represent the area is sometimes k so we're going to say k is the area of our triangle and it would be one half base times height that's where our area for triangle comes from in the first place now what if we knew two sides and an angle between it what if we didn't actually know the height is there a way that we could figure out the area from knowing two sides an angle between it once you loved it if one of those times i was like nope we can't end a video this is it never not gonna happen um but let's go ahead and here's what we're gonna try let's suppose that we use this formula we would know the base we know the side but what if we don't know the height is there a way that we can make a substitution so let's start with that area of a triangle is one half base times height what would we know if we knew two sides and hang between we'd know this side we know this side we know the angle we would not know the height but wait a second what that height does is creates a right triangle here here and that angle with our h create a right triangle let's go ahead and set that up now what we what would we know in that right triangle we wouldn't know this base why because that base is the whole entire thing i don't know where this comes so i don't know that but i would know the angle and this particular side oh my gosh if this is a right triangle and identify the angle that i know and given or in referencing i can identify my hypotenuse i can identify the the side opposite my angle then i can identify the side adjacent then what this is don't look at this guy but look at this guy if you know two sides and an angle between then your height creates a right triangle you would still know this angle of the right triangle you would still know the hypotenuse of that right triangle so what trig function represent that any trig function not including adjacent that would be sine and so we can use sine of the angle between the sides that we know equals opposite over hypotenuse i hope you're seeing that i hope you seen the right triangle there and that sine of angle c equals opposite over hypotenuse we don't want to use the b because we don't know well this side doesn't end here it goes the whole way we have no idea what that adjacent side is we would know knowing two sides and angle between that angle and the hypotenuse we don't know the height and that's the whole point of the next step that we're doing if we don't know the height finding this area would be really difficult but if we know this angle on that side maybe we can solve for height maybe we can use that to substitute so let's multiply both sides by a this says that the height of that triangle is going to be given for sure by a the hypotenuse times sine of angle c this is true this is just right triangle trigonometry now let's substitute it this h is the same as this h so if we don't know what that h is we can substitute this in there so the the triangle the area of that triangle is one-half b times h but instead of h i'm going to use this with a little bit of multiple uh switching or multiplication because that's commutative we get the area of that triangle is one half a times b the whole b not just this little part the whole b times sine of the angle between them that's pretty impressive so using a little right triangle trigonometry we can get around the fact we don't know h because we could find it with some right triangle trig so if you had to do this on your own without this formula you'd have to drop a height you'd have to figure out what this angle is what the that side is do your sine which would be horribly hard then you'd have your height this formula does it all at once for you we've just made a substitution to make it nicer so there's there's really three instances we have area is one half a times b times sine c we can have a times c times sine b we can have b times c times sine a all it really is is one half the two sides that you know times sine of the angle between them that's the concept i'm gonna write up the formulas but that's the concept so there's our formulas remember this only works if you know two sides with an angle between because that's the only way we'd be able to figure out the height with our sine function so this is for a side angle side knowledge of a triangle what it says the concept of it is man area of a triangle is still one half something but we're being kind of smart with the substitution so it's one half multiply the sides and sine of the angle between the sides that you know that's why you need to know two sides of the angle between that that's all this says multiply the sides times sine of the angle between those two sides have one half of that and you have the area of your triangle so i'm going to come back i'm just going to do two examples of this and then we'll move on to our knowing three sides and finding the area of a triangle all right let's get after it so we have this triangle i don't know it's right triangle i don't care all we really need to know to find the area is in general a base times a height now if we don't know a height if we know two sides and an angle between we can find the area of that triangle so all we've got to do is take one half times the two sides and sine of the angle between them if you need to label this as a b and c that's absolutely fine you don't really need to but you could if you need the formula that would be a a maybe this is b that would be lowercase b if this is c then this is lowercase c honestly though the formulas are more of a concept one half times the two sides and sine of the angle between them so one of the sides the other side sine of the angle between them no matter how this is oriented you can always find area of a triangle that way one half the two sides that you know or any two sides you know times sine of the angle between if we do this let's see sine of 30 degrees is one half that's going to give you three so the area of this triangle is three square units is that nice yeah you bet it's nice that's that's really great because you don't have to use right triangle trigonometry and then do something else with it it's all in one that's really all there is to it we've already done the right triangle trigonometry and do the substitution so that this was possible all right we have one last one with our side angle side i'm looking at this i'm trying to find the area of a triangle i don't really know the height how would you find the height you have to draw a perpendicular right here and find the height of that or draw one here and extend that you do both cases but really it's a lot nicer if this fits law of cosines you can use an area formula for it so the area of a triangle says all we really need to know is all three sides or two sides and an angle between i know that i know two sides and an angle between so if you want to label this as a a b b c and lowercase c that's fine our area is going to give us one half times multiply those sides together so four times one or one times four times sine of the angle between them which is 120 degrees now one half times 1 times 4 is just 2 and sine of 120 degrees let's see that's square root of 3 over 2 which leaves us with just the square root of 3 or about 1.73 if you want to approximate i hope that makes sense i hope that explained the area of a triangle really nicely if you've if you have two sides and you know an angle between them it's not all that bad we've just done a substitution so if it fits the law of cosines you can do it if you need the formula great if you're a constant person then just if you know the two sides and the angle between it's multiply the sides times one half and sine of angle between them so let's take a look at what happens if you know all three sides okay so last little concept here let's suppose that you know all three sides of a triangle can you find the area yes you can but it does involve a special formula it's called heron's formula the idea is add up your sides and multiply it by one half this is going to give you a value called s then take that value instead of square root s times s minus a times s minus b times s minus c it is a process i'm not going to prove it for you but it does work if you know all three sides of your right triangle to figure out the area pretty concisely otherwise you would it would take a lot of work to actually do this so you need quite a bit of trigonometry to figure out that area so let's go through it the ideas again is there's a part one and there's a part two figure out s first think of s as half the perimeter so s says add everything up and divide by two or multiply by one half so we would do that now it doesn't matter the order of course in which you add them but you do need to add everything together before you divide by two so that looks like we're going to have oh let's see one half of 19 should be 9.5 so we're going to find this quantity s half of the perimeter first after that we can find the area all we're going to do is take k equals or area equals the square root and inside that we're going to start with s so 9.5 and then we're going to continue to multiply by s minus each of the three sides it does not matter the order so 9.5 minus 9 9.5 minus 6 9.5 minus 4 or any sort of permutation of those for exact answer you actually could put square root of 91.4375 i haven't rounded that um but really in your calculators normally we would just put this all all in square root of use your parentheses appropriately and then when you take that square root it's going to give you about oh 9.56 so 9.56 square units whatever that is it's kind of a nice way to find the area if you know all three sides it's at least very quick so find s it's half the perimeter then square root of s and then s minus each of your sides multiplied together okay last one so you should probably try that on your own um just see if you can go through karen's formula see if you can figure out s and then use s in your area formula so for us we've got s is half the perimeter so add this up that would be one half of nine plus eight plus five in any order that you want so let's see that's oh 17 plus 5 is 22 half of that is 11. so s is 11. our area formula says take the s multiply times s minus each of those sides in succession multiply it all together take square root if we do that 11 times 11 minus 9 times 11 minus 8 times 11 minus 5 we're going to get 396 as the radicand the inside of that square root if we take a square root it's about about 19.9 19.9 square units whatever that is that's still an area i hope this makes sense i hope that i've explained to you well enough that if something fits law of cosines you can find the area of that triangle pretty easily with one of these formulas um so we're multiplying one half times two sides and sine of the angle between or when we're adding them up multiplying by one half to figure out s and square root of that s times s minus each of those three sides that's about it that's how we can find area without having to know the height i hope it's made sense to you and i will see you for another video we're going to go on to some harmonic motion
