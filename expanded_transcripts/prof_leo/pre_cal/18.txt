Transcript for: Completing the Square Made Easy (Precalculus - College Algebra 19)
hey welcome to another video so in this video I'm going to show you how to complete the square easily though easily completing the square is not easy yeah it can be a little tricky but the way to make something easy and math is to understand it and so what I'm gonna do I'm going to teach you why completing the square actually works because I can't afford for this to be a process for you something oh you do this and this then you're good to go I need you to understand what it is that it's doing and the reason why it's important is because in in this class in like precalculus intermediate algebra we have other ways to install quadratics like the quadratic formula but what completing the square does is make it gives you a very powerful tool that you will be using later in math like in in calculus too we use trig sub the trigonometric substitution to solve some integrals and you have to complete the square on some of those problems so I'm going to show you why it works how it works and it's going to seem a lot easier when we're done so we're gonna solve some quadratics we have one of you this factorable we'll talk about the minute and leave some ones that aren't so there's two principles I need you to understand before we get started the first one is this what we're going to be doing how to make completing the square easy is to understand that what it really is is taking something that quadratic forcing it to factor as a perfect square so that you can use the square root method to solve it so we're looking at a quadratic we're saying that doesn't factor otherwise we wouldn't be doing this we're making part of it purposely factored into a perfect square trinomial we're going to talk about that this is one of them show you what that looks like so that we can make the square root method work the second principle is this I need you to understand that if something's an equation like we have here like we have here if we start messing with one side by adding something to it we have to undo that somewhere and there's two choices both are good I'm going to show you in this video how to deal with completing score on one side of your equation because that will mimic more closely well how you use completing the square later on your math lives so here's the principle we all know this to have an equal set up if start adding or subtracting mostly just adding on one side of this equation I have to balance it somewhere and so here's what I want you to look at if I start making seven and let's say I add to this is no longer invalid equation it's not it's not true seven plus two is not equal to 7 7 plus 2 is 9 on the same so seven I have to undo that somewhere and so what I'm going to show you in this video is that in order to complete the square in order to make factor impossible we're going to be adding something to a piece of our equation we're going to have to subtract on the same side to keep it equal now a lot of textbooks are going to say ok once you add here I want you to add here that's perfectly fine that is absolutely true if you add two here and add two here 9 would equal 9 I'm going to show you a different approach that will work better for you later so instead of 7 plus 2 equals 7 even though this plus 2 kind of screwed us up what if we get 7 plus 2 minus 2 would that's still equal 7 well yeah the plus 2 minus 2 those are those are inverses they're gonna cancel out if you will and we would just get 7 equals 7 again this is the principle I'm going to teach you in completing the square and so here's the idea one last time before we start this this stuff we're gonna take a look at how factoring works we're gonna make factoring work for something that's not actually factorable by adding a number to a piece of this equation then we'll have to undo that because you can't just add the one side without undoing this somewhere so I'm going to show you how that works and let's take a look at this example in order to do that so let's look at x squared minus 6x plus 9 equals 0 and we look at it we've got everything on one side we got it in order to get the first term positive let me say number one can we use the square root method in order to solve that well can I get that power to something squared on one side with no other X's and a constant on the side answers know that that X Agnetha this up so the next thing we tries can you factor it yeah of course I can factor that that that looks that's in order percent positive looks pretty good the Reacher if I try to factor it here's our insert build miss process if we try to factor this we use our diamond problem we put our middle term this negative six this be up top and we have a times c1 times a night it was night now of course because our a is one it's gonna look like it's just nine now here's something that I'm going to tell you and we're gonna do in just a minute in just a minute I'm going to say that now imagine something imagine we didn't have the nine imagine you still wanted to complete this you still wanted a factor there's a perfect square trinomial but you didn't have the nine or gonna learn that if you can find these two numbers that's the number that's actually missing some of the changes in just a minute just watch for it so if we went through this say okay had a factor we need two numbers to add negative six but at the same time multiply to positive 9 and we think in our heads we know they're gonna be the same sign we know they both have to be negative and they're both going to be negative three and if we continue we know that whether we do a shortcut away they do factor by grouping we're gonna get X minus 3 and X minus 3 and you wait a minute that's the same factor trying twice exactly so here's what I'm trying to show you here I'm trying to show you that we're not going to be given the 9 we're gonna be given something like ain't missing tonight and we still want to make this work so that when we put it together as X minus 3 squared the square root meant that is still going to work for us that's the whole principle of completing the square is forcing something a factor so that the square root method is gonna work from here yes we take the square root on both sides we get a plus a minus 0 we add the 3 of you yeah you get that from here 2x plus 3 hello yeah exactly because this was actually factorable so here's the point what we're gonna do instead instead of having something that's already factorable here's what it's going to look like we're going to have what if you didn't have than I what if this wasn't here what if you wanted to complete this so that you forced it to factor well if we ask that question the answer B if I had this middle term of negative six I'm looking for this number basically we're just sort you can kind of make up something that we have to add to it in order to make this thing factor like this so you look at the okay well how would I make this work I'd make this work if both of these numbers are negative three you see I still want this to be something that I have the same factor twice something where the square root method would work when I combine my factors so X minus 3 and X minus 3 need to make this X minus 3 squared we have to have the same numbers here and here in order to get the same factor in order to combine it to a power to so that the square root method will work and that's exactly what completing the square it does it forces the square root method of work force the problem is without this number this doesn't work so your weight Louie these numbers have to add to this one right yeah that's how that's how we found them we need them to be the same correct well of course because we need this to happen so that we can combine and get a power to but don't these numbers also have to multiply to here well that's exactly how we did effect in the first place you said these numbers have to add to this one but at the same time they have to multiply to this so how do I find this number let's let's multiply them let's say well negative 3 times negative 3 is 9 9 is the only number in the world that I can add to this and complete the square complete the thing that we want to factor is a perfect square trinomial so that 9 that 9 can get added right here but we run into a situation it's this situation right now you see what I've done I've added 9 to something that didn't have a night we'd have to undo that somewhere and that's what we're going to focus on the rest of our example so I'm going to walk you through this process right now hopefully I've explained well enough the the two major principles number one is or finding a number that's forcing this to happen so that we use the square root method the second thing is if I'm going to add something I'm gonna have to subtract something as well I don't have to undo it I would say so we're gonna practice that on this example and we're certain rate now so let's say that we get this function x squared plus 4x minus 3 and and you need to find the 0 so they say find the x-intercepts or the roots or whatever they call them the zeros x-intercepts roots and so the first thing you do is set the equal to zero and then we run through the all of our options on solving quadratics so we think well is it on one side yeah of course is it in order that looks really good is the first term positive definitely and then we'd say will we check does the square method work and and the short answers you know of course because we have this this X that we can't get in power to with all our X's inside and and cons on this side the next question is can you factor and you know what you should try you should try the factoring for about 10 seconds and if it's factorable great we should be able to do about 10 20 seconds and if that's not the case if you can factor this you look at this you know hey there's nothing that adds to 4 and also multiplies negative 3 then we've got to find another technique here's the two techniques we're going to choose from they work all the time but they're a little bit more intensive than like factoring and square root method they're completing the square and there's a quadratic formula again most of the time guys we're just gonna go to quadratic formula because completing the squares you're gonna see on some of these examples takes a really long time and it's really hard to think of but it is very valuable if you needed for later on in math so I'm going to show you how that works but just to just bear with me here that the quadratic formula is gonna be a better choice for almost all of these just telling you right now so let's see if we can make this make this work for us so we're gonna set this up and we're gonna set up in a way that we're gonna force factory to happen how in the world do we force factory to happen here's the Leonard way of doing completing the square number one I need you to think of this as this parks great this as long as curious l think about why that happens if you were trying to factor this the force not a problem you could you could find numbers that multiply there that had to for very easily but none that also multiply to negative three so we're going to take that negative three or that minus three we're gonna hold it out for a little while we're gonna say this is the number that's screwing us up so let's write x squared plus 4x don't lose this minus three but put it way over here put way over there here's the thing that we're gonna do we're going to treat this piece exactly how we treated this piece about the nine remember how that nine wasn't there we're gonna look at this where a look at this treat this the same way this is the thing that you want to factor this is the thing that you're going to complete so that it can factor so we're gonna say hey if this were to factor like if it even possible what would this part ignore this what would this part look like this part would look like I have a four I wouldn't factor out the axis is not a GCF thing this is not what we're talking about then what we're talking about here is getting something where the square root method works so you need three terms in order for this to have that perfect square trinomial look to it so we're not doing a factoring by grouping or not factor out the X here we're finding a missing number it's going to make as possible so so so again we have some order we say factor does it work correct take off the piece that's not working for you look at the first two terms make factoring work how do we make factory work how does it make factory work in such a way that we're gonna have the same two factors well if this is our middle term after we find one it's gonna be our military if that's our middle term what two numbers add two for two numbers added four that are the same number because we need to have that same factors so we're looking at how well it's got to be two and two those are the only numbers that are the same that add before again why the same because if we can make these numbers the same we're going to get X plus 2 times X plus 2 that shortcut or that grouping or whatever you want to do and these numbers are the same you were going to get the same factors here there's only one problem this does not factor like this right now this is missing one number and if we add that number this would factor this was completing the square does it completes the factoring for you well what is this number that's missing well do you remember like if this if this was if this is the only two numbers are the same that had before this number comes from multiplying these two numbers or missing four so here's that four comes in that four says if I were to add four here this number that I would give this multiplication this is now factorable so you've completed the one missing number right there that makes this factor also so we're looking at we're saying that would be our middle term and put it here find two numbers are they're the same that add that have to add the four are you seeing that would have to be half of this number of your time it's always half of it because if you have two numbers that add up to something that are the same it's always half the number you try to add to then what would this be this is always a multiplication of these two numbers but that's always the number of those missing so we're gonna add that it's always adding this number to it but then we run into that seven equals seven with the two thing we added two we have to subtract it's similar here's where that happens if you just arbitrarily add for you now no longer have this same equation that you started with you just changed your function we have to subtract it and we're gonna subtract on the same side so when we add it for C well we gotta take it away this is the principle of hey 7 equals 7 7 plus 2 minus 2 is still equal to 7 we added something so we undid it right next to it that's what we're doing we added 4 to make this factorable in such a way that it completes the square we made it a perfect square but in doing so we added 4 we have to undo that 4 because if we add it and then subtract it keeps our equation same as it was and then we're going to combine it and say hey that's so we held up that minus three we subtracted four we also have a minus three that's a minus seven does that look familiar that's exactly exactly where the the whole square root method came from so all those problems we did a few videos ago where there was something square you get that square bites lbgtq square root on both sides plus and minus this is where it comes from so we're making that happen by something that's not normally factorable that's the whole idea from here on out I mean we know that this is still equal to zero and we can solve it I mean I might solve some of these for you probably not I probably will do all that was do but if we if we solve this we're gonna add 7 to both sides so X plus 2 squared equals 7 we take a square root we know that when we take a square root we have a plus or minus of X plus 2 equals plus and minus square root of 7 we simplify the square root if we can here it's not simplified so it's as simple as you can make it we subtract 2 remembering where that 2 goes in front of our plus and minus and this gives us two solutions x equals negative 2 plus square root 7 and x equals negative 2 minus square root 7 that's it and then you categorize it so you think about that does that have any x-intercepts and oh man I hope it's making sense that if you have eyes you don't you completely miss a complex solution say we missed the x axis if we had one solution it would have to be a real solution we get it twice and it would say our vertex is on the x axis here there's no eyes there's two distinct solutions those are two x-intercepts if you want an approximation you put your calculator and you get about where this parabola upward-opening across the x axis of two times that's got to make sense before we go any further so we're taking something that's not factorable stripping off this constant that's screwing us up anyway figuring out what its gonna take to make it factorable how think think about if you wanted to factor a diamond problem what what would happen these numbers have added the middle one and multiply it to the the last number so if they have to be the same so as to get the same factor twice you'd basically just divide that by two time this number has to be the product of these two that is the number that you are adding as soon as you add it as soon as you got it you will have something that's factorable because you just completed it you just said what you needed to complete it and then did you added that in there therefore this is factorable as something times itself this is a square we just have to undo the thing that we did so we add for your subtractive it's always going to be added and senator parentheses always because you're multiplying the number kind of cell aren't you number times itself is always positive you're always adding here and then we're going to be undoing whatever this is I said I'm doing not necessarily subtracting because we can have some certain special circumstances so we'll talk about that a bit then we combine the number we didn't really want the first place with the number that's keeping this thing the same function and we would get exactly the same same function just written in a a different form something with a square root method will work and if you wanted to check your work you could distribute this and subtract seven and you're going to get exactly that that's where I need you to be right now all right so let's keep on going now we get this G of X x squared minus three X plus one we're looking at we're thinking it's a quadratic it's an upward-opening parabola it's probably going to have some x-intercepts but if we run into any eyes well then of course we wouldn't we'd have some imaginary solutions so when we're asked to solve for x intercepts here the first thing we're going to do like every time we have a quadratic and you're asked that question is we're gonna set this vein equal to zero everyone say what what's the method what would we go through the first thing we should try is the square root method it is the fastest and easiest but it only works if you have something raised to the second power with all containing all your X's and this is going to screw us up we solve for x squared we have an excellent strength equation it says the square root method will not work right now the next thing we would try to do so we try so you take us over here you'd say alright here's my negative three here's my one I'm trying to look for any numbers to add a negative three multiply the one and you go you can't you can't there's no numbers that add to negative three and multiply to positive one that's the whole point this thing is not factorable now why and why is that what is the problem here the problem is is that this one screws us up can't really change the negative three but we can hold off the one so here's the whole point of completing the square we love this form method it's really nice but it doesn't work right now this won't factor so what we're gonna do is we're going to kind of combine the ideas we're going to make this factor so that the square root method will work how we're going to do it is we're going to say this one that's screwing us up we're going to hold that off for a minute we're going to hold that way over here we're not losing notice that I've written it down I just don't want to consider it's here because it's not factorable we're gonna find something that is so here's how we find something that's factor well it's not super fun with fractions but I need you to think back to the last example in our last example when we didn't have this four we've thought about it we said alright what we want is we want to end with something that has the same factor twice what because you still want the square root method so we want this these numbers to be half of this one something plus itself equals what we will only have been given so we look at the floor and say I want two numbers that add before that are the same number it's going to be half of four I want two numbers that add to negative three that are the same number we go that's not easy it's like one and a half like negative one and a half yes it is half of three is one half or three halves and so half of negative three is negative three halves we need the same number twice in order for this to have the same factor twice to be written as a perfect square we need the same number twice that's investment imperative so we have that will okay that doesn't look nice but let's think about it if we wanted to remember to make this thing factor it would have to be a number that these two things multiplied to remember how this factoring works we add to this one we multiply that one so when we looked at our teacher said we want these numbers to be the same okay they're both two we need a number that when I write it here it's going to make this factor we know that these two numbers have to multiply to this number whatever it is two times two is four you're creating the number that you're adding to this equation so that you can make it factor that's what we're doing so we're looking here we're saying I mean my two numbers that are finding to both be the same they both gotta add a negative three it's got to be half of that but I've got to add to this expression right here on this side of my equation I've got to add to it something that makes my factoring work in order manufacturing work this never has to be the product of these that's the seam negative times a negative is a positive do you see where we're always adding 3 times 3 is 9 3 times 2 is 4 that be positive 9 fourths if I add that this right here is what we just created here it says this this right here is missing the number to make it factor what number to find the number if I add that in that now creates something that is fact we should be factorable we just created something that will give us a perfect square trinomial you don't have to worry about factoring this again because you made it in such a way that it's already factorable look what you did you said I want to hold off my mind 1 it's alright it should be plus I want to hold off my plus 1 I want this thing without my plus 1 to be factored what if that were to happen my middle term goes here I need my my two numbers I'm going to be the same in order to get a complete the square or a perfect square trinomial I need this number to be the product of these so if I multiply this that's the number that's missing it's already factored you already found what this thing is in fact it has in fact you found the number to make this happen so this would be X minus 3 house we know that and another X minus 3 halves or X minus 3 squared there's one thing that we have to do is perfect you just added 9/4 here we need to undo the 9/4 that you added so we held off the one we looked at the x squared minus three said I really want that to factor what's missing let's figured out what's missing is that would be a negative 3 we find numbers are the same that add up to that we multiply them to find the missing number it's always a constant find the missing number that's going to make this Factory complete as a perfect square cleans foil but when you add something you have to undo that and you can't just start adding random numbers in there so we add 9 force we subtract 9 force and you combine these two pieces so when you combine negative 9/4 and 1 let's see negative 9/4 + 4 4 is negative 5/4 so minus 5/4 equals 0 and now we have something that even though it's really ugly you can use a square method on it has a has this power too with all of our X's in it we can get a constant on one side if we take a square root on both sides with a plus of minus well simplify the right hand side so 5/4 will have a square root of 5 over 2 because square root of 4 is 2 someone move over here so X minus 3 times square root empower 2 are gone that's fantastic we'll get plus and minus square root 5 over 2 again squared 4 is 2 if we add 3 house we really do get two solutions think about it are they are the x-intercepts or the imaginary does this have business across the x-axis twice yes it does there are no eyes there's no imaginary complex zeros so we have x equals there's two ways to write it you can leave it as a fraction plus another fraction or because these have a common denominator you can't write this as no succumbing matter 3 plus square root of 5 over 2 and 3 minus square root of 5 over 2 if you've ever had any exposure to the quadratic formula that might look very very familiar to you what well they kind of ruined the surprise in the next video but I'm gonna prove the quadratic formula to you and you know how we're gonna do it do with completing the square might do this exact same thing but instead of having actual a is 1 B is four-season 83 we're gonna have a B and C being a B and C and we're gonna we're gonna do complete the square and we're going to get the quadratic formula from it which is why these answers can sometimes look very very very similar so I'm hoping that makes sense I'm hoping you're seeing the reason why I complete the square works most of the time what I've seen teachers do or textbooks do really is they say okay it's a process what you're going to do divide this number by two goes here multiply the numbers together you do this and then put this on the other side if you be equal I get that it does work but when you get to later levels of math people to completely miss this you know what what is it what's at for this adding for subtracting for this adding knife or subtract uniting force if you add something to an equation you can subtract it on the same side and it's going to keep that equation same as it was and that's what we're doing the other thing that I need to keep in mind is that when you're setting up your factoring you are forcing factoring where it shouldn't that doesn't already so you're fortunate as a factor by having the same number twice it's got always be the same you're always adding you're always undoing whatever you've done on the same set of equation and then we're making it so that the screwed method actually works in solving it so let's let's try one more and it will kind of make it harder all right let's take a look at the last one before we start deal with some some funky fractions there's one other principle I haven't explained yet that I need to explain in this problem so I'm going to walk you through it I'm gonna tell you exactly what we've done already and I'll talk about how our aid needs to be won and then the reason why that is as we go through so your face of this problem and says hey you gotta complete the square but you gotta prove to me that you play the square or you're later on in math like I don't know calculus too and you have to find some sort of a completeness squares you can make a problem happen so the first thing we're gonna do is we're going to set this equal to zero because we know that anytime we want to find x-intercepts roots zeros whatever we're gonna set our function equal to zero so we're gonna get 5x squared minus 10x plus two equal to zero and you know what we're going to try the screw method first is there a way to get a power to with all your exit inside of it and everything else that doesn't involve X's on the side answers now again this X right here says that the square root method will not work the way it is right now so we try factoring alright well let's let's try to factor if we try to factor then we would have negative 10 and we would have 10 because 5 times 2 would give us 10 you say they I know is there's no way that's happening there's nothing that adds new 10 and multiplies to positive 10 we don't have any numbers that do that so we're gonna start setting up completing the square now we're gonna do that by taking this 5x squared minus 10x plus 2 don't forget that plus 2 plus 2 equals 0 it's the same exact equation where instead of stuff so that we can force this thing to factor as a perfect square there is one drawback the only drawback is that that 5 is gonna really hurt because it's a lot harder to complete that when you can't use this nice direct shortcut do you remember the direct shortcut shortcut said if I divide this by 1 I get 1 X plus 2 1 X plus 2 same thing down here divide this by 1/8 of 1 1 X minus 3 halves X minus three halves of that actually workforce but it's fairly difficult to do that if we have to multiply to five alongside of our see that we're finding so we have to find this number and also make it multiply to five times that number we're gonna have an issue and so what happens is that completing the squares are best done if you're a is one because we can start using these nice shortcuts that I taught you in the previous videos so what we're going to do is we're going to factor out whatever this a is so our a here is five do not factor it from this number you don't have to so we're looking at saying it's an order one side first you're positive factor as it works your method doesn't work we're pulling off our X terms because we're going to make this factor we're holding back our plus two are constant and then we're gonna force this a factor but we're first going to make sure that our a is one that we're dealing with so we're gonna factor out a 5 we're going to get x squared minus 2x well this piece this piece is what you want to factor I kind of don't care about the 5 right now I just care about this do you see how much easier that makes it's like if you if you have a 5 there it's fairly difficult to figure out what you need to factor to make it a perfect square in that like it's not easy but if you have this well it's not it's not as easy if you have this without the 5 this is now pretty nice all we're gonna do is we're gonna take and that's my border so we're gonna do we're gonna force this to factor we're going to force this to factor with a negative - we're gonna say hey you know what if I want this to factor as something times itself I need two numbers are the same so we think what numbers are the same that add to negative two it's always got to be half of this number half of 4 is 2 half of negative 3 is negative 3 halves half of negative 2 is negative 1 and negative 1 those are the only two numbers are the same that add to negative 2 we also know that if we're going to complete this square this is missing a number that number has to be the product of these two so no limits that's one it's always positive if you multiply two numbers that are the same you will always be positive you're always going to be adding it in here so when we look at that me all right that's got to be plus one so if we add one what we've just done is we've forced this expression to follow the pattern that we needed to follow that we created so that will be factorable you don't have to worry about fabulous again you've already done it you said this these two numbers will add to my middle one these two numbers will multiply to my last one in fact you gave it the last number so that it would multiply so I know for a fact this is going to factor as X's there you go X minus 1 squared that's going to be the case now if you listen if you miss if you don't then don't miss this this is a one thing you gotta make sure that you don't miss otherwise you've been really frustrated what number did you add well it looks like added 1 but notice where that one is this is the hardest thing for students to grasp notice where that one is you added one bit chip but you added it in an expression a parenthetical expression that's being multiplied times 5 so wait a minute if you were to distribute this you would get x squared minus 10x this actually counts 4 minus 10x because that fine and you'd get plus 5 so in adding that one inside of a parenthesis you have to count on the distribution factor so when you distribute the specter that adding one actually turns into an adding five so how I always teach my students to do this as they hey mr. Biba's when you get when you distribute this you get plus five undo that so if this says five times positive 1 is positive five we need to undo by adding five you need to subtract five not one if you subtracted just one and then you distribute all this stuff in combined and it will not be what you start with exactly that now we know well if you want to try this right now 5x squared minus 10x plus five minus five oh wait plus five minus zero plus two that's exactly what we have it's a minus five that's necessary in order to make this factory consistent with what we had originally so we looked at we said it's in order but this very method factor does not work let's let's make it so that the factory is easy and it works let's factor out the five now we have something where you can complete the square we take a look at our our middle term on this three term polynomial that we're building right now we say I need these numbers to be the same great / - we say that the number I need to add has to be the product of those why because you made one of them if you're a nice one it's really easy to understand that these two numbers multiply into your a times C but one times whatever number I'm getting is still my C and that's why I'm adding when I add that be very careful if you have to distribute you know how to undo the distribution not just the number under the distribution now we see that this is okay I've got an X minus one squared I would still have my 5 as a coefficient I would now have a minus 3 equals 0 I'm combining these two minus 5 and minus 2 is minus 3 from there man we just solve it we saw the rest of the way if you want to and this is this is just the square root method if you want to do it you know you add 3/5 first we take a square root on both sides depending on whether your teacher needs you to rationalize the denominator or not you might have to rationalize it down denominator there's your square root of three over five multiplied by root 5 over 5 you can get square root of 15 over 5 and do that and then we would subtract 1 so negative 1 plus or minus square root of 3 fifths or negative 1 plus or minus square root of 15 over 5 whatever one of those ways you need to do the main concept I'm really concerned about is beating you down to here I've taught you discrete method already we're just isolating the square root the square take a square root on both sides with the plus and minus again two solutions in this case two real solutions there are no negatives inside square root so we don't have any eyes now with that in mind let me talk about that what if this had happened to be a don't change your word but what if this had been a plus well then when I subtracted it I would get it negative and I would have a negative here and would give me an eye right out in front of that square root that right there would tell me that I have no x-intercepts these would be two imaginary solutions that's important I need you to understand it I think that's about it for right now what we're going to do in just a minute is we're gonna we're going to come back we're gonna have at least two problems that are a little more challenging because they start off with fractions and I need to show you what you get with that all right so let's get after it so we have three more problems to do these ones are the toughest ones I could find or make up made up that one to see if we did it we can handle it the way it is without changing signs so what to do with when you have to factor out menus there so we're gonna take a look and say hey you know what on all these problems I'm gonna ask you to find x-intercepts or find zeros or roots complex or not and so we're gonna take all these problems are gonna say seven equals zero put them in order one side first term positive and see if the screw meant it'll work it does great if not try to factor it if not well then we honestly probably do go to quadratic formula but I'm going to show you completing the square so that you can do it so let's set this equal to zero and when we take a look at it and we really likes crude method work but it's going to happen that X messes is up and Factory no it's it's not going to factor because there's nothing that we can find that adds two thirds and multiplies to one at times negative one third and so what we're going to do is we're going to strip off that constant and we're gonna have this as x squared plus 2/3 X we're gonna have this minus one third over here equals zero you see the constant is what is messing up our factory we define a different constants of the factoring works so we're going to take a look at this part right here we're gonna find what number we can add to this to make factory work for us but make it work in a very specific way we want it to work so that we have this perfect square the same factor twice we rounded power to so that square root method will actually work so we take a look and say this is two-thirds right here is what I want to add to but if we're gonna have the same factor twice these numbers need to be the same now what in the world are they going to be if they're the same number that adds two thirds well it's gonna be half of two-thirds here's how to find half of a fraction either divide the numerator by 2 if that works evenly or multiply the denominator by 2 if you can't divide the numerator so in this case we look at the numerator and say hey 2 divided by 2 is 1 half of 2/3 is 1/3 or 2 times 3 or 100 is 6 2/6 is 1/3 so either way you go you're going to give this 1/3 of course 1/3 is half of 2/3 they're both positive because you are actually adding two positive 2/3 so we found the number that's gonna make this factor as the same factor twice so that we can put together as a perfect square that's perfect well we're missing is the number that we need to add here in order to make this factory work so what we know about that number we know that these two values that we found that add to I also have to multiply to your a which is 1 times C then never we're looking for we're looking for the C because we've made certain that our a is 1 so the dispatcher's very nice of course when we multiply these two numbers you get 1/9 if this number is always a times C and your a is always 1 and for this complete the square then 1 times this number is your C well 1 times 1 knife is one night and this is the number that we're going to add to this part of our equation to make the factory possible do you see it I hope you're seeing that when I add that it is now completing this process we knew what we had to have we just were missing it you're adding it so that this process that you just created works so this one's are gonna remember we have that same replaces like that you multiply here this is the number that's missing to make the factor impossible the way I want so we know that this is going to factor as X plus 1/3 and X plus 1/3 or X plus 1/3 squared I hope you're seeing what's missing writing on the board it's gotta be it on your head that we just added something and we never we never compensated for that so when we add in one night we're gonna have to distribute so one times one night okay we've added one night let's subtract one month on the left hand side over here well we know that this expression is factorable as X plus 1/3 squared we just showed that that's right here 2x plus 1/3 times X plus 1/3 our a is 1 the short that works very nicely for us let's see minus 1/9 minus 3 nights is minus 4/9 so this would be three nights 1/9 four nights if we sit man this is beautiful it's all it's a square root method is going to work perfectly if we add 4/9 to both sides if we take a square root on both sides with a plus and minus then X plus 1/3 equals plus or minus 2/3 and if we subtract 1/3 we get negative 1/3 plus or minus 2/3 and we know that we're going to get two solutions out here there's two real solutions so x equals negative 1/3 plus 2/3 negative 1/3 minus 2/3 well this X is going to be 1/3 and this x value is going to be let's see negative 1/3 minus 2/3 native 3 through this negative 1 so we have two x-intercepts we have one at positive 1/3 and one at negative one on the x-axis is up above the opening parabola now I did that because sometimes you're going to listen very carefully here here the words behind what I'm saying here would I actually do this for solving x-intercepts and answers and no no I wouldn't know I'm gonna show you that right now but the second part of it is is it still valuable to learn what we've done yes because later you may actually have to do this when you're not asked to solve for X intercepts so how do we do it what we do instead man every time you have an equation wouldn't you get rid of fractions don't you look at it and say hey my LCD is 3 let's multiply everything both sides times 3 that's going to give us 3x squared plus 2x minus 1 equals 0 0 times 3 is still 0 is that going to factor with 2 and negative 3 yeah you get 1 sorry backwards 3 and negative 1 as the two this multiplies of three if you divide by your a which is three here we get positive 1 over 1 we get negative 1/3 this says your Dunamis is you have 1 X plus 1 this says you have 3 X's minus 1 equals 0 if you set them equal to 0 X plus 1 would equal 0 3 X minus 1 would equal 0 X would equal negative 1 and X would equal positive 1/3 it's the same exact thing so what's ways easier probably the factoring is easier probably the factory is easier but again it's valuable to understand and especially if your teacher shouldn't make it you show this stuff here you gotta do to completing the square with a fraction now you know how to do that I hope that I made it easier for you to understand why you're doing what you're doing because sometimes it just becomes a process you know ok I just divide this by 2 and square it but I have no wine then I subtract this random number because told me to this is the reason why I hope you've seen that you were just making the factor I taught you earlier possible okay last less - we're going to have with whip through these as fast as we really can so I'm gonna show you the process special rattling again I hope you understand and that really what I'm going to intend to do is if you can't factor something give her your fractions first if you still can't factor something pretty much we're doing a quadratic formula here we're kind of just practicing so FX equals 3x squared plus X minus 1 half ago we're looking for we're looking for zeros x-intercepts roots so we're going to do 3 x squared plus X minus 1/2 equals 0 and we got set equals 0 that's on one side you know reversed from positive looks pretty good we say can the square root method work the way it is right now know that X messes it up can we factor the way it is right now no not really with fractions could you get rid of your fractions yes yes you could if you multiply both sides by 2 2 here and 2 over there we get I'll show you we get 6x squared plus 2x minus 1 equals 0 still now is the factoring going to work we have a 2 here we'd have a negative 6 here can you think of any numbers that multiply to negative 6 and add to 2 I'm not seeing it right now I can't think of anything that adds to negative 6 multiplied so sorry as a to both 986 so that's not working for especially wouldn't work like it did in the previous problem so what would you do now listen please get this if you're just looking for x-intercepts you probably would not complete the square here what you probably do is get rid of your fractions and do the quadratic formula which we haven't talked about do the quadratic formula from right here so I hope you pay attention on that one in like real-life situation you're rarely going to complete the square on this to find x-intercepts it just takes too long but you the quadratic formula would be quicker so that's what we would do in order to practice the square method or if you have this function and you have to complete the square on the function which does happen from time to time you can't change much about it well then this is great this is what the technique I'm showing you this is the reason why I'm not working on both sides of my equation you'll see that most textbooks will add to one side and add to the other side you keep it keep it stable if you rule balance let's keep it equal I'm not doing that because I want you to learn how to deal with one side deal with the function by itself without having to compensate with another side of the equation it doesn't exist so that's why I'm showing this way all right we're taking a look at it let's do the completing the square thing we're gonna take our 3x squared plus X we're gonna take this minus 1/2 and the equals 0 we're going to factor out a 3 from just here because we want this the the certain method to work by forcing us to factor but we also know that our K really has to be 1 in order for it is to use that shortcut very well so we're going to factor out 3 we know this is 3x squared plus X we have a missing number this is what we're finding this is factory for and saying hey here's a here's a 1/3 here's a 1/3 I need to find half of that number and you find the number that I can add to itself to give you 1/3 well it's gonna be pepper 1/3 how do you find half of 1/3 you either divide the numerator or you multiply the denominators so I can't divide the numerator easily but I can't multiply the denominator so 3 times 2 is 6 divide the numerator by 2 or multiply the denominator by 2 this is going to be 1/6 and 1/6 1/6 plus 1/6 is 2 6 sixes that's going to be 1/3 that right there says what this is going to factor as so this is going to be X plus 1/6 and X plus 1 6 because our a is 1 right now that's what we know it now the number that's missing to make this happen is whatever it's here we know that these numbers would have to multiply to our a times C since a is 1 this is just gonna be our C times C is C so since airs 1 whatever we get for our multiplications gonna go right there so let's see 1/6 times 1/6 is 136th we're gonna add one 36 but we're also gonna have to undo that now fig carefully what are we undoing here are we gonna undo want that in 136 no because we have a 3 here pretend to distribute 3 times 136th is let's see 336 that's 1/12 this is you basically added 1/12 3 times 31 over 36 is 1 or 12 that's what you added that's we're going to subtract minus 1/12 this is already senator factor we already completed it so we know that all that number did was say oh now this works because if you try to factor this leave it you'd have 1/3 here you'd have 1 over 36 you find two numbers add the 1 multiply to 1 over 36 that's 1/6 and 1/6 this is now factored Balazs X plus 1/6 squared we have a 3 up front - oh let's see - 1 12 minus 6 12 minus 7/12 we're going to add that 7 twelfths we're gonna add that 7 12 the next thing we do is before you take a square root here you have to divide that by 3 so when we do we divide by 3 we're gonna get X plus one-sixth squared equals if you divide this by 3 divide any fraction by 3 the same thing as multiplying by 1/3 remember that so we can multiply by the reciprocal so if you ever divide a fraction by a whole number just multiply the denominator by that whole number so if I divide 7 twelfths by 3 I'm really taking 3 times 12 36 37 36 now we're able to take a square root now we can have a plus and minus we can simplify and get this X plus one-sixth equals plus or minus the square root of 7 over 6 looks pretty familiar that something we did earlier and then we subtract 1/6 so negative 1 6 plus or minus the square root of 7 6 I showed you a couple ways you can write that the main thing is I need you understand there's two solutions here there are two x-intercepts they're not complex this is where this parabola is upward-opening somewhat narrow across the x axis twice this is the way that man in my opinion the best way to conclude the square without just using an arbitrary technique it's thinking about what it is you're doing what you're doing is you're you're factoring you're seeing this thing to factor by finding the missing constant that creates this perfect square factorization that you already have it down all right the last one and then we're going to we're gonna be doing a I changed it up just a bit I'm not going to go through this this les problem as solving it by if for an x-intercept I'm gonna do this problem like what you would see later on if you're forced to complete the square within a function so I'm gonna leave H of X here I'm going to validate the technique I'm using because a lot like I said most times you would you add the 1/12 on the other side of the equation I'm going to show you that the reason why I'm doing that in this example is because sometimes you get to do this out solver 0 so let's leave the H of X out there let's complete the square the way that it is so what are we gonna do well we're gonna hold out that negative 2x squared plus 5x I will put this in minus 7 way over there not forgetting about it but we're not we're just kind of kind of lose it for a second after that we're going to factor so there is 1 so that our shortcut works very well we understand that what we'd be getting multiplies to exactly the C 1 times C so we find that missing constant otherwise in kids becomes very difficult so we're gonna factor out negative 2 if we factor out a negative 2 we get x squared we get minus five-halves 5 divided by negative 2 is minus 5 halves X we're gonna be finding the same number here one thing I want to comment on if you did have this set equal to zero the first thing you do change all your sons you change all your sign and see if it's factorable with negative 5 and positive 14 you just change your sign so add need to make my subtract 5x at 7 & u so if you had zero equals much like getting rid of fractions first you remember that much like that you'd make sure everything's on one side in order first turn positive and that is already a whole lot easier to deal with you'd see if factoring works if it does great if it doesn't well then you would go ahead and you do quadratic formula right now I'm completing this with this actually it's a vegetable no it's not I think you would you would at least try that and then you do quadratic forms and probably okay so here we are we know that if that was a zero we just change your signs and go for it probably quadratic formula but now since we're completing the square we're going to go ahead we're gonna have our B term negative five-halves or understanding that I need these two numbers to add to that and be the same which means we're going to have half of this number that's the only way you find two numbers are the same that add to something is by half so negative five halves divided by two either divide the numerator or multiply the denominator by two that's going to be negative 5/4 and negative 5/4 that actually does Adam eight five halves negative ten fourths is negative five halves and now we find that number there's missing it you see this this isn't here this is there's no there's no see right now we're gonna find what this takes to make this factorable and then we're gonna add it in there to force this to happen so negative 5/4 times negative 5/4 is positive twenty five sixteenths that is what we're missing so we're gonna take this we're gonna add that twenty five sixteenths this is now factorable according to what you found the problem is you just added twenty five sixteen here's the issue I hope that you're seeing it did you really add be very careful because this negative 2 is going to distribute by adding 25 16 you really want negative 2 times 25 16 is negative 25 8 to 16 cross value getting negative twenty five eighths that is what you've actually subtracted I know it's a little weird but if you were to tribute this he'd have negative 2x squared you have plus 5x and you would have minus 2 times 25 16 this would subtract twenty five eighths you need to add that so we're distributing and then undoing that distribution by distributing you find out that you really subtract your twenty five eighths you're adding that back you're undoing the distribution here we kind of did the same thing with our even with our r1 you said hey 1 times 1/9 is one knife you need to subtract adding the 1/9 three times 36 is whatever that was one twelfth year I'm doing the 112 negative two times twenty five sixteenths is negative twenty five eighths okay we're adding twenty five eighths you're undoing that distribution then we're gonna combine our like terms which are constants over here we're going to factor as X minus it's already factored you already have X minus 5/4 squared we know that we had a negative two and then we're from a on senior twenty five eighths minus seven minus thirty-one eights and that looks really nasty but if you had to complete the square our function written as a completed square it's pretty darn nasty if you had to set that equal to zero you could use that to now find whatever your your x-intercepts would be there they'd still be some x-intercepts there they're gonna be kind of ugly but you could certainly find them so I hope this makes sense I hope at least what it does illustrate the way to complete the square it works not that you use it all the time so Matthew cut anything on this lesson it was it's this number one completing the square is taking factor and making it happen number two when it gets hard like this mostly for finance internships we're going to be using quadratic formula that's the way that we do it we look at this and say can you use the square root method if not try factoring if not go to quadratic formula complete the square roots of rare that we do it to find x-intercepts I taught it to you so that it wouldn't be the scary thing and because you do use it as you go to later on in mathematics oh I hope I've got a good job explain that to you hope you guys are having a wonderful day and next video I'm going to show you a proof of what the quadratic formula comes from by completing this work you
