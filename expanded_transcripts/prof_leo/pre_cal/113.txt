Transcript for: How to Graph Basic Polar Equations (Precalculus - Trigonometry 41)
welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about how to graph some of these polar equations that we've been working with um it'll it'll be basic in this video kind of more brief as much as i can make it i'm just really what they mean getting used to looking at this and kind of seeing what happens by transforming these into rectangular equations for now just so that we can get a picture that we're more used to in that way i intend to make it so that when you look at that you can see that's a circle with a radius of three you go how are they going to do that because it kind of tells you that but getting these into rectangular equations can make it clearer for now in the next video we're going to go a lot deeper we'll talk about symmetry how to use symmetry to graph some fairly advanced polar equations and really get some cool pictures out of it that would be a lot more difficult to graph with rectangular equations so for now these basic ones might be a little bit nicer rectangular we'll get a picture what they are we'll graph that picture and get more used to what these things are as polar so in order to do that there's some kind of identities that we are used to that we're going to be using and they're they're right here on the board we really need to be pretty familiar that x squared plus y squared equals r squared it's the pythagorean theorem or pythagorean identity when you apply it to right triangle trigonometry we need to be really clear that r cosine theta is x and the reason why that is is because cosine theta is x over r so x is our cosine theta y is our sine theta because sine theta is y over r and tangent theta is x over y and we can use all those things we will use all those things and we're going to jump right into it let's take a look at our first polar equation r equals 3. we're going to get a picture what this looks like by changing this into rectangular coordinates that is something that you can do oftentimes to get a really clear picture is with some basic equations change them into rectangular there's some things we can do in order to do that one thing we can do is if r equals 3 we really like seeing r squared if you don't have any cosines or sines flying around we really like to see r squareds in our equations we can do things like multiply both sides by r we can do things like square both sides so if r equals 3 let's square both sides and get r squared equals 9. now that we have that because r squared equals x squared plus y squared we can immediately translate this into a rectangular equation that's something that we can do to get used to polar equations a little bit more is translate these into rectangular something we're used to because r squared is x squared plus y squared that lets us say x squared plus y squared equals nine now what in the world is that if you've ever seen conic sections which i've taught before in our intermediate algebra uh portion of this this video series is x squared plus y squared is a circle if x squared plus y squared equals r squared this is x squared plus y squared is a circle with a radius squared this is the square of the radius so our radius would be three this is a circle circle centered at the origin notice there's no shifting there's no addition no subtraction no parentheses within that that next to our x or next to our y being squared this is not shifted it's a circle with a center of the origin and a radius of three so how do we draw that if we have a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 3 our center would be right here and a radius of 3 would go up down left and right 3 we're just getting a circle so maybe now we can see that if you were to take that original polar equation think about what r is r is the distance from the pole to a point and you say okay where's the theta there is no theta which means that for any theta ever your r is just going to be three the distance from the pole to whatever graph you're doing whatever function you're getting is three well that's a circle if we keep this distance from the pole to our function at three regardless of what our our theta is regardless what our angle is it says for any angle you have this distance from the pole to your graph of three you're certainly going to get a circle that's exactly what that says it just really says your radius is three from the pole that r is constant you're going to get a circle out of that i hope it makes sense i hope that when when you're seeing this as x squared plus y squared it's a little more clear kind of solidifying a thought of that is a circle just with a radius of 3. what if we don't have a constant radius like we had before what if we have a constant angle a constant theta saying you will always have this angle of pi over 4. maybe start thinking about what that means if your angle is always pi over 4 from our polar axis always like this what would that do regardless of what the r is says r can be anything positive negative you're just going to hold this angle true what that what is that going to give you now we're going to translate this into rectangular equation so that we can see this a little more clearly but how would we do it well the only thing that really we can do here is take a look at tangent maybe we can take tangent of both sides of our equation generally that's what we do with with theta because there's a way to translate tangent theta into something rectangular very very nicely so let's take tangent of both sides tangent of pi over four is really nice tangent of pi over four is just one but tangent of theta is something that we should recognize tangent of theta is y over x so let's translate that tangent both sides cool tangent pi over 4 1 tangent theta is y over x and we've just translated this into a rectangular equation if we multiply both sides by x we just get y equals x now now put this together ask you to remember something ask you really think about this for a second if you held this angle at pi over 4 it says here's your angle of pi over 4 basically 45 degrees and regardless of your r i don't care what that is you're going to keep that angle so r can be anything but it's got to be on that angle that's going to give you a diagonal line look at your rectangular equation y equals x is your diagonal line you go through 1 1 2 2 3 3 negative 5 negative 5. you're just getting diagonal line right through that origin this is y equals x it's also the graph of the line where theta is pi over four anytime you see this angle being held constant you are going to get one of those diagonal lines it says regardless of what your r is positive negative it'd be somewhere along this angle this ray in both directions let's move on to r sine theta equals two so this might be a little harder to see hopefully you've seen that hey if your r is constant that's just a radius you're going to get a circle centered at the origin center at the pole if your angle is constant you're just going to get a diagonal line going through the pole why well because this is holding that angle constant the whole time regardless of what your r is you're going to get that diagonal line that's a little more challenging to see so let's translate this into a rectangular equation let's look at r sine theta and see what that actually means here so r sine theta says that's y we can translate this right now into rectangular equation by saying r sine theta is y that was really nice we're really familiar with y equals 2 y equals 2 is a horizontal line constant at 2. well that's exactly what that is but notice in terms of why it's constant like the y variable would be held constant regardless of what x is but in terms of your polar equation both r and theta would have to change to get the points on that line so for this point right here your angle would be pi over 2 your r would be 2 but for this point over here your angle would be well something different and your r would change as well both of those things change and what this should tell you is that there's benefits depending on what we're dealing with if we have a circle it's really nice just to hold our r constant and say that's in a polar equation that's really easy if we have a diagonal line it's either way you're fine you can have y equals x it's pretty easy to graph you can also say let's just hold our angle constant and we're going to get every point along the angle as soon as we start getting constants in terms of rectangular equations they're a little bit easier to deal with so y equals 2 that's really nice it just holds your y constant you're getting a horizontal line if we do have this in terms of polar it's a little more challenging because both your angle and your r have to change to get the points on that line for for rectangular only your y has to stay the same and your x has to be anything you can hold that y constant okay last one r cosine theta equals negative three we're taking a look over here maybe it's a little bit nicer change this into rectangular get a picture of this r cosine theta is x let's change this to x equals negative 3. for constants in terms of x and y rectangular equations are a lot nicer because we have to change both the angle and the r to get this vertical line at negative three for circles for even diagonal lines things that are held constant in terms of angles or in terms of circles it's easier for polar equations to represent that so for us we got this x equals negative 3 we know that's a vertical line where x is held constant regardless of what the y is y can be anything you're just going to hold this at x equals negative three um that's exactly what this is telling you but in terms of polar equations both your angle and your r would have to change in order to get the points on that vertical line you'd have to have an angle changing and r getting shorter and shorter and shorter and shorter until that point and then longer and longer and longer until all the rest of those points hope it's making sense i hope that you you really understand what's going on with these basic basic polar equations translating them to rectangular can help us get a picture of what they are but the only thing i really want you to come away with right now is that uh four circles with a constant radius for angles that are held constant sometimes polar can be quite nice to look at makes it a little bit easier for y's being held constant for x is being held constant for those those constant lines in rectangular equations those are a little bit nicer c because they're a little harder to find with two changing variables in polar equations all right let's try two more so we're going to translate these into rectangular equations so we can get a better picture of it without having to understand exactly what that means as a polar equation just yet now in the next video that's going to be a little bit taxing to do a little bit too hard to translate into something usable for a rectangular equation and so we're going to learn how to graph these with with symmetry but that's the next video for right now we're just going to get a real handle on it so let's take a look at r equals 4 sine theta now one thing i really want you to grasp because sine is related to y this is going to somehow be affecting the y-axis and we're going to see that we're going to see that this is going to be a shift up on the y-axis this is going to be a shift left on the x-axis why because cosine has to do with x and y has to do with sine in fact positive is going to be a shift up negative is going to be a shift left that's going to bear out as we work with this but i want that in your head so what in the world we're going to do to translate this into a rectangular equation we've kind of already done that in previous videos but there's a few things that we can do such as we really like getting r squares we really like getting r sine theta because r squared you can change into x squared plus y squared and r sine theta we can change that into y so it's appropriate to be able to to multiply both sides by r so let's do that multiply both sides by r we're going to get r squared and 4 r sine theta now with the r squared that's nice we got x squared plus y squared directly from that on the right hand side r sine theta is equal to y now in order to really use this there's a couple things that we have to do number one thing is we've got to get this all on one side and make it look like the circle that it is make it look like generally a conic section that we get if we're going to translate this into rectangular equations so we're going to subtract 4y now while that helps us a little bit get things organized it doesn't really show us what exactly is going on you see this isn't a perfect picture of a circle yet in order to get there you really have to have all the stuff with x's being squared and all the stuff with y's being squared which means you might have to complete the square i forgot how to do that firstly i've got videos on that you can look back and figure out how to complete the square but secondly it's not that bad for here and we're going to be completing the square with each variable that needs it now our x this is all the x's that are up there everything's being squared but this y is really screwing us up so we're going to complete the square with the y variables if you don't remember how to do that i'm going to give you a real crash course on it basically we're trying to com make this be factorable as a perfect square if you remember all about like diamond problem or the the creating this three term um polynomial that you can factor as a perfect square this would act as your middle term so we'd think y squared minus 4y plus nothing there's nothing there we want to add something here to make this perfectly factorable so we're going to do that if that's negative four that would act like your middle term we're looking for two numbers that add to negative four and have the same signs because we're trying to make a perfect square like y minus some number y minus some number that's the same number so that we can make it y minus that number squared well in that case it's really just half of that number it's going to be negative 2. now what's this last term this last term is whatever these numbers multiply to so positive 4 in this case what all this says is that we're missing positive 4. if positive 4 were up there then this would be perfectly factorable so we're going to do that we're just going to force this thing to add 4. now that's a problem though you see if you just add 4 into an equation it's no longer equal to the other side you have one of two things that you can do you can either subtract four use this to factor and have a negative four or you can add four to both sides and thereby keep this equal so that's what we're going to choose to do in this case because we really like having our x's and y's on one side and everything that's going to become a radius a constant on the other side so we've said hey let's complete the square with the y's that way we can get all of our y stuff to the second power it'll be easier to identify a shift that way in order to do it we say that acts like a middle term and that's missing something all right if that's a middle term these two numbers would have to add to it and if i want to keep it a perfect square i need to have them be the same but they also multiply to this last term so this is the number that's missing so we add it so taking a look just at this piece we're going to add 4 to this side for the reason we just explained we're going to add 4 to this side to keep it equal you can't just add 4 to one side of an equation without doing it to the other side so we're adding 4 to both sides this part is now perfectly factorable we just saw that we saw that yeah if i if i add 4 in there this is going to create this possibility for us to factor it as y minus 2 squared on the right hand side 0 plus 4 is 4 and we have this x squared out front this is what we're looking for to identify really conic sections is all the things with x being squared all the things that had y's being squared now what in the world is this this is a circle that's been shifted but notice where it's being shifted i really need to remember transformations right now to understand that everything inside of parentheses shifts opposite of what you want it to do along with that stuff next to x's affects x stuff and stuff next to y affects y stuff so like x plus or minus some number is going to be a horizontal shift inside of parentheses y plus or minus number is going to be vertical shift it's along the y that's what the y is telling you stuff next to y affects the y stuff next to x affects the x once you have in parenthesis but it's opposite of what you want it to be so this minus 2 says i'm going to shift along the y axis but it's going to be opposite of what your brain probably wants to think this is not a downshift this is an upshift along the y-axis of two units it is a circle you have x squared you have y squared and that's r squared it's going to be the square of your radius the radius here is two so if we're going to shift up 2 then the center of our circle which this is is at 2. if it has a radius of 2 which that's what that says we're just going to draw a circle shift it up two units and call it good that's what this is telling us it's saying your x has not though the center of the circle has not shifted along the x it's still right at x equals zero it has shifted up remember it's opposite up on the y-axis two units no problem has a radius of the square root of that number which is two and that's exactly what we've shown so that's what this represents r equals four sine theta says this is a circle shifted up two units with a radius of two along the y because sine represent is related to our y of those two units all right last one we're going to do something very similar i just want to show you what a shift along the axis looks like so r equals negative 2 cosine theta it doesn't look all that great but we can change this into rectangular by multiplying multiplying both sides by r that way we'll get an r squared on the left hand side we'll get an r cosine theta on the right because r squared is x squared plus y squared we can translate this side into rectangular really nicely on the right hand side we've got negative 2 and r cosine theta is x we're going to do something very similar to the last example and we're going to get everything on one side and use completing the square to get our x's as something squared that way it represents a circle better so we've got x squared plus 2 x e plus y squared equals 0. everything in terms of y is being squared already so we don't have to worry about that but this x is kind of messing us up we really need all of our x's in parentheses being squared to identify a circle what that means is we've got to do that completing the square so we're going to take a look just at the x's here if that's a middle term of some uncompleted polynomial that has to be a perfect square then i would get a positive two here the numbers that would have to be the same that add up to that two are both positive one would have to multiply to this missing number right there which would be one so we're missing one get that if i put a one right there then this would have a one this would factor perfectly as x plus one squared that's exactly what we're trying to do but in order to add that one if i want to complete that square hence completing the square if i'm missing the one and i need to add it in here i can't just do it to one side doesn't make sense i would have to do to both sides of an equation to keep it equal so on the right hand side 0 plus 1 is just 1. but on the left hand side i've now completed this as a perfect square trinomial so x squared plus two x plus one here's the two here's the one those are the same number that cause it to factor that would be x plus one quantity squared i already had the y squared but now everything in terms of x is in parentheses being squared everything in terms of y is well you could think of parentheses being squared and we have a constant on the other side this is a circle but identify what's going on firstly maybe identify the radius so x squared stuff plus y squared stuff equals the radius squared the radius is the square root of that number the square root of one is one so we got a radius of 1. now think about where this is shifting there's no numbers in parentheses next to the y so this is not shifting up it's not shifting down there is numbers next to the x in parentheses being squared that means we're shifting left or right however everything in parentheses with transformations is opposite of the sign so even though this one is next to the x saying you're shifting along the x it's not right one it's the left one i hope you can see a lot of students make that mistake it's super easy to make a mistake but this is a shift left one unit next to x along the x opposite of the sign shifted left one unit and now we use our radius our radius is one so from that center that we just shifted from the origin we're just going to draw a circle with a radius one and that's really all there is to it so we've been able to change our polar equations into rectangular get a better picture and that's that's really possible with these basic ones we can change all of them and get a decent idea about what it looks like constant r would be a circle with centered at zero with just a radius of whatever that r is constant theta is just a diagonal line with whatever angle related to the polar axis when we start to change when we start having to change both the r and and cosine thetas into things we generally get circles that are shifted and our rectangular equations will show that it's just a little more work past these things it is actually easier to leave them as polar equations and use symmetry so in the next video i'm going to talk about that i'll show you why it's a little bit harder to to deal with rectangular equations it starts getting pretty nasty but then when we deal with polar and symmetry and what exactly happens with sine and cosine involving symmetry like even in oddness it becomes a little bit easier so we'll talk about that graphing some more advanced polar equations without having to change them into rectangular next time you
