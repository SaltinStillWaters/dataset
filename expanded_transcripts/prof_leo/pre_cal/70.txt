Transcript for: Geometric Sequences (Precalculus - College Algebra 71)
welcome to another video now that we have talked about arithmetic sequences and arithmetic series it's time to jump on to another very very common sequence and series called a geometric sequence and from there we're going to talk about geometric series when we add up the terms of that geometric sequence on which it's based so we'll talk about what exactly a geometric sequence means how it's built how to figure them out uh from one term or maybe two terms um deal with what the the the the sequence should look like formulaically and then next video we'll talk about the series how to add those terms up there's some really interesting formulas that we get we'll talk about something called convergence and Divergence of a series that's about it so what a geometric sequence is it's actually quite similar to an arithmetic sequence except that where when you had an arithmetic sequence what you did to get from term to term is you added you added the same number over and over and over and over and over again term by term by term and term by term you added the same thing over and over again and therefore you had what was called a common difference which meant if you took two successive terms and you subtracted them you're going to do the same thing over and over and over again that was what number you're adding well we have something similar except instead of adding the same number over and over and over again we're multiplying so geometric sequences and series are built on the idea of taking some starting number and multiplying to get to the next term and the next term by the same number over and over and over now that number that you're multiplying by is is called the common ratio and the idea goes back to an arithmetic sequence and says all right arithmetic sequence if I took two terms and I subtracted that's going to give me the number that I'm actually adding well if I take two terms here and I divide them the second term by the first term or the third term by the second term or the fourth term by the third term and I divide them it will give me the number that I'm actually multiplying to get to term to term to term to term so what we need to know is very similar to arithmetic you need to know where you start you need to know what number you are multiplying to get to the next term and every subsequent term after that that number that you're multiplying is called the common ratio because when you divide two successive terms it's going to give you the same fraction every time now sometimes we get a whole number but it still is a fraction common same ratio fraction I hope you're seeing the similarity between this and arithmetic sequences they're built the same way except instead of adding over and over we are multiplying over and over and over you still need to know a starting spot and that's what all this says so it's a sequence or the ratio between any two successive terms is constant called the common ratio so what we're going to do we're going to take a look at these examples we're going to figure out which ones are arithmetic which ones are geometric and which ones are neither um sometimes you have a sequence that has a definite pattern but you don't exactly know well you maybe do know what it is but you don't have the ability to call it arithmetic or geometric because it doesn't fit that that model and so let's take a look at these when we take a look at something like this 2 -6 1854 162 if we're trying to classify this maybe we try to figure out if it's arithmetic first arithmetic means that you're adding the same number over and over again how you can always determine if you have an arithmetic sequence is take two terms and subtract them this minus this so -6 - 2 is8 okay take these two terms 18 -6 is not8 that's 24 well if you don't get the same common difference then you're not adding the same number over and over again obviously we're not doing that if I had to add from 2 to -6 well that would be8 and then -68 I'd have I'd have to add 24 well that's definitely not a common difference this is not arithmetic let's see if this one's arithmetic from 2 to 9 I'm adding let's see seven from 9 to 16 I'm adding 7 from 60 16 to 23 I'm adding 7 from 23 to 30 I'm adding 7 this is arithmetic this would be a sequence like we dealt with two videos ago this is an arithmetic sequence because the common difference if I were to subtract two successive terms 9 - 2 7 16 - 9 7 23 - 16 7 30 - 23 7 do you see how taking two terms and subtracting them is giving me the number I'm adding over and over and over again this would be arithmetic with a common difference of seven it's not geometric because I'm adding to get from term to term to term let's go back to this one for a second now since it's not arithmetic maybe we think about it being geometric can I multiply to get from here to here to here to here to here we can think of it one of two ways sure you could think what do I multiply by to get from 2 to -6 uh that be-3 can I keep doing that 6 -6 * -3 well that would be POS 18 * is a positive 18 * -3 well that's 54 * -3 that's 162 that is what's happening this is definitely a geometric sequence but you can also think about it this way if you take any two successive terms and divide them so -6 / pos2 or 18 ID -6 or-54 / 18 or 162 /54 in each case we get get the same number the number that you get by dividing is the same that common ratio is the same number that you are actually multiplying to get from term to term to term so this is definitely geometric because we have the same exact ratio between any two successive terms meaning you are multiplying by the same number over and over and over and over and over again to get term by term by term the next term could be found by multiplying by another neg3 and another neg3 and another neg3 this is geometric with a common ratio of -3 the common ratio is called R so when we hear that word that common ratio common difference was D it was a d because it was a difference and it's a term we're actually adding from term to term to term the common ratio is called R for ratio and it stands for the number you're multiplying in a geometric sequence from term to term to term in our case it's just3 that's really the difference between arithmetic and a geometric arithmetic you're just adding whatever number you're adding over and over and over again that's D that's your common difference um geometric you're just multiplying so whatever number you're multiplying by over and over and over and over again to get that sequence that's your common ratio that's R you of course can find them by subtracting two successive terms and it's the same for all of them you arithmetic sequence or dividing two successive terms it's the same for all of them every pair you have a geometric sequence now how the next one so 1 2 4 7 11 16 well we can try let's try geometric first in order to get from 1 to 2 I would multiply by two that's great in order to get from two to four oh I'd multiply by two that that's also great maybe this is geometric in order to get from four to seven I'd multiply by two no so even though the first two terms if I were to divide them 2 / 1 is 2 and 4 / 2 is 2 but 7 / 4 is not 2 and in order for this to be called a certain type of sequence you can't say like oh it's geometric for a little while and then athetic for a little while and then I don't know for a little while doesn't really work um so it has to maintain the same exact pattern if you're going to call it one of these things so this common ratio would be well the a ratio would be two and two and then not two this fails to be geometric because I'm not multiplying by the same number to get from term to term to term I'm not actually multiplying at all do it from term to term to term it looks like it may betimes 2 * two time but that right there starts failing it this is not geometric so maybe we try arithmetic and all right well let's try to add so if I was adding from here to here I would add one from here to here I would add two that already fails because a common difference for arithmetics says I should be able to take 2 - 1 and 4 - 2 and 7 - 4 and get the same thing that's what a common difference would do for arithmetic that was the last video 2 - 1 is 1 4 - 2 is 2 7 - 4 is three well wait a minute that's not common that's not the same number being added to go from term to term to term in fact there is a pattern here but it's not geometric it's not arithmetic we've taken geometric off the board this proves it's not arithmetic the pattern is you'd add one then two then three then four then five then six probably you're going to add seven next it would be 29 then eight then nine then 10 you're just adding successive integers on that U we could certainly find a a sequence for that but it's not something that we're actually studying by name here so that's the way we go ahead and determine whether or not something's geometric or arithmetic or neither you just try them just see if you're multiplying the same number divide two successive terms just do it for all the pairs um see if you're arithmetic by adding the same number just subtract successive terms see the same um or if you get this this would be neither arithmetic nor geometric the next one is is a little bit easier than what we've done so far hopefully you can look at this and just say well um I'm fairly certain I know what that's going to be because we have the starting spot of seven now think how you get to 14 and think how from 14 to 28 28 to 56 are you adding the same number every time 7 + 7 gives us 14 + 7 is not 28 so it's not arithmetic let thing geometric 7 time what gives us 14 * 2 14 * 2 gives us oh 28 28 * 2 gives us 56 if I were to divide this uh it's Pair by pair 14 divided 7 is 2 28 divided 14 is 2 56 divided 28 is 2 our common ratio for this geometric sequence is two now what's kind of interesting is that much like arithmetic sequences did a geometric sequence has this this very uh repeatable pattern and so repeatable you can has a formula so there is a a model for every geometric sequence all we need to know is what the first term is and what our common ratio is now just like we did arithmetic sequences I really want you to see why there's an N minus one here so think about this if you burn up one term by starting somewhere a sub one then how do you get to your 100th term well if this is where you start and this is how many times you have to multiply to get to whatever term you want then let's say I wanted to get to the 100th term if I want to get to the 100th term I start somewhere that's one term I would need to multiply by 99 RS to get to the 100th term I'm going say that one more time in just a slightly different way by taking up one value by a starting number in order to get to whatever term you need it's one less uh one less iteration of multiplication than the index than the index you're trying to find so so again for the 100th term I'm using one as my starting term and I need to multiply once to get the second term twice to do the third term 99 times you the 100th term this is losing one of those NE it's it's taking away one um necessary multiplication because you're starting with one of those terms so we would say all right if I know that my common ratio is two and my starting value is seven then I can easily write this in terms of a geometric sequence I can say that this sequence is take your starting value you don't necessarily need parentheses but you're going to see it a lot especially with fractions take your common ratio that's the number you're multiplying over and over and over again to the N minus one do not multiply that and give me 14 please break an order operations you can't do it now does it work if I wanted to find the third term check this out if I want to find the third term is 28 if I want to find a sub3 think about what that would mean a sub3 says I would take seven as my starting term how many times would you have to multiply by two to get your third term well if this is my starting term that counts as one I'd multiply by two once for 14 and twice for 28 not three times that's why there's a minus one right there and this would actually work uh 3 - 1 is 2 2 the 2 power is 4 and 7 * 4 would be 28 I hope I'm making that make sense to you that you're you're only having to multiply by one less iteration of that common ratio than the term you actually want to find so now we can find any term though so if I actually you find like the 10th term man this is really nice because you wouldn't have to continue this pattern say multiply by two two two and then like four more twos or five more twos you wouldn't have to do that all you'd say if you wanted to find the 10th term we know where we're starting seven and if we're starting at seven we would have to multiply by two nine times to get to the 10th term this takes up the first term I need nine iterations of multiplication repetitions order to get to the 10th term so that would be 7 * 2 9th so we figure out 2 the 9th and then multiply by seven whatever that is that is your 10th term and you can do this with any term that you want to with the geometric sequence very similar idea to arithmetic we're just multiplying over and over again let's go back to this geometric sequence and see if we can write that one so in order to write any geometric sequence we need to know where we start and what our common ratio is we already found our common ratio but if we know where we start if we take a look at that and understand that our starting value our first term is two then our geometric sequence can be modeled by our starting number times our common ratio to one less than the N term so n minus one and this actually does work if I want to find the 1 2 3 four fifth term I'd start at two I would need to multiply by -3 let's see 1 2 3 four times let's see if that works plug in your five start at -2 that counts as one 5 - 1 is 4-3 4 power is postive 81 81 * 2 is 162 it works just fine this works very well so let's go ahead we're going to do uh three more examples these two and then one more where I give you two terms I'll show you a special way to deal with that and then uh then we're done this is all we have to deal with in geometric sequences then we'll add them up in our Series so if you were to look at that how do we know when something is geometric well we can always divide two successive terms or think about what number I'm multiplying over and over again so how do I get from -3 to 1 now that might be kind of tricky to think of multiplication sometimes it really does benefit us to just divide all of our successive terms and see if it works out at the same Comm ratio so if I take one divided by three notice is always that way it's always the second term divided by the first or the third term divided by the second the next term divided by your current term so this one divided by that one 1 /3 or- 1/3 / 1 or 1 9th / 1/3 1 / -3 well that's 13- 13 ID 1 well something divid 1 gives you back that something that's- 13 that's looking pretty good this one we probably want to verify maybe multiply by nine as an LCD 1 9th * 9 is 1 - 1/3 * 9 is -3 and we get -3 1/3 for every single time we comp comp two successive terms that is a common ratio so that's the reason why we do in this order um we want to make sure that when we divide we're actually getting the common ratio we don't want to divide -3 by one to get -3 because that would make us assume that R is3 it's not if we divide in the order I've just told you take the second divide by the 1 the third divide by the second the fourth divide by the third it'll always give you out your common ratio and you don't have to change it our common ratio is 13 with our first term of -3 we can easily go ahead and model this with a geometric sequence we know it's geometric because it gives us a starting spot and it gives us the same exact multiplication term by term of 1/3 so our geometric sequence says you'd start at -3 you'd have -3 to the nus1 and that's perfectly appropriate there are a couple ways you can manipulate that um but this is just fine for most of our cases so starting number3 that's what this says right here and then your common ratio 1/3 we figured that out to the N minus one again remember that what this says is this takes up your starting position your first term therefore you need one less multiplication than the term you're trying to reach now what happens when they give you U some term uh but not the starting one but they do give you the common ratio can you figure out an arithmetic sequence from that it's actually not that hard to do we just need to remember what this says so this says any term that you want is modeled by that sequence well let's plug in the things we know what do we know we know that the sixth term is 243 so if I put 243 for my term that I know I know that's 243 while I don't know my first term I do know my common ratio and I also know that 243 is the sixth term so my n has to be six so my term that I know is 243 and that represents the sixth term in that sequence so let's just fill out the formula after that you should be able to see that this is pretty nice to solve for it's not all that bad so this is 243 = a sub 1 -3 to the 5th power is - 243 and if you divide both sides by - 243 you're going to get a sub1 is1 now this allows you to plug this into this formula so we now know the general formula for that sequence we know the first term is1 you generally would want to write the negative 1 but I'm showing that to you here you know your common ratio and that would be the form of our of our sequence we have our first term and our common ratio to the N minus one power that's about all there really is to it you're just trying to figure out from your sequence what your com what your first term is you need that and then you need to know what your common ratio is from here on all these examples you should very very easily be able to find whatever term you want if you want to find the 50th term you just plug in 50 or find the 50th term here plug in uh plug in 50 wherever right here wherever that that says to do so find the seventh term whatever we're just plugging in n and then using that formula to find the specific term of the sequence so I'm going to come back with one more and then we'll move on to our series let's try one more so what happens when they say you have a geometric sequence but they don't give you the common ratio and you really can't find it easily we got to set up something from our our our formula for it and then use not really a system but some way to set these things equal to find our first term and to find our common ratio so I'm going to show you one way to do this there are other ways to do it I'm just showing you one so if you know this is geometric and it says I want you to find the formula for it let's start using this and fill it as much as we can from the information we're provided so if we know that our nth term is a sub1 r to nus1 and we know an n a term like a third term and we know the value of it well we can set that up so we know that 1/3 is I don't know the first term I don't know the common ratio but I know that's going to be a three so 1/3 is our term I don't know my first term I don't know my common ratio but I know this would represent the third term and we'd have to multiply two iterations of that common ratio to achieve 1/3 I also the same or something very similar here I know that the sixth term equals 81 now I know I still know the first term I still know the common ratio but what we do have here is the ability to set parts of this equal and so here's what I'm going to do what I'm going to do is I'm going to solve this solve both of these for a sub one and set them equal to one another we can also solve for one and set them equal and divide by a sub one but uh some it looks a little funny and it feels like you're divided by variable you're not because it's a constant but I like this a little bit better it doesn't really matter which is why I said there's multiple ways to do this um but I'm going to solve this for a sub one so if we do if we divide by R 2 and we divide by R 5 multiple ways you can solve for for this by dividing by different things um but if you have this and that's the first term and this and that's the first term then if you've solved for something you know has to be equal you can set these two things equal to one another now it might look a little funny but think about this this is a proportion and you can cross multiply and set equals so 3 R 2 * 1 or 1 * a81 R to the 5th or realize that 1 over some variable equals 1 over some other variable these two variables have to be equal anyway you go you're going to get 3 R squ = 81 R 5 now what we generally don't want to do with variables we generally don't like to divide both sides by a variable because it could equal zero now our common ratio can't equal zero it's impossible it's it's a constant um it's not zero because otherwise you would get zero every single time that's not going to happen so we are perfectly okay dividing both sides by 3 R 2 all right so 1 = 27r 3 power well wait a minute can you isolate that power three yeah sure let's divide by 27 and when we take a cube root we're going to get 1/3 and that shows us what our common ratio is from here you have to go back and solve for your your first term this is why I like writing it like this it's it's already solved for you we just have to plug in 1/3 here so if we do be careful on your fractions but if you plug in 1/3 1 13 2 is 1 9th so I'm using just like kind of a substitution or system of equations Works many times I'm using this as solve for a sub 1 it's Sol for my first term I'm plugging in my R because now I Know It r^ 2 is 1 9th 3 * 1 9th is 13 so 1 nth 3 * 1 n is 1/3 and 1 / 1/3 is 3 so we now know our common ratio we now know our first term and this is pretty easy to be able to um to write this as as our our geometric sequence so we'd say our geometric sequence is our first term that's three times our common ratio that's 1/3 to the N minus one now there are some things we can do to manipulate this uh I'm I'm not going to do it um uh you know what yeah I'm going to do it it just it gets a little bit confusing for a lot of students um however sometimes you're going to see this in the back of your text go how in the world we get n minus 2 where' that come from here's where it comes from if you see a a number here and a b kind of like a base here that you could somehow make the same you can combine these via multiplication and addition of exponents so here's what I mean if you can make this somehow into that common ratio like 1 / three three so instead of 3 to the first Power think about a negative exponent you could write this as 1/3 to the 1 power in your head right now that has to be the same thing as three 1/3 to the ne 1 reciprocate and change the sign is three but you have it multiplied what do you do when you multiply common bases you add the exponents so you could combine these get the same base you have the same base and add your exponents -1 plus and minus one is not n it's n minus 2 and you'll see some of that fancy stuff where sometimes they won't show you this they show you that and you go but I got that it is the same this is usually just fine but sometimes you will see that and I wanted to mention that to you it is more concise right it is a little bit nicer to work with but that's where that's coming from so I hope that you learned in this lesson what a geometric sequence is um that it's similar to arithmetic but instead of adding or multiplying you can always find a common ratio by dividing all of your successive terms just make sure they're the same you don't want to stop after two and assume you're right you really want to check um the formula is really easy just have your first term have your common ratio to n minus one the N minus one is there because we need one less iterational multiplication to get the term that we want considering that our first term is taken up by a sub one um after that I've given you as many examples I could find or come up with about how to create a geometric sequence just from either some sequences themselves or knowing one term or several terms um after that I've shown you a way to take and make more concise some of these geometric sequences when they have a a first term that can be written as your common ratio usually it's with a negative exponent usually it subtracts here somehow it can be positive exponents just usually not um and then you get that m - 2 so I hope it makes sense what we're going to do now is come back with a geometric series and learn how to add these sequences up
