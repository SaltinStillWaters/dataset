Transcript for: Introduction to Series and Summation Notation  (Precalculus - College Algebra 68)
welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about series and with all the time we spent on sequences this should be a little bit more understandable because uh we already really explored a lot of the hardest parts and sequences how do you take a series and go backwards what's series mean um what's it based on and are there formulas for it uh the formulas are going to make the math so much easier for series you see here's what a series does a series adds up the terms of the sequence so they are not unrelated things that we have they're not the same and sequences in general are just a list of numbers and that's what we have we can talk about convergence and divergence and things like that but a series takes those terms and adds them now there's some very interesting things that happen with series some very predictable formulas that we can prove by proof by induction we can prove a lot of these things i'm going to show you how to do that when we get there and do proofs by induction that's in a few videos from now so we're going to be able to prove them some very interesting things happen and especially when we get into some calculus like calculus 2 we're going to find that you can actually add an infinite series an infinite number terms and get something it converges there's some very special cases to do that we talk about that in some geometric series in just a little while but some very fascinating things happen it's really worth our time to understand how a sequence works so that we can understand how a series works so we can understand a lot about some calculus later and do some very interesting things with it i won't go into everything that we have but some very interesting things happen with like pi and e and a lot of these numbers that are transcendental when we view them in a type of series so here's what the series does and how they work if you've never been exposed to it before this is what they look like you know what in the world does that mean a series is just taking a sequence and adding up the terms so here's what this tells you mathematically this sigma is it is a sigma it's a greek letter s and it stands for a sum your sequence is right here if you ignore this that's just a sequence in fact your series tells you where to start and where to end so your series is built like a sum of a sequence could you find the first let's say n terms of this well if the series is telling you where to start this says i want you to look for your k whatever this index is i want you to look for your k here's my k i want you to plug in 1. okay i'm going to plug in 1 to this it's going to give me my first term then i'm going to plug in 2 and 3 and 4. and then natural numbers because it's based on sequence you don't plug in like 1.5 you plug in all the natural numbers because it is a sequence you're just adding or subbing it up until you get to that term so here's what we would do starting with whatever this is it could be zero it could be one could be anything just start with what this is and plug it in so our first term says replace your index with one and then two and then three until you get to whatever this is now now that's an n so we're not going to be able to stop but we show that we would do this continuously until we reached the end notice that the two different letters that we have this k is the index of your sequence this n tells you where to stop sometimes n is infinity and it'll be an infinite sequence we get that a little bit later but most of the time that is going to be an actual number so what if that was what if that had been three if that had been three it would be exactly this it would say you plug in one then two then three then you stop that is how a series works it takes these values starting here plugs it into the sequence that you know how to deal with and stops with that term and then you add it up so one two and three from our one our two and our three if that had been 31 you do one two three four five six all the way to thirty one you plug them in here and you add the whole thing up is it possible yes is it annoying of course because if you have 31 terms here and you've got to add them up that's a lot of number crunching are there formulas thank goodness there are imma show them to you in just a little while in this video on how you would do this quickly very quickly because there's formulas that allow us to do that the k squared so i'll show you those things when we get there but in general that's health series we're going to just intended to to give you an example on how you'd find the first number of terms the actual doing of the math and finding the sum while you could do it this way there's better ways most cases there's better ways if this was left as n we would have to show that we continue until we reach whatever that number is that's an important step to do by for proof by induction when we finally get there okay let's do one that looks a little bit more complicated it's not going to be all that bad this says that here's your series here's the sequence on which this is built so you are summing or adding the terms of this sequence by starting at zero and ending at n minus one how to end minus 1 you just plug in n minus 1 just like we just plugged in n you just start here show a few terms then go yeah some stuff happens and we end here how do we end there i took n and i plugged it in and we got that term we're going to do the same thing so this says i want you to start adding these terms of the sequence by starting at zero so if i start at zero i can do two times zero plus one the next term would be i plug in 1 then i plug in 2 then i plug in 3 it would give me an another term for each of those inputs this is the zeroth term the first term second term third term uh you can consider a first term second term third third fourth term but you you notice that you start at zero so we typically call it that uh case of zero or the uh the n sub zero term n sub one has a two it's a three and where we would end is take your two and plug in whatever that is if we had had just watch this if we would have had a three here this is where we would stop we would plug in zero one two and three and we'd be done that's it that's all we would stop or right where we stop that's all we do but if you have an n minus one then you go okay i'm plugging zero and then one two three four five six blah blah blah blah blah blah going for a right down here going for a really long time and then you would have plug in 2 or you have a 2 plug in your n minus 1 plus 1. it's just an evaluation like you plugged in 0 and then one and then two and then three and then where you stop so take this and evaluate it that would be two times n minus one you do have to have parentheses i hope that you see it's a composition function you just plug in one number it's just n minus 1 and you can simplify all this stuff this would give you 1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 7 plus look at what this does this would be 2 n minus two plus one wait a minute two n minus two because i distributed plus one is two n minus one isn't that exactly what we got for odd numbers in the last video for sequences yeah that's it and this is really interesting because if you notice this you can define odd numbers two different ways you can define them by what if i started at zero well then i would have to have two times zero plus 1 to get 1. what if i started at 1 then i have 2 times 1 minus 1 to get 1. you can define them two different ways and some of these series and sequences can be done that way this defines odd numbers the same way that this does if you think about it and you want to do it on your own i might spend a lot of time on it but if you think about it this is going to give you exactly the same thing that this does exactly plug in one two times one minus one is one plug in two two times two minus one is three plug in three that would be five plug in seven that would be seven or sorry plug in four that would be seven plug in n plug in n you get two n minus one two minus one same stuff so this does teach something that says that you can manipulate one series into being something else by altering where you start and where you stop and it might even change your your sequence that you're working with so i hope that makes sense i'm trying to teach you some pretty advanced things just by looking through a couple of examples here so in general a sequence is a series it's just a sequence added up the sequence is given to you it tells you where to start it tells you where to stop those can be finite numbers in which you have a finite number of terms or they can be left as n and n minus one in which you have an infinite number of terms and you just show what that last term is by plugging in or evaluating your n that's all that series do in general we're going to see that there's some formulas that would solve all of these things for us very nicely and let us add up the terms of your sequence without having to do a whole lot of writing out because this is annoying and if you went to 50 terms that'd be crazy that would take you so much time with a better way all right another thing that we can do is we can go backwards on a series like we went backwards on a sequence we can build a series from a sum and so we're going to show that it is the same exact technique so if you have not watched the sequence video on how we build a sequence from a list of numbers you need to because we're going to do the same thing here but quicker so how we do this the same exact idea is take whatever you're given and write the terms down so we have two then negative four then eight and those are being added the next term think about what the next term would be the next term would be let's see two negative four oh wait it's not six it's eight these are not just even numbers because let's skip one two negative four eight and the next one would be negative 16. so if you remember what we're trying to do is we're trying to make all of these the same form and then figure out the stuff that's not changing it and then relate it back to our n our index now there is one other thing here this series stops this series does have something some number as a stopping point so we're gonna have to figure this out we're gonna figure what the k is because we're gonna write our series and have a finite number there we're gonna figure out what that is actually gonna be eight but we'll figure out what that is as we go so we have to relate it back i'll do a different example like if you weren't given that how you would do it how would change but this is the way we go through it we list our terms out then we try to make them all the same form what do you mean try to make them look like they have the same stuff and represent the stuff that's the same as unchanging things in your series so i'm looking at this going hey i have a negative here a negative here and no negatives here i'm going to relate this to a negative one eventually so i'm going to say this is negative one times four one times eight 1 times 2 negative 1 times 256 so i know that there's a 1 in there that's not a negative 1 in there that's that's not changing my exponent will be changing we talked about alternation so we're going to have that in our series the next thing i do is look at our 2 4 8 and 256 and try to relate them to the same thing something that's not changing now this is not even numbers so it can't just be two times something like two times one two times two two times weight two times four two ten that doesn't work but they are all powers of two so this is two to the first to the second two the third two to the you'll figure that out but it will answer that question for you so to the first to the second two to the third two to the eighth the next one will be a negative one times two to the fourth and now we're ready to start making the jump for our series so i know it's being added so that says we have a series i know i have to start at 1 and so we're going to have this case of one so i know that our first term is is going to be our first term in this series as well i now need to start representing all of this stuff that's not changing just like we did a sequence what because a series is based on a sequence you need to have the same exact sequence so our sequence should have a negative 1 in it our sequence should have a 2 in it because the negative 1 and the two are not changing what is changing the sign of the first of our terms our negative one to a power that's changing so the exponent here needs to model that well let's take a look our first term is positive so if our first term is positive it needs to take negative one to some power and give me positive one it needs to take negative one to some power for our second term and give me negative one the way we do that is we take our k and we subtract 1. now please get this y k and not n k is the index for a series because you show where you end at the end you want to be able to plug in that n and get your general term and so we have to have a different index we can't use n and then plug in n to the n and represent a different n that doesn't make any sense so you start at k and you go okay k is my index that way i can plug in 1 and two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight and end at my n i can plug in n later and it actually makes sense i just need like this dummy index we call it k hopefully you're you're okay with that so plugging in one let's just double check this negative one to the one minus one one minus one zero negative one to the zero is one that works two i have a two in every single one of those terms and now we relate the other part that's changing one two three 8 back to my index it appears that 1 and 1 2 and 2 3 and 3 my index is matching and so this is going to match my index again it's k it's not n you can't do that because you're going to end with an n you can't say that n equals one and then two and then three and then end at n it's not correct form you'd have too many ends floating in here you use a different index we call it k now the last thing how do you know when you end because all of this stuff you could have just had this and got this so i'm gonna say two things number one if you were not given this last term let's pretend that wasn't there if you weren't given that last term and you didn't have this information you would just put n and you would be done because you would be able to represent that series and you would say it has no end to it so this this and this that would give you 1 negative 1 1 2 to the first second third you'd have negative 1 to the k minus 1 that matches our signs 2 to the first second third that matches our index the first term would give us positive 2 to the first that's what we got second term we're plugging two i'd get two minus one that's negative negative one two to the second that's what we have the next term if i plugged in three i would get three minus one is two negative one to the second is positive one two to the third that's exactly what we have and we say if we were not given an end you put an n there and that n says you go forever until you reach an n do you see how you could write remember imagine that's not there you could write the same series that we have here and your ending term would be let's see 2 negative 4 8 then negative 16 then blah blah blah blah blah and you would plug in n and you get negative 1 n minus 1 2 to the n that would be your nth term that'd be your general term that's why we use two different letters k for your series and the sequence that is series is based on and then n to represent your nth term because you need a different variable to plug this into it's inappropriate to plug an n into an n you're kind of switching variables there we don't want we want to show that we don't want it to be ambiguous now we don't we don't have a general term we have an end so what's very nice about this is because because our index matches our power index matches power index matches power index has to match that power it's got to be an eight and that says oh okay this has to be an 8 then you know that's the eighth term if you know that's an eighth term and it's the last term you've just found where you end this series is represented as here's the sequence we know it's right we've just spent like an hour long video finding sequences we know that that's represents a sequence we know it starts at one and now we know it ends at eight that is the eighth term this is how you would represent that series in series notation hope that makes sense hope you're seeing the relationship between the sequences that we already talked about now we're just kind of relating it back to the sum and showing that a little better with some different letters again we need those different letters because you need an n to be able to plug into something and we need to end with an nth term a general term in terms of n so we need a different variable to base our sequence on that's the only reason we're going to do now is i'm going to show you the formulas for how to add series because we don't want to be doing this with a calculator or something i'll show you that and then what we'll do is let's practice a couple okay so how do we actually calculate the sum of these series we don't want to actually write it all out and do it because that'd be crazy i want you to imagine something because we're going to do this problem and you're going to find out that it's not as bad as it looks right now this looks horrifying why because if you had to actually add that series what would you do well let's let's look at it this series means sum of what this sequence it is a sequence is based on an index k of 1 to 12 so you'd you do this you plug in one figure it out plug in two figure it out plug in three figure it out plug in four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve all twelve terms you'd figure that out and then you'd have that that's a lot of work and we're going to do something that's still a lot of work but quicker work also hopefully you can tell i kind of enjoy this stuff i don't know why it seems like some sort of a puzzle i really enjoy it don't know why that is but this is one of my favorite things is the the sequences in the series i like the the challenges i suppose there are some formulas that are going to help us solve series how to add the terms without having to actually have the terms now you're going to ask the question where in the world does this stuff come from one of them is very common sense and needs no proof same thing as that one but the rest of them would require proof we prove most of these by induction if you want to know where they came from originally you could ask someone like carl frederick gauss well you can't because he's dead but if you could he solved that by himself in like fifth grade or the level of fifth grade which is insane he did it like out of a couple minutes because he was super genius but anyhow a lot of these were discovered by pattern and then proved with with induction and so i will show you how to do that there's other ways to prove it but i'll show you how to do that in the last last video in this little little kind of sub series that we have on on sequence in series so here's what this means here's what the formulas look like because at first they look a little confusing i'm going to do this one last actually even though it's the most basic one i'm going to do this one so how how you can add up the terms of a series without actually doing the addition is with a formula like this now i want you to understand how this works this says let's suppose that your sequence is based on just k it's a mean that means that you plug in 1 2 three four five and that would be the terms of your sequence one plus two plus three plus four plus five if you add it up would create a series you'd stop at n so if this was ten here's what this would mean this series would be add one two three four five six seven eight nine and ten that's about b now you can do that pretty quickly on a calculator but this is actually even quicker than that here's all you need to know in order to find the series find the sum of that series quickly just know where you end this is the second reason why we need different letters here is so that you understand that this is based on the end of this series so if i'm adding the series of the sequence k from 1 to n i just take my n i plug it in here and it's going to give me the sum so if i go from 1 to 10 and i know it's based on k then i just plug in 10. 10 times 11 over two ten times eleven over two is fifty-five that's going to add to fifty-five if you take calculator right now do one plus two plus three plus four all the way to ten it's gonna be fifty-five why because this actually works and it's provable i'm not proving them now because i haven't taught you abduction but i will prove that one to you at a different time now there's some other ones why are there other ones because not everything can be simplified to just having a sequence of k what about k squared and k cubed we have two other formulas for that now there are other ones out there but these are the most common ones so what if you had a sequence based on k squared well what you would need to know is that you're starting at one and that you're ending at whatever like 10 or 12 or whatever that number is because if we have that there's a formula to add it so if we were ending at let's say seven or something so we knew the sequence was k squared we're starting to one and that's seven take your ending number seven seven plus one is eight seven times two plus one is fifteen seven times eight times fifteen and then divide by six that will give you the sum of one squared two squared three squared four squared y squared 6 squared and 7 squared all added up it will do it for you it's pretty fascinating same thing works here with k cubed if you know where you end take your ending number plug it in and it will solve for you now what if you don't know where you end then this is a this is still relevant but it won't give you a finite number there are some infinite series that will but they have special names like geometric series and their special conditions like you have to have a ratio of uh less than one common ratio so there are some special conditions or between negative one and one there's some special conditions there and there's some other series that have the same type of things going on but in general to add a series you need to know where you end otherwise it's going to go to infinity do you see that like if you just kept on adding this forever and k was numbers one two and three and four it's gonna go to infinity i it's getting really really really big even going from like one to twelve if this was one to twelve so you'd add up 1 cubed 2 cubed 3 cubed fourteen that's already big 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 all cubed and you added them we can do the same thing by taking the ending number let's say 12 12 times 13 divided by 2 78 squared and then square that whatever that is well that's going to be pretty big i can't do that in my head i was trying that's a little outside my range so this is what the formulas do and how they work they'll add the terms of your series very quickly very cool now let's look at this one because this one confuses a lot of people they go how do you get the n where the world's that coming from i want you to think about it this way first and then see that that makes sense so one thing that we can do is we can say if you have a constant in there nothing would change there's no k in there so what this would be this would say plug in one i can't there's nothing to plug into so what that would do is say for the first term take one for the second term take one for the third term take one for the fourth term take one for the fifth term take one for all the terms of the edges take one and add them up so if i went from one to seven of the sequence one here's what it would do it would take one one one i wish i would have picked a smaller number than seven because i'm gonna write seven ones one two three four five six seven here's the first term it's one second term two one third term one fourth term one you're giving it back fifth term one six term one seven term one and then i end because it terminates it says i end at seven the seventh term not plugging in seven you're you're trying to but it's only yours it's only giving out one it's a constant what do constants do they're the same value all the time so one one one one one one there's seven ones what do you get when you add seven ones wait a minute that's repeated addition of the same number repeated addition is multiplication how many times have you repeated it seven times whatever is here that value got repeated okay what would happen here you'd have a constant c would be a constant there's nothing to plug into the cc would be something like one or maybe five let's say five what would that be then well if i went from one to seven of let's say five now these wouldn't be ones anymore you'd have five five five five five five and five one two three four five six seven the first term will give you a five second term five third and five it's a constant seventh term five well how many times have you added the five well there's seven terms seven times 5 would be 35 this is where that comes from it says take your constant that's not changing see how many times you have it repeated every time from 1 to n there will be n repetitions of that constant the other way that you can view this and this is why it says or is is this it's quite important you can always take a constant being multiplied by something inside of your series and move it in front of the series so you could do this you could say this is the same as same thing as k equals 1 to n of c times 1. because c is a constant i could make this c times the series of 1 to n of 1. this would be c times we already know that this piece is n c times n that proves that to you so we do get that out of it we'll see that working through our one example that we're going to get because it i've involved everything of every one of these formulas in that so we'll talk about what you can do when we get there right now i just need to be really really clear on these formulas actually work they're very relevant we're going to use them in just a minute this one makes sense but you really have to think about a little bit okay so back to our example we don't really want to plug in 1 through 12 and add them up because that's really annoying and we have some formulas that do this for us so the couple things that i need you to know in order to be successful at solving that or adding up that series finding the sum without writing it out is that you can separate series by addition and subtraction and multiplication now get why it worked on what i showed you if a series means addition adding stuff up and addition is commutative it doesn't matter the order adds stuff it's also associative and separable which means that i can add stuff separately and add it back together later okay what does that mean that means i can look at adding these things and these things and these things and these things have separable and or associative grouping and then add it back together so and long story made short is i can separate by pluses and minuses i can separate my series into several different series by pluses and minuses i can move constants in front of factors in front of my series why because we know that you can factor out the same thing being multiplied in every single one of your terms addition and subtraction is factorable by multiplication so i can take multiplication and factor it in front of my series it is factorable because addition subtraction is factorable by multiplication so in other words i can break this down some really simple pieces that match up what we have here so we're going to do that we're going to say all right because addition subtraction is multiple way it's associative it's commutative i can move stuff around i can separate things it's also factorable by multiplication i'm going to start separating this i'm going to separate it first by addition and subtraction and then pull my factors out so i can consider one big series to be a sum of little series adding up different stuff and then adding together is the same thing as adding up all the stuff at once what we're trying to do our goal is to get the insides of every one of our series to look just like one of these things you'll notice that you have to keep the same starting spot and ending spot you'll also notice i'm not doing a whole lot of work in my head it's way too easy to start making little mistakes on this like for getting signs if you're getting fours or if you're if you want to be smart about it and go well i know i can separate that but i can pull the 4 out front that's true but sometimes we just lose the four and make a signed error so i never do it that's up to you whether you want to i prefer to write this stuff out so this series can be represented as one two three four different series because i have one two three four different terms and we can break that up and we can associate it group it by addition and subtraction so k cubed okay minus 4k squared got it plus 5k cool plus 7. you'll also notice that i'm keeping the subtraction and the addition that's fine we want to make sure that we we do understand what's going to happen later though that i'm subtracting whatever this gives us that is important now there's some more work that i have to do i need to make sure that insides of these four series separated by the four terms that i had match up with one of these formulas i've given you so we're gonna do that this is great k cubed is done we love that we're going to have a formula for that in just a minute in fact it's going to use the 12 that i referenced i'm going to be putting for this one term this one series i'm going to say this starts at 1. so what i wanted this has a k cubed that matches perfectly that's the sequence for that mini series mini series and then it ends at 12. 12 is going to get plugged in here and here and i'm going to square whatever i think it was 78 did that's it 7 8 squared is what that is going to be we're done with that one this one not so much so this one says i have very close to what that says but there's a four that four because at four man i hope you see it that 4 would be on every single term in the things that are being added it's factorable you could factor it out of every term right that means you could factor it and move it in front of that stuff that's being added it's factorable that means you can move that four up front hope you're also seeing why i'm not giving you lots of different examples this pretty much covers everything that you do except for one example which i'll show you in just a minute same thing here you could factor out a 5 from every one of those terms so we can move our 5 in front just like a factor does this k squared is what we're looking for this k is what i'm looking for and now the constant you can do one of two ways it doesn't matter to me which one you do you can leave it as this or you can write it of it as seven not seventy-one seven times one you could pull out the seven and leave the one either way and you just see if you do the same thing if you leave it as a seven you do twelve times seven that's what that says leave it as a seven a constant you would do n 12 times 7 no problem if you do it like this you say all right if i am adding up lots of ones how many ones am i adding 12 you're n you're 12. so you'd say here's 12 times 7. either way you're going to get 12 times 7 it doesn't really matter what matters is being able to separate this into our number of terms gives me number of series then making every one of those series look like something about formula 4 and then applying the formula correctly so the formulas are all based on your n where you end your n is where you end your series i know that sounds similar when i say it so our k cubed says there's a formula for that it's right there so i'm going to take my ending value my n i'm going to plug it in my ending value my n is 12. so i'm going to apply this formula and say that this part is 12 12 plus 1 over 2 squared this is exactly what that should be i should take my n plug it in appropriately and then we'll do the math a little later minus four times keep that four don't lose it remember that's being multiplied by whatever you get out of this the sum is represented in this expression we're about to write but four gets multiplied because that is the factor you factored out now because this is based on our k squared it says find your ending value your n here's our k squared here's our formula for k squared just plug in your n 12 12 and 12 our n is 12. a good question would be will you ever get fractions out of this nope they all work out to whole numbers so if you're getting a whole lot of fractions you're doing something wrong uh those fractions should simplify so we have a 12 12 plus 1 and 2 times 12 plus 1 that's coming from our n then we do our plus 5 so we have a plus we have a 5 and then we look at the formula for that series since it's based on k we're going to go all right we have an n of 12 i'm going to plug in 12 12 plus 1 over 2. lastly no matter what you do you'll get 7 times n which is 12 or 7 times 12. either way you're going to get 7 times 12 and we've already talked about why that is you're welcome to plug that in just like that on your calculator and get whatever it is that this equals you can also you're welcome to simplify this stuff however it seems best to you to do i'll simplify because i don't have a calculator handy i would do things like this i'd simplify all of my fractions because they all will so this is going to be 6 times 13 squared minus this would give us 2 times four is eight so four times two is eight thirteen twenty-five this is going to give us six that would be 30 5 times 6 is 30 times 13 plus 84. that's probably what i'd plug into my calculator i might double check it to make sure that i did everything right but i'm going to come back with this the answer here the sum in just a bit okay borrowing any little mistakes that i've made i could have i don't know i haven't really looked back at it yet but if i've made any mistakes then there should be small errors but if i haven't then that is the sum that you get by adding up the 12 terms of that sequence and that's exactly what you should get there you can try it i suppose if you really wanted to but that's what you should get so i hope it made it make sense as far as how to manipulate a series into something that's manageable by the formulas that i've given you i'm going to give you one more example about how to manipulate something that doesn't match this like what if you don't start one when you start like four i'll show you how to do that all right so what do you do when it doesn't match up with where you're supposed to start like if you start at k equals four and you're supposed to start k goes one is this gonna work no and don't try to make it work the way it is right now it will not work um so let's be smart about it what if it what if it was a one like could you make it work if it was a one if it was that it'd be fine we could say yeah okay i know that that matches perfectly this i know what the formula is i know i'm ending at 24. putting 24 24 plus 1 over 2 and then take that and square it you find the sum of the series very quick and easy the problem is is that this is not what this is so what is this compared to this let's think about what i don't want out of this i don't want the first term i don't want the second term and i don't want the third term in that series i do want the 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th and 10th so here's how we can think about it this series is the same thing as taking the whole series that that formula needs removing the first three terms i hope that you see what this does this says here's my whole series what don't i want here i don't want terms one two and three this is terms one two and three of that series so we can always always really do that if you don't start at one take the whole series and subtract off starting from one to all the stuff that you don't need so up to but not including that that beginning index that beginning term so hopefully that you can see that that actually does work um that should kind of make sense you just have to start at one in order for these these formulas to work otherwise you're going to start subtracting things and this is the way that we do it i want from 4 to 24 i want the whole thing but i don't want the first three terms that's the first three terms but i can work that out for you can easily do that on your own i just want to show you that's the process you're going through so i hope it made it make sense i hope now that see the sequences and series aren't a huge mystery to you hope that you can see they're very manageable we even have some formulas for series that really really help us so we're going to start talking about specific sequences and series over the next four videos we'll talk about arithmetic sequences then arithmetic series geometric sequences then geometric series and finally how to prove some of these formulas with proof by adduction so i'll see you for those videos and i hope you're doing well
