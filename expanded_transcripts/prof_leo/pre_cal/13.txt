Transcript for: Introduction to Graph Transformations (Precalculus - College Algebra 14)
hey welcome to another video now that we've talked about the library functions and the basic functions I asked you to memorize memorize them especially with their key points and what they look like we're going to take them and we're gonna graph with these things called transformations so what transformations do is house you look at a function and determine just based on the operation that's happening with it what the graph is gonna affect or how it's gonna affect one of these basic graph shapes and the library functions whether it moves it up or down or left or right or stretches compresses it reflects it all these sort of things that transformations do why that's important why we want to know that we don't want to have to plug in points or evaluate a whole bunch of different points in a function every time because for a number reasons number one we might miss some very key features of a graph people if you don't pull it in the right points or it man takes a tremendous amount of time and for these graphs that continue forever like trigonometric functions it's really useful to understand what in the world these operations are doing to the graph of your function that's what we start right now with these things called transformations we're not going to talk about trigonometric functions now but later on we will what we visit all of this stuff and if I can teach you what shifts a graph up and down what shoots a graph left and right what stretches it compresses it both horizontally and vertically then when we get trigonal trigonometry it's gonna be a piece of cake to graph the you're not piece of cake but a lot easier to graph them so so really we want to get a feel for what these graphs are doing by just looking at the functions themselves and the operations that are taking place the things you need to know in order to do this are number one what does an x squared graph look like what does an absolute value of x graph look like what are the key points there and then I'm gonna teach you that transform so let's let's start right away we're gonna talk about what a vertical shift is now please don't just memorize this understand what's taking place and why in the world adding or subtracting outside of your function so like this plus 3 y that would be a shift up or down vertical shift on the y axis so I want you to take a look at it let's imagine that you have way too and we understand this you know that X is our input so stick with me here if I had an x value and I plug it into a function the functions value is an output for that that whatever that x value is so says take an input plug it into a function you get an output now this right here this FX this is the output for your graph what if you took the output value f of X is an output value and you added something to it a constant so you just added a number to an output what's I going to do is that going to affect the input that you plug in no is it going to take the effect the output value of your function yes what this says is if you have an output value or you take a functions output value and you just add to it or you take an output value and you subtract from it what's gonna happen it's not going to move it left to right that would be an input idea that's not affecting the input I haven't taken X an effective input it can't move it on the input axis this is take your output add or subtract take your output that's an output axis idea and add or subtract to or from it adding to an outputs value is going to change the output and make it taller will make it higher it's going to take that and shift it vertically upward take an output value and subtracting from this can take an output of a function and move it lower so these are going to give and give us an what's called a vertical shift or a vertical transformation it's going to shift it up for plus and minus four down that's got to make sense that's you've got to see it you got to see that our input would go into a function this is the output of a function and now I just add to every single one of the outputs that would be the same value I'm adding for every one of the outputs it could take the graph shape that's gonna move it up or take the graph shake and move it down that's where this comes from so when I take a function value and I add after the function outside the parentheses after everything's been accomplished and I take a helper value add to it that's a shift up or if I subtract that's a shift down one thing to really focus on here this is not affecting input it says take a value plug it into your thumb Shin yeah then after you've plugged it in after the parentheses are over after u squared stuff R cubed inner square root or absolute value did outside of that after the function you'd have an ugly thought you wouldn't you now add to that oh I'm taking the alpha value and I'm adding to it or I'm taking it out the value and I'm subtracting from it that's why this shifts up or down but not left to right it's affecting the output only input does not change output does change and it's shifting it units above or units below that's what we're talking about here so when we talk about x squared plus three I'm gonna give you this a very specific way on how I want you to graph these it's not going to be in any textbook that you see I know of because I made it up but as far as I know maybe not but but here's the way that I do this number one I identify what my basic rap sheet is it's going to be in one of the library functions that you just talked about in last video so when I look at this I go okay the key basic function here is x squared what are your key points for that function don't be overthinking it with the plus three right now just think what's my one's my basic graph shape X group one of my key points okay my key points very important my key points are 1 1 0 0 and because it's based on an even function negative 1 positive 1 that is what I wanted you to remember from the last video firstly what the graphs shape is this is a parabola secondly what my key points are 1 1 0 0 negative 1 positive 1 I need that to be there now now that we have the basic graph shape in our heads we know it's a parabola we know what our key points are that's them we're gonna look at what the +3 does so we think okay this is this is a parabola and this says take the output values so you plug in a number right you square it that's an alpha value and they'll add 3 to it adding 3 to the output value is gonna be a shift up 3 so I'm gonna circle that I'm gonna say that this plus 3 that means that we take my original basic graph shape my parabola and I would shift every those values those output values up I have a very kind of neat way to do this graphically so here's we're going to do if we're gonna shift every single value of this graph of 3 not left to right we're gonna leave that alone but up 3 here's the might have let's do I'm gonna say you know what we could do instead of graphing this on the original XY axis what if we pretended that we shifted the x-axis of 3 what if we pretended we didn't shift the y-axis at all why not I'm not moving left to right I'm staying right where my input is this shift is not affecting my input it's affecting my output so I'm gonna pretend my my my shift up moves my x-axis up it shifted the whole graph up it has not shifted my my y-axis of left to right at all so that's staying there I'll make a couple key comments about this when I'm doing this I'm not really shooting an exacta simple we're just kind of pretending or giving ourselves a graphic organizer so that we can say you know what this parabola is all shifting up three units if the whole thing's shifting up for you is let's shift our axes let's shift up three units and let's shift lever right no units let's leave that alone but if I do that then what I can do is take the key points of our basic graph shape and if i graph the room for might like new XY axis if i say alright this graph would always have one one right well yeah but now I shifted it up three spots three units let's using the same scale let's plot one one using the same scale let's plot zero zero from my new XY axis let's plot negative one one on the same scale what that's gonna do is if I get my scale right which I didn't what that's gonna do that's gonna allow us to graph the parabola that we know this this graph gives us but it's going to allow us to graph it in the correct spot so the whole idea is identify what your basic graph shape is got it identify which key points are you should have down understanding why I caught you though hey even has the 1 1 0 0 negative 1 positive 1 and odd hasn't maybe 1 negative 1 will make it a lot nicer you go that's even it's got these as key points great I know if the shape isn't no the key points are I also understand that up 3 that plus 3 says I'm taking and shifting this graph up three spots if we pretend our x axis shifts up and we pretend our Y axis doesn't shift at all that gives you this new place on which I can graph my key points now please understand this is not really on your graph it's not really there it's not really the x axis just gives us a way for us to graph it nice and from our new XY axis we can graph 1 1 0 0 making 1 positive 1 are the points 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 1 on your graph no the real points are 1 4 0 3 negative 1 4 what because you took these output values and you added 3 to them that's what happened that's what's going on it's just nice to be able to graph it that way I hope that makes sense I hope you're seeing why adding a value at the end of your function is shifting up outside parentheses outside ups and value outside all the function stuff and - is down you're taking the Alpen value adding or subtracting respectively one way we can show that is this shift our X and our Y axis and give a new X Y X not really there and then plot our key points works very nicely now let's move on a little bit what about a horizontal shift you know what we'll wait a minute a vertical shift what that did was it took an output value and it added or subtracted because output values are vertical idea it's moving vertically on the y axis now look what an input value would do let's say I would take my now what's this do wait a second takes an input value X is our input that says right before you do anything else I want you to add to that or take your input value and before you do anything else I was subtract from it well because X is our input access idea adding or subtracting to an input value before you put any sort of function onto it or any sort of function it's gonna affect shifting on our horizontal axis it's a horizontal shift because our input axis is horizontal and because we're affecting our input first it's going to take an input value it's going to alter it it's going to say I'm going to move you to the right or to the left man I'll tell you what in the 13 years I've been teaching now I've tied I've taught this this stuff in 60 different classes to 260 different groups of students and I'll tell you what this I did is the number one missed idea when you are shifting the graphing with transformations people really really want this to be a shift right it's not they really want that to be a shift left it's not it's opposite of what your brain wants to make it intuitively I'll tell you what in parentheses anything that happens in parentheses is almost always opposite of your intuition it's weird but that's the way were to explain that very well in just a second what I want to make sure that you get right though this is shift this is a shift in a direction on the horizontal and this is shift horizontal in the correct direction but man you need to get your  straight all right so this is a shift left and this is a shift right you probably see that that's really easy for students to get good views big oh I really want plus two I mean plus means up and it does don't haven't change that plus means up when it's outside of function what's affecting the output yes it does plus does not mean right when you're affecting the input - doesn't mean left when you're affecting an input everything in parentheses happens opposite of the way that you want it to happen so here this is going to or instead of a function sense that's not a shift to the to the left this will be shipped right why why is this a shift left and there's a shift right I'm explaining it to two different ways one way is just be the whole way put idea what what this does let's focus specifically on this this says I want you to take I want you to take a number and I want you to to write when I plug it in add 2 to it in order to get out the same height that I would normally have got so let's let's say 0 let's say I want to get out a height of 0 if I cover up that 2 and say in order to get a height of 0 out out plugging 0 because they absolute value it would be 0 now you tell me okay I want I'm gonna add whatever you never you give me I'm gonna add 2 to it no matter what it's okay now what if I wanted to get a height of 0 i plug in 0 is gonna be a height of 2 what value would I have to plug in in order to still get the same height if you're gonna add 2 to everything well it's not to because if I look if I say 2 no 2 plus 2 would give me a height of 4 in order to undo this sort of a this sort of a adding to your input idea I'd have to put in an input that's less than what I started with so I'd have to put a negative 2 in order to get the height of 0 back so I hope that makes sense I'm in a different way in a second but if I haven't giving out if I want to get the height of 0 I plug in 0 to get out at 0 here I have to plug in negative 2 to get the height of cereal the same value that I would get out previously well negative 2 is not to the right now you two need to go left it's a shift left the way I can think of it is like a time line let's say that the years 2015 if it is that's cool you're watching this in the future although it would be the future for me not for you for you weird let's say that that's the year 2015 here's you 2000 and I walk into the room and I say in the year 2050 at this time I say I'm 50 years old I am fitting when was I born I was born in the year 2000 ok never been that's to make sense I hope hopefully that makes sense see if it's 20 59 50 years old which I won't be able to older than that unfortunately but and I say I'm 50 years old you go ok you were born in the year 2000 now what if I walk into the room and say oh now it's still the year 2050 and I say I'm now 48 I'm 48 years old so the year 2050 and I walk into the room and say I'm 48 years old I've subtracted two years from my age and my board year 2000 no I subtracted two for my age imma go to the year 1998 no unborn the year 2002 even though I subtracted two from that that time I've moved to the right on my timeline that's sort of what's going on I'm subtracting two for my input value it's moving me actually to the right I know this is adding to I get it but but I need to understand that subtracting two from your input subtracting two from your value is a moving to the right sort of an idea on timeline that's what's happening here I hope one of those two things make sense to you but for us we just need to understand I well I did explain it a couple good ways but we understand that adding to your input value in order to undo the adding to an input you would have to give me a smaller value that's to the left in order to undo subtracting from my input you'd have to give me a bigger value in order to undo that and get the same height out that would be a shift to the right in order to undo this adding two to your input I'd have to give you smaller values so that when you add two to it and get back the original height that's the idea it's an opposite of what you want it to be so this this and this so this ship let's look at that that's an absolute value of x plus two the first thing one I understand is it absolute value gives me a V I'm gonna get a V here the second thing to understand is that I have some key points my key points are 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 1 that would be the key points but my basic absolute value of X graph that's what that's what value of x is gonna have now we identify that the plus 2 what that does it takes the absolute value it says that plus 2 is going to be and in affecting of the input axis it's not after them so that it's not affecting the output that doesn't affect the output it says I'm affecting the input first it says before you even look at the absolute value I'm saying plug in a value of X I'm gonna add 2 to it that's affecting the input that's a horizontal shift in fact it's a shift left left two units so I looked at it at some values of V as debate has these key points I've looked at my function and saying this is inside my function this is affecting the input the X input that's a horizontal idea it's gonna shift left to so what we're gonna do this isn't shifting up and down there's no nothing outside of that function shift up and down it's not that's affecting the output so we're gonna do is we're gonna sell right well I couldn't that this would shift my graph left - it would not shift my graph up and down at all because there's no constant that's being added to every output value are you seeing how when we sort of create a new XY axis it's given us a place where we can plot our key points so when we shift our graph we're basically shifting the beach and just moving where that thing starts so if we're if we're moving this graph left - I can still 1 the 0 0 and the 1 1 and the negative 1 1 like it would normally get on a on a absolute value type of graph but I've shifted the whole thing over 2 units to the left plus instead of function means to the left I know it's not intuitive but when we really think about it that's what has to be the case in order to undo that adding to it every input you give me smaller values to the same output so we say alright let's plot our new XY axis it's not really there but I can use this to plot my key points and graph my absolute value I know it's not a parabola do not give me a parabola that's an absolute value graph and we're sketching here with our transformations I hope that that makes sense that adding to an input is actually moving you to the left not to the right are and you can check it with outputs if you really want to plug in negative 2 negative 2 plus 2 is 0 absolute value of 0 is 0 the original absolute value would be here that's Memphis in left plug in negative 1 negative 1 plus 2 is 1 absolute value of 1 would be 1 that's the correct graph it's just moved to the left I seem like we wouldn't want to just graph these by plugging in points what if you just plugged in negative 1 0 and 1 you get a straight you just get a straight line you wouldn't get this key feature this change from decreasing increasing this is a local minimum you wouldn't get it unless you plugged in negative 2 and then negative 3 might not do that you just plug in values so we really want to get a feel for what transformations actually do this is one way to do it figure out your basic graph put your key points identify your shifts and then graph your key points from your new XY axis yes these key points aren't actually there the points are negative 3 1 negative 2 0 negative 1 1 but it's a good way to get it all right we're going to put this stuff together I'm going to go kind of quickly through it so I'm gonna model my thinking on what our basic graph is alright my key points first what our shifts are doing I'll move my X and my Y axis on both of these and then we're gonna graph so when I'm looking at it man f of X is it's based on an X cubed graph now so stuff does happen to it but it's based on X cubed that means I know I'm gonna get this s-curve going with sort of an s-curve going up I know that it's odd it's an odd basic graph shape I know my key points are 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 negative 1 because it's based on that font graph I also know what my shifts do so how I look at this I look at the end first I look at after the functions over with after that power 3 is over with is there anything that's added or subtracted to it this is yeah this right here says that I'm shifting down one unit it's after the function is affecting the outputs of my function I've shifted down this plus one that plus one is inside now I really want my head plus one to be to the right but I know it's affecting the input I know it's inside the parentheses inside input so I'm affecting this by adding one of input I know I wanted to be the right but I know the inside produces opposite of that so adding 1 in order to undo the adding of 1 you would have to give me a smaller value to get out the same height so this would be a left one so if I've notified my graph I know I'm gonna be graphing this I've identified that key points based on the fact that's an odd graph in our library functions now I'm shifting down one and the left one I'm gonna draw like a new XY axis a new location for me to graph my key points so there's down 1 and here's left one so we're going to put our key points on that graph so our key points were 1 1 but I'm graphing it from this new X Y X is account I'm kind of not focusing on the black lines and focus on my dotted lines here so 0 0 would be here 1 1 would be 1 1 it would actually be the old origin and then negative 1 negative 1 would be 1/4 the same scale right here I have memorized my cubic I know what it looks like I know that's this sort of a curve that's what that graph looks like normally we get something that's that's just a sketch we can make it a little bit better one way to make it better is to plug in a few points that you don't know now I just said don't grab this thing I plug in the points understand that we didn't we grabbed a very good graph by just having our key points and shifting it if you want to make it better to get more of a feel for where the graph really looks like maybe plug in a value like the y-intercept now when we have that here zero comma zero is on our graph but if you wanted to see plug in one where this thing actually goes or plug in negative 3 it gives you a better feel for it same thing here we could be a lot more specific by saying hey you know what I know where our real key features are but if I want to find out where this crosses the y axis plug in 0 if I plug in the 0 here 0 plus 2 is 2 absolute value of 2 is 2 so I know that really I'm cross you had 2 this is a little bit off I didn't do correctly we can get a much better look that's not much better by graphing that through its actual y-intercept is there more could you do more could you understand that because this is even man stick with me here because this is even I know that if this two units away from my axis of symmetry why would you why would you want to use my technique to graph why would you want to shift over the y axis it gives you explicitly your axes of symmetry when you do that if I want to use this axis of symmetry two units away I can use symmetry because it's even to you it's a way I know it has to also go through that point you get one for free that's nice to do that you done the same thing here all right so our last one we know that we know this is a functions based on a square root graph so in your head hopefully you're thinking square root square roots look like this they're half of a parabola on its side that's big look like I know my key points my key points for square roots there's only two of them I know one one and 0 0 there are no negatives that are allowed in your square roots that means that not necessarily you can't plug in negative numbers but I can't plug in any value that's gonna give me a negative number inside so for instance I can't even plug in 1 here I can't put them like this 1 minus 2 is negative 1 that'd be a problem so we're probably not gonna have anything to the left of the next value of 2 now that's fine because that says shift to the right but we want to think about that right now this is a one-sided graph it's based on the square root it's based on original key points of 1 1 and 0 0 no negative 1 1 negative 1 negative 1 so I understand that I know the shape I know my key points now I'm gonna identify what my shifts are so the plus 3 what's happening with that I go from the outside in the plus 3 says that I would take after my function and affect the outputs by adding 3 3 is gonna move my outputs up so that's a shift up 3 now I'm gonna look inside them ok inside my function inside parentheses or absolute value or inside the square root I see a minus 2 so my hand I think okay -2 is affecting horizontal -2 is going to be to the right - I'm going to subtract 2 from every input in order to undo that and get the same height out I originally would so where my graph is but same height but move over somewhere I would have to give me bigger numbers those are to the right but your numbers to the right so this would be right - so I've identified my shape my key points what's happening to those key points and now I'm going to graph it so Unruh graphic okay I'm gonna shift up 3 that's going to shift this up three spots I'm gonna shift right - that's going to shift this over or that allowed me to shift an axis over two spots so right up three right - even though that's not actually on your graph and even though my key points when I shoot them are going to be different points on your graph it's a really nice way to get where this graph is what this graph looks like so I'm looking at okay here's my new XY axis if i graph these key points from this new XY axis i have 0 0 according to the same scale my graph I have 1 comma 1 now that 2 points 3 comma 4 you didn't know that this is not really here but it lets me identify exactly where my graph is I know my shape I know I'm not going to put a V it's not absolutely I'm not gonna put a problem it's not a problem this is a square root type of graph that's why it's so important to memorize the shapes of these graphs from your library functions if you want to be a little bit more specific you might plug in a value probably not for if I play them three I know I'm going to get that value 4 I get the square root of 2 that's kind of hard to deal with so maybe something like let's see if I wanted to get out for I play in something like 6 plug in 6 6 minus 4 give you - sorry 6 - to give you 4 squared 4 is 2 and then add 3 you get 5 and you can find a couple other values if you want to you better get a better graph but before sketching this is what I need you to know I need you to understand the shapes of the graphs on the basis of what I'm giving you I need to understand the key points on being even or odd and then I need to understand what these shifts are doing after the function plus means that my space down within the function plus means left and minus means right and putting those together right now I'm gonna come back with how to how to affect your outputs as far as stretching them and compressing them and then we'll talk about how to reflect them let's continue so the last couple that we had last three we have to deal with is how to take a graph and stretch it out vertically or compress it vertically how to stretch it out horizontally compressed horizontally and how to reflect it both across the x-axis and across the y-axis so we'll talk about those kind of four transformations we'll talk about how this one really man almost always in at least point on those are functions you can change it into a vertical stretch compression and so will really focus on vertical stretches and compressions and there are reflections let's talk about the vertical stress compression so imagine imagine that you take an input you don't mess of it look at what you're doing you're not messing with the input you're saying take my input plug it into a function that's going to give me an output value f of X stands for an output value of some function so take your output value now multiply your output value not your input value multiply your output value by some sort of number what's gonna happen let's say your input values were something like I don't know one one zero zero and negative one one like the key points for an x squared now take those and multiply your not into it this is doing nothing to give the value that happens over here this is doing nothing to improve value this is take your output value and multiply it by a number what's going to happen your Impa values are going to change so for the same input values your output values will start growing or shrinking depending on whether you multiply it by a number greater than 1 or less than 1 so what the vertical stretching compression does it says you're taking your output value your x number it's going to leave your inputs alone it's going to stretch it if the numbers more than 1 taking the output value times 2 times 3 times 1 and 1/2 times some fraction greater than 1 it's going to take those in it's a multiplier taking it up and multiply them it's not a shift it's not moving the whole graph it's taken the graph and growing your outputs or if you multiply by numbers less than one one third one five sevenths 1/2 taking your output value and shrinking them that's what's happening here so for our eight values and greater than one you're going to get what's called a vertical stretch it's gonna take those output values and it's going to multiply that so they get bigger what that's gonna do it's gonna start making your graph look more narrow imagine like I'm 6 feet tall so if if I start if I stayed my same weight and I gained like eight inches while I'm gonna get pretty tall but I'm also getting pretty thin so I'm that that's gonna that's gonna make me appear narrower and taller a vertical stretch is a narrow sort of idea I'm also gonna talk about this in a minute it's not on there to be suspense a vertical stretch is a horizontal compression a vertical compression is a horizontal stretch with six feet x six we tell if I if I shrunk 8 inches and same the same way I'm gonna get wider there's no way I'm not going to be wider that's what happens with with these vertical sort of stretch compression idea so with our values greater than 1 we're multiplying our outputs it's not an input idea now but idea I'm multiplying that by numbers that are making them bigger I'm stretching out my outlets that's a stretch and it's gonna be more narrow for numbers less than 1 that's shrinking that's saying take your output and give me fractions of them so I'm going to take my output values with my inputs being the same and make it smaller or it's going to go shrinking that's a compression and that will make the graph appear more wide so let's go ahead and let's talk about this one look at what this says look what it doesn't output this is I have an x squared kind of graph that's my basic graph here I've done my key points 1 1 0 0 negative 1 they do 1 now this says these are all your outputs our x squared your anklets are not affected all your outputs are x squared and B plug in a number and squared now take all those outputs and multiply x to know what can we do why in the world would Leonard want you to learn key points for something because if you're taking your key points and all you're doing is affecting the output by multiplying it by 2 then why don't we take your output and multiply the outputs of our key points by two so what this to does it really does take this and multiply your outputs not your inputs so you'd still get one button one times two is two zero zero times zero is zero times zero is zero negative one one well negative one that's insane but one times two gives you two those are your new outputs for this graph now we did not shift up we didn't shift down there's no plus after here no mines up here no plus in here if I can input an alliance in here if they can input so really we we still have zero zero but now we have instead of one cup of one this has affected the output values not the input values there's nothing in here affecting the input there's no fit in you're affecting the input because it's a but affect your output values are multiplied by two that's why I wanted you to learn the basic graph shapes and their key points so that we can start affecting outlets and later affecting the inputs since affects your outputs by multiplying by two so instead of one one you know one comma two zero zeros to the same negative one comma two this is taking your original parabola and made it skinnier made it more narrow it's stretched down vertically that's what's going on now I love the next one what about one-half X to the third so we're looking at going alright this is an X cubed graph this is an odd graph this has key points of 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 negative 1 but what does this do there's nothing add or subtract if therefore there's no vertical shift there's nothing added or subtracted inside the function no horizontal shift this says take every output can do it that way I can take every output of your X to the third power and multiply by 1/2 don't fit the inputs just take the output values and multiply them by 1/2 that would take the output values and that would cut them in half so 0 0 now the inputs with 0 0 1 1 negative 1 1 and affecting the outputs only the 0 0 would still be 0 0 1 1 would still have an input value 1 this is not inputs but it have an output value 1/2 negative 1 negative on would still have an input value negative 1 but an output value of negative 1/2 it's cut all of those output values and 1/2 do you see how it's going to squish it squish it down that's what's happening here in the future what's going to happen is we're going to do two two transformations at once it's me the next video when we just practice all this stuff if I put a negative sign up front that's not look very good but if that's a negative sign up front then that would affect the outputs by changing the sign as well so we can do both a vertical stretch or compression and we can do reflections about the x-axis at the same time so I want you to watch out for that in the next video that's what we're going to be doing so let's graph it we did not shift up or down only not shoot left or right we took our key points we affect your outputs by cutting them in half we still have zero zero but now instead of one one we cut the output in half instead of negative one negative one we cut the output in half so this is going to be a much shrunken sort of a graph as far as a vertical compression we can plug in a couple of the points if you if you want to be a little more accurate but notice how it's it took our original s-curve and women are sort of shrunk it down and compressed it also made a little bit wider because it compressed it this made this graph narrow because we stretched it I hope that makes sense to you that we still have some key points but then when we talk about a vertical stretching oppression we're affecting the output we're growing it if our a of the number in front there's more than one and we're shrinking it or compressing it if our a is less than one fractions of your outputs now how about horizontal stretching depression we I'm not going to talk a whole lot about this just one thing it's very very common that a horizontal stretch or compression can be changed into a vertical stretch or compression almost always with the stuff we deal with when we get to trigonometry no but there's sort of a different way that we're going to approach it so I'll get there when we eat those videos way way way in the future for right now what I would like it is that when we talk about a horizontal stretch or compression I mentioned this is a little while ago virtually everything inside parentheses is opposite of your intuition so here's what's going to happen if you have a number greater than three first are greater than one so you're a here if your a is greater than one that what that's going to do that's going to give you a horizontal compression not a horizontal stretch it's opposite of what you kind of want it to be numbers greater than one are a horizontal compression numbers less than one or a horizontal stretch why why in the world of that'd be the case I said something well back that's it goes into this if I talk about a vertical stretch it would be a horizontal compression when I stretched something out it's gonna make it appear more narrow it's going to compress the horizontally when I squish something down vertically it's going to stretch it out horizontally things work hand-in-hand on the prove it to you right now so if I have f of X equals three x quantity squared that would say what this is going to do this would compress your grab that's a parabola it would compress your graph horizontally well isn't that the same thing as 9x squared yeah well that's a stretch this is it's a stretched vertically x squared and I take every output and multiply it by nine that's going to go one it's going to make it much more narrow a horizontal compression is greater than one here is a vertical stretch do you see it do you see how that makes sense if I had 1/2 it would be 1/2 squared to be 1/4 there would be a vertical compression giving us a horizontal stretch they work in hand most of the time we can change horizontal stretches and compressions into I do vertical compressions and stretches respectively that's what we can do with it if you don't want to do that you're multiplying your input you'd still be the same exact points just doing it slightly different way that's what I'm going to leave it at I'm going to tell you that horizontal compressions and stretches we're going to change vertical doing the same exact thing right there now last one reflections in the next video we practice all the stuff put together what reflections do is they change the sign of either your output or your input so let's think about this let's say that I give you a function and you put something into it it gives you an output they go no no no change the sign well what's that gonna do it says I want you to change the sign of your Y value it literally says in English is look at your Y value your bio is based on f of X but I want you to take the original output and now change the sign so for something that would have a Y value normally that's positive you're gonna give me a negative for something that has a Y value that's negative normally you'd give me a positive so you're you're taking your your sign of your output side of your output is a vertical idea and I would change the sign change the Sun or change the sign change the sign what that what's that doing well that's taking your graph in reflecting it vertically reflected about nothing y-axis but the x-axis changing the output sign put something opposite side of the x-axis because the x axis marks where your outlets change sign doesn't it so that x axis floats at y equals zero above the x axis are positive outputs and below are negative outputs so if I start changing the sign of that positive becomes negative negative becomes positive it's it's reflecting it vertically that's a reflection of the x axis what happens with our what happens we think this sign of our inputs it's not nearly as common as our outputs but imagine I said I want you plug in five you okay negative five oh yeah no I said I said I said five negative I'm fine maybe if I'm gonna pacify you start changing out of the inputs on me well if I change an input sign then an input sign says if I would normally plug in five and I'm changing the sign to give me negative five or plug in negative two and now you're changing something to be positive two that's what that that's something I would do it would affect the input before I even got to the function what that's going to do is affect the sign of the Y axis that you are on this is a reflection about the y axis now like always and you didn't know what the shape is of the graph that we're talking about so I need to know that this cube this cube root function is normally this sort of an s-curve it's like the cube root it's like the the power three function flipped on its side so that's what that's gonna look like I'm gonna be graphing that but let's let's understand it this right here this basic graph shape has key points everything comes back of shape and key points of 1 1 0 0 and negative 1 negative 1 that's the key points for this graph now what's the negative do does the negative affect the input does negative affect the output well it's not next to the input it's not affecting the input I'm telling you you see you're telling me I'm gonna plug in the same input no problem so plug in a 1 or 0 or negative 1 no problem but this says take whatever the output value is and change the sign so take your key points take whatever the output values are and change the sign not the one not the 0 not that negative 1 as far as inputs but the one for an out becomes negative 1 0 does not change negative 1 for the input no problem but change this that's what this says it says change this on your output change the sign of your output of your original function one becomes negative 1 0 stays 0 negative 1 becomes positive 1 what's that done that is not change the input but it's given you an opposite output for that input so add normally being at 1 1 now your 1 they do want notice what it did to get out but they just flipped over the x-axis 0 0 didn't change not gonna change for any of these negative 1 negative 1 is what you normally have it's a change your output negative 1 don't use input make the 1 positive 1 so what's going on we would normally have this graph but now it has reflected it about the x-axis your wait a minute that looks a whole lot like it reflect about the y-axis you can view it two different ways notice if I took this and moved this negative inside cube root of negative x is the same thing as a negative cube root of x because that is an odd function that's the way that that would work so you can view it two different ways but the way that we talked about it what this would do what the negative does that native respect the outputs it would flip the output over the other side of the x-axis that's what that reflection does for you and I would I would want a student understand what that transformation is we would say this transformation there's no vertical shift there's no horizontal shift there's a reflection about the x axis that's what's going on okay this last one what happens about reflection over the y axis this says take your input and change the sign all right my input value is X now change the sign give me a negative x so let's see a square root our key points are 1 1 and 0 0 it's neither even nor odd it's neither it has only two key points that we really focus on so this says now I want you to take your input values and I want to change your values but leave your outputs alone so this would give us a instead of one one it'd be negative 1 1 instead of 0 0 it's to be 0 to 0 so go in from our graph our normal graph would look like this our normal graph would have a point at 0 0 that would have a point and make it positive 1 1 and it would look like this that happened from outside if I say now switch the sign of your inputs leave your output values alone so it's a sign of your inputs then instead of positive 1 1 I'd have negative 1 but I'd still have an Apple one and zero zero still there that's a reflection about the y axis that is what's going on I hope that that makes sense I hope that I've explained in such a way that you understand that what a vertical stretch is is affecting the output and leave the input alone by multiplying the output by some number numbers bigger than one take a number multiplied by something bigger than one it's going to grow it take a number multiply it by something less than one it's going to shrink it that's what's happening here when we talk about reflections we're talking about take an output and multiply by an opposite sign so change the sign it's going to take an output value and reflect you about the x-axis take an input value and multiply by the opposite sign I'm going to take an input and put it on the other side of the y-axis we are going to put all these things together the next video talk about vertical shifts and horizontal shifts and stretches compressions and reflections all at the same time and do a good job we explain what in the world they do we'll talk about shifting our x axis and y axis using our key points affecting the outputs or even the inputs of our key points and seeing what that does for our stretching and compressing and reflecting hope that makes sense I'll see you for the next video you
