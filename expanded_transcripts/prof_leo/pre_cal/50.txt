Transcript for: Finding Inverse Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 51)
welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about inverses so we're going to discuss when functions have inverses we're going to discuss how you find inverses how you can tell you found inverses or that two functions are actually inverses and what they look like once we found them so kind of the graphs of inverses and again remember why we're doing this uh the whole reason why we're talking about inverses is because we want to get to exponentials and logarithms and discover that they are in fact inverses we're going to do that very very soon and that's very powerful for us let's do a lot of different sort of things mathematically so let's talk about inverses where they come from what an inverse comes from is from something called a one to one function that we talked about in the last video so here's something you need to know if a function has an inverse it's going to be one to one and if a function is one to one it's going to have an inverse and that's exactly what this first statement says a function has an inverse if and only if it is one to one that statement if and only it's kind of strange if you've never seen it before that's called a biconditional statement it means one is necessary and sufficient for the other in other words it says uh if a function is going to have an inverse it's got to be one to one and if it functions one to one it's going to have an inverse it basically goes both ways so inverses are important and one-on-one functions are important you can't have an inverse without being one-to-one and so we we needed that we need to understand that functions were one-to-one in order to have an inverse a couple of things i want you to know when we talk about what an inverse is an inverse undoes something so like addition and subtraction are inverse operations and likewise inverse functions are going to undo each other and we're going to talk about that when we get to the composition here in just a minute a couple other is that if f of x is a one-to-one function which means it's going to have an inverse right if we know it's one one it's gonna have inverse then we have a little uh notation for that and we can say um a couple different things about being one to one sorry about being an inverse a couple different notations uh typically we're going to see this little minus one and in my opinion it's really not great notation usually it's it's a little bit better to use something like arc or inverse and say it but this is the notation that we have and so when you see that it is not an exponent what that stands for it's not f to the negative one power it's not a reciprocal because it would be a reciprocal would be one over f of x that's not how we find hardly any inverses what that means is and how this is pronounced is f inverse of x so for a one-to-one function f and it's gonna have an inverse that inverse function is notated as f inverse and it has a little negative one as a superscript so the inverse is f inverse of x that's how you say that and it's also going to be one to one and it just makes sense if an inverse is one if a function is one to one its inverse is also going to be one to one because when we're going to find this out essentially we're just switching x's and y's to create our inverses so we're going to get into that just a little little bit so recap real quick uh one to one functions have inverses and inverses have to be one to one they're going to undo each other when you see that in just a second and then if a function is one to one it has an inverse it's going to we write that as a superscript with a negative one and we say f inverse or g inverse or whatever the function's name is so what is this whole undoing thing about when you have a function and you compose it with its inverse for instance when you have a function f and it's inverse and your input is x here's what the undoing says we saw this when we did composition of functions a couple videos ago that we actually had an inverse and what happened was we took an input we ran it through a function and another function which was its inverse and it gave us back the input this is what this is about to say if you take an input where would this go first this would go into the inverse function and the output of that would go into the original function this f of x and it would give you out whatever you plug back in well what did you plug in you plug in x if you compose a function and its inverse it's going to cancel out all the operations everything about it and it's going to leave you with whatever you plugged in that is what an inverse function does and so here we'd say all right our input is x it ran through one function and the inverse of that function is going to undo everything about it and versus undo each other it's going to leave us with x what if i did it the other way around what if i write my input through the function and then that through the inverse of the function it's going to leave you the same thing this is the only time in the world that when you compose functions differently when you switch around like commuted if you want to think of that if you compose two functions and you reverse it and you compose those functions the opposite way and you get the same thing out it says those things are inverses and the thing you will get out is x i hope it makes sense that that x that you're getting out is your input if you plugged in five you get out five you plug in negative two you get up negative 2 by doing this why well because when you plugged into your function it did something to that input right it gave you an output but then if your inverse undoes everything that it did to that input it's going to be back the input so it's going to undo everything the function did likewise the function would undo everything the inverse did they are inverses of one another we're going to see that in a couple of these examples i'll show you that before we get into it i simply want to show you with uh with one example on on how to find a function an inverse of a function with which is some points so before we get into this one imagine that we had just this relationship and i say i want to find an inverse for this and this is going to lead us on what to do with these algebraic functions that we have on the board firstly we do need to understand what one to one means so one to one means number one that it is a function that means our inputs one three seven and five can't be repeated and it has to be one to one function means our outputs cannot be repeated negative two five negative three and eight this is a one to one function it's a function because every input is giving us one output we can see that and it's a one-to-one function because not only is every input giving us one output but those outputs are unique every input has given us one unique output those topics are not repeated so here's what an inverse would do think about the work behind it and this is going to illustrate why this happens think about the work behind it so if i plug in 1 what my function does my function gives me out negative 2. what would an inverse have to do to undo all that it's going to have an inverse because this is a one-to-one function it has to have an inverse but what would happen well if my function is mapping basically one to negative two then the inverse has to undo that where is that what where is the value now so if i plug in one and got out negative two i went from one to negative two the inverse has to say well wait a minute um i gotta take that negative two and i gotta move it back to one i have to undo everything about it i've always thought of this because i've had i got some kids like two-year-olds when you're trying to clean the house this is like a two-year-old so you take toy and you put toy on away let's say this is this is like the the uh the toy chest or something you take toy from floor to toy chest what's two year old do immediately right after toy chest two four yay that is what an inverse does two-year-olds are cleaning inverses they can do everything that you've just done well that's true one to negative two got undone now it went from negative two back to one notice what happened it took my input ran it through a function ran that output as an input through an inverse and gave me back what i originally put in so i plugged in one i ran through function inverse and it gave me out one that's what this says it says take your input row through function run through inverse get back out your input take input run through function run through inverse get you back out whatever you plugged in that's all there is to it every point we can manipulate that way so our inverse is going to say all right what are you doing really in essence all you're doing is you're changing your input and your output you're just you're swapping them your input becomes your output your output becomes your input so the inverse of 3 five would be the point five three and for seven negative three that inverse would be negative three seven and finally eight five this would be the inverse of f we call it f inverse and all we're doing essentially is switching our x with our y that is what inverses really do and that's how they undo the function they just say all right well hey you took an input and moved it to an output i'm going to switch that and take the output move back to the input it should make sense it's just switching your x with your y it's replacing those or reversing those so that's a bit about why this works one illustration that we're going to see that now as we solve for these functions for inverses so let's get started let's take a look at f of x 1 minus 3x i'm going to give you a series of steps on how you can solve a one-to-one function for its inverse how you can find that the first step is if we're going to have to switch x with y and that's exactly what we did in the previous example we just switched the input with the output or the x value of the y value and it gave us an inverse we're going to do the same thing algebraically but we don't have y we do have something that stands for y f of x h of x g of x those are all the output values those are the output for your function and we can call that y f x g of x and h of x are just a little hard to work with in some algebra and so we're going to replace that with y so step number one replace your name of your function f of x with y step number two is you're actually going to find the inverse right now you can perform that performing the inverse is exactly what we did earlier switching your x with your y and we're going to do that every place we see y which should only be one place remember there's only one output right so you should be just one place we're going to call that x and every place we see x we're going to call that y in this way we have just reversed the input and the output this right here has done the inverse what we're going to do now is solve for y why what's it going to do notice if i replace my output with an input an input with an output and i solve for this it's going to have to do undo everything about this function it's going to undo all these operations it's going to undo the function itself and that's what inverse does it undoes a function and so we replace with y we change our y to an x and all of our x's that we have into y's and then we solve for y it's not going to be that bad we're going to subtract one divide by negative three i really don't like seeing a negative on the denominator so i'm going to write this a little differently maybe move my negative to my numerator in which case you would have to distribute and this essentially is your inverse but you want to call it such you want to say yes this is what i've done this is the process of finding the inverse i've replaced it with y so it's something i could work with easier that's only reason why we do it i've replaced my output with an input and input with an output input and i've solved for y that's undone the entire function but then you're going to call it that so you say this process will find you the inverse for any one to one function and then what we're going to say is that is the inverse of f so we're going to write it as f inverse and that's really all i need you to be able to do i need to be able to take a function and find its inverse of the process that i've shown you now let's take a look at the next one g of x g of x equals x cubed plus four we're gonna say all right um is that a one to one function first off is this a one to one function because you can only solve inverses for inverses if you do have one to one functions so you go well how do you know well it might be nice to take a look at those graphs that's a line a diagonal line with a slope of negative three looks like that with y intercept of one so our all of our lines are one-to-one functions it's gonna have an inverse that's an x cubed and there's no going back down because you've seen that cubics go back down with some turning points this doesn't have any because that's just a vertical shift of four oh wait hey all our transformations are coming back at us we should understand that that's a power three cubic that has a its original before we shifted x intercept and y intercept is 0 0. it's going through the origin but it shifted up four units it's not causing any additional turning points this is a one-to-one function and so we can now solve for its inverse since it is one to one it's going to have one and we go through the same process that we've just done we're going to start by replacing our g of x with y after that we say all right if i want to find an inverse i'm going to have to undo the function somehow um i've seen some teachers teach it like hey just solve for x you can you can do that and then then switch your variables but i've seen a lot of students accidentally leave it in terms of why which is we don't want that so instead we go right well what can i do differently i could change my output to an input and my input to an output or in other words switch y to x and every x to y and then solve for y and it accomplishes the same thing but it's a little bit more understandable and what you get is is going to be your final answer you don't have to switch all your variables after that so let's solve for y and do doing so undo our original function we're going to subtract four and lastly how we get rid of a power three is with a cube root i'm going to ask something that should pop into your head really quick when you take a cube root do you need to put a plus and minus in front of your cube root and you should know that you should know with a cube root or a fifth root or a seventh root or any odd root you do not need that because power threes maintain the sign of the radicand in other words what's on the inside if it's negative you maintain a negative and it's positive maintain a positive you don't need that power twos what happens if you take a square root well with square roots you would need a plus and minus wouldn't you so if i needed a plus and minus because those those those even powers 2 4 8 6 if i square a negative it becomes positive it does not maintain the sign of its radicand which is where that came from in the first place i don't need them for cubes or cube roots but certainly here we're going to talk about that in a second so if we simplify we know that this is going to be y equals the cube root of x minus 4 that is the inverse but i'm going to say that this is an inverse one thing now you can see this all the time a lot of the times because our notation is based on having a function f because it's very very common many many times you are going to see this and this is technically incorrect it is actually incorrect when you call something inverse you need to say what it's inverse of so if i use f inverse i'm not really matched up with the original function that i'm finding inverse four so if i find the infer inverse for g of x it's not going to magically become f inverse of x we're going to call this whatever the name is inverse so this is the inverse of the function g not f so in both cases we replaced with y we replaced our y with x x of y we solved for y there by finding the inverse and we called it an inverse now what is that for well that essentially tells you what's going on it tells you that you're undoing everything and that's exactly what we've done but it's also a way for you to check your work here's how if you compose what you get here into what you get here or what's here into what you've found what's going to happen is these two things will cancel everything out and you will end with x why well if your input is x and a function and inverse undo each other then the output also has to be x it has to be whatever you had originally it's got to not essentially do nothing you start with x you end with x so we're going to show that we're going to show this in this example that when you compose a function with this inverse in either way it's going to simplify down to x so let's try it if we want to check our work or check whether any two functions are inverses just compose them it doesn't really matter the order in which you go whether you want to do g of g inverse or g inverse of g it doesn't matter sometimes you're asked to show both that really doesn't matter because if you do it one way it's going to work both ways so let's check g inverse and a g if you remember compositions this is why we did compositions everything coming together right now for us if we do compositions we look at our first function this function right here say let's open that up with a blank space take the second function which is what we have right down here evaluate it essentially just plug it into the variable or the blank space of the function you just open now it doesn't have to be this easy this is the easy one because i wanted to show it to you but everything should cancel hey cube root to the third power is gone x minus four plus four is x this is what will happen every time you compose a function onto its inverse or an inverse onto its function every time in fact if you wanted to picture this just think about it if i did it opposite i took this function and put it here so this x would be x cubed plus 4. x cubed plus 4 minus 4 those would count so you get x cubed the cube root of x cubed would be x it'd give you the same exact thing no matter what and that's what compositions of inverses do where are we going with it like why who cares when we get to logarithms and exponentials we're going to find out the following things we're going to find out that an exponential is 1 1 well that means it has to have an inverse but none exists and what we had and so we created one we discovered one everyone think about that we discovered logarithms okay exponentials and logarithms are not inverses what's that mean means when you compose them they're going to cancel that's exactly what this says if you compose a function with this inverse it's going to cancel if you compose a function with its inverse it's going to cancel we're going to discover that logarithms exponentials are inverses and therefore when you compose them they cancel and that leaves us how do you solve exponentials and how to solve logarithms that's why we need it that's why we did compositions to get to one-to-one and inverses so that we can explore exponentials and logarithms that's why all right let's talk about the last one h of x equals x squared plus nine and you are asked find the inverse of this function maybe even find it and verify that they're inverses by doing a composition sounds like a lot of words it's not that hard however you do know something about inverses you know that they have to come from one to one functions well think about that this right there is a parabola are parabolas inherently one-to-one well no they're inherently not one-to-one functions there are many outputs which are repeated there are many equal outputs that give us different inputs here's what happens if you try to go ahead and find an inverse of a non-one to one function you're going to run into a situation that as you're solving this for y you're going to be getting having one input give you two different outputs we're going to see it in here so here's how to how to fix that or how um textbooks or teachers fix that they say okay is that one to one well no can you find an inverse or something that's not one to one no no every single inverse has to come from a one-to-one function so how do we fix this problem this is a parabola that shifted up nine units so if i just look at one side of my graph so either the positive x-axis or the negative x-axis well then it becomes one-to-one so i find out where that axis of symmetry is and i say well let's let's just take a look at that let's take a look at when x is greater than or equal to zero well then at that point and further to the right this would become a one one function this is a parabola shifted up nine units and i'm looking at just where x is positive it's going to give me [Music] that half of a graph oh is that let's say that's nine if is that one to one yes if i ignore this other half of the parabola i ignore that and i say i am ignoring it if i ignore that then that is a one-to-one function and in order to find that inverse we can go through the same process but you are going to see that when we start solving this for y we would unless we had done that we would come up with a situation where one input would give us two outputs this is the whole reason do not miss this point the whole reason you needed one to one was so that one input gave you one unique output y so that when you switch them like we do we switch x's wise then that output becomes your input so what that says is that if i have two inputs giving me the same output remember my output is going to become my input then i'd have one input give me two different outputs that would be a non-function this is why it was so important for us to have a one to one function so one input one unique output not not a not not repeated by any any other input that would be an issue so i switch it that's not even a function anymore so let's solve this let's see what the issue would be the first thing we're going to do is we're going to set our h of x equal to y so basically we replace it with y it gives us something that's a little easier to work with then we're going to replace y with x and x is y we're interchanging our outputs and our inputs and as we solve for this y as we solve the output it's going to undo everything about this function and it's going to give us our inverse so let's subtract 9 and here it is when you took a cube root you didn't need a plus and minus but when you take a square root fourth root an even radical when you do that on both sides yeah for sure you're going to have a plus and minus and let's check this out think back i really need to think back to one of our first videos and we discovered functions versus non-functions and we said all right if you have a plus and minus stemming from the fact that you were taking a square root of both sides you had a non-function that's exactly the point i'm trying to make here this is not one-to-one this is not one-to-one without this this is not one-to-one if you go and try to solve it if you try to find an inverse of a non-one-to-one function what you're going to get is a non-function period if you plug in one number besides nine plug in one number here it's going to give you two different outputs one input would give you two outputs here that's a problem it's not even a function why would one input give you two outputs because two out the two inputs here give you the same output so if two inputs give you the same output one new input that's your output would give you two new outputs you're switching them this would not even be a function anymore so how do you fix it you fix it by restricting your domain you fix it by saying okay we're only looking at this part that is one to one what that would be is now remove that negative if our x is positive would give us just those positives there and that's the way we get around this idea of if you don't have a one-to-one function can you still find inverse no but you can restrict your domain so that that changes the function into being one to one or or looks at just the one to one part of that function so this came from h that's h inverse and we say that's just the square root of x minus nine if you needed to prove that that was the inverse you would show a composition i showed it this way i'm going to show it one more time let me show it backwards just to show the same thing so if i compose my first function onto my second or my original h of x onto the inverse i'm going to open h of x h inverse of x with a blank space i'm going to put my function inside and we can really easily see that all this stuff's going to cancel a function and inverse into each other if i start with x i'm going to get out x that happens every time when you compose inversion that's how you check we're going to come back with a few more examples a little bit more robust i'd say and then we'll be done let's get after we got four more examples we'll talk about the graphs of inverses how they look to be very important for exponentials and then and then we'll call it uh call it a video and we'll move on to exponentials in the next video so i'm going to run through these fairly quickly now the idea is not for me to teach you more about inverses where they come from but to show you some of the techniques you need to solve for y there's some factoring involved that sometimes students just forget that you can do and so i'm going to show you that it's very useful now it's also very useful when we solve for logarithms in about a lot of videos so let's take a look at them number one thing when you get these examples it's going to say find the inverse for this one two one function so you don't necessarily need to check for it the times when you see really that something's not one-to-one is when you start having to take a square root and you go oh wait a minute that's that's a problem and therefore you need to restrict the domain we'll see that right here like that's a that's an even function we'll talk about that even functions are symmetric about the y-axis we need to restrict the domain um but in general you go all right that's that's one to one because it's going to tell me that or i can i can i can test it out like we've done before but in general those are going to be one to one if they're asking you to find an inverse so that's a one-to-one function you could graph it if you wanted to i taught you how to graph them but it's it's for sure going to pass the horizontal line test that's one one so we're going to run through it i'm going to show you all the techniques that you need number one thing you're going to replace your output with y then what we're going to do is replace the y with x and replace every x with y and finally we're going to solve for that y sometimes it's not all that easy sometimes it is it's not that bad but in general that's our idea so if we solve for y we're going to have to somehow move y off a denominator you can do it a couple different ways you can picture this as a proportion and cross multiply if you think of this as x over one that's totally fine you can multiply both sides by the denominator that's okay too that's what i'm going to do um you can just switch this with this denominator which is eventually what we're going to do anyhow and so i'm going to show that to you so let's multiply by 2 minus y and 2 minus y what are we going to get on the left hand side we get 2 minus y times x on the right hand side we get four now here's what i tell you at this point in a lot of these examples it's time for you to make it the correct choice you either distribute or you don't here's how to tell if you have all of your y's already on this side in parentheses just divide by that x if you don't then you need to distribute collect all your y terms on one side all your non-y terms on the other side and you're going to factor we'll see that in a couple examples but for right now we look at this and all right i've got all my y's right here i am just trying to solve for y there's no otherwise anywhere else i do not need to distribute if you do distribute is it a problem no might be a little extra work but it's not a problem so we're going to divide by x we're going to subtract 2 and if we divide by negative 1 we get y equals i'm going to switch our our order here positive 2 minus 4 over x we're done that's our inverse 2 minus 4 over x if you have to make this one fraction remember you need a common denominator it'd be 2x minus 4 over x you can do that x over x and that's fine also it's the same exact thing and you say all right this is f inverse of x okay what if you don't like that what if you don't like to divide or if you say you know what i'm just a distribution kind of person i just love distribute that's fine there's nothing wrong with that in fact we're going to do that on all the rest of our examples we're going to have to distribute that if you do distribute from here so we not divide by x if you distribute then at this point collect all your y terms on one side all your non y terms on the other side and then if you have more than one y term factor the y and divide if you don't like here just divide just divide by negative x we rarely like to see a negative on the denominator so i'm going to take that run that through the denominator with the numerator so if i divide by negative 1 on the numerator and denominator actually i would get 2x minus 4 over x which is exactly the same thing that we got either way works pick the way that you're most comfortable with a lot of people actually do like the distribution because they're used to it just saying you don't really have to do that you can divide the main point is collect your chart with y's factor if you have to and then your final step should be divide maybe change your signs and that's our inverse could you compose it yeah you could but you'd have to take this function and put it right there if you did that you need to clear a denominator but it is going to eventually cancel out everything and give you x all right so let's try g of x g of x equals negative two x over x minus one we're gonna right after we're gonna try to find the inverse so let's replace our g with y place we see y which is only one place we're going to change that into an x and every place we see an x we're going to change that into a y now we've got to solve for y but we also have a denominator so we're going to multiply both sides by that and we end up getting y minus one x equals negative two y and the last example i gave you give you the example to show you that it's not always necessary to to do distribution however if you ever have a y anywhere else beside in that parenthesis you have to distribute the idea is get all of your terms with y on one side all the terms without y on the other side why because then you can factor the y and divide that's what we're going to do here so when you see this if you confuse just distribute we know that it actually does work both cases is going to work but here for sure you're going to have to distribute this so when we distribute we get x y minus x equals negative 2y and this is where a lot of students get stuck they go what in the world do i do now because i have y's in two different places what i'm going to do factor but in order to factor you get your y's on one side and non y's and other that way every term has a y so i'm going to take this and move it over here and this and move over here by adding x on both sides and adding the 2y on both sides so that's what we're doing right now i'm going to add 2y to both sides i'm going to add x to both sides and look what it does if i collect my terms with y and separate my terms without y it leaves me every term with y over here as something that can that has a gcf of y i can factor it looks like magic almost like oh that's cool i've just changed two y's into one well that's what factoring does doesn't it it removes it from all the terms and puts in one spot via multiplication but now i can divide because it is multiplication and that right there is the inverse of the function g that we started with you can check your work you can compose it it just becomes more difficult with some of these harder problems more complicated because you have to plug in this function in at least two different places most of the time so you take this plug it in here and here you'd have to simplify that complex fraction that you're going to get with the lcd of x plus 2 distribute combine some like terms factor and it's going to cancel out and leave you with just an x just for fun let's do it so either way you go it doesn't matter how you compose them i'm going to compose g of g inverse so how compositions work you open up your first function listed i'm looking back at my g i'm going to replace all my variables with some blank spaces into those blank spaces i put my second function so into this function i put this entire function so into my blank spaces i put this what i found that looks kind of nasty but this is the reason why we deal with complex fractions in like intermediate algebra classes so that we do this so how do i deal with complex fractions we multiply by the lcd so our lcd here is just x plus 2. we're going to multiply both the numerator and denominators so as to multiply by a really fancy one equivalent rational expression is what we're creating here i'm going to multiply both the numerator denominator x plus 2. on this numerator that just cancels and that's great so on this numerator i'm just going to get negative 2x on my denominator keep in mind you have to distribute this so i'm going to distribute yes it's going to go here x plus 2 and x 2 are going to cancel i'm going to get x but it also multiplies to the now when you multiply by one you're going to subtract that whole thing so what's that look like oh my gosh i'm subtracting the whole thing subtracting 1 times that whole thing so it's negative 2x over x minus x minus 2 not plus 2. and because negative 2 of negative two is one we get x and that proves it that proves that these two things are in fact inverses you can actually see it here too imagine plugging in anything but one imagine plugging in something like two all right so let's remember we're plugging in 2d plug into if i plug in 2 i get negative 4 over 1. well that's negative 4. now take your negative 4 plug it in here negative 4 divided by negative 4 plus 2 well this is negative 2 negative four divided by negative two is two i got out after i plugged it in and ran it through i got back out two that's what inverses does and that's what this composition is showing you okay let's move on to the last two let's look at h of x negative three x plus four that negative is supposed to be out front negative three x plus four over x minus two first thing we're doing to find the inverse is recognizing that it's gonna be a one to one function if we're going to find it or it has to have a domain restriction so that's a one-to-one function actually has a horizontal asymptote at negative three that's what it's going to look like but we're going to replace our h of x with y and we show that every time now we take our y we say i want that to be my x and every place i see an x i'm going to change that to a y and now it's our job to solve for y we're going to deal with something very similar to this and that we're going to have to distribute and collect our y terms and factor but we also see that negative make it make a choice with that negative and do one of one of three things either divide right now by negative one that's okay you can do that or multiply through your numerator which is what i'm going to do or your denominator which i don't recommend but you can do so i'm going to run this through my numerator and make this x equals negative three y minus four over y minus two that way we have at least we have a sign floating out front that we're not sure of so you can always do that you always just run through your numerator so i distributed negative 3y and then minus 4. now we're going to go ahead and do our manipulation try to solve for y let's firstly multiply both sides by y minus 2. and then we're going to check your problem if all of my y's are right here all i've got to do is divide if i have more y's that are right here i need to distribute collect my y's and factor that's what happens here so i have a y here and here it says you're gonna have to collect those terms there's no way to do that without distribution and now we see it we got a y here y here we got to collect and we got to get everything else it doesn't have a y on the other side so i'm going to add 2x and add 3y to both sides now we're ready to factor now because we factored we have things that are multiplied together we undo multiplication by division we could check our work with a composition take this plug it into the variables there and simplify yeah you're going to get a lot of complex fractions but it is possible to show that and this is our inverse so we're going to say that this came from the function h this is h inverse that's it if you i wouldn't say this is really conclusive but if you did take a value besides negative besides positive 2 because you can't believe that and you evaluated here took the output plugged in here and give you the same input that's a really good indication without doing a composition that you have inverses but really to check your work you're going to want to compose those i hope this is making sense i hope you're seeing the process and the whole idea of why i'm doing this one just make sure you're grouping your y's that way you can factor it and i get stuck right there's where students get stuck on it so let's come back we'll do one more example all right here we go so f of x equals x squared plus 3 over 3x squared you go wait a minute that's an even function i'll verify that's an even function even functions are symmetric about the y-axis so if something's symmetric about the y-axis no matter how it looks it is not going to be one to one so this requires something from us if we have something symmetric with the y-axis we can make a one-to-one part of it a lot of the times by taking and saying let's just let x be greater than or equal to zero now there's a problem with that too in this case we can't let x be greater than or equal to zero why well it fails our domain our domain says you've got a vertical asymptote on the x on that y axis you can't let x equal zero so we just want to be strictly greater than zero here and i hope that makes sense to put domain together with this this hey you have to have a one-to-one function this section of the x-axis is going to cause this to be a one-to-one function that's not normally something you would have to do it's going to be given to you it's going to say hey this is 101 or hey on this portion of the x-axis this is a one-to-one function now i'll find the inverse considering that and so we go through that so all right let's replace our f of x with y let's change our y to an x our x's both to y's and now we're going to solve for y do the same thing you did here let's multiply both sides by 3y squared so 3xy squared these are gone you're going to get y squared plus 3. and now the same idea collect your terms that have y or y squared and the ones that don't leave them on the other side so i'm going to subtract y squared there's no distribution here and then we're going to factor factor out the whole gcf so factor out y squared and now because we have factored these are connected by multiplication multiplication we can divide and one more step and why that was necessary if you ever see yourself taking a square root you're going to normally have a plus and minus if that wasn't there oh man i hope makes sense if that wasn't there when you did this next step you would have to have a plus and minus there and that would create a problem for you because you'd say one input would give me two outputs stemming from the fact that right here two inputs are giving you one output that would be a problem so one input would give me two outputs if i reverse that that's an issue but because we restrict our domain you don't have both you just have the positive here and that creates an inverse and it's inverse of this function on that domain so what that means is that these are both one-to-one functions and they're in versus one another you can compose them you might kind of see that your squares are going to cancel out your square root threes uh you have a little bit of work with the lcd there but it certainly would be an inverse and we're going to say that this is f inverse of x i hope i've made that make sense for you how to find an inverse algebraically so we've done it now with points so we can just switch x and y that's essentially what we've done here just a lot more work um and we had to do it all the time right because we these aren't just four points those are infinite number points so we can't switch it in for the number of points unless we do it with the function itself that's what we've done we made sure to label it appropriately with our f inverse h inverse as the case may be and now we're going to take a look at graphs very briefly to see that what a graph does from a function to its inverse all right last little bit we need to talk about the graphs and i hope you're still with me because this is really important this is how one of the ways that we're going to determine what a logarithm is from an exponential function so here's what you need to know about a function and its inverse graphically if this is our function is it a one-to-one function yeah is it gonna have inverse all of them do all one-to-one functions are going to have an inverse function graphically here's what happens because we switch our x with our y you remember that we did with points we do with algebraic functions because you switch your x with your y because your input becomes your output your output times your input we are going to reflect our function across the y equals x line and it is going to give us our inverse so a function and its inverse are reflections about this y equals x line because we're switching x with y to create that inverse that's the idea so this function will look like this roughly so this point is let's say negative 3 0 then now we switch that if this was negative 3 0 then 0 negative 3 should appear on my inverse function if this was let's say um 0 4 just making these up right now then 4 0 should appear on my inverse function and i've sketched this this is approximate but it's just to show you that this is the inverse of this function uh the graphs are reflections about this diagonal line this y equals x line if you folded it they hopefully match up the distance here should be the same and that's it this is still a one to one function they are inverses of one another if i had this as our function that would be the inverse it doesn't really matter they're inverses of each other so moving on what happens if you're required to graph a an inverse from its function i've given you one that i made up really quickly so i've given you one two three four five points one of which you notice is on that y equals x line if we ever want to find the inverse just take those points reverse them and reflect it about this diagonal line it's a lot easier when it doesn't intersect that line to find the reflection when it does you're going to be crossing it's going to get a little bit awkward so here's the idea if we have these four points listed not that one because that right there if i reflect something on y equals x it's going to stay y equals x this is a point that's going to be on both of these functions the function and its inverse so if i have the other four points then if 2 negative 2 1 is on the original function remember that we're switching that was not switching we're switching the y with the x so if negative 2 1 is on the original then 1 negative 2 is on the inverse you know it's changing these signs you switch your x with your y and 0 negative 1 negative 2 0 and negative 7 3 let's double check so switched switched switched and switched if we plot those one negative two that would be the new point for an inverse zero negative one this would be now this point for the inverse this point is the same now my scale is a little off but that's going to be the same zero negative so negative two zero this became that point and negative seven three this became that point when i reflected it and we're going to do our best to graph this looks about like that this is a little off of our scale but hopefully you get the point that all this is really doing is taking this and reflecting about that point right there notice how they have to both have the same exact point because that is on or y equals x so i've taken this and i just rotated it and that's where it ended up so i hope i hope you're with me on the graphs what we're going to do in the future is get an exponential and reflected about that line it's going to create the graph of a logarithm we'll look at our key points for that and that'll be about it we're ready to get certain exponentials which is exciting a whole other world kind of opens up with them with us or for us with exponentials and logarithms so at this point you didn't know that one-to-one functions create inverses that inverses only come from one-to-one functions and then how to find them algebraically and what they look like graphically so hopefully it's making sense and i'll see you for another video you
