Transcript for: Finding End Behavior of Rational Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 42)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we are going to talk about the last case of end behavior of rational functions as a little deceiving because the title is end behavior rational functions i do want to tell you that horizontal asymptotes or an oblique asymptote that is also end behavior they're just special cases so this is the case where what if a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero or y equals a constant or an oblique asymptote at y equals some sort of linear function does not happen so what would that look like well a horizontal asymptote we know happens when the degree of the denominator is equal to the numerator or bigger than the numerator you're going to get constant or zero respectively we know that an oblique asymptote sometimes called a slant or diagonal asymptote happens when the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of denominator but by only one well what if we have the degree of the numerator larger than the degree of the denominator by more than one then we're just going to get some straight up end behavior it's not hard it is going to look very similar what we did on horizontal asymptotes when we found those things so when we do this when we deal with just end behavior we would look and go okay let's first just identify some degrees because that is a nice way to at least understand where what we're gonna be getting out of this thing we look at the degree of the numerator is five degree of denominator is three so remember denominator has to be bigger or equal for us to get horizontal numerator has to be bigger by exactly 1 for us to get oblique more than that we just have end behavior so this degree is five that degree is three the numerator outpaces the denominator by more than one so there is no horizontal there is no oblique we're just getting end behavior remember you cannot have all of them you're either horizontal you are oblique or you have end behavior that's different from those things so we're just going to take a look at this by taking the leading terms that's what end behavior is defined as is taking the leading terms of your polynomial in this case we have two of them so we take the leading term of our numerator and denominator in the previous videos we talked about how leading terms are power functions and so when you put power functions and ratio either your numerator or your denominator is going to completely cancel out as far as the variables are concerned well if we have a numerator that's larger in degree by more than one our denominator is going to completely disappear as far as its variables so we would say all right here's x to the third x to the fifth notice you'll never get a one when you do this unless you have an oblique asymptote and this would give us 4x squared ladies and gentlemen that that's exactly exactly what this graph is going to look like as we get end behavior so just picture in your head what that even positive power function looks like this is 4x squared it's narrow it's upward opening it looks like a parabola this is going to do this now of course we're going to have some things that happen in the middle like x-intercepts or some vertical asymptotes but we will not have a horizontal asymptote we will not have an oblique asymptote this function will actually be modeled by 4x squared as x approaches positive negative infinity you can see it take x make it really large as x approaches positive infinity four times really big numbers squared are enormous numbers this function would also approach positive infinity now think about x approaches negative infinity take some really big negative numbers on the x-axis square them oh wait that's positive okay multiply by four that's even more positive that's also positive infinity so if i take really big numbers squared multiply by four i get really big numbers if i take really negative numbers square them multiply by four i get really big numbers so this function would also approach positive infinity that's why we get that look that's why even functions do that so this is the the model of this graph as we approach the end behavior that's that's all it is now of course you know me i like to cover lots of cases with one example so what would happen if that were negative so let's imagine that's negative that's negative that's negative really nothing you do would change except now positive numbers times a negative would be negative infinity and positive numbers because a large negative number squared times negative negative infinity as well so this would go negative negative and our graph would look you yeah i should probably do a different case i don't want to confuse you let's do it down here let's suppose that g of x looked like that in its end behavior then we would just end up getting a negative a negative even power function just a downward opening so this cool this no big deal one more case let's say that we did all this and this happened to be like 4x to the sixth over x cubed so if that was the power six we'd get something like that how would that look well when we simplify remember power functions can simplify that would give us a power three so this would be four x to the third well just think about what that power function looks like and that would be the modeling of our original rational function if we had started with 4x to the sixth power like we have here well that's an odd okay an odd a cubic in this case and it's positive so let's see odd power functions look like this when they're positive so this end behavior would be very close to that it would mirror or model for x to the third that's what that's going to be again if we change it to negative all that really happens is we reflect that graph and then that would model the end behavior of this function so if i just made that negative and made that a six negative four x to the sixth over x to the third would give us negative four x to the third the end behavior would look just like that things can happen in the middle we can have x-intercepts vertical asymptotes things like that uh but this is what the end behavior would look like so i hope that makes sense hope that you all uh you know understand end behavior a little bit better than we started next example the next video we're going to practice about six examples just really hammering through what do you do first what do you do second what what do our where do our vertical asymptotes come from horizontal asymptote where does it come from oblique or a whole and what to do with that after that we'll we'll practice graphing a lot of examples it'll be a huge video uh kind of intimidating in its length but you need to watch it because this is it's one of the capstones of this course is being able to graph rational functions appropriately so i'm going to teach you that next video we're just going to practice putting everything together so i'll see for that you
