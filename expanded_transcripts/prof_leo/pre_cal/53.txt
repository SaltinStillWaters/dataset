Transcript for: Solving Exponential Equations with Common Bases (Precalculus - College Algebra 54)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about a very special case on how to solve exponentials so we are kind of halfway through talking about exponentials and logarithms we're going to get to logarithms very shortly but we're going to talk about exponentials just to get our brains wrapped around a couple of ideas so here's what i want you to learn in this video number one in general why we have learned everything we've learned in this unit so talking about exponentials and logarithms and inverses and one-to-one functions and composition functions is so that we can make the following connections this is it this is a train of thought that we needed to know number one we learned about one-to-one functions so that we can discover inverses one to one functions have inverses we learn about inverses to know that when you compose two inverses of compositions with inverses they undo each other we learned about those things to discover that exponential functions are one to one therefore they're going to have this inverse we're going to call that inverse a logarithm and when you compose them an exponential and a logarithm will basically cancel each other out that's what we're going to to get to so this is a very very special case on what if you can shortcut that that that situation what if you can solve exponentials without logarithms and there is one time that you can do that it's if you can find common bases in an equation that has exponential expressions so in general and i need you to know this in general if you want to solve exponential equations you need logarithms that's a must unless we have this one special case where we can find common bases now why is it work well if you have an equation with exponential expressions and that's it all your terms or exponentials basically looks like this you have one exponential equal to another exponential if you can make it so that you have the same exact base on both sides of your equation we can make something happen we can say hey does it make sense that if this and this have the same base and these are equal the only way they can possibly happen is if the exponents are also equal and that's a statement that's the special case for solving exponential equations when you don't need logarithms is if and only if you have this these common bases here so if a to the x equals a to the y if our bases are the same in an equation then your exponents also have to be equal that seems pretty straightforward i hope but here's here's the point there's really nothing happening here uh there's no real math that you show like you you don't need to cross out the a's you can i love crossing stuff out but you don't have to this is just a blanket statement saying if you have an equation with your base is the same the exponents also have to be the same and take this for instance if you have 2 to the i don't know equals 2 to the third well the only way these can possibly be equal is if you have the same base here you have the same exponent here two to the third is eight two to what power gives you eight well two to the third would be eight so we'd say this question mark equals three well question mark's a really awkward way to write something we don't know why don't we use a variable and we can so we'd say hey if 2 to the x this thing i don't know equals 2 to the third then x would equal 3 in this case that's the only way to make this statement true is if those exponents are the same consider that our bases are the same so we're going to use that technique for a few examples just illustrating this you probably have seen something like this before i'm going to show you some special situations where you need to know what to do with fractions you need to know what what to do with some quadratics that are going to come out of these these equations but that's basically we're just digging a little bit deeper so long story made hopefully shorter is that with exponentials in general you need their inverse you need logarithms but there's one situation where we can avoid all that if we can make an equation have all exponentials with common bases and we get one exponent exponential on one side and another on the other side of an equation and with the same base then we can set our exponents equal let's practice so how about 2 to the negative x equals 16 to go those are our common bases that's true but sometimes we can manipulate this so that we get common bases that's the only way we're going to get around not having to have logarithms to solve exponential equations so 2 to the negative x 2 is a prime number we can't get any lower than that a sub base if you want to but 16 is not prime so we're going to think can i write 16 as the same base raised to some power the same base being 2. so i know that 2 to the negative x that looks really good 16 we can write as 2 to the fourth power and we see right away that this is the case that we're talking about if you can get an equation with the common bases then if 2 to the negative x equals 2 to the fourth the only way this is possibly equal is if our exponents are also equal now if our bases are not equal then that goes off the table we can't use that and then we need logarithms to figure it out but if you're basically the same the only way this equation is true is if your exponents are also equal and so if you if you need to show this man i don't i have to show something i just i just gotta cross it out you can do that but it's not it's not real math it's just using this principle right here that says base is the same exponents also have to be the same and then we can solve something that's much much easier can you do some of this in your head yeah yeah but i'm going to really encourage you not to because it's fairly difficult to do something like this in your head and it's really difficult to do something like that in your head and so finding the common bases and setting your exponents equal is very useful for us so cool we got this we set them equal if we divide by negative one then we get x equals negative four and that's actually true two to the negative negative fourth power or opposite negative fourth power is to the fourth and that is 16. let's go ahead let's move over here so we have another exponential equation this is where we have one exponential expression equal to another that's what we're looking for here we notice that we have a base of two and a base of four the first idea the easiest idea for us so that we don't have to go down logarithms is let's check and see if we can get common bases now with a base of two being a prime number we can't go any lower than that but a base of four that's different than two we can so here's the way that i'd like you to do this number one when you are going to to take some sort of a base and write it as a different base i need you to use parentheses and i also really really need you to write this exponent exactly the same way the most of the mistakes here in this in these cases they're not signatures only a few times in sign errors are the major thing uh one of the major things about this is students start losing exponents and students forget to distribute when you have to start changing bases and those are two really really important concepts so the way that we solve that we fix it is rewrite your your base in parentheses but then also do not forget to write your exponents so i'm writing my exponent first so i don't forget it when we get too wrapped up in changing this we tend to forget that so write it first and then look at the 4 look at your base let's try to write this as 2 the base we want to some power i know that 4 is 2 squared so this says 2 to the 2x minus 1 that's what we have this says this right here says 4 to the 3x plus 1. we're just writing it as 2 squared and then we all know we all know that when we take an exponent to an exponent we multiply well what that means for us is that when we have two to the second raised to three x plus one we're going to have to think of this in parentheses we're gonna have to think of this as two that's our exponent not our base our exponent raised to another exponent you need to distribute that so sure we get this 2 to the 2x minus 1. that's totally fine we did nothing that would change the base we'd have to but on the right hand side we've got 2 to the 2 times essentially times three x plus one that is two to the six x plus two not six x plus one we must distribute that it's an exponent times an exponent and because this is our entire exponent distribution is necessary if you need to write this as an extra step that's fine that's taking an exponent times an exponent and then you can really see the distribution but once we've done that once we've taken and found common bases this principle takes over and says hey if your bases are the same in an equation then your exponents are also equal they have to be in order to make this equation true or make it equal that also says that if you have more than two exponentials you're gonna have to have some way to combine them and if you can't then we need another technique for that this only works if you have one exponential expression equal to one exponential expression and then you can set your exponents equal bar in that very very special case we need other techniques for that if our bases cannot possibly be the same then we need logarithms for that so once we have it we say all right now that our bases are the same we know the only way that's true is if our exponents are also the same and this gives us something really nice to solve we're going to subtract 2x and we're going to subtract 2. so subtracting 2x from both sides gives us 4x subtracting 2 from both sides gives us negative 1 minus 2 is negative 3 if we divide by 4. x equals negative three-fourths so that's about what we're doing here i'm going to start going into some special situations that we can get like with fractions what to do with those but that's essentially what we're doing we're finding common bases and setting our exponents equal when we get further on into this when we get to where what happens if this is a 2 and that's a 5 can you possibly get a common base no and we would not try any of this stuff we'd go directly to the inverse of an exponential remember i'm trying to build out in your head what that's going to be okay we haven't got there yet but i'm trying to build up that if these are not able to get common bases you're going to go directly to the inverse of an exponential which is a logarithm so right now this is a real special case if you can get these to be the same base cool do it it's really easy or easier than logarithms but if you can't you're going to need the inverse you're going to need logarithms for exponentials all right let's move on if you ever get fractions and you're trying to do this technique what we're going to do right away is we're going to get common bases but for every fraction that you have make sure that you write that as a negative exponent so save you so much time and a lot of headaches so fractions are going to equal negative exponents for these exponential expressions and exponential functions so let's take a look at we have 25 and we have something with a 125 and go man that's that's really lousy i don't like that that's nasty these are not the same let's try to look at these under this lens and say let's try to get some common bases out of it if i think about 25 and i think about 125 um try to write the bigger one as an exponent of the smaller one so here we were able to write 16 as 2 to some power that was 2. 4 as 2 to some power the bigger one is as a and exponent of the smaller can i write 125 as a power of 25 well no i could like 625 is 25 squared so so no what that also means is this little caveat here you don't always necessarily need to get down to the smallest prime number base sometimes you don't have to do that if this had been four then i wouldn't have to break both of them down to two if this had been four and not 2 then i could have said this is 4 to the negative x and 16 would be 4 squared and i would set those equal to one another you don't always necessarily have to get down to a prime number base to make this work just any common base will do in this case we go well i can't really write 125 as 25 to a power but i could write both 25 and 125 as 5 to some power so we're going to go through that we're going to say all right 25 to the x plus 3 i'm going to think i'm rewriting my base i'm going to number one first show that i have my same exponent i'm going to write that right there so i don't forget i don't lose it i'm taking my 25 and i'm thinking in my head let's find a common base between 125 and 25 and that would be a power 5. so i'm going to write this as 5 squared this means the same thing here's my same exponent here's 25 written is 5 squared we're good to go i'm going to do the same thing with 125 i'm going to think how how is 125 at power of 5 well it's 5 to the third power so we've just rewritten this with a common base that's the idea take a look at what your bases are this is the base think of fractions as something over the basis you want so 25 and 125 both have a base of 5 somehow 500 5 to the second power 5 to the third power and now with every negative exponent i'm sorry with every fraction that you get after you've written them as an exponent write them as a negative exponent so we can always on one fraction change a power to a negative exponent by moving it from a numerator to a denominator or from a denominator to a numerator so we can do that here too so instead of 1 over 5 to the third we can think of this as 5 to the negative 3rd power consider that this is the same thing five to the negative third power is one over five to the positive third power so again if you see fractions sure get a common base but then write them as a negative exponent it makes everything a lot nicer we see it right now after we take care of this side so 5 to the negative 3rd power that's good to go on the left hand side we have an exponent raised to another exponent if you want to write this out like it did over there an extra step that's fine you don't have to we can think about this as distribution this would be 2x plus 6 but we do absolutely need to distribute this is really what we're doing taking an exponent times another exponent and then that causes us to have to distribute so we're going to get this 5 to the 2x plus 6. equals five to the negative third power now we see why we use that negative exponent if we hadn't it's really awkward to understand what's going on here with the denominator so if we write that as 5 to the negative third power we see oh this is perfect is exactly what we want we've got 5 here we've got the same base and the only way this equation can possibly be true is if we have common bases we also have equal exponents so our 2x plus 6 equals negative 3 gives us something really nice to solve if we do solve that we're going to subtract six and dividing by two x equals negative two ninths no we don't negative nine halves you can put negative four in half if you really want to but it's fine to leave that as an improper fraction in fact um that would show you that this is going to be some sort of a radical expression anyhow with our our exponentials so i hope that makes sense to you um i really want to make sure that you understand that the concept of get your bases the same and if you don't have that you will need logarithms it's it's a must so here cool yeah we got 5 squared 5 to the third but that was a special case that had been 27 this won't work uh we could have done three to the to the third and five to the third but those would not be the same base and when we get down to here we get stuck so we need something else beside that all right we're going to work our way through three more examples a little bit tougher a little bit more more in this than we had in the first few examples so a little more complicated really but just remember our goals so our goal is whenever you see an exponential equation i'm trying to build these categories in your head if you can find common bases great set your exponents equal but we have a very stress case there you have to be able to get one exponential equal to another one with the same exact base and then set your exponents equal if you do not have that the second category is you're going to have to use logarithms somehow so in your head right now common bases great exponents equal and you have to have two exponentials one on one side one on the other that's it but if that's not the case logarithms we haven't made it there yet so let's take a look at it are we going to be able to write all three of these exponentials as one common base if that's true then we can start combining our exponentials and that's great that's not a problem we know that when common bases are multiplied you can add exponents and that's a really good thing if not then we're going to have to use logarithms somehow so we look at 9 and 27 and 3. 3x is your base here can i write all of those as one base take a look at your smallest base and see if you can write the larger ones as some sort of a power of that so i'm looking at 9 i'm looking at 27 i'm looking at 3 3 is the smallest one can i write 9 as the power of 3 yeah it's 3 squared can i write 27 is the power 3. yeah it's 3 to the third and so we're going to take a moment we're going to do that i'm going to start with my 3 i'm going to remember that 3 has a power of 1 so that's going to be important because that's a fraction we're going to be writing that as a negative exponent in just a moment i'm also before i do anything here going to write my exponent and my ex so i don't forget about it so i know that 9 to the 2x i have my 2x 27 of x squared i've got my x squared and this is 1 over 3 to the first i have my 3 to the first then i go inside i rewrite 9 and 27 as these powers of 3 9 is 3 squared and 27 is 3 to the third but because of the way we wrote this in parentheses and with our exponents already up there it shows us that we're going to have to multiply this so this represents 9 but to the 2x power we know that we would get 3 to the 4x power 2 times 2x is 4x 27 is 3 to the third and we're raising that to the x squared power but because we have an exponent raised to an exponent we're multiplying this is going to become 3 to the 3 times x squared whenever you get a fraction and you're going to use this technique of evaluating the or sorry solving these exponential equations with common bases make sure that you write any sort of fraction as having a negative exponent so this would be 3 to the negative 1 power that puts everything almost on the same level if you will where we have same base same base same base now this looks really good but but the only way this technique works is if you have one exponential equation equal to another however the great thing about using this common base technique is if you can get common base bases and all of your in all of your expressions here that are multiplied or divided you can combine them so 3 to the 4x power times 3 to the 3x squared power you can combine those remember this that if you ever had x squared times x to the fifth you can combine those and make it x to the seventh you can add exponents but this leads to a really really common mistake you can probably see it i've seen this so many times where students go oh this is fantastic i can combine these i see it very very often it is so common for us to see multiplication and really really want these two exponents to be multiplied but that's not what happens x to the second times x to the fifth gives us x to the seventh not x to the tenth we add two plus five three to the x 4x times 3 to the 3x squared we're going to get 3 to the x 3x squared plus 4x we need to add those exponents do not multiply this is completely wrong so common base is being multiplied we know that what we do with exponents is one level below what we see so if we see multiplication operationally we're going to be adding them if we see division we operationally subtract if we see exponents we operationally multiply so we've been doing here anyway we saw an exponent raised to an exponent that's an exponent level idea but one level below that is multiply so that's what we're doing here we're doing one level below what we're seeing one level below multiplication is you need to add those exponents it looks a little bit more awkward but this is exactly what we want we have an exponential equation we have the same exact bases and we have just two exponential expressions one on one side base three one on the other side base three that's great the only way these can possibly be equal is if our exponents are also equal so this is the place this is what we want to this is where we want to be essentially we want to be at the spot where we can say same bases exponents are also the same and now we get into something that sometimes we just forget what to do with if you ever have a power two or larger in an equation it's not a direct solving it's something where you need another technique and that's going to either be a square root method or factoring some sort of a formula like difference of squares something you're going to have to use in order to solve this if you have power ones like we had some of our earlier examples that's just fine we can solve them directly by subtracting a smaller variable adding or subtracting a constant and dividing but if you have a power 2 or higher try factoring so we're going to get everything on one side in order first turn positive and we're going to factor because we're really good at factoring we know that we can put a four and a three that's three times one one and three add to four multiply the three if i divide by my a and simplify one third doesn't simplify three or three simplifies to one over one that's one x plus one that's three x plus one and that actually works here's three x squared plus one plus three x that's four x and n plus one and if we set both of those equal to zero by the zero product property then x equals negative one and x equals negative one third we get our two solutions there so i hope that's making sense i hope you're seeing that the technique doesn't change i'll be just a little bit more involved here and if you have more than one exponential expression on one side you need to combine it you need to have just one equals one exponential expression in order to set your exponents equal sometimes that takes some exponent work just remember what you do with exponents is one level below what you see so if you see exponents raised to exponents you're not powering them if you will you're multiplying them if you see multiplication or division you should be adding or subtracting your exponentials if you see addition subtraction well wait a minute there's nothing below those so you don't do anything with your exponents which means y that's why you can't add or subtract your non-like terms let's say the same column all right let's move right along so we have this next one that's really nasty it's got a fraction it's got three different exponential expressions two are multiplied if you do have any that are added or subtracted so you might get to those we'll deal with those a little bit later those are typically a substitution idea so this is what this is what you get when you can combine in situation one exponential equal to another that's the only way that these common base solving by common bases work is if you can do that if not if you have more than that more than just one term this is still one term it just has two factors that you can combine if you have more than one term typically it's a substitution or some other technique so let's look at it we've got two terms but three exponential expressions we've got a base three we've got a base three notice to the seventh power but that is a base three just happens to be a denominator that's okay we deal with that and we get a base 27 so we're going to look at this and identify our smallest base is 3. i've got it a couple times that's really good can i write the larger base or bases as that smaller one can i write 27 as a power 3 sure so what if you could well you combine what you could and then you'd use logarithms for what you can't and anyhow if you don't have those common bases we have a 3 to the x squared and we don't need to simplify that times out whenever you get fractions and i could have given this different right i could have given this like the 125 and made you think about that's 5 to the third and then that would be 1 over 5 to the third so 5 to the negative 3rd power we just did that i couldn't give this to you as the number three to the seventh it's just a fairly large number and so i don't want to think about that so i could give that to you as a number just keep that in mind you'd have to change this to a base of three and then say hey this is one over three to the seventh but that's a fraction i like fractions can i write this as a base on the same level as the other bases to a negative exponent the answer is yeah we can do that that's appropriate that's what we want to do to get rid of those fractions they're very hard to deal with otherwise on the right hand side we are going to immediately write down that exponent we don't ever want to lose that but the 27 we're going to change so 27 needs to be written as 3. to the third power to still represent 27 but to also say i want the same base so i can use this technique if that didn't work if that was not a three there well then we'd have to combine these two and use logarithms and now we're going to simplify a little bit more we know that an exponent raised to an exponent we're going to one level below we're going to multiply those and that's 6x we also know this common base technique where we set exponents equal only work if we have one exponential on each side that looks good this doesn't so we have common bases that's great and this would not work if we didn't but if we have common bases we know that when we multiply these expressions with common bases we need to add our exponents multiplication that's the operation you see one level below that addition is what you do with the exponents and so we're going to keep our base the same that doesn't change that's how exponent rules work you keep the base the same all the math is done with your exponents if we add those x squared plus negative 7 is x squared minus 7 equals 3 to the 6 x this is what we want i'm going to say it one last time this is it but if these were not the same number you would have done exactly the same thing until you got down to here you went i wouldn't actually even have to do anything with this but you would have done this until you got here let's say that was like a four or something then logarithms would come in that would be the inverse and you'd have to do it that way here this is a special case we have the same bases that's great if you have the same bases and two two exponential expressions one on each side of your equation the only way that's true is if your exponents are also equal we see another power too that means that we're gonna have to use some technique uh beyond just solving for x directly we're gonna need to factor this so let's get everything on one side every time you see a power two or higher this is your your technique everything on one side and then check it out so by checking it out i mean how do we solve that can we factor it can we do quadratic formula is there another technique we have square root method different squares something like that so here we'd say yeah that factors looks like negative seven one that adds to negative 6 that multiplies to negative 7 because our a is 1 is a nice factorization for us and if we use the zero product property we get two solutions out of it we get x equals seven we get x equals negative one so i hope this makes sense i hope you're seeing the technique getting your fractions to be negative exponents combining your your like bases or your common bases appropriately and making sure we don't lose those exponents and keep in the back in mind that you know if if you're not able to get those common bases we have something else later that i'm going to teach you all right we get the last one and even though it has those ease in there this is actually a little bit easier and the reason is because there's no argument what kind of common base you're going to have it's given to you you have a base of e and you're not going to have to manipulate hardly any of it the only thing that we have is that 1 over e to the 1 over e squared to the second power we're going to change that that's a fraction we always want to take our bases that have that are within our fractions and make them a base to a negative exponent other than that this is pretty straightforward this is really nice we see right away that we're going to be able to use the common base technique so e to the x squared great e to the 3x no problem remember e is just a number it's like any other number it just happens to be written as e it's 2.7 well it's like any other number it's it's a transcendental but um and then it's not a fraction doesn't doesn't ever terminate but it is still a constant and so we can write this as e to the x squared e to the 3x and e to the negative 2. it's just a number they're just exponentials and now you have the same base and they're on the same level nothing in fractions that's really good the next thing we're going to do is understand that in order to use our technique we need one exponential equal to one exponential this is great this is not because we have common bases being multiplied we know that we can add our exponents together and create one exponential what that means when we're adding this is e to the three x times e to the negative two is the same thing as e to the three x plus negative two or three x minus two and that's what we're looking for we're looking for with this technique two exponentials same base and that means your exponents also have to be equal in order to satisfy this equation so when we solve this we're noticing the power 2 this is going to be another factoring equation so if we subtract 3x we add our 2 we can factor it nicely negative 2 and negative 1 add a negative 3 and they multiply to positive 2. so those are our factors so x squared minus three x plus two we set each of those equal to zero by zero product property we solve them straight down we get 2 and 1. you notice i haven't been doing this very often but i'm going to show you right now that you can actually check your work here it does work i haven't shown it to you that's kind of on you but you can't do it if i take 2 and evaluate it this would be e to the fourth equals e to the sixth times one over e squared remember that if i were to divide those i would subtract e to the sixth over e squared would be e to the fourth e to the fourth equals e to the fourth or i would have first power this would be e to the first e to the third and e to the one over e to the second e to the third over e to the second will give you e to the first they do work you can check them in these equations that's just fine the other thing i wanted to tell you was what if you were able to what if you're able to get all the way down here and then you set these exponents equal and you get something that's not factorable firstly try again because almost always these things are factorable but if they're not we already know that if you have a quadratic that's not factorable well then you can do the quadratic formula don't be afraid of that so this is really the technique i'm showing you is how to get down to right here and then say oh my exponents are equal done if this doesn't work i'm going to teach you logarithms in a while but this technique of setting exponentials equal this opens up the door for anything else to happen so what i mean is if you set your exponents equal and you can't you get everything on one side you can't factor it well you might have to do quadratic formula you might have to do man this would be just nasty but you might have to do something like uh rational zeros theorem if it's not factorable you power three or higher it's not factorable that's a potential i doubt you're ever going to see it but keep in mind that these are all factorable to keep it nice they don't have to be but the technique is if you have exponentials one way to solve them is to get two exponentials on on one on each side with the same base and set your exponents equal if that does not happen or you can't make it happen you need another technique typically you'll have more than one more than one term on each side you need a substitution and then eventually if you can't get common bases you will need logarithms that wraps up everything i really want you to know about solving these exponential equations with common bases as far as i really want to go next time what we're going to do is we're going to start talking about what a logarithm is we'll start taking that graph of an exponential we will find the inverse of it and then we'll say that's the graph of a logarithm and what logarithms do so we'll graph logarithms we'll talk about how to solve logarithms and we'll talk about how they're inverse of an exponential i hope you're hanging with me i hope you enjoyed the video i'll see you for another one soon
