Transcript for: Using Factoring to Solve Quadratics (Precalculus - College Algebra 18)
hey there welcome to another video in this video we're gonna continue solving quadratics and we're gonna find some x-intercepts or we're gonna focus on the technique called Factory now emo might be like I know factoring you might there's a lot of different ways to factor I've seen many many good techniques I'm gonna give you the best technique that I've ever seen so I'm gonna show you exactly how I factor how I go through the process hopefully you can open your mind a little bit and say wow that that's pretty cool because I guarantee a lot of you haven't seen unless you watch some of my videos from Interview algebra what to do that happens is I see a lot of students make it to a precalculus level and they either forgotten factoring or just okay I'm gonna teach that to you or their technique is miss apply and let you start using shortcuts probably know what I'm talking about and it'll do it wrong there go oh yeah that works I'm suited every time and a shortcut they learn doesn't work every time I promise you I'm going to teach you a shortcut that will work every single time for factoring so the idea again what we're getting into is we have these things called quadratics they all make parabolas we're going to be finding the x-intercepts the zeroes the roots and seen seen how to do that one good technique for it so what I want to talk about is that this is a second technique you try so we're going to talk about how the square root method is going to work for none of these I'll kind of preface the next section and say how would you make the square root method work and then we'll talk about factoring and and why that would be a great technique for these so let's listen to the very first one number one man that's a quadratic and if we want to find the x-intercepts for any quadratic ever or any function ever we set it equal to zero so we're gonna take this and say I'm gonna have x squared plus 7x plus 6 equal to 0 we're going to solve that and in solving that we're gonna find out where the height of our function equals 0 we're gonna find the x values that make the height f of X 0 that means we're going to find out where we cross or touch the x-axis if we do so one thing I want to mention real quick before we move on with factoring you're not going to get imaginary so this technique will not give that to you you may need quadratic formula or completing the square to do that so for factoring it's going to show you if you cross twice or bounce the vertex off the x-axis one time if you can actually factor that's what that's going to give you secondly we're going to kind of juxtapose this with with the square method so we're looking this go what does the square method work and if it does great use it if not why not so let's take a look the square root method worked if we could isolate a power to where I had all of our X's instead of a power to no X's anywhere else and a constant other side can we do that here can we get that power to by itself yes we could subtract 6 and subtract 7x would it contain all of our X's no what do we have just a constant on the side no and for that reason the scrutiny that is not going to work on problems like any of these is because we don't have that power to kind of contained or containing all of our X's that's a problem if we start subtracting 7x well then we don't have all of our X's inside power to is there a way we could make the square root method work the answer is yes we could make it work by doing something called completing the square giving this something that you could make that factorable so saying how would I make that work you would do something called completing the square completing the square is the way you change something that's not factorable into something you can do the square root method on that that's what completing the square does completing the square also gives us a way to create in the quadratic formula so the big scheme of things what we're doing is we're finding x-intercepts of quadratics that are all parabolas upward opening and downward opening the easiest way is square root method that's if we can I send power to that has all our exes it's they can we try to factor you go all right listen let's do that third is we make the sort of method work by doing something called completing the square and third is what have we completed the square all the time in general ah that gives us the quadratic formula which is a very nice all the time working so so we look at every meal can we do the the skirt method no that screws divorce can we factor here's what factoring does factoring takes a polynomial and it breaks it up and do things that are multiplied together these things called factors there's a variety of ways to do it I'm going to give you my way so I'm going to show you the math behind it and then I'm going to show you the shortcut with it I'm not going to really show you the shortcut with these two I'm going to show you the shortcut here and then backwards map it and say here's why the short could you understand why it works so well so let's take a look at it one thing that we can do is we need to make well one thing we have to make sure we do is when we have a polynomial in general or or a quadratic specifically that on the left hand side an order factor appropriately we have to have everything in order so like x squared then our X term that are constant we have to have a zero on one side so that this thing called the zero product property works we'll talk about that in a minute and third we want to make sure that our first term is positive because it makes our factory easier because it makes some of our techniques even possible so let's let's check that we said equal to zero to find X intercepts got it we have this on one side and zero side got it we have all this in order perfect and our first term is positive fantastic this is how I want instead of a factoring next I'm going to give you a technique a guy called the diamond method I don't know why it looks like an X but it's a way it's just a graphic organizer for us to kind of kind of picture some numbers and what they have to be so what I want to do is I'm going to look at our middle term or B term if we think of this as ax squared plus BX plus C are a would be one our B would be seven and our C with these six what I want to do is I want to take my beam number it's a coefficient it's just a number it's always sine specific so in this case would be positive seven not negative seven I want to put that up here I'm gonna look at my a times my see the a here would be one let's see would be six I want to multiply those two things now you probably understand that that's not super important here because one time six is just six and just see but for these later ones we've been very important so I'm gonna take one times six I'm going to put a times C that product there now here's what we need to happen over for factory to work we need to find two numbers we're gonna put them here and here that add to B and then multiply to a times C add this top number multiply the last number it's kind of on you in order to figure those out I'm maybe a couple hints I'm going to be hints like hey if you're multiplying to a positive number so we're going to add to this one we're going to multiply these that one if you're multiplying to a positive number your signs have to be the same either both positive or both negative if you're multiplying to a negative number you'd have to have different signs one negative one positive that's got to happen so here since we're multiplying to a positive number we know that our signs are going to be the same both positive or negative since we're adding to a positive number they both have to be positive so you can't add two negatives and get it positive you multiply two negatives get a positive but these are both have to be positive numbers that narrows down our search the forest pretty well and so what we're gonna think of is what numbers multiply to 6 that will literally add to 7 on tell you this also if your signs are the same you are literally adding to that number if your signs are different this will be the difference between these two numbers we'll see that in just a minute so I'm thinking about this going alright I got 7 I got 6 that's 1 times 6 make sure you do that I'm thinking I have to have both same signs as I'm multiplying go positive both have to be positive because I'm adding to a positive something in what numbers multiply to 6 2 & 3 1 & 6 what pair of that actually adds a 7 1 & 6 it does not matter what order you put what matters they get them right double check it for you any further because if if these are wrong you're wasting your time so does one plus six add the 7 yeah this is multiplied to 6 yeah I guarantee if you can find those numbers this will be factorable and I guarantee you can't find those numbers either the problem is two too complicated probably not the case or it's not factored well we need a different technique so does factoring work all the time no is it really cool one doesn't work yeah and it can be very very fast so we found these numbers and here's what they do what this does for you it doesn't do the math for you you don't have you haven't organizers or help you think of these numbers what those numbers do notice how they add up to that number what they're going to do is they're gonna allow you to split that middle term from one term into two terms why would we want to do that well because we know something called factoring by grouping if you don't know that you need to check out factor by grouping it's an intermediate algebra and this is all review for us but I'm gonna show you great techniques because people tend to miss them what what that does what this idea since this adds to the middle term since this adds in 7x that means I can take the 7x instead of 7x I can write it as 1 X plus 6x well that's still 7x but it takes let's see three terms into four terms so that I can group them together so these numbers say instead of 7x writing with these two numbers writing as 1x plus eight X is 6x and notice that's still 7x but it's changed these three terms into four terms so that now I can group the first pair and group the second hair and it will factor so roofing we're saying disappear if you're unfamiliar with grouping if it's if it's been a while grouping takes a look at your first two terms and then says factor out a common factor greatest common factor which in this case is X and if we do that we would get X plus one it says look at your second two terms but before you factor anything goodness sakes drop down that plus sign or the minus I that's a minus and now factor your GCF or greatest common factor from your second two terms so 6x plus 6y gamma factor out six cool one thing that bears mentioning right now you're factoring like this using the diamond method or whatever X method what do you want to call it whatever method you use it's predicated on the fact that you would have done a few things now it bears repeating so please get it that you set your function equal to zero you have all of your stuff on one side but it's in order and your first term is positive and you have factored a greatest common factor from the beginning if you have this so really what I should have said is when you've done this and when you've done this look here in factor out a GCF that there is one now there wasn't one there these didn't have a common factor at all we're gonna see that this one does so I'm gonna tell you that when we get there but I want to make sure you get it now so we've set this equal to zero to find x-intercepts we have it organized on one side in order first for positive so that we can factor we've tried the square root method it didn't work we've looked at factor GCF there wasn't one then we say can we do this can we factor this trinomial by like an X method or dinah method yep we put our middle number our eight times syrupy our a times C we find out two numbers add to the middle one Y so that we can split Y so that if we have four terms we can factor by grouping so we've grouped the first two group the second two and if you found these two numbers I guarantee that this is gonna be the same you have now you have now created a GCF a greatest common factor of X plus one that's something that we can factor so when we factor this X plus one it creates this other factor for so when we factor Isis normally when we remove it by division just like we did here we said hey these both have an X put it out front these both have a six put it out front create some sort of a factor because these both have X plus one we're putting that out front we're creating some sort of second factor that only has X plus six in it so we factor by grouping X plus one whatever's left over goes in the second set of parenthesis another factor X plus six and we still have it equal to zero now some of you right now are thinking you just wasted a lot of time because can't you just do X plus 1 and X plus six and the answer is sometimes you can do that if your a is one you can do that if your a is one now I'm gonna ask this question why does that shortcut work and most of the people out there go no it just does my teacher told me that your teachers right if you're a is one if you're a is one this technique is fantastic you find a couple numbers and you go oh yeah all right I could just do X plus this number and X plus this number or if they're my negatives do X minus a number whatever the science is saying what you have and you go these create factors for you my question is why do they do that why part of it has to do with the grouping I mean I showed you this this is the math behind if it says set equals zero come with these so that you split your middle term do you affected by grouping and it works great question is why does it always work great what is the shortcut from here to here is it just taking these factors if that's a shortcut then it should work all the time does it work all the time no because if your a is not one you cannot do this right from there it's not possible I'll show you a way to this possible okay let's get won't get to that in just a minute from here you're not quite done you have something called the zero product property or you know you know what if we have two factors that equals zero two factors are multiplied together equals zero the only way that that can actually work is it one or the other the factors equals zero itself because zero times anything else gives you the zero so X would equal negative 1 and X equal negative 6 and then we answer that's not a negative 6 maybe answer the question what are those because sometimes we get wrapped up in the technique and we forget what what are those those are x-intercepts so we knew this was a parabola we didn't find the x-intercepts and I told you the very beginning that factoring will always give you real solutions if it's factorable so these are two real solutions and this is where this upward-opening parabola will cross the x axis twice that's extremely important to know that's what we're doing here so it's just another technique it is like the screwed method and then it gives you X intercepts it's just a different way to go around it so we said equals 0 we say script method don't work we say Miami try GCF we're factoring it didn't work but in order one side first are positive we factor with our technique can't use a shortcut yes sometimes you're kind of fleshing that out right now we'll talk about why that shortcut works in just a minute I might hold you in suspense for the first time like ever because I can't explain it yet but I will explain it and then we're finding x-intercepts and determining that this is where the parabola crosses the x axis let's move on let's talk with the next one so what in the world you do to find x-intercepts that's that's what we're doing here in all these videos well we said that equal to 0 so we have a 3x X minus 4 minus 36 equals 0 all right I know it's kind of nasty how the real can I solve that let's see the first thing we would try is we would try the square root method do we have something raised to the second power that contains all of our X's no we don't we don't even have a second power of there right now so when that happens the screw method is off the table for now there's ways we can get back to it called completing the square but right now this is not a good candidate what we do have to do is if the screwed methods not a good candidate then we have to distribute we don't want to distribute if the square root methods can work but it's not going to work we have to so we look at it we go finding X intercepts all that's zero we look at we go okay screwed method I don't see anything that contains all over it all of our exes race for second power that means we have to distribute barring some special technique like there's some sort of substitutions that we can do that avoid that but this isn't one of them there's nothing that's the same and in two spots that we can set it to so we distribute and we make sure we have this in the proper order for factoring so we've tried spirt method but then we go that doesn't work the next thing we try is factoring so let's look at it is this all on one side yeah is it in order x squared then X's then constants yeah it's the first term positive yeah this looks perfect for factories so we've helped we set this up this is really good now we try our factory so when we when we set up the factory and we everything on one side in order first term positive the first thing that we're in trying to do is factor out some sort of the greatest common factor if there is one now there wasn't here but there is here and this is gonna save you tremendous amount of time a lot of students avoid this of a way to factor the GCF and then that factor gets horrible I think oh man that's really big or they plug numbers in the quadratic formula there are an enormous and they don't have to do that so when we factor always try to when do getting these techniques always tried for a greatest common factor first you're looking at okay is there anything that divides 3 12 and 36 good yeah actually 3 let's factor out the 3 that's a greatest common factor sometimes you might even see it like 3x cubed minus 12x minus squared minus 36 X and you can factor out a 3x the X would give you a factor of 0 you'd say oh so you have one x intercept of 0 and then you factor the rest of it so you can see that we're not going to deal with it here because we're strictly dealing with quadratics but that is possibly always check for a greatest common factor first sometimes you get additional solutions there so we look at it now what's the 3u that 3 does absolutely nothing as far as your x-intercepts it does not have a factor that contains a variable and therefore this will not be set equal to 0 three doesn't equal zero 3x that's a different story so if we had a factor out here that you'd factor out a GCF from all of your terms ahead X then yeah we'd have a zero of x equals zero but we don't so where we find our next intercepts are just and dealing with these these expressions that have variables in them so like the x squared minus 4x minus 12 that's what we're looking at now we don't even really care about the 3 we're not going to lose it but we're sort of going to ignore it this part as far as our factoring or using zero product property so let's go through and let's go ahead let's identify our a and our B in our seat so our a here is yeah we don't we're not worried about 3 worried just about right here our 8 is 1 our B is negative 4 and our C is negative 12 so let's put negative 4 here 1 times negative 12 is negative 12 that's a big deal I don't want you just to put the C I want you to put the a times the C one times negative 12 and now we're gonna think about two numbers that add to negative 4 and multiply the native 12 sometimes or some people these come really easily and they just get it because they're good at their factor tables sometimes it's not that easy for people and so I'm going to give you some good ways to go through it like it did before if you're multiplying to a negative your signs have to be opposite one will be negative one will be positive make the first one negative and the second one positive not because the order matters but because when you get to the grouping it's easier to have a plus here and not a minus because you want to change signs so if it's not possible then yea if you have two two negatives that's not possible but if you have different signs put the minus first it'll be a little bit nicer for you so I know that I'm multiplying two negative that means my signs are different I know that I'm adding to a negative that means that that's the difference between the two numbers so if they add to negative four that means my sons are opposite and my Center obviously that means they'll have a difference of four units in there so I go right well what what numbers multiply to negative twelve well there's 12 and one there's there's two and six there three and four that someone's I can think of there are whole numbers which one of those have a difference of four well six and to do which one will be the negative one because I'm adding to the negative four I need the bigger of those two numbers and I was in value to be the negative so I can't have this as negative 2 & 6 that add to positive 4 I'm gonna have that as a negative 6 & 2 that multiplies native 12 that adds a negative 4 I'd double check my work I know that this is right that's the only time that you go on from here so you make sure that that works now will this really shortcut work yes it will it will work this is going to end up being X minus 6 and X plus 2 we know that because our a is 1 and that's going to work what I'd like you to understand is the grouping as well so what this does practically it says because these add to your negative 4 because they add to your middle term I can take x squared instead of minus 4x I put minus 6 X plus 2 X minus 12 equals 0 notice I haven't forgotten about the 3 it's still there it's not going to affect our solutions at all it's not going to affect this Factory at all but it is still going to be there we don't want to lose track of that so I've looked at I said okay this is Factory I've come up with two numbers that are allowing me to split up my middle term and they use 6 and positive 2 X so negative 6 and positive 2 X those would combine to give you a 4x so it's the same thing but it's taken three terms in the four terms so that we can group them together that's what we are doing why I told you to put the negative first was because when you group things you always have to drop down this middle sign and if this is a negative you start changing signs you have to divide up negatives it's gonna change your signs and if I can avoid sign errors for you I do so I'm gonna put my positive last so that I don't have to change signs and dividing out my GCF for my first two terms that's just next we get X minus 6 I have to bring down my plus see how that's a minus it's R divided by negative that's that's not so that's not great to do for sign errors we have to - this says you're factoring positive to my sons are not going to change and now that I've done that I've created a GCF I've created this common factor X minus 6 that we can factor out so when I remove it by division I have an X plus 2 and I drop down that free I do not distribute the 3 don't worry about it it's not going to affect these factors at all so it's still there that was our GCF of the beginning what are solutions well our solutions say set every factor listen carefully set every factor that has a variable equal to 0 3 doesn't have a variable it's as coefficient for us right now this has a variable so X minus 6 equals 0 and this has a variable X plus 2 equals 0 that means x equals 6 and x equals negative 2 could you go directly from here two factors yes and we'll show you why in about five minutes ten minutes secondly some people will tell you this and it's true can you find your solutions Oh your x-intercepts just by looking at these and changing your signs yes you can yep so your solutions here are negative 1 and negative 6 or shows it's here positive 6 and native to that actually does work if you don't have to show you work and you're just doing this to find your x intercepts or to find out that's basically you can just change your signs and it will work because of the the way that we the way that we set the zero product property equal to zero and our science changed so that doesn't work you can go here and go yep the solutions are positive six negative two and you have them right there that's something that you can't do good I need to do it I don't know it kind of depends on what you're doing but it is possible well that's making sense you I hope you understand the idea that we're still setting equal to zero it's just another technique once where every method doesn't work does factor and always work no that's why we have two other techniques coming one that works all the time and then we use it to create the quadratic formula all right let's move on we're good time right he's feeling great is it a quadratic yeah Howard you said that is the parabola think about whether it's upward opening downward this happens to be upward opening and now we're going to think let's find x-intercepts so when we do that we're gonna set this equal to zero but we're going to be smart about it we're going to say because this is out of order when I set this equal to zero I'm going to put it in order so that our exponents are descending in power so the x squared term should come first then our X term that our constant term and then 0 on the other side is it all on one side how looks really good is it in order yes it's a border is my first term positive fantastic it is this is the set up for all of our solving techniques can you do it differently yes but this is the easiest way to go then we start going through it can you do the square root method here can you isolate a power to take a square root no because that X messes it up I don't have everything all of our X term inside something being raised to the second power so No can I do factoring yup it's set up for that let's try it one thing we try is we would try to do it greatest common factor first can i factor out a number and/or variable from all three of these terms no not even close there's nothing divides Alden so it's not like this problem we had that this fails that so let's try to go ahead and let's factor just like we did let's set up some sort of a technique I call the diet method to help us factor this if our a is 3 and our B is 5 and our C is 2 then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put my be up here I'm gonna put my a times my seat not freaking to our doing 3 times 2 we're doing 6 we're giving a 6 here and then we're going to find two numbers that add to 5 and multiply to 6 now now look we're multiplying to a positive number if we're multiplying to a positive number of signs have to be the same if we're adding to a positive number they have to both be positive think of some numbers that multiply to 6 that actually add to 5 not have a difference of 5 actually add to 5 so same sign you're adding to the top number different signs this will be the difference between the two numbers okay let's see I have three two five six and one that's one things I think of six and one do those add to five no they don't that a 7 3 and 2 those identified yes and because we have the same sign that works it does not matter the order 3 & 2 okay alright so you're done right because because we just go yeah it's easy X plus 3 and X plus 2 and moving on let's go to the next does that work this it work that shortcut that cell is really trying to do it doesn't because if you distribute this you get x squared you get 3x squared if we go directly to here and go our answer there negative 3 and negative 2 because I just changed signs we get it completely wrong this shortcut that we know works here and here doesn't work here and that's problem with shortcuts if we have a shortcut that works some of the time it's not a good shortcut a shortcut should work all of the time I'm gonna teach you this in exactly three minutes so what do we do what do you do if it's troga doesn't work remember one thing you can do go back to something that does work go back to this idea that what these numbers do is they head to five these numbers can split up this middle term these numbers can do 3x squared plus 3x plus 2x plus 2 equals 0 yeah they let you do grouping you can totally do that group the first to 3x we factor out of this if X plus 1 bring down your middle term our middle side to positive 2 would factor out of this via X plus 1 you've created a greatest common factor of X plus 1 factor it that's X plus 1 that's 3x plus 2 equals 0 because we have two factors and both of them have variables we would set X plus 1 equals 0 we would set 3x plus 2 equals 0 and we would have solutions negative one maybe two thirds you think in your head hey those are real numbers this is a parabola it's upward opening this is exactly where this problem will cross two times the x axis these are X intercepts now you heard me say something that was true you should be able to just change these signs and get solutions can you change these signs and get these solutions no what that means is that the short can listen because I know that some of you were taught differently the shortcut you use to get from here to your factors and here to your factors is incomplete here's the complete shortcut hope that it's exactly three minutes because that would be awesome maybe just possibly some time to make sure it's the same three minutes I'm not gonna do that okay so so here's the the real complete shortcut and where it comes from that I know that some of you have never seen unless you watch some my videos here's that works coming right back to here coming right back to here if you find these don't do everything the same get everything on one side in order first term positive put down your be put down your a times your C and finding numbers an add to this one and multiply to this one and then do one additional step look at your a divide these numbers by your a your 8 here is free so take those numbers divide by 3 and simplify what you get this would be positive 1 over 1 leave them as a fraction this is already simplified positive 3 over 2 if you do that I promise you two things number one you can read your factors directly from here and they will always be correct number two you can change your signs of these numbers and they will always be your solutions that's a complete shortcut people so let's look at it how do you read your factors if you need a factor if you don't if you're not just looking for solutions but you're looking for factors look at your denominator your denominator will tell you how many X's factors should contain and your numerator will tell you the constant to add or subtract to a from it so looking at the denominator this says you should have one X in a factor and then add one here's one X and then you add once you can amass chills right now what this should say another factor should have three X's and then you add to three X's and then you add to that is how a shortcut works now what's your solutions one over ones one positive one change the sign that's a solution two-thirds change the sign negative two-thirds that's a solution now why did I say this this shortcut why does it work let's incomplete the reason why a lot of people don't understand why this shortcut doesn't work here is because they do not acknowledge that your a is one if your a is one and you divide by one just like I did here but with I divided by 3 divide these by one why because your a is one look how this doesn't change your X that's why this shortcut actually works if I divide by one it's not changing what you're adding to or subtracting from your your X's it's same okay if I divide by a is one you always have one X it's not changing these numbers you'll always add or subtract that exact same number you won't have the simplified link we just did that's why people lose the fact that these tighten these shortcuts are the same they just never make it that far so this says you should have one X and then factor in add one we actually have that it was X plus one this shows you you have one X and then add six yes one X and then add 6 to the equals zero you should be able to change your signs positive one movie negative one positive six to be negative six that's where this shortcut actually comes from well so why I did it it that's that's where that would come from so it's it's this idea but people lose the fact that this a is one and that's why you're able to go directly from these fat from these numbers to your vectors that's why so if you're gonna do it and you reduce just want your solutions man just divided by your a just simplify and ginger signs that's the easiest way to go about doing I hope that makes sense to you it's it's a really cool shortcut that does work all the time I'm going to show you just the shortcut down I'll show you both I'll show you the factory and the shortcut because we'll have a negative in there I'll show you how that works all right let's get after it so we all know what we're doing we have a quadratic we know it's a parabola let's think about it though that should be a downward-opening parabola in your head we're still finding x-intercepts there the same way we're going to take this we're going to set this equal to zero we're going to make sure everything is on one side it is we're going to make sure it's in order it is x squared then X and then a constant but we're going to make sure that the first term is positive maybe before that you check the square root method so we'll sort method work do you have everything your X is instead of a power - now you don't that messes up but we do want our first term positive there's a couple ways to think about doing this mostly we just think about it we just do it one way is you could add 2x squared + 5 X and subtract 12 to both sides you could divide out a negative or you could factor negative and then multiply by negative 1 divided by negative 1 any of those ways essentially are just going to change every sign up now listen please listen it is not a problem to change your signs when you're solving for x intercepts but keep in mind you're not changing the side of your original function it still needs to be a downward-opening parabola the idea is that if I change the signs of a downward-opening parabola yes it would make it upward opening it would be a reflection but if you reflect something on the x axis about the x axis it doesn't change if my sign on the x axis is an on sign it's 0 and I change signs it's not changing because it's even had a sign so when we when we change when we change our signs to positive 2x squared plus 5x or minus 12 equals zero by either what I said before adding these two terms respecting this 1 or divide anything by negative or factor negative one multiplying or dividing negative one that's not gonna change the parabola and that's also not going to change our x-intercepts they will still show up exactly the same because in reflecting x-intercepts you don't change anything about them they reflect about the x axis but there are we on the x axis they can't change now let's go through the process of solving for x so we're gonna we're gonna try factoring we're gonna look at our middle we know that a is 2 B is 5 and C is negative 12 so I know that 5 goes here not negative 12 but negative 24 is what we could put down there we're going to add to 5 we're going to multiply to negative 24 so I'm thinking if I'm multiplying to a negative my signs have to be different I'm doing this on purpose and putting these out of what the order I said so that you can see what happens when you do that so I'm I'm putting this this minus second I should have the - first I'm thinking okay if I'm adding a 5 and have different signs then the bigger number is positive smaller number is negative and there's a difference of 5 units between them something into I see 24 is 24 1 12 and 2 no 8 and 3 yeah that has a difference of 5 so different sign difference of 5 difference of that B so I'm thinking this needs to be 8 and negative 3 that adds to 5 cool that multiplies negative 24 also let's say I wanted to be really quick about this how I would do it and I'm just looking for my excellent yes I would take my a whatever I'm working with this to negative 2 what I'm working with right now take that 2 and divide simplify the fractions that you can so positive 4 over 1 8 over 2 and 4 1 of the same thing I leave it as a fraction negative 3 halves you can't simplify that anymore I'm done if I wanted to find that X intercepts one x-intercept let's see this is 4 negative or another next intercept that's negative 3 halves so he has done I guarantee you that is where this parabola that's downward-opening crossing the x-axis at those two exact values that is the quickest way that I know use factoring to find x-intercepts and now I gave it to you what if you needed the factors themselves two ways to do it one way is you can read your fraction that says you would have your denominator we tell you how many X isn't a factor so that'd be 1x your numerator tells you what you add or subtract to or from it your denominator tells you how many X's your numerator tells you what to add or subtract or from it can you see by using the zero-product property I'd have X plus 4 equals 0 I'd have 2x minus 3 equals 0 and we would get those exact solutions I need to pause for just half a second now and tell you there's there's a slightly different way to consider this factor some people prefer to do this X minus 3 has as a factor it's the same so X minus three halves and 2x minus 3 are giving you the same factor I need you to be comfortable with both of those so X minus 4 great our side X plus 4 great or X minus three halves and X 2x minus 3 or the same factor here here's why they're the same if I look at 2x minus 3 and I solve for X and I wanted to create a factor couldn't you subtract 3 halves from both sides and get let's see I added 3 divided by 2 couldn't you just subtract 3 halves Linda this is when to factor equals 0 by the opposite of the zero product property tell you a factor to be X minus 3 house it's it's the same exact thing in fact if we just divide divide this both by 2 so divide everything by 2 here here and here you would get X minus 3 halves so that's a different way to write that factor in just wanted you be aware of it okay the last way is to use the grouping yeah it's a little slower but it does work all the time so we'd have this X 2x squared plus 8x we'd use our original numbers minus 3x minus 12 equals 0 we look at the first two in factor out a 2x that's our greatest common factor for those two terms X plus 4 be careful if you have a minus second if you have a minus there you have to drop that down when you factor out your GCF of 3 it says no no no no you have to factor out negative 3 what that does it changes this sign to a positive X and it changes this time whatever it is it will flip your sign that's a plus 4 sometimes we get sign errors because we we drop the mines but we forget about that we should abide by 3 instead of negative 3 your signs got to change if that term as - now we get X plus 4 and 2x minus 3 to 0 and we get exactly the same thing man I'm hoping you appreciate the technique I just gave you if you know before cool if not do you see how powerful it is do you see that with very minimal work you get your X intercepts super fast if you want to try that actually we go back and try that one try all these with with that other ones were working on now these are some special cases I just want to talk and talk over with you so first one negative 12x plus 9 plus 4x squared we're gonna do it fairly quickly I'm not going to show you the grouping any longer that's a lot of iterative group you know I can't you can't I can't not do that gonna be complete here so I'm gonna show you how to how to solve this and just a special case that we get so so far we have we have two real x-intercepts and every single one of these cases even here these are two real x-intercept there's no eyes they're different numbers so we know we're crossing the x-axis twice with that downward-opening parabola let's do the same thing so we have this function it's a it's definitely quadratic we know it's a parabola in fact it's upward-opening because the term in front of my x squared well that that sign is plus plus so it's a positive x square that's upward opening in order to find x-intercepts we would set this equal to zero but we're doing it in such a way that we're putting this in order first so positive 4x squared minus 12x plus 9 equals zero I'm thinking about the square root method I'm looking at going can I do the square root method I know because I don't have all my X's contained in the power - that doesn't work next thing we do is can we factor well we're certainly gonna try and because this is on one side in order in her first term is already positive that's great we're gonna try to factor in GCF can i factor GCF no no there's nothing that divides for 12 and 9 and x squared X and not having next there's nothing that's in common with all three of those terms so we're gonna try to do our diamond method I know that we're going to do negative 12 and 36 not 9 4 times 9 is 36 and now we're thinking wait okay hang on a second negative 12 positive 36 if you are multiplying to a positive number your signs will be the same but if you're adding to a negative that means they both have to be negative this is the only time where you can't avoid having a minus second in grouping here you could have think you would have wrote them written them different here here you can't avoid that so if we do factor by grouping and two negatives you're going to be changing sides apart now this thing what two numbers add to the negative 12 and multiply to positive 36 well they have the same sign so what's your number and they're actually adding a 12 so what multiplies 36 36 and 1 that's an add 12 to an 18 that one was a 2012 and 36 12 and 13 oh that's added 12 6 and 6 yeah 6 & 6 works 94 doesn't work 6 & 6 negative 6 and negative 6 added to negative 12 and multiply to positive 36 now if you were listening anything about what I said if you divide by your a and you simplifies and you change their sign you're done you have just found x-intercepts guaranteed our x-intercepts are gonna be positive three-halves and positive three-halves what wait a minute how long the world do you the same answer twice oh you got to see that physical what's that mean you need to know what that means this is a parabola right it's upward opening right we're finding x-intercepts right what does it mean make the same answer twice this is exactly what we're talking about before and unlike that one of the first first video on quadratics we had two videos ago what does that mean to you does this cross twice does this balance once does this completely miss it can't completely miss because there's no imaginary numbers factoring can't give those to you it doesn't cross because we have the same number twice this is called a double root so do we get two solutions yes are they the same yes so really how many do you get you get one you just get it twice this is where the vertex will be this right here is a parabola that touches our x axis opening upward but just touches your x axis right at x equals one and a half so if you went over to one and a half that's where that parabola is going to be that's got to make sense now can you can you do a little bit more work if you refuse to more work yeah sure you could you could write this as 2x minus 3 because we have a denominator minus numerator 2x is minus 3 another 2x minus 3 equals zero oh look hang on a second wait a second wait wouldn't you do 2x minus 3 squared equals zero yeah checking I'm gonna wrap the whole unwrap all the videos for us right now that we had on quadratics could you do that yep with the skirt method work yep could you take a square root on both sides of the plus and minus yep when plus and minus the square root of zero still give you just zero yes you do the same answer twice do you see the square root method at work you have to add three and divide by two you the same exact thing do you see going back to this do you see that if we wrote it slightly different instead of having two X minus three squared could you have X minus three halves like we talked about here could we have that all squared yes just divide both of them by two or look here do X minus three halves same thing do you see how this is check it out so yeah this is a problem this is shifted right three house whoa about we'd have an x intercept of three handsets the graph I just gave you this is a parabola shifted right three halves this needs to be coming together in your head that we have parabolas the shifting the x-intercepts these vertex they're all they all should be trying to do the same thing get a better picture your graph could you do it as a little bit different could you say alright well you know what I really like the grouping or I forgot my shortcuts or I just really like extra work and so I'm gonna take this and do 4x squared minus 6x you know you undo all this is minus 6x minus 6x plus 9 equals 0 yeah we've got factor by grouping that's a 2x I get 2x minus 3 bring down your - factor out a 3 and you get positive 2x minus 3 because your sign change you divided by a negative here equals 0 well that's 2x minus 3 and another 2x minus 3 and we're back to the same thing we just had 2x minus 3 squared equals 0 there's a few ways to write it you could of course do X minus 3 halves that is appropriate and fine most people like this a little bit better but it does tell you're going to get the same solution twice or you say well how many factors do I have like one but it's repeated so we said 2x minus 3 equal to 0 we add 3 we divide by 2 and you get your three-halves now how many ways that you can get for 4 different ways or something I hope at least one of them makes sense but I hope more than that I hope that what I'm teaching you is that these techniques are everything in parabolas is not like just different little segments I want them to come together to make one cohesive idea about parabolas what their x-intercepts are that the shifting and the graphing and the vertex and and the x-intercepts they're they all work together and I hope that you're now seeing that with some of these techniques that can appear to be completely unrelated than I'm making them relate for you so that's my goal that's man that's about it as far as solving these these quadratics I want to talk just a little blurb about this one and then we're going to be done so this last one this is x squared minus 5 is a parabola of course in fact it's a parabola that shifted down 5 units so it's not moving the left or right just shift it down 5 units that means it's X and I'm excuse me its vertex is going to have an x value of 0 that's what's gonna happen to shape it down with ideas how to solve that for X intercepts yes you still set this equal to 0 you'd have an onion work it is on one side great first positive you got it with the screwed method work absolutely the skirt method would work if we add 5 to both sides and take a square root with a plus and minus but I don't want to talk about the factoring you see a lot of students will say this is factorable x squared minus 25 respectable and you'd say yeah that's X minus 5 and X plus 5 equals 0 and you're done yeah that's that's easy but then when we talk about x squared minus 5 they say all of it that's and that's not fat burning' longer yeah it is and this is sort of a problem in the way that we teach is that students get here and they go this is no longer factorable because that's not a perfect square it's not a perfect square over-over whole numbers over integers but it is a perfect square over square roots and so here's what I need you know I need to know that this is still a difference of squares it's just kind of weird so when you have this house it has a a typical difference of squares actually work well a typical difference of squares actually works because you'd be safe x squared minus something else squared and there's something else that you get is just the square root of that number you go with that that's going to be five it's just a square root of that number now what about x squared minus five could we write this as x squared minus something saleable yes it's just the square root of that number what I want you to get out of this is that you can factor anything any quadratic as you say any quadratic that's x squared or some things squared minus a number so square minus number you can factor that just take the square root let's say it's gonna be X minus the square root of five and thanks plus a squared vitamin much like this would be X minus the square root of 25 and X plus L square root of 25 the same thing happens here if you set this equal to zero then X minus the square root of 5 is 0 and X plus the square root of 5 is 0 and X would equal square root of 5 and X to equal negative square root of 5 the exact same thing we did is we added 5 and took a square root with the plus or minus it works I just need you to be prepared for that because when we get down to polynomials in general and we factor it and you're left with Linear's and irreducible quadratics this is not irreducible this has to be factored still as x squared minus and plus some sort of number just take the square root of that it's factorable I'm gonna leave it for there for right now we'll revisit that when we talk about polynomials I hope that makes sense I hope that you're you feeling pretty good about factoring right now I hope that that new technique kind of stuck with you it's the fastest way I know how to factor and it works really well for me so I hope it works well for you too next time we'll talk about completing the square and we'll talk about why it works I'll give you the easiest way to do completing the square I promise easy way ever seen so we'll rely on our knowledge of factory to do that and I'll see you the next video you
