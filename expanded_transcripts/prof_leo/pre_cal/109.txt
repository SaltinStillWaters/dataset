Transcript for: How to Convert From Polar Coordinates to Rectangular Coordinates (Precalculus - Trigonometry 37)
hey there welcome to another video in this video i'm going to show you how to convert from polar to rectangular coordinates and the next video from rectangular to polar converting from polar to rectangular is a little bit easier a little bit nicer we'll see that right now but let's talk about exactly how in the world we do this hopefully you remember how to even graph these polar coordinates so that what a polar coordinate really does it gives you r comma theta it gives you a distance from something that we call the pole along an angle with a polar axis that this this this point creates a polar axis along some sort of array and so all of our polar coordinates are r comma theta now that's great but sometimes we actually do like to see rectangular coordinates i mean we're really used to it rectangular coordinates are x comma y so is there a way to get from here to here yeah i'm doing a video on it there's going to be a way to do it so how do we do that if we understand what this actually means that r comma theta is a distance from the pole along some sort of angle that we create with what acts as an x-axis like a polar axis then we can create a triangle so if this this is our theta from a polar coordinate and this is our r distance from the pole then what if we draw a perpendicular right down to that polar axis then if we superimpose this on an x y coordinate system this distance at that point would just be y and this distance to where that point would fall on that x-axis would just be x now i hope that you see the beauty in this because our right triangle trigonometry is going to make it very easy to convert from polar coordinates into rectangular so we thought polar just means r comma theta distance from the pole along some sort of an angle let the angle be superimposed on an x y coordinate system that point will have a certain vertical distance it's y that point will have a certain horizontal distance that's x let's use our trigonometry what in the world would we know well we know sine cosine tangent so what sine would do sine would take sine of whatever angle we have equals opposite over hypotenuse or sine of theta equals y over r cosine of theta is always the adjacent over the hypotenuse or x over r and tangent of theta just from our right triangle trigonometry is opposite over json or y over x man we've seen this for a really long time now think about what's going on here we want to somehow take what we know about r and theta take what we know here and what we know here and solve for x and y but wait a minute do you see y and x can be solved for right here if we just multiply this equation and this equation by r on both sides we're going to end up with y equals r sine theta and x equals r cosine theta this is all you need in order to convert from polar coordinates into rectangular coordinates this is it all you got to do is find your wine your eggs put them in the correct order of course x comma y but but look at what you're given if you're given a polar coordinate well then you have r and you have theta so you would have r here and you would have your angle here all we've got to do is take r times sine of the angle they give you bar times cosine of angle they give you and that will solve for y coordinate and x coordinate respectively that's all there is to it use these and only these to convert from polar to rectangular they give you everything you need here to plug in here and find this that's great we're going to practice that so what does tangent do tangent is one half of the way you convert from rectangular back to polar so if tangent theta equals y over x then the angle so notice you'll be given y and x in a rectangular coordinate until you like negative two comma three or something you'd be given this you want to find the angle how would you do that take tangent inverse this is how you'd find the angle if you're given rectangular right here y and x you can put them in a ratio y over x take tangent inverse it will give you your angle now this is a little tricky because our quadrants can get a little bit messed up we have to really watch this but you might be also thinking where's the r come in well because this also does create a right triangle pythagorean theorem works x squared plus y squared equals r squared leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared you can do that and so if you took a square root on both sides we would end up getting r equals the square root of x squared plus y squared and you're probably wondering where's your plus and minus this is why the quadrants have to be taken into account when you're doing uh rectangular into polar because without that negative r we can be in the wrong quadrant if you want to use negative r you can but most of the time it's easier to find a different angle than it is to deal with a negative r long story made sure it is this is how you convert from polar to rectangular and this is how you convert from rectangular to polar polar to rectangular is a little bit easier because you don't have to really worry about switching quadrants this can be a little tougher because we typically keep positive r and adjust our angle to fit the quadrant that our rectangular coordinates were in so find coordinate first do all your your work to figure out your polar and then locate if that's in the correct quadrant switch your angles if you have to so i'm going to write this out that this is for polar to rectangular this is for rectangular polar we'll talk about all this in the next video so we'll talk about how you can find the quadrants of your x y coordinates uh that ordered pair and then we can use that to determine your polar coordinates it's not too bad it just requires a little bit more work right now i want to focus on how we can change from polar to rectangular we'll still identify quadrants i'm going to use this to do it just to make sure we're in the right place and then we'll we'll do the math pretty quickly again it gives you everything you need all right let's try a few examples just converting some polar coordinates into rectangular coordinates uh we've already seen that it's not too bad as long as we're given polar we can identify the r or the radius really and the angle that we make with the polar axis so this this theta and according to that we know that because sine theta equals y over r y equals r sine theta x equals r cosine theta so here's here's the process going through it number one we're going to take a look at our polar coordinates here identify the r and identify the theta really write it down that way when you're converting to x and y for rectangular coordinates you know exactly where to look so when we take a look at this r is always first in polar coordinates so r is four here and our angle is three pi over two once we've done that think about what quadrant we're in now it's not such a big deal from polar coordinates to rectangular because we're never going to make a mistake on what quadrant this actually actually has but going from rectangular to polar that does make a difference and and the reason why it does is because tangent inverse only gives you back angles on quadrants four or one negative pi over two to pi over two so if something is actually in quadrants two or three we have to manipulate it that doesn't happen here but it's good practice to get in just to check your work to make sure you're there so if we think about an angle of 3 pi over 2 all the way right there and a radius of 4 or an ro4 that's 1 2 3 4. we are actually right on the negative y axis so we know that this is kind of a quadrant angle so we're not in a quadrant we're on one of our quadrant angles there so we should end on the negative y axis if we don't we've made a mistake it's a great way to check your work so now that we've got our rs4 our theta is 3 pi over 2 all we really have to do is find x and y it doesn't really matter which order you do it in so i'm going to start with y y equals r sine theta so if r r is four and our theta is three pi over two we're just going to look at a unit circle or your calculator whatever you really need to do this sine of three pi over two is negative one so four times negative one is negative four x is found really similarly but instead of using sine we're going to use cosine that's what makes sense sine was really always associated with a y type of idea y over r uh cosine's always associated with an x idea x over r so if we take our r of 4 and cosine of our angle so r cosine theta cosine of 3 pi over 2 is 0 the x coordinate of that that angle is 0 times 4 is still 0 so x is 0. if we put that together just make sure you do the right order it's not negative 4 0 it's 0 negative four remember we're converting from polar which is always r theta into rectangular which always is x y so this is zero comma negative four now the reason why we talked about the quadrant was so that you check your work 0 negative 4 is you go over 0 you would go down 4. hey that's on the negative y-axis these both refer to the exact same point it's just a different way to get there polar says find me an angle and then go a distance out from that and rectangular says use an x and use a y to rectangularly get to the same exact point that's just about it we're going to practice a few more but this really kind of shows you what you'll be doing to convert from polar to rectangular let's try this one so we have a point in polar coordinates that we want to change to rectangular the very first thing we're going to do if we are if we know we're in polar coordinates is give the r and the theta r is always first in this ordered pair so r is negative two and our theta is zero after that we're going to look at the quadrant so negative two zero in polar coordinates means your angle is zero so we're we're really on the polar axis but negative two means we're going this way so we'd say hey we're not going up it's not positive it's not negative that's at zero but negative two is one two positive but this way would be negative two so we're really over here it's on this this negative x-axis so it's another quadrant angle really let's see if the rectangular coordinates give us the same thing in order to convert we just need to know r and theta we've written it down so that we're sure what they are find x or y in any order that you want it doesn't really matter some people like finding x first because they know to put that first in the ordered pair for rectangular coordinates that's fine so x is given by whatever your r is cosine of whatever your angle is so cosine of zero is one you find out the unit circle you memorize it use a table cosine of zero is one one times negative two is negative two now notice something you don't have to worry about what quadrant you're in with polar because these negative r's and angles tell you precisely where you're at and those signs really do translate into rectangular importance system very very well so there's never really a confusion about what quadrant you have we're just going through it to make sure that we have amazing mistakes really checking your work so negative 2 times 1 is just negative 2. we do the same exact thing for the y coordinate but we're using sine because sine relates to our y sine of zero is actually zero so negative two times zero is zero the y coordinate here is zero and so we get this point negative two comma zero think about where that would be on the rectangular coordinate system negative two comma zero is on the x axis you go negative 2 on the y-axis you go zero this is exactly the same point now hopefully you see something interesting these are the same numbers but they mean something completely different in polar coordinates this means the angle which was zero this means the distance from the pole in the opposite direction of positive r which would be this way this means you go left two on the x-axis and you do not move on the y it's going to give you the same point but they do mean different things this is rectangular that's polar let's take a look at this example so we have a point in polar coordinates 6 comma 150 degrees think about what that means these polar coordinates or these these points in polar coordinates are always ordered that means that r comes first and the angle comes second so let's write that out the r has to be six here and our angle is 150 degrees i gotta throw some degrees at you eventually so we're going to write that down after that we're going to determine the quadrant of that point now even though polar coordinates into rectangular will always maintain the quadrant it's not to worry about that it's so that we can check our work so let's think about what an r of 6 and an angle of 150 degrees actually means from our polar axis 150 degrees positive is the same thing as 5 pi over 6 so we're going right to there and because the r is positive six along that that ray we go one two three four five six we'd be right about there each of these concentric circles represents one unit we'd be right exactly there now it's not to graph this point even though that's very useful it's great practice to be able to go 100 degrees and out positive 6 for r but we're getting a quadrant of 2. here's what that'll let us do when we finally figure out our rectangular coordinates it better end up in quadrant two if not we've made a mistake so this is simply to check your work we know this point is in quadrant two if we were to superimpose this on a rectangular coordinate system therefore the coordinates we get has to match that after that it's really a matter of using the right trigonometry for the right point if x relates to cosine then use cosine to figure out x we're just going to take our r of 6. and cosine of our angle which is 150 degrees cosine of 150 degrees or 5 pi over 6 is negative or negative x square root 3 over 2. if we simplify that we'll get negative three square root of three the y coordinates found really similarly but we're using sine because sine relates to y so 6 times sine of 150 degrees now because sine of 150 degrees or 5 pi over 6 same thing is one half we'll end up with six times positive one half remember at 150 degrees that y value is positive so if we put this together remember that x comes first y comes second put them in order we're going to get 3 comma negative sorry negative 3 square root 3 comma positive 3. now i almost did something there that the quadrants would have caught let's say for instance i had accidentally reversed this and got 3 comma negative 3 root 3. if i had if i'd done that positive 3 comma negative 3 3 would have been quadrant 4. i would have looked here and said wait a minute this 150 with the r of 6 is in quadrant 2 i actually got something quadrant 4 that does not work and so i know i would have made a mistake the way i have it if i put this x and y in order correctly negative 3 square root 3 is okay that's that's left that's a negative x value positive y would give us something in quadrant two quadrant true matches quadrant two these represent the same point but using different coordinate systems this is polar and this is rectangular but it's giving you the same point what's nice is these also go pretty quick so we only have like four more to do it'll just take us a couple minutes honestly let's go ahead and convert this on i want to give you some negative r some negative radius so that we can get pretty used to it especially in identifying the quadrant that's pretty important when we're just going to go from rectangular into polar we won't really be using negative r they're just a lot easier to deal with if we use positive r but we will have to manipulate some angles so we're going to practice that now getting used to where these go that way we can sort of fix that problem in the next video so if these are polar coordinates and we are given this by r theta all the time the first thing we do is identify our r our r is negative two now there's no worry going from polar to rectangular these negatives will work themselves out to be in the correct quadrants for your rectangular coordinates we just want to make sure that we we nail it the first time and understand what quadrant this point is actually in so this point in polar says you've got an r of negative two given by an angle of 3 pi over 4. spend just a second and figure out what quadrant that's in so positive 3 pi over 4 for an angle says from our polar axis we're going one two three pi over four that's right here so here's our array that we just created but we're going negative 2 so along this ray in the opposite direction is going to put me along 7 pi over 4 really or negative pi over 4 but opposite direction from positive r along that ray would be right down here one two so negative two that puts us squarely into quadrant four so i'm thinking quadrant formula write that down so quadrant four figure out x and y the same way so x relates to cosine so negative 2 times cosine of 3 pi over 4 cosine of three pi over four is negative square root two over two notice also i've kept the negative r this will work itself out you do not have to worry about it the y value the y coordinate is going to be given by negative 2 sine of 3 pi over 4. which when we simplify figure that sine 3 pi over 4 is positive square root 2 over 2 simplify our 2 so we get negative square root 2. putting this together in the right order is important we have x comma y that's positive square root 2 comma negative square root 2. this should be exactly the same location of this point according to rectangular coordinates well let's see let's see if it's at least in the right quadrant this was in quadrant 4 because we went positive 3 pi over 4 and negative 2 put us from quadrant 2 into quadrant 4. this says go positive square root two and down square root two so along the x positively along the y and negatively that puts us into quadrant four so our quadrants match this is exactly the same point but according to a different coordinate system let's come back we'll do three more then we'll be done okay moving on we've got another point in polar coordinates of negative three comma negative pi over three every polar coordinate system is in the same same manner we always do r we always do theta seconds so r is negative three we're gonna write that down along with negative pi over three for our angle now let's take a look at that negative pi over three says from your polar axis you're gonna go well clockwise really pi over three that's the same thing as five pi over three but you got there in a different way we went down here then negative three said yeah you'd go along that if you're a positive but if you're negative you're going to reverse right across that pole like basically reflect that and you're gonna or add pi or subtract pi you're gonna be in quadrant two essentially like you went to two pi over three so this point is in quadrant two if we were to put this on an x y coordinate plane now we're going to figure out x and y exactly the same way so for x because x relates to cosine we have negative 3 that's our r always r first with the sign it'll take care of where this is located on the quadrant so we're just going to make sure that we haven't made a mistake by matching our quadrants up cosine for x sine for y so cosine of negative pi over three you can use your circle and do this you can think of this as five pi over three anyway you go you're going to get positive one half you could also do something like this though just so we don't forget this remember that cosine is an even function and sine is an odd function so you could really say hey because cosine's even i can change the sign of my argument without changing the sign of my function opposite inputs have equal outputs so this is the same thing as negative three cosine positive pi over three now don't do that before you've identified your quadrant though do this in a certain order so always your r always your angle without changing it always your quadrant without changing it but when you do your math you can rely on some of these identities we've talked about but you've got to find this first so because cosine's even you can do that to figure out the value of the x coordinate of that angle so cosine pi over 3 is positive one-half cosine of negative pi over three is positive one-half so negative three times positive one-half is negative three-halves now sine is an odd function and so if you want to figure out sine of negative pi over 3 you could certainly do it by thinking of 5 pi over 3 or negative pi over 3 on your unit circle you're going to get negative square root 3 over 2. you could certainly do that you get negative 3 times negative square root of 3 over 2 it'll give you positive 3 square root 3 over 2. positive 3 square root 3 over 2. you could also at this point since you've already written this down and you're not going to change it now you could change this by its odd function into negative sine of positive pi over 3. opposite inputs give you opposite outputs for negatives so i'm going to show that just to refresh your memory odd function change the argument change the function this will give you positive 3 sine pi 3. because sine of pi over 3 is square root 3 over 2 we're going to end up getting 3 square root 3 over 2 exactly what we would have got if we looked up sine of negative pi over 3 but for some students a little bit easier and i wanted to make sure you remember about those odd functions either way we go though we now have an x coordinate we have a y coordinate we can put this together and this will be the rectangular coordinate way to represent the exact same point now all we've got to do is make sure the quadrant is right so that we haven't seen any major mistakes here if our x value is negative one and a half that's x is negative one and a half y is positive that puts us right in quadrant two exactly where we thought this is just a different way to represent the same exact point they're both in quadrant two at the same exact spot okay in the last two examples i really want to focus on what you need to be doing if we don't have things that are on our unit circle like negative 3.1 comma 182 degrees something kind of strange like we don't really we can't really look that up very easily and so you'll be using your calculator that's perfectly okay but we do still want to be good at locating what quadrant this polar this point in polar coordinates is and then making sure that this matches that so this is a point in polar coordinates write down the r first if it's negative that's fine leave it if it's a decimal that's okay too so we just have negative 3.1 with an angle of 182 degrees so if we have an r of negative 3.1 an angle of 180 degrees notice that if we started from our our polar axis here and we went 182 degrees that's like oh just past 180 that's like right here it would be in quadrant three if our r was positive but it's not so this goes all the way to 182 degrees and says ah yeah but i want to switch it up here i'm going to put you reflected back over here that would put us in quadrant 1. i hope you see that 180 degrees is here 182 degrees is just past that and we would go out 3.1 123.1 positively and this says yes but you'd go in the opposite direction of that positive r you would go along this ray in the other direction that would put you from quadrant three into quadrant one now think about this remem i hope you remember this you can always change the sign of your r by adding pi what that also means is that positive r and negative r are pi radians or 180 degrees different from one another so if you were 182 degrees at negative 3.1 that'd be the same thing as subtract 180 2 degrees with positive 3.1 this would be at 2 degrees positive 3.1 we did that math already i'm not going to repeat it but we were able to change the sine of r by adding or subtracting pi or 180 degrees this would be 182 in the other direction or 2 in the positive r direction 2 degrees with positive 3.1 as your r now anyway you go you're going to be in quadrant 1. now we can go ahead and find x and y but you're going to have to approximate them in order to get kind of useful information here so x is negative 3.1 cosine because we have x 182 degrees and y is negative 3.1 sine of 182 degrees if we use our calculator to approximate we get about 3.10 for x and about 0.11 for y why so small man i really hope i put this together for you but if you have gone 182 degrees and then reversed that because of your negative r you're going to be floating right above this at 2 degrees just barely 2 degrees and 3.1 out so what's it going to do point wise for x that's going to be almost 3.1 not it's just me just under that so this is 3.1 this is probably rounded up just a little bit and then slightly above the x-axis that's what that y tells you you're just floating right above there not very much just 0.11 because your angle would only be 2 degrees up that polar axis so does it work is this still in quadrant one yes x is positive and y is positive it's just barely in quadrant one but so is this point this was just barely two degrees up the polar axis and three point one units out so they're both in the same quadrant they actually represent the same point this is just in rectangular coordinates and this is just in polar last one now we don't see this very often but occasionally you'll have some sort of radians that aren't just pi over two or pi over four or five pi over six radians but something like three point eight radians uh it's still polar coordinates and it's still a point that's written with r and theta and we're going to write that down but when you go to use your calculator because you're going to have to approximate this a couple things firstly make sure your calculator is in radians because just like from before we have in degrees when dealing with degrees you're going to want it in radians secondly we really want to understand that pi is 3.14 about radians and so that will help you determine what quadrant this is in so we're going to write it down r is 6 let's write down 6 for r and our angle is 3.8 radians let's think about that if pi is 180 degrees or pi is 3.14 radians because all those those pi type units are in radians then pi stands for 3.14 radians where would 3.8 radians end up well it's measured positively so it still be counterclockwise but we'd go from zero radians all the way to pi radians 3.14 and then a little bit past that 3.8 radians would put us in quadrant number 3 as long as our r is positive so it says go past 3.14 to 3.8 somewhere along there you're going to go from a pole one two three four five six units out that's what that says so we are in quadrant three for sure what if it had been negative r then you'd go 3.8 radians and you would reflect back you'd go in the opposite direction of that angle 180 degrees or pi different and you'd be in quadrant one this one happens to be in quadrant three and then we go about finding x and y so we're still going to do the same thing but we're going to have to approximate so make sure your calculators and radians like we've already talked about and if we do that we're going to get 6 times cosine 3.8 radians is about negative 4.98 and y is about negative 3.85 if we use sine of three point radians times six so that's going to give us this point in rectangular coordinates same point different way of looking at it let's just make sure the quadrant matches negative x and negative y puts us right in quadrant three this was in quadrant three just just past 3.14 radians and positive six quadrant three matches it looks really good uh just a different way to look at the same thing honestly so hopefully that makes sense i hope i've explained well enough how to convert from polar to rectangular the usefulness of double checking with your your quadrants just to make sure you haven't made any errors this is going to be exceptionally useful when we go the other way around so so the next video is going to talk about what if you have rectangular coordinates for a point can you get to polar yes but the tangent's a little bit tricky because it can only return angles in quadrants four or one so if your rectangular coordinates are giving you angles in quadrants two or three you're going to have to add or subtract pi to get there we'll talk about the next video hope this has made sense hopefully you see usefulness and the connection to our right triangle trigonometry and i'll see you for another video you
