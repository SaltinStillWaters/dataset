Transcript for: Introduction to Inverse Trigonometric Functions (Precalculus - Trigonometry 17)
welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about what in the world inverse trig functions are you know what why would we do that because it's fun not really um it is kind of fun but because you want to solve them eventually maybe you don't but you're going to have to so we're going to learn how functions solve other functions by using inverses that's really the basis of why we we talked about this is because inverse functions are needed to solve certain types of functions in fact all functions for instance if you wanted to solve an equation with addition you're going to need to use subtraction and inverse operation something quite similar happens when we want to solve an equation that has sine in it or cosine or tangent well we can't just divide why well because sine is a function not an operation and so we need an inverse function rather than just an inverse operation in order to solve these equations that deal with these trigonometric functions that we've been dealt with so we're going to talk about inverse functions what they look like why they are the way they are being sort of a cutting off of a one to one to make a function one to one and then as we progress through several more videos we'll learn how to use inverse functions to solve their root functions so how to use sine inverse to solve sine functions or cosine inverse to solve cosine functions things like that so that's why we're getting into it so the the long story made very short is you need inverse functions to solve equations that contain a specific function inverse sine for sine and the inverse of cosine for cosine and etc so let's talk about what they are now if you remember anything about inverse functions you should remember that a function has an inverse if and only if it's one to one now that if and only if an iff stands for if and only if that's that's by conditional means uh one is necessary and sufficient for the other well what that means is this like put all together is a function has an inverse if it's one to one and if a function is one to one it has an inverse okay well what in the world does one to one mean one to one is this idea of being forward and backwards mappable the the specific definition is one input gives you one unique output now a function itself says plug in one number you get out one number uh one to one says plug in one number you get out one number but that number never happens again why is that important well if you want to be able to reverse something map it forwards and backwards one input needs to be mapped to one output but that output needs to be backwards mapped to one input think about this for a second parabolas do not do this if i say plug in positive 2 to x squared you're going to get 4 but i would say okay now take an output of 4 what was your input you could have 2 or negative 2. the backwards mapping does not work because that those two inputs gave you the same output therefore that output could possibly give you two different inputs it's forward mappable but not backward mappable it's a function but not a one to one function we need one to one functions that are mapped forwards and backwards so that inverses make sense why well because in inverses we switch the x and y the input becomes the output the output becomes the input the domain becomes the range and the range becomes the domain if that's true then if we have one input giving us one output and we reverse that that new input which was an output is still going to give us that output it's still a function if we had one input uh certain sorry two different inputs it gave us the same output when we reversed that we'd have one input giving us two different outputs and that is a non-function so the whole thing wrapped up together is one to one functions are one input one unique output so that we can map it forwards and backwards so that we can reverse inputs and outputs and we still have functions and in that way we can undo functions with inverses that's a really probably three video explanation one to one in case you didn't remember it so we're going to get right into it and talk about how sine is not one to one and so we're gonna have to restrict it and in doing so we create a portion of a function that is one to one and this is the portion we have to look at so that inverses make sense so all that you really need to know right now is that inverses are only possible if a function is one to one one easy way to tell the functions one-to-one is something called the horizontal line test so imagine a horizontal line if it hits your function at more than one spot you don't have a one-to-one function you have a function but not one-to-one we have problems here if we imagine a horizontal line we hit outputs here and here and here here and every so often um twice a period that we get the same exact outputs that that's an issue that would be a very very big issue because we do not have a one-to-one function inside now why is that important if sine is not a one-to-one function sine of x is what i'm referring to well then if it's not to one it can't have an inverse so here's the thought process if we want inverses so that we're able to solve equations with sine in them well then we're going to have to restrict this function so that becomes one to one so that we can map forwards and backwards and functions still work between a function and inverse we can still have that so if we take a look and we go uh yeah that's not one to one so it does not have an inverse let's start cutting this and the common common way to do it is to take a part of this function that is to one to one now notice something we couldn't do something like from zero to pi why well from zero to pi it's still not one-to-one this has inputs giving us outputs that are repeated you cannot have repeated outputs in a function that has an inverse and so that's on the table where would we cut this well from here to here and along the x-axis that's negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 that is a one-to-one function so we're going to ignore all of this and all of this and just focus on this little sliver now i've kind of zoomed in here a lot this is the part of the sine function that we typically say this is what we're building our inverse on so this is huge it's a big deal it's why a lot of students struggle with inverses is because they really don't recognize what we're looking at what we're looking at when we talk about sine inverse or some people call it arc sine if you've heard of that before sine inverses sine of little negative 1 looks like an exponent it's not but we pronounce it sine inverse the inverse of the sine function this is what we're looking at we're looking at a zoomed in part of sine now in order to get an inverse out of it again you have to be one to this is one-to-one every input is giving you a unique not repeated output it passes the horizontal line test this is a one-to-one part of a function but in order to do it we had to cut it in cutting it restricting the domain we're only looking at a little piece here's the payoff for us is that when we start talking about inverse functions if you have something outside of this interval you can't do it if you have something outside of this range you can't do it you can't talk about inverses that creates a very specific domain and range for both the sine function that has an inverse and the sine inverse function later and it's a big deal we'll talk a lot about this so what is our domain of the part of the sine function that lets us find an inverse well the domain is from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. that is including those endpoints because we don't run into any problems with those outputs being repeated so we can go from negative pi over two to pi over two and have a one-to-one function i hope i'm explaining that well enough i hope that you're seeing that one-to-one functions past horizontal line tests outputs are not repeated it's because we need a one a mapping forwards and backwards that we have to have that happen sine doesn't do it so we cut side where we cut sine from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 that's where we're going to cut it now our range says well you still do have the same range don't you from negative one to one this portion this little little part of the graph on this interval x axis still has a range from negative one to one including those and our key points two of our most important key points are on there are quarters the high and the low the local max and local men now technically we don't really have a local max anymore because we're not changing from increasing or decreasing we have an absolute max an absolute min that's true but those key points that negative pi over 2 negative 1 and the pi over 2 negative 1 they're still here negative pi over 2 negative 1 pi over 2 positive 1. here's the deal we need to remember a few things about how inverse functions work so the first thing was when they're possible they're possible when we have one-to-one functions and a one-to-one function will have an inverse that means this has an inverse there's a few things about inverses though everything switches from inputs to outputs and outputs to inputs what that means is several things i want to point out right now number one if you're going to find an inverse function from some sort of a root function your x's and your y's switch your inputs and your outputs switch your domain and your range switch and your graph reflects about the y equals x you might remember that we talked a lot about inverses in some videos ago the same things hold true even though it's trigonometry inverse searches inverses they take one-to-one functions and they switch stuff up they see your x's and your y's change what that means is that if i want to find an inverse function if negative pi over 2 comma negative 1 is on my original function then negative 1 comma negative pi over 2 is going to be on the inverse likewise 1 comma pi over 2 is going to be on my inverse i'm switching my x and my y my domain is going to become my range my range is going to become my domain my graph is going to reflect across y equals x and we're going to get something just like this so instead of negative pi over 2 negative 1 i have negative 1 negative pi over 2. 0 0 now wait a minute 0 0 is still 0 0 so it goes to the origin pi over two comma one we reflect that we get one comma pi over two those are the key points for my inverse function my domain is going to become my range you can see it right now this is still one to one that's important if we have a one-to-one function and find an inverse the inverse is also one to one they're inverses of one another now that's important for later on that means that sine inverse is going to solve sine stuff and sine stuff is going to solve sine inverse equations they work together it's like this if you have an equation with addition you need subtraction if you have an equation with subtraction you need addition they work hand in hand to solve equations because they're inverse operations likewise we have inverse functions here that are going to solve one another because they're made for one another and from one another based on this inverse function idea so it's still one to one it's still actually a function it's just that everything changes so let's write out a couple things about it we can see it graphically that our domain is negative one to one notice i'm not drawing arrows here why because if i was well then we would start getting this this non-one-to-one function same thing happens here we're going to get this non-one-to-one function so our domain is negative one to one that's what the range here was remember input's an output switch so domain and range switch between functions and their their inverses so domain is negative one to one range is negative pi over two to pi over two that's our old domain becomes our range for inverse our old range becomes our domain for our inverse our key points are now different negative 1 negative pi over 2 0 0 for sure still and then 1 comma pi over 2. and i hope that makes sense to you the one thing that you've noticed we haven't done yet we don't even know what what it looks like we don't even know what the name of it looks like for sine inverse here's where we would get this from so we have a picture of it and we know why it's sort of truncated we cut it so that this would still be one to one and so is the inverse we know our domain we know our range we know our key points this is it this is all that sine inverse can do so here's what this means if you have something on the inside of sine inverse that's not negative one to one you have a problem it's outside the domain and you cannot deal with it interesting if you have something inside or equal to side numbers equal to something that's outside negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 you can't deal with it it must satisfy what we have here and what we have here if we're going to solve it with inverses that's interesting that's that should be valuable to them to us what we don't have is the name yet so let's go ahead and let's remember how we solve equations for inverses this is going to lead us in the next two videos from now how to find inverse functions so if you remember how to solve for inverses the first thing we did is we changed y into x and x into y and then we solved for y and you go yeah but how am i supposed to do that do i divide by sine no we can't do that why well if we divided by sine sine is not really an operator right sine is not a number sine is a function and so we have some have to have something to undo that function we call it sine inverse so we're going to apply sine inverse to the left-hand side of both sides of this equation what that looks like is looks kind of awkward the first time you see it you go okay sine negative 1x it's pronounced sine inverse it stands for the inverse of the sine function you can also hear it said or here seen it red as arc sine a r c sine arc sine and sine numbers are the same thing it looks a little weird over here like okay sine inverse of sine of y what in the world does that do here here's like the plain english way to look at this this says thing that undoes sine of sine wait a minute the thing that undoes sine is going to undo the sign what are you left with well if this undoes this you're left with that that's exactly what an inverse function does an inverse function undoes the original function the function itself would undo the inverse and so thing that under sine of sine leaves you with whatever that sign was that's just why this is the inverse of the sine function so we say y equals sine inverse of x here's the domain and the range and the key points of it here's the graph of it even but that's how you pronounce it so if you want to do this say sine inverse of x you just pronounce this correctly you can also say arc sine x and you pronounce this well technically you'd say sine inverse but you can see this red as arc sine same exact thing a couple comments about this is this is a big deal please remember this this is a huge that in our original function sine of x was an angle that's exactly what this is now it can be viewed as a real number yes but on a unit circle this was an angle or an arc length and this was well let's see that was a coordinate that was a point on the inner circle sine inverse is now backwards so look at this your angle is now your your y well this is your angle this is your point it has switched remember that inputs become outputs outputs become inputs on the unit circle our input was an angle our output was a point on the circle inverses say your input's a point on the circle and your output's going to be the angle that gives you that point that's a big deal it's reversed of what this originally was and that's how inverse functions really do work they reverse the x and the y they solve for the y what that does is that makes inputs outputs and outputs inputs on the unit circle if the original input was an angle and output was a point now for inverses the input's the point the output is the angle that we that gives us that point and that's really how we think about it so i hope it makes sense if it makes sense on why we had to cut this to get a one-to-one function that this is the picture of it and now that we've solved this down we're going to move quickly through the cosine and cosine inverse relationship i'm not going to show you this because it's exactly the same what we're going to focus on is the domain the range what the picture looks like and then what what the key points are same thing for tangent let's talk about cosine and cosine inverse we're going to go much quicker than the sine because we've already talked about what one-to-one means the necessity of having a one-to-one function for an inverse we just have to look at cosine determine yeah there's no way that's one to one that's not a one to one function it does not pass the horizontal line test so we're going to cut it we're going to find out what our domain is on which we have a one to one portion of cosine what our range is as a consequence of that and then we'll take a look at what the key points are what the graph of that would look like if we reflect it across y equals x so if we take a look at cosine of x it's a little different it's actually a phase shift of sine but cosine of x is definitely not one to one unless we start cutting it now there are several options like we have a sign there's several options where we cut it but probably the most obvious one is if we cut it at zero and at pi we'll have a portion of the x-axis on which cosine is one-to-one decreasing where sine was increasing that's interesting sine was an increasing function on which we took an inverse and cosine is decreasing on that portion of the x-axis that domain so we're going to cut it here and here we're going to ignore all of this stuff why well because we can't find a one-to-one function for that not the whole thing so we're going to cut this from zero to pi i've done that here so from zero to pi we have this portion on our graph it passes the one to one the horizontal line test it is one to one every input is given one unique output on this interval well that therefore is the domain on which we can find an inverse for cosine x so our domain is from zero to pi now consequently zero has an output of one and pi has an output of negative one so that is a range and we put it in order and the end points are also there yes this has endpoints it has to otherwise when this continues it becomes not one to one and we can't find an inverse any longer and then there's some key points we have 0 1 pi over 2 0 and then pi comma negative 1. when we start reversing those here's what has to happen our x's and our y's are going to switch so if we had zero one a key point on the inverse should be one zero if we had pi over two comma zero on the inverse we get zero pi over two and if we had pi comma negative one then on the inverse we have negative one comma pi also this is kind of awkward because the uh the y equals x line goes through our function remember we're reflecting about that and so this is going to look a little bit weird because any graph that crosses the line of reflection you reflect it looks a little a little strange it was diagonal and so how this really looks is this looks quite similar to that side doesn't it but it's almost it's not going uh it's not increasing it's decreasing like the original function was this is the graph of what we would call arc cosine x or cosine inverse of x now the domain and the range are what we would expect the domain of cosine inverse well that was the range of cosine so our domain is negative one to one the range is the old domain so the range was zero to pi sorry the domain was zero to pi here the range is zero to pi on our cosine inverse another thing to remember just remember that with the original cosine function the input was an angle the output was part of a point that's also reverse inputs become outputs outputs become inputs so on cosine inverse the input is a point and the output is the angle that gives you that point if i want to be a bit more specific it's the x coordinate of a point and before with sine inverse it was the y coordinate of the point that was your input the output is the angle that's giving you that it's reversed at this so now we should have a pretty good feel for hey inverses are going to solve one another that's the idea i want your head they only work on one to one function so we had to cut it and give us something very important that these one-to-one functions do not work everywhere you have to have a very specific input very specific range of outputs and inputs that work in this relationship we're going to come back with tangent take a look at what that that is as well all right let's talk about one more we're going to talk about the inverse of tangent so we're going to find tan inverse same exact idea is what we've been dealing with actually really really similar to side even kind of looks a little bit similar to that and so we'll take a look at it right now so let's take a look at tangent of x all right here's the graph of tangent of x and very very conveniently we already see that this is a one-to-one function now it does have some other cycles to it which i haven't shown but a really sort of obvious domain restriction would be if we cut this thing at negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 it's already one to one we don't have to modify this any other way we're just going to kind of ignore all the other cycles the repetitions of the periods that we have the period being pi and distance of pi on the x-axis that this is already one-to-one so tangent of x on this particular domain is a one-to-one function and therefore has to have an inverse and that's exactly what we find out and that is the domain restriction that makes the inverse of tangent possible do remember this though in its natural state without restricting the domain this thing does continue forever with that same repetition so it's not one-to-one in general until we make a domain restriction and so that's what we're going to do right now kind of a natural one though i mean we see it's one to one it's really nice to say yeah just from here to here we have this nice function that is one to one we can find an inverse now one thing to keep in mind with a vertical asymptote you can't ever include that it's undefined right there's no way to find this if you try to plug in tangent of pi over two you're going to get something over zero one over zero specifically that would be y over x on the unit circle you say that's undefined yeah that's why there's a vertical asymptote there which means that we can't have a bracket we're going to have a parenthesis there is no point on tangent of pi over 2 or negative pi over 2. so we're going to show that now the range also is from negative infinity all the way to infinity and we see a few key points on this we have this key point of negative pi over four negative one we've got zero zero and we have pi over four positive one everything about this one to one function on the restricted domain of tangent is going to be reversed as far as inputs and outputs are concerned so all of our key points are going to change if negative pi over 4 negative 1 is on tangent then negative 1 negative pi over 4 is on the inverse 0 0 gives us 0 0 pi over 4 1 gives us 1 pi over 4. so we're going to get three points that are key points for the inverse function and so we've shown that we have a few points right there negative one negative power four got it zero zero and one comma pi over four inputs and output switch x's and y's switch between a function and inverse domain range also switched so the domain of tangent was negative pi over two to pi over two that's going to be the range of tan inverse our range was negative infinity to positive infinity that's going to be the domain for tan inverse in fact even asymptotes change a vertical asymptote said you can't have this on the x axis you can't have that input well we're going to have now a horizontal asymptote you can't get that out on the y axis and so asymptotes at negative pi over 2 and pi over 2 are still there but they change from vertical to horizontal the last thing we have to do is graph it so we know that the function we're building is an inverse function for tangent we have tan inverse or arctan we can say that too our domain and range have switched we have the graph we know it's going to be reflection across the y equals x line so our graph is going to look something like this that's about what tan inverse of x looks like we can see that our domain is all real numbers you can plug in anything to tan inverse why because you could get out anything from tangent you can only get out negative pi over two to pi over two for four tan inverse why because you can only plug in that that interval for tangent and so this is the last important point the last name i make please make sure you understand that the input for tangent is an angle the output was a comparison of a coordinates of points y over x so the reverse is true for tan inverse our input is going to be a ratio of y over x the output is going to be an angle here so we would have this as a point and that is the angle that gives the point that's reverse of that's reverse of the comparison of y over x being the output of some angle for tangent uh please keep this in mind that i i know that we have x's and y's going on in the context of what we're dealing with yes x can be real numbers it's what we are uh talking about but on the unit circle where i'm kind of making this an uncomfortable circle to connect a little bit for you is that when you look up tangent on a unit circle you look up an angle x stands for that angle um or arc length on a unit circle it's fine it can be any real number that's okay as long as between here for an inverse that's fine it's appropriate the input would be the angle the output what that is would be the comparison of coordinates of the points on a unit circle for sine it was just angle gave me y coordinate for cosine angle gave me x coordinate for tangent angle gives me y divided by x coordinates that's what's going on the inverses reverse that inverses say okay give me a y coordinate sine inverse of that y coordinate gives me the angle that makes it give me an x coordinate cosine inverse of that coordinate gives me the angle that makes it give me a y compared to x coordinate tan inverse of that y compared to x is going to give me the angle that makes that ratio i hope that makes sense this is where these graphs come from what they look like and why most importantly why we have to restrict them to make one-to-one functions so that we can even get inverses next video we're going to do is talk about how to use it so we're going to we're going to show what the domain has to be what the range has to be when you can actually simplify some of these these expressions involving sine and sine inverse or cosine cosine inverse so we'll get a little more complicated than that then after that i'll show you how to find inverse functions of something like 3 sine of 2x plus 7. can we find an inverse with that so that's where we're going with it right now just an introduction into how inverse functions are possible with some trigonometric ideas hope i've made it make sense for you i'll see you for another video
