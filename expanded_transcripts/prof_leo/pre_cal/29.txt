Transcript for: Creating Polynomials from Real Zeros (Precalculus - College Algebra 30)
hi welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about how we can go from x-intercepts or zeros or roots into a polynomial type function so it's pretty important because what we're going to be learning at the very end of it is that if we have a graph and we can identify some x-intercepts well then we can build a function from it same thing is going to happen in the next few videos where we find some zeros and then build functions from that as well so pretty useful for graphing gives us a very good impression of our interpretation i should say about how x-intercepts and polynomials play together and one way we can go is from x-intercepts into the polynomial so we're going to learn how to do that and how we're going to start is we're going to kind of rediscover how factoring and the zero product property give us x intercepts and then we're just going to go back to that so here's what we're going to learn we're going to learn that if you have an x intercept you can create a factor and by using the zero product property we can take those factors and build a polynomial from it so this is only to do with polynomials for now but we can use some of the same ideas to build rational functions later on when we get to rationals which is a polynomial divided by another polynomial so let's check it out imagine we have a function x squared plus 2x minus 8. and i know that you've seen this before but remember what i'm trying to teach you i'm trying to teach you how going from here to our our zeros our x-intercepts our roots if we go backwards we're gonna be able to start with zeros x-intercepts or roots and find polynomials from that so let's let's discover it how we find a zero or an x-intercept or a root of any function is we set it equal to zero so let's start that now if we don't have factoring available to us for quadratics it's pretty nice because we can just do the quadratic formula and we're good for cubics those power threes we do there is a way to do that there's a formula sort of that you can use and even fourth powers you can do it it's very very labor intensive uh for fifth power and higher degree five polynomials and higher there is no general way to factor it that means there's no formula that you can just throw at it uh plug in the coefficients and it does it for you quadratic formula is the easiest one that we have uh there is one for power three and a power four but none for a power five and higher you can prove it but it takes some fairly high level math uh to do it you do learn this in like a bachelor's level mathematics and so we're not going to be doing that maybe even masters level i can't remember where i learned that but we're not going to be learning that what we're going to be learning a little bit later is if you have a power 3 power 4 power 5 power 6 if you can find some zeros that means you can factor it and so you're going to be learning that in the next few videos what that means is that factoring is sort of our our best case scenario for working with these polynomials for quadratics man we should really try to factor them and this one is in fact factorable but later on if they're not factorable we're going to be trying to find x-intercepts so as to make them factorable i'll teach you about the the rational zeros theorem a little bit later so let's go ahead and factor this this of course we know is x plus 4 times x minus 2 equals 0. now here's the point because we were able to factor this polynomial we're able to use the zero product property to set each of those factors equal to zero and it's going to give us two in this case real x-intercepts now keep in mind i know that you know this what i'm going to do is after we finish this i'm going to structure this problem as a way to go backwards and get a polynomial from your x-intercepts so zero product property and if we solve that we get two x-intercepts these are the places where this parabola upper opening crosses or intersects the x axis at negative 4 0 and a 2 0. now here's the point what if you were only given this say hey we know two x intercepts can you go backwards and figure out the function from it and the answer is yeah and it's pretty easy there's only a couple things that we want to make sure that we we do number one is we want to make sure that we have any multiplicity taken care of with an appropriate exponent on the factors that we create from our x-intercepts we also want to make sure that we match degrees that's the degree of the polynomial if one's given to us lastly if we have a point that's given and we get this often times from graphs we're going to do this in the last half of the video if you have a point that's given you can find a specific polynomial if you don't then you find a general polynomial sort of a family of curves that has these x-intercepts and we'll talk about that as we get into the factory we'll notice that man this this could be a whole lot of different polynomials that are given so typically we have a little a out front to say this is a family of polynomials of a specific that has specific x-intercepts that would fit this and so we'll talk about that as we go so let's go ahead and let's start going backwards so what if you were given some x-intercepts can you go back and find find a polynomial well let's suppose that we have x-intercepts of negative 3 4 1 and 0. what we're going to do is we're going to allow the zero product property to work for us in reverse model it exactly the same just going backwards so if we have x-intercepts then we know that x would equal negative 3 x would equal 4 x would equal 1 and x would equal 0 for some polynomial if that's the case if that's true if x equals negative 4 well then that's an x intercept of some function we're saying the reverse now here's your x-intercepts of some function that means that x equals negative 3 for some function we're going to find now x equals 4 for some function x equals 1 for some function and x equals 0 for some function that we're going to find those are the x intercepts now how do we build a factor from it if you solve this so that you get 0 on one side so basically undoing your solving if you add 3 to both sides or subtract 4 subtract one subtract zero don't do anything then that right there gives you your factors we're basically doing the opposite of this step you're saying hey you know what from x plus 4 equals 0 i got x equals negative 4. can i create these factors see here's the point what we want is we want to find the factors so that every factor is set equal to 0. if we do that the zero product property works both ways it says if you have products that are multiplied to zero then every factor can be set equal to zero but likewise if you have factors set equal to zero you can multiply them together and that product is still equal to zero that's the zero product property in reverse so we say all right here's our x intercepts great let's create some factors where the zero product property is going to work in other words have some factors set equal to zero and make sure that every single one of those factors is equal to zero then what this says is man you have one two three four factors every one of those is coming from an x-intercept what that means is that you can develop a polynomial not the only one but a polynomial that has these as its factors and by setting them equal to zero you can use a zero product property in reverse and so we're going to do that right now we're going to say all right these factors are x plus 3 x minus 4 x minus 1 and x we typically put individual term factors in the front of an expression not out of necessity just out of convenience it looks a little better we don't lose them as often so let's check it out and just just think through through it with me if you were to do this backwards if you were to have a function like this a polynomial has been factored like this and you have it equal to zero you could certainly say well yeah by the zero product property you'd have x equals zero x plus three equals zero x minus four equals 0 and x minus 1 equals 0 and that would give me these four x intercepts so we're basically just doing this in reverse that's really all there is to it's not not super complicated you just need to know what to do and this is one way that we can go from x-intercepts into a factored version of a polynomial now you'll notice something about this this right here is a function that's set equal to 0. to get a function out of it you just go yeah one function that would have these x-intercepts could be f of x equals x x plus 3 x minus 4 and x minus 1. now i said this is a polynomial that would have these x-intercepts and i don't want to have your brains explode or anything but you can put any number out front and have the exact same x-intercepts wait a minute what any constant factor like let's say seven if i put seven there that seven has absolutely nothing to do with those x intercepts it wouldn't change it or negative seven it still would not change those x intercepts try it if you want to if you put a negative seven in front you would still set x equal to zero the negative seven does nothing even if you take the negative seven and put it over here and divide by negative seven it does nothing as far as your x intercepts all that would do is start changing the the let's call it dramaticity the dramaticness i think it just made up two words right there of how it grows between the x-intercepts or shrinks or reflects it would certainly change the shape of your graph absolutely and the end behavior of your graph again negative to positive for sure but it would not change the x-intercepts the way that this graph interacts with the x-axis now that's interesting what that means is that when you do this technique if you do not have a specific point off of the x-axis that you're going through then you are not really sure about a specific function itself and to signify that we usually put a little a in front to say you know what any a that's a constant factor any a positive or negative would not change the x-intercepts so any a here would have exactly the same for x-intercepts and that's really interesting so without a specific point i said that twice now without a specific point then you leave this a here because you're now talking about a family of functions that all have the same four x-intercepts now what if you do have a point off of the x-axis well then you can use it i'm gonna explore that when we get to the graph so we'll see the point or if they give you a point like hey this goes through the point uh one comma something then you can like one comma two well then you can plug in the two for your function the one for your x because this is the input that's the output input is one for your x's output would be two for your f x and you can use that to solve for a it's not all that bad but without that without a point that is off of the x axis you cannot get a specific function i hope that you understand that now why why off the x-axis well because anything off of the x-axis is not going to be an x-intercept the zero product property says that you're multiplying to get zero so each of those individual factors doesn't really matter if one of them is zero it's something off of the x-axis does matter and it won't be zero it won't it will affect the um the shape of your graph and that that one point will kind of dictate what the shape of the graph is it'll allow you to solve for that a without becoming zero so we're going to explore that in graphs and that's about all there is to it one thing i do want to tell you is that sometimes you'll be required to distribute this i generally don't because it takes a whole long time if you're required to here's how to do it start at the right hand side this is my opinion i think it's the easiest way to go start the right hand side and you would foil this or distribute this then once you have this expression distribute the x plus 3 and then distribute the x and then distribute the a if you have to typically you'll want that to be a number if you're going to distribute that so hopefully you have a point that's off that's off of that x-axis and that's really all there is so we're going to keep on going with a couple more examples where i show you how to deal with multiplicity and why they give you a degree here because that can be confusing like who cares like you didn't give me a degree here or what why why does that matter i'm going to explain that as we go through this and i'll show you why this was sort of an incomplete question to begin with so let's go ahead let's say they give you some zeros or they can call these things roots or they can call these x-intercepts as long as they're real x-intercepts when we start getting into complex zeros complex roots you wouldn't call them x-intercepts anymore because they don't intersect the x-axis when they give you these zeros what we can do first off is to understand that zeros are if they're real are where your graph intersects the x-axis that means that we would get x equals man i talked so long my pen ran out i think goodness because i'm used to that we would get x equals negative one and we would get x equals zero and x equals four and x equals nine if those are zeros then that's where the graph would intersect the x-axis and we've done this many times in reverse where we have a function we factor it we use zero product property and we get our solutions here you could also do negative one zero zero zero four zero negative nine zero but it doesn't really really make a difference from these x intercepts or these real zeros we can create factors so we're being smart about it we're understanding that if i get zero on one side of my equation basically going opposite of solving so in this case adding one doing nothing subtracting 4 and adding 9. then what this allows us to do is to view these x intercepts as some result of a factor that's set equal to 0 by the zero product property we're straight up going in reverse of this well now if all of these are set equal to zero we can consider them to be factors of some polynomial some function so we'd say all right well one factor equal to zero is x plus one this is what gave us the x intercept of negative one in the first place and x we usually put individual term factors out front and x minus four and x plus nine those would be the four factors that we would get from these four x-intercepts you're done the only thing that we have to do right now is to say by the zero product property this is true we're using in reverse so we start with x-intercepts we say let's create some factors that are set equal to zero then we have all of our factors set equal to zero they have to come from somewhere or you could create a function that uses zero product property to state that those are factors so we write them all out the last thing that you would do is you'd say because i have not given a specific point here this is one of many functions that would satisfy these four real zeros and so we'd say yeah there's a function as possible this is one of them we don't want to leave it here equal to zero because we're asking for a function technically we're asking for a polynomial and polynomials are typically not factored in when you write them in standard form and so you would usually distribute this so distribute these two and then this one on top of it and then this one on top of that and then if there's a coefficient out front then you distribute that as well for us we say this is one of many possible so give it a little a because whatever constant factor you put out there it would have the same exact x-intercepts for sure so that that's about as far as i would require to go again you'd have to distribute if you want a polynomial now the degree four what does that mean and why is it relevant the degree four actually saves you work here's the the point of doing this what we want is if you have a degree four then you should have at most four factors one two three four four factors that have variables any more than that and you would have a degree that's higher than four so imagine remember our fake distribution i hope you remember we did in last two videos if you were to distribute this you would take x x x and x that's x to the fourth power that matches our degree what it does is it prevents you from doing things like this it prevents you from putting in some factors that are irreducible quadratics and wouldn't give you any more x-intercepts you know what in the world does that mean for instance if i allowed this to be anything but a degree four if i said let's make it a degree i don't care well i could start tacking on some irreducible quadratics like x squared plus nine x squared plus 9 hopefully it doesn't come as a shock to you is not factorable that's not x squared minus 9. it's not a difference of squares it's called an irreducible quadratic which means you cannot factor it any further than that over the real number system now we allow complex numbers sure but we're not talking about that yet uh we can't factor it it's not going to give us any more x-intercepts you can try you want you go uh how's that factor well x plus 3i and x minus 3i is 3i and x intercept no it's not is it zero yes but it's complex zero so it's not what we're talking about here in terms of the real number system that's not really allowed as far as graphing on our x-axis the way we're normally used to so what would that do this function would have these as it's only for real x-intercepts this would do it but notice why the degree four is there if i allowed that that would be now degree one two three four five six that would be a degree six do the fake distribution in your head right now make sure that i'm right you take x x x x and x squared that would be a degree 6 polynomial once you're done well that's not what we asked for that's a degree 4. so if we didn't have that statement of degree 4 you'd be allowed to multiply as factors these irreducible quadratics that wouldn't give you any other x intercepts and you could do it all day long uh x squared plus five and keep on going x squared whatever doesn't factor and you would have these degree however much you wanted that would still only have four x intercepts that's what the degree four is therefore is to make sure that you're not degree four is therefore make sure you're not doing too much work and adding things in there that um that wouldn't change your x intercepts but would certainly be much more complicated of a graph which is why this one i told you was a little bit incomplete of a problem you see this says suppose we have x-intercepts of just these four well this would be a function but i could also put on some irreducible quadratics and not be wrong there's many different answers to that any constant would make a function with those x-intercepts any irreducible quadratic would not make any additional or alter those x intercepts this x squared plus 9 does not change the fact that we only have one two three four x intercepts it would change the look of your graph for sure so would the coefficient of any sort of constant we change the look of your graph for sure but it would not change the x-intercepts so that's really the whole rundown start with your x-intercepts make some factors equal to zero make them factors using the zero-product property in reverse call it a function and you're done just don't overwork so if you have a degree four you should have at most four at most four factors that's that's about it you can't have less than that but i'll show you how the degree should match up so we deal we do our work we sort of do our fake distribution to make sure that we're right here's one two three four x's that's a degree four so four factors with uh x to the first power and each one and we know that we're right put a little a out front and you're good to go all right let's move on to the next couple so we have some multiplicity up here are they any harder no they're really not i just want to show you what to do with the multiplicity and how that works into the powers of our factors so we're going to reverse we say hey this really only has two distinct x-intercepts we would have x equal one and x equals two all right that says here's our zeros x equals one and x equals two what about the multiplicity we deal with that later and then we check our degree so what we're gonna do is we're gonna say every time we have an x-intercept it should come from some factor we find that factor by setting our one side equal to zero and that says hey if that's true then this came from something by the zero product property that be x minus one would be a factor and x minus two would be a factor of some polynomial set equal to zero and that's great it says here's our x intercepts cool subtract one and subtract two this would be a factor and this would be a factor that's where our x-intercepts would have to come from now is where we deal with the multiplicity if you remember from i don't know it was last video before that we talked about multiplicity as the power from of the of the factor from where we got our x intercept so these are x intercepts they come came from some factor that factor has an exponent to it it's either one or two or three it's not zero because then we wouldn't have that factor but it's some sort of integer remember polynomials can't be fractions or negatives some sort of positive whole number integer included typically is possibly including zero but we're never going to see that so our multiplicity basically tells us how many times that factor is repeated and so we just have to read it so here's our x equals one cool we built a factor from it and now we're going to look at our multiplicity this says this factor has a multiplicity of one it's not repeated more than one time so you have this you could put a one there we're not going to but that's where that number is coming from now x minus two this is here's our x-intercept here's our factor and it said x equals two has a multiplicity two that means that it was repeated it was a repeated zero repeated root repeated x-intercept that means it had to have a power two there that multiplicity 2 is the exponent of the factor from where you got your x-intercept so go into reverse you have your x-intercept build your factor and then put the multiplicity on after the fact now that's our that's our polynomial as long as we write this in function form this is one of many polynomials that has these as x-intercepts with the appropriate multiplicity the appropriate repeatedness of those roots you see if we took this and said hey x minus one equals zero cool x minus two equals zero you'd have another one x minus two and x minus two that's a repeated root and that's where the multiplicity is coming from that's what that's saying to you is that that zero has been repeated now i also mentioned something that your degree is something you'll wanna check so this should be a degree three this should have at most three factors now this only has two sort of it has one and it has one that is repeated that really counts as three doesn't it so x minus one x minus two and x minus two that's three factors three linear factors you will have at most the degree number of factors if you have irreducible quadratics you'll have less than that we're going to get into that in several more videos where if you allow complex numbers you'll have exactly the same number of factors as your degree if you have complex numbers that you're working on and you factor you'll have the same number of factors as your degree you'll have at most the degree number of factors if you're working over reals those those uh irreducible carbon quadratics sort of mess that up a little bit so we're going to fake distribute we're going to make sure that we match our degree we're going to put a little a out front to represent this like a family of curves so if we check it out we'd say hey this factor would give us x and if we fake distribute this the biggest power we get out of this would be x squared hey x to the first times x to the second is x to the third that would be our leading term that matches our degree and that we know that that's correct the only last thing we're going to do is say that any coefficient any constant well any coefficient that those are technically constants anyway if it does as long as i have a variable in it that's not going to affect those x intercepts one bit so the last one let's go ahead and work through this real quick you probably should try this on on your own um one thing that you can do just really quickly this typically works pretty well look at your degree and count up your multiplicities and they should usually match up the only time they wouldn't is if you have a hidden degree in there or they're not giving you multiplicity so then you'd want to match your factors to that degree so if you have an irreducible quadratic that can mess it up but usually you don't see that so here's one two three four five six seven eight nine oh hey my multiplicity matches my degree that's great that's really what we're looking for then what we're going to do is we're going to take all of our x-intercepts that they've given us be careful here sometimes we go too fast and we go oh yeah x equals negative two and we see the one we go x equals one just make sure that you're setting your x equal to the x intercept and not accidentally the multiplicity it happens okay so i'm going to double check x equals negative two got it x equals five got x equals zero got it and x equals positive one half got it so i'm not worried about the multiplicity right now that comes as the factor is the power of the factor we're about to create so we're going to make sure that we have zero on the right-hand side of all of these four equations i need to talk about this one in just a minute uh so let's see uh x plus two cool we added two x minus five subtract five x equals zero is good and x equals negative one half equals zero these right here are the four factors of a polynomial that would have these x-intercepts we're going to use the multiplicity to make sure that we have the same degree it's given it to us we just don't need to use it appropriately so we're going to go ahead we're going to write this out i'm going to put the x first it really doesn't matter the order but by using the zero product property we're saying these factors are all equal to zero therefore if i multiply them together that product would still be equal to zero and this is one function that if i were to set it equal to zero that's how we find x-intercepts as we said a function is zero right so if we're doing that to find x-intercepts why not go in reverse and say hey a function that looks like this would have those x-intercepts now i told you a couple things about it number one we're going to deal with the multiplicity number two i said i need to talk about this a little bit and number three we're going to put an a out front because we haven't been given a specific point to have a specific or unique polynomial here we have a family of curves so any a out front any coefficient out front positive or negative doesn't matter you would have exactly the same x-intercepts we also have to match the degree so the degree is important because otherwise we could add on any irreducible quadratic and still not have altered those x-intercepts um however it is important for us to understand what that multiplicity does as far as a balance hopefully you remember this that an even multiplicity will bounce or touch and an odd will cross at those x intercepts it's really important for graphing so let's go very carefully and make sure that we have this correct so we know that the x plus 2 factor has a multiplicity of two so i'm gonna work myself down x plus two has a multiplicity two so i write my exponent of two uh x minus five so that's our our x intercept of five x minus five factored has a multiplicity of one i'm not going to write anything right there i don't need to the zero the x equals zero x intercept the factor of x has a multiplicity of three and the one half x equals one half also has a multiplicity of three we can fake distribute in our head just a really easy way to find a leading term is to take your factors and your coefficient that have x's in them and multiply the largest power that you would get if you were to distribute so x to the third x squared x and x x to the third so next to the third five six seven eight nine so we know that our degree matches here so if you were to distribute this you would have an a x to the ninth as your leading term that ninth power would be the largest one you could possibly get if you were to distribute this and that matches with that degree that's how we would check your work so here's the last thing i want to say this factor can look different i need you to hang on for this because people get kind of weirded out when you get to uh like synthetic division and then you have fractions flipping around wait a minute i thought my my factor was 2x minus 1. yeah it is it's also x minus one-half because that's the same there are two ways to go about getting that factor let me show you on that side another way that you could get that factor is by undoing that fraction rather than subtracting it if you multiply both sides by two you would get two x equals one and if you subtract one you would get two x minus one equals zero you know well which one is better it depends on the case um it doesn't really matter but what i'm trying to tell you is that the factor of x minus one half and the factor of two x minus one are identical set them both equal to zero and solve it and you're going to get positive one-half as your x-intercept so whichever one you want to use is fine but i will tell you that for synthetic division that doesn't work and this one would if you needed to divide a polynomial by a factor you wouldn't really want the two there if you did you'd have to do long division polynomials which isn't a huge headache i'm going to show you both ways anyway but i just want to make you aware of that so that when you get there you're like why the minus one half like why do we need that for synthetic division it's because you can't have an a that's not one or well let's say that a coefficient of x that's not one so that's about it so we're taking x-intercepts we're finding factors by making zero on one side using the zero product property in reverse and then making a function out of it understanding one thing man you need to get it that if you do not have a specific point that's off of the x-axis like a y-intercept or something like that that you cannot say that this is the only function it's a one of many all of all of whom with a different coefficient would give you the same x-intercepts make sure your degree matches what they're telling you so you're not allowed to add or sorry multiply have any factors at a factor of irreducible quadratics that would not change your x-intercepts it would just um make your function much more complicated by the way this i think i gave you x squared plus 9. keep in mind that x squared minus 9 is not an irreducible quadratic you could factor that it would give you additional x-intercepts so that's certainly not allowed the degree allows you it's kind of prevents you from multiplying by any irreducible quadratics so we're going to come right back we're going to have some kind of same idea but using graphs and i'll show you how you can find a specific polynomial if you do have a point that's off of your x-axis okay now that we have an idea of what to do when we're given x-intercepts we can use them to find factors use zero product property create some sort of a polynomial where we normally should be distributing but that is a family of curves that has the same x-intercepts and matches the degree that we're given now we're going to do that from graphs it's a very similar idea but the multiplicity is not expressly given to you you have to read the graph also a lot of times we can find a point that's not on the x-axis to make it so that we can find a specific polynomial and not a general one so so basically we solve for the a i'm going to show you how to do that in the last two examples so let's take a look at it if we're able to find x-intercepts then we can find factors and then we can find a polynomial that has those x-intercepts that would match our graph now we can't match our graph exactly unless we know a point that's not on the x-axis that doesn't give it to us so typically we're looking for a y-intercept or something that they've marked and said hey this is the point 1 negative 8. well our y-intercept here is 0 that's not going to help us because that's on the x-axis to give it the the shape that we need to match you'd have to have a point that's not on the x-axis one that's on the x-axis you can sort of stretch this graph out and you wouldn't change that x-axis at all and that's why we need one off of it so here's the thought process what we're going to be doing is we're going to say okay what are our x-intercepts how is our graph behaving on them are we crossing or are we bouncing or touching that's going to determine multiplicity we're going to pick 1 for a cross we're going to pick multiplicity 2 for a bounce or a touch could we pick 4 or 6 yes we could but we're trying to keep it easy we're trying to create a function that has that x-intercept that's not like let's pick uh x minus 1 to the 7th power because it's odd and i know it crosses you could do that probably it's not going to match that graph a whole lot because when you start getting very large exponents you get super dynamic super crazy graphs i haven't even given you any markings on the y-axis because because this is a sketch but we're going to pick very easy numbers to work with one or two for a multiplicity for odd and even respectively so let's go through it our x-intercepts if we look an x-intercept is where our graph interacts with the x-axis it intersects it so either it crosses it or it bounces off of it our x's here are zero one and two and right now at this point you are exactly where we were if they were to just give you zeros or x-intercepts or roots like all right well you know what we know that these x-intercepts they have to come from factors and those factors would be set equal to zero if we were using the zero product property now that we have those set equal to zero we can use zero product property in reverse and say hey our factors would be x and x minus one and x minus two and our function would have this as its basic form now a couple things about it could you start adding in or multiplying some um some other like irreducible polynomials you you could irritable quadratics i'm sorry here's the quadratics here you could except for the fact that our turning points really suggest that we have a degree three uh so there's two turning points remember that the the number of turning points maximum turning points is one less than the degree so probably this is a degree three polynomial it has one two turning points local maxima or local minimum and that's what we're looking for this is probably a degree three so we're not going to be putting any strange factors in there we're going to keep it simple also we know that this was crossing crossing and crossing so those factors should have odd exponents now we could do something like x to the third and x minus one to the seventh then x minus two to the seven hundred eleven but why i mean if you wanna be fun about it i guess you could do that but we're not going to be doing that we're going to be keeping it simple saying hey if we have a crossing x intercept so where the graph crosses the x-axis at the x-intercept then we need an odd power otherwise you have this idea of being even in the neighborhood or sort of even at least you have the same sign in the neighborhood of that that that x-intercept here we have different signs so we're crossing right one's negative one's positive on that in that neighborhood around that x-intercept and so what we would have to have is an odd power to signify that we studied that in that a couple videos ago so we're going to say hey that's crossing let's leave this odd choose one that's crossing let's leave this odd that's one that's crossing with this odd that's one and so our function has to have an x factor and x minus one factor and an x minus 2 factor now we are not given a point off of the x axis and so this is one of many polynomials that could look that way as soon as we start altering our coefficient which in this case is one as soon as we start altering that we start getting not different x-intercepts but a different shape maybe it's more dramatic or maybe it's flatter maybe well it shouldn't be reflected that should be positive because otherwise oh man i hope you get this this is important right now if you distributed this you would have x to the third power as your leading term that end behavior would fit this if i start putting a negative in front that would be reflected i hope that makes sense to you our end behavior here actually fits that so we would probably leave it this way or at least say that that has to be a positive coefficient coefficient in the front without a point off of the x-axis you don't know for sure but we're going to leave it just like that if you have to distribute it to get the polynomial you would distribute these two first and then run the x through it on distribution let's move on to the next one so this is a little bit different in that we actually do have a point that's off of the x-axis we are going to be able to solve for the a here so in most cases you have an a and you go yeah that could be any number here not negative any number and it would fit there that's true now when we get this we're not going to have that so here's the way to start these number one what we're going to do is we're going to identify our x-intercepts so x equals negative 1 and x equals 1 and x equals 2. we're also going to identify a point off of the x-axis if we can this guy didn't have any but this has the point zero negative one now we go through the same process we go all right well if x equals negative 1 then x plus 1 has to be a factor and x minus 1 has to be a factor and x minus 2 has to be a factor of some polynomial also we're going to look at this this is probably a degree oh man really follow me on this one this is probably a degree three y it has one two turning points it ends in a sort of an opposite infinities idea it's not anything like this or like this it's ending like this it's end behaviors like that that has to be an odd degree if you're opposite infinities if you will uh that's an odd degree why is it three and not five it only has two turning points five most of the time is another turning point and there's some another two turning points in there somewhere so this is probably a degree three think through this use that critical thinking head that i know you have this is probably a degree 3. it probably has a negative degree 3. otherwise it would have looked like this like that one so this is probably a negative in front of a degree 3 polynomial keep that in your head so when we solve this if we don't have a negative in front of our factors we've probably done something wrong it has to mesh with this it's got to be that so we go all right here's our x-intercepts uh negative 1 1 and 2. cool find some factors x plus 1 x minus 1 x minus 2. let's build our polynomial so f x would have three factors in it x plus 1 x minus one and x minus two now is where we look for how that graph is intersect intersecting the x-axis is it bouncing is it or touching or is it crossing so we have a cross we leave this a power one across leave this to power one and across we've got a power one so we're picking odd powers because crossing x-intercepts have to have a multiplicity that is odd we're picking one so that we're making it easier we don't want to pick three or seven if we're five if we don't have to and we already determined that we should have a degree three why because it looks like a degree three i mean it's a horrible way to say that but it has two turning points probably it's going to be a degree three has the end behavior of a degree three and so we're going to leave this as one two three factors that have x's in it that's the most number of factors you can have for degree three now how in the world do we use the point that's off of the x-axis to find a specific function well you'd give it an a you'd see there's lots of polynomials that can have these three x-intercepts that's true there's lots of polynomials that can interact with a cross across and across that's also true there's lots of degree three polynomials it can look exactly like that except for that point that point makes a specific graph so if you have x intercepts and one point off of the x-axis you can find a specific polynomial and here's how to do it go through the same process we just did here's your x-intercepts here's your factors okay they're all crosses so make them odd exponents let's choose one give yourself an a saying lots of different polynomials but now if this is your x coordinate and this is your f of x coordinate your y coordinate sure but i'm going to use f of x because that's the output that we're talking about here if that's the case then you can fill out all of your x's with well in this case zero you can fill out your f of x with negative one and it will allow you to solve for your a so let's try that if i fill out my x's i'm gonna leave my a my x should be zero and my a should be sorry my f of x should be negative one let's simplify that let's see that's one negative one and negative two if we multiply this together that's positive two so 2 1 times negative 1 times negative 2 is 2 times a if we divide by 2 oh my gosh hey we solved a now all we need to do is say hey that a that we didn't know before now that we've used a piece of information about a point that's off the x-axis we don't have a general polynomial we don't have a family of curves anymore we have one specific curve all you need is one point off of that x-axis to determine a specific curve that would have those x-intercepts at least a degree three so now we say hey we know the a the a is negative one-half then we'd have those three factors and that's about it i hope that you um hope you understand that although this is this is not like super brain-bustingly hard math to do once you understand it but getting to understand it will absolutely very much help you when you start graphing things in calculus so getting the idea of oh that's what x-intercepts do oh that's how multiplicity affects the exponent of the factor oh wait a minute the point off of the x-axis will let me solve for that unknown coefficient that's huge i mean that's really really really helpful also understanding beforehand what's going to happen that's why i have you do those things so that you can predict what's going to happen and check your work we said that's probably a degree three why because that's two turning points it's probably a degree three one two three factors hey that's the most you have x times x times x is power three hey this end behavior is looks odd and it's a negative odd hey there's a negative in front if i distribute this this would have negative one half x to the third as a leading term it fits it fits the model that's why we do these things so we can understand more appropriately how these graphs behave makes us much more powerful when we get to things like calculus all right and that by the way just for the last time that's not a family of curves this is one specific polynomial that would be that exact graph so that that's kind of neat to be able to find that if you have to distribute again you'd start here distribute this once you simplify distribute this once you simplify it then distribute the negative one-half and you'll see that leading term in there right away it'll be negative one-half x to the third all right last one we're going to go through and then we're going to be done so how we start all the time if we're going from graphs to polynomial functions how we know it's a polynomial there's no weirdness here there's no asymptotes there's no gaps there's no holes there's no sharp points no cusps how we start this is by listing out our x-intercepts so our x-intercepts are x equals negative four x equals negative one and x equals three we got one here here and there even though it doesn't cross that's very important that says hey that's an x-intercept but wait wait it doesn't cross oh it bounces oh what's that mean for multiplicity you need to know that like what does that mean when we cross versus when we bounce as far as multiplicity because we're about to use it so we have our x-intercepts there's only three one two three we're going to list any points that we find that are off of our x-axis in our case the x the y-intercept i'm not exactly sure what that is don't guess at it find an actual point that is off of our x-axis in this case the y-x the y-intercept is not going to work for us this though 1 comma negative 8 that's a great point so we're going to be able to take our x-intercepts build some factors find a function and put an a in front of it and then use that point to solve for the a so when we build our factors we're going to have x plus 4 and x plus 1 and x minus 3 all equal to 0. we take care of the multiplicity in the next step so we're going to start building our our function we're going to say hey by the zero product property all of those three factors that are set equal to zero would still equal zero if i were to multiply them together they they'd have to uh by the zero product property now we're going to start taking care of our multiplicity um i yeah i didn't have to do the last two because we didn't have any bounces but now we go ahead and we do that so we're going to take a look at okay look at our intercept x equals negative 4 look at where this whether this crosses or bounces sometimes we say the word touches well this one crosses so i know that x equals negative 4 is an odd multiplicity so that factor has to have an odd exponent we're going to choose one now let's check out the next uh x-intercept x equals negative one this bounces or touches this but this does not cross so it bounces right off of that so it is an x-intercept but it has to have an even multiplicity that means the exponent of the factor that we got from that has to be even we're going to choose two so negative one here's our negative one here's our factor from that x equals negative one that factor is a bouncy and so it's gotta have a 2. could it be a 4 possibly but probably not why not well how many turning points does this have turning points are local minimums or local maximums so turning points are where we change from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing this has one two three turning points well that's three turning points then one more than that is potentially our degree so we say all right it probably has to have at least a degree four but it's probably not six or eight uh because it doesn't have more turning points so we'd say the the least degree this could have is four why because degree is always at least one more than your turning points why isn't it six well because we don't have that many turning points it's probably not that also this isn't as dynamic so i mean that'd be crazy or eight that'd be super crazy why isn't it odd look at your end behavior look at your behavior your end behavior says i'm even in fact it says i'm a positive even do you remember that odd even negative odd negative even so this is an end behavior that's a negative or sorry a positive even function so the reason why we don't have an odd mole well the reason why we don't have odds here is because this right here would have to have a degree that is even it has the end behavior before the reason why we're picking a two and not a four or something crazy is because our degree is probably four and if we start making a four here or six here we're going to be blowing up that degree okay last one so x equals negative 3 i know that's a cross so that's across e so that means that this x intercept gives us a factor that has an exponent that is odd i'm going to pick one so we know that our function is based on the following factors i'm giving myself an a so that i can solve for it so i know i'm going to be able to find a specific polynomial but i'm giving myself an a so that i allow an x and a y or an f of x and let me solve for something so i don't know what that coefficient is yet i know that it could be anything and have these x-intercepts but it can't be anything and so and be this exact graph that's where the point comes in hopefully getting the point um one last time just to make sure that you're you're with me before we wrap this thing up so while i have your full attention is that you should be thinking of what you're going to get before you do anything you should be thinking hey i've got one two three x intercepts i'm gonna have a multiplicity one because it crosses two because it bounces through one because it crosses i should have a degree probably four because it's even it has to be four or six or eight there's three turning points i have to be at least one more than that so four but it's probably not six or eight we try to keep it as simple as possible and still fit our model now we're going to go ahead and plug in our 1 for x and our negative 8 for f of x or our y so that would give us 1 plus 4 1 plus 2 and 1 minus 3. of course you don't want to forget about that square so let's see that's negative 40. 20 times negative 2 is negative 40. if we divide both sides by negative 40 we're going to get one-fifth you can also put 0.2 that's fine doesn't really matter but we have gone ahead and we've solved this this polynomial function we know exactly what it is now not a guess not a family of curves because with the point off the x-axis we know that this function is one fifth or point two x plus four x plus one squared and x minus 3. let's see if it messes with what we thought it was going to be we thought it was going to be a degree 4 is it a degree 4. one this would be x squared so two three four that would be x times x squared times x that's a degree four one fifth is positive so one fifth x to the fourth would be your leading term do your fake distribution one fifth x to the fourth point two x to the fourth um positive x so positive that's one fifth x to the fourth that's even that's positive even that's a degree four should have at most three turning points one two three it has our x-intercepts negative four uh negative one and three that's across e and bouncing across e there's a crossing bouncy crossing it works has the point one negative eight in it so we know right now that this is the exact function that would have this picture to it if you have to distribute it gets kind of nasty uh how you would do this take care of your exponents that are not one first so you do x plus one times x plus one distribute then distribute your linear factors over that and finally distribute your coefficient that one-fifth so i hope that makes sense i hope now you really really understand how multiplicity is used to create functions how we can find a specific function if we have a point off of the x-axis and if not we cannot do that so i know we've gone uh very very deep into this concept the reason why we do that i'm not trying to teach you just how to do this stuff i'm trying to teach you why it works and how you use in the future because if i can build that in there if you understand why it works man it makes your life so much easier when you actually get to calculus to use this stuff so i hope you're doing well i hope this is making sense and working for you and we will see in another video when we start sketching from scratch on some of these polynomials have a good day
