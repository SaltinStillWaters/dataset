Transcript for: How to Use Inverse Trigonometric Functions (Precalculus - Trigonometry 18)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to start talking about how to use some of the inverse trig functions that we need to be really really familiar with so namely sine cosine tangent and their inverses and one of the most important things to understand about them is their domains so on what domain sine has an inverse cosine has an inverse and tangent has an inverse and what the domains of those inverse functions actually are so i've done a couple things here real quick to make sure that we understand that so when we are when we started talking about those inverses of sine cosine and tangent we said that we had to restrict the x-axis that's the domain so we had to we had to cut it basically and say you know what this is only going to have an inverse if x is between negative pi over 2 and pi over 2 for sine and tangent including negative pi over 2 and pi over 2 for sine but not tangent because of those vertical asymptotes and between 0 and pi inclusive for cosine on those portions of the x-axis that's where an inverse function can be found well what that means is that if we're outside of that interval outside that domain we do not have the ability to use an inverse function and it's very very important that sine cosine tangent are restricted on those domains so that the inverses actually apply but likewise when we found our inverses the range for these functions became the domain for the inverse functions so basically the long story made short is if you're going to use sine inverse that x had better be between negative one and one and that x for cosine inverse it better be between negative one and one and that x for tangent inverse can be anything all real numbers because that was the range of tangent if you're going to find an inverse with these functions well your x is better and it better be defined on where that function actually had an inverse that was a big deal the other thing i wanted to point out is that with our trig functions the input is actually an angle and the output is a i say point here but i mean a coordinate of a point or ratio of coordinates on a unit circle that's reversed for inverse functions our input is a coordinate on a point of a point on a unit circle or a ratio of those those points and the output is the angle that gives us those coordinates or that ratio of some point that's what we mean here the other thing before we get really into it is do you remember i hope that you do do you remember that when we take a composition of a function with its inverse or an inverse with its function they cancel and that is the whole point about why these inverse functions are so relevant so necessary is because in order to solve equations with with a function you need the inverse of that function and if i can compose them i can cancel them and that's the point so in either case when you compose a function it's inverse or inverse of its function they're going to cancel you're going to get x and so what we're going to do now is we're going to take a look at what happens when you compose them but we're going to make very sure that this is solid in our minds about what has to happen so so here's the deal the inside function's domain must be met so here's here's what happens does sine inverse of sine of x cancel yes it does absolutely as long as this x is in the domain of that function that's the most important thing to check so this is going to cancel you're going to get x but that's only true if sine of x is go is somewhere between negative sorry if that x is somewhere between negative pi over two and pi over two so i've written that in such a way that you can see intervention you can also see a little bit inequality notation of that but basically what it says is yeah you know what if sine inverse of sine is actually the inverse of that if they're inverse functions this has to be on that part of the x-axis where we set it in receiving existed we said we had to cut it right well you better make sure you cut it correctly and that's what that's saying you have to be on that part that has an inverse same thing for cosine this is going to work it's going to simplify as long as that x is between the interval of 0 and pi that was the part of the x-axis where we said that the inverse even existed so think about that if we're outside of the part where we said inverse exists then inverse has no no relevance to it so we'd have to be on that section of the x-axis that we said this is where inverse happens because of that one-to-one portion of that function according to that interval that domain for tangent same thing happens an inverse will cancel the function that always happens whenever you compose an inverse of this function but it has to meet the domain so this domain where we cut that was negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. and that's saying the same thing that this does it says yes we have an inverse function for these things on that domain notice how they're all angles this is an angle on a unit circle angle angle and the outputs would be the coordinates the y coordinate the x coordinate or the ratio of y over x and that's what this is saying it's saying your angle must be on the part of that unit circle or the graph where we had a one-to-one function here here there that has to that has to be the case now when we reverse that when we find a different composition notice either way you go you're going to cancel it's true but you must meet the domain of the inside function so sine of sine inverse of x it is going to simplify you're going to get x but only where the domain of that inverse function is now remember with with inverse functions well the input is now a point the input is a point on the unit circle or a point on a graph and the output is the angle that gives you that or the x value on the x-axis that's true but here we go okay so our point is from negative one to one the output would be an angle that that makes sense here this is somewhere on your unit circle the y-coordinate can only be between negative one and one the x-coordinate cosine can only be between negative one and one the ratio of those two things could be anything and so what our domain is has to be met for us to use a composition we have to have inside functions domain met for inverse functions those are points that's between negative one and one the output of which would be an angle sine of an angle that's what that means it means that this is going to give us an angle and and this is only going to work if we're on the appropriate domain for cosine x and cosine oh sorry cosine of cosine inverse of x we get x and meaning the domain of inside function means you go from negative one to one you have to have that met in order for the inverse relationship to take place and lastly for tangent we can have any number so anything would work there why the domain and range switch angles became coordinates of points coordinates points became angles for their respective places in these functions the other thing that i wanted to talk about is that when you compose these and they do simplify and we've already checked our domain appropriately when we have those inverse functions inverses can be kind of tricky to deal with because we don't we sometimes want to misconstrue what they are an inverse trig function is going to give you out an angle that's the output so when you see sine inverse of something it is talking about an angle and so this should make absolute sense sine of something that gives you out an angle sine of an angle is actually appropriate that makes sense or likewise sine inverse is talking about in an input that is a a value sorry a y coordinate for a sine of a point so remember sine of x is going to give you a y coordinate sine inverse of a y coordinate actually makes sense so they have to match up in order for our the appropriate input to give us out the appropriate output what i mean by that is your sine of x has to give you an uh it has to take in an angle give you out a y coordinate sine number so that y coordinate therefore would be in the appropriate domain so they kind of work together long story made really short is make sure that you're inside function of your composition make sure that that domain is appropriate make sure that that value is in your domain so i'm going to pull up the unit circle here really quick and we're going to talk about how to use it in order to figure out some of these inverse relationships so let's practice a few let's just make sure that we get the hang of what an inverse function is talking about before we start doing a few compositions here now we talked about compositions but we'll get to some examples in a minute but just to get a feel of what this is doing so when you're asked sine inverse of zero i don't want you just memorize what to do i want you to understand what's going on so sine inverse of zero basically asks this question remember that sine inverse of zero is supposed to give you out an angle the input is a coordinate of a point what point the y coordinate is dealing with sine here so sine inverse says i want you to find me the angle that has a y coordinate of z of zero when that angle gives you that point so find a angle that has a y coordinate of zero for the point of the unit circle that's an opposite idea right so sine said here's your angle finding the y coordinate side number says here's a like coordinated find me the angle that's all it's really talking about now you can confirm that zero is on that interval so the input is is is on the appropriate domain that's great we're just looking for the angle so here's what we do go to unit circle and find out where the y coordinate is zero why why coordinate well that's sine and we're undoing sideway and we're inversion side so where's the y coordinate zero um here oh but also here this is the main problem man don't miss this this is the main problem on why we had to restrict the domain because we wouldn't have a one-to-one function and inverses would fail you'd say zero or pi that's a problem we can't do that we have to have one input and one output otherwise we don't have a function one input would give us two different outputs that's a real big problem this is exactly why we had to restrict our domain so here's the here's the whole point of this it says yes you're gonna you're gonna do this find me the angle that has a y coordinate of zero but you must be on the restricted domain so for sine and sine inverse you're looking from negative pi over two to pi over two just quadrants four and one or one and four however you want to think about that it must be here negative pi over two to pi over two so the question says find me the angle that gives me a y coordinate of zero but only on that portion of your x-axis or that portion of if you're talking about a graph or that portion of your unit circle so negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 says there's only one value that has a y coordinate of zero it's right there why only one because it's one to one on this portion it's one to one there's no repeated y values notice if i go past this i start repeating y values that's a problem that's why we had to restrict it that's exactly why we have that domain the way it is so when we look at this okay find sine inverse of zero says you're going to have have to find me an angle that has a y coordinate of zero that is on the restricted domain that we found that's going to be an angle of zero zero radians that's another thing so all of these are going to be in terms of radians keep that in mind all of the inverse functions are going to work on radians how about let's do cosine inverse of one cosine inverse of one says all right um well what's cosine deal with cosine deals with the x coordinate so what cosine inverse of 1 says is here is an x coordinate of 1. find me an angle remember this is asking for an angle is an output find me an angle that gives me an x coordinate of 1. well an x-coordinate 1 would be let's see right there that's an x-coordinate of 1. well it also has to be on 0 to pi so from zero to pi we're not talking about two pi we're talking about zero to pi so our exponent of one happens at an angle of again zero why does this have to take place on zero to pi and not two pi well that's how we restricted our vein our domain is restricted from zero to pi that's from here to here the x coordinate only is one at that exact point let's talk about tan inverse of negative one remember what these inverse functions say they're opposite of our original trig functions trig functions say give me in an angle i'll give you out a coordinate inverses say i'm going to give you a coordinate or a ratio coordinates i want you to give me the angle that makes that so this says i want you to give me an x a y compared to an x that is negative one i want tan inverse of negative one says the ratio of y range remember tangent is y over x is negative one give me an angle that makes the the y over x equal to negative one but also remember that we restricted this so our domain for tangent is negative pi over two to pi over two again we're looking just on this part of our unit circle just on this part of an x-axis means this part of your unit circle it's got to be from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 that's it just 1 and 4 or 4 and 1. so where would tangent be negative 1 well tangent of an angle gives me negative 1 when the y and x are the same but opposite signs well that would be root 2 over 2 divided by root 2 over 2 but that's positive or negative root 2 over 2 over root 2 over 2. oh that's negative so where tangent what angle would give me a tangent of negative one what angle would give me a y over x that equals negative one it would have to be negative pi over four now look not seven pi over four that would be all the way around that's not the idea tangent has to be from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. so for inverses your inputs must be coordinates or ratio of coordinates and your outputs must be angles but they have to be on the domain that you restricted hope that makes sense otherwise otherwise we're outside of that one-to-one nature of how we cut our domain we have to get one-to-one that's why we said exclude everything outside of this but if you exclude everything outside of this you are taking away most well at least half of your unit circle and that's what we've done here so tan inverse of negative one says i want my i want to find the angle where tangent of that angle gives me negative one that's negative pi over four let's keep on going so cosine inverse of negative 1 remember what inverses do inverses say i'm going to give you whatever an x coordinate is for this case this is cosine i want you to tell me the angle that gives me this x coordinate so cosine deals with x coordinate on a unit circle cosine inverse of negative 1 says find me the angle that has an x coordinate of negative one but keep in mind that you have to be on that you have to be on on that part of your your unit circle or x axis or this is your range basically isn't it so for for inverses domains this but range is that it's the inverse of our trig functions so the the easy way to do is go find me your x coordinate just make sure you're between the appropriate domain so x coordinate is negative one on zero to pi that would be pi so on that particular part of your your unit circle this would be pi cosine of pi equals negative one yeah so cosine inverse of negative 1 equals pi that's the way this works sine of 0 gives me 0 sine inverse of 0 is 0. okay cosine of 0 gives me 1 cosine of the angle 0 and radians always in radians is going to give you 1. so cosine inverse of 1 gives me 0. um it's an easier one to kind of think about tangent of negative pi over 4 is negative 1. so tangent inverse of negative 1 has to be negative pi over 4. they have to relate that way there can't be two options that's why we restricted the domain how a tangent inverse of zero so what this is asking is give me the angle where tangent of that angle gives me zero so tangent of what angle gives me zero so tan tan inverse of zero says your your your ratio of y to x has to be zero but you also have to be on that part of the unit circle from here to here where is tangent zero uh tangent of zero would be zero so tan inverse of zero is also zero what this is saying is that the ratio of y to x is only zero if your angle is zero that would be zero over one nowhere else on this interval would that be take place now if you did the whole unit circle that would take place here too so it'd be at zero and it'd be at pi that's why we had to cut it and say no no we can't have that we need it only on what to happen one time that's one to one so inverses make sense and you have these non-functions if you don't do that from here you probably could try a couple we're gonna do several more but i i really need to make sense so sine inverse of square root of 2 over 2 what that asks is give me the angle that creates this y coordinate of root 2 over 2. so for sine for for cosine for tangent think of the appropriate coordinate so sine relates to a y coordinate so sine number says your y coordinate is root two over two find that all right but keep in mind that we're only from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. that's what this that's why it was so darn important so from here to here finding the y coordinate the square root of 2 over 2. well that's here so this must be pi over 4. says what angle gives me a y coordinate y y and sine what angle gives me a y coordinate of square root of 2 over 2 that's pi over 4. what angle gives me a ratio of zero over whatever who cares that would be zero what angle gives me an x coordinate of negative one that's pi what angle gives me a y coordinate of zero that's zero what angle gives me an x coordinate of one that's zero what angle gives me a ratio of negative one over one that would be that angle that negative pi over four and that's that's how we're really thinking about this how about this one what angle gives me a x coordinate y x coordinate we need to know that cosine means x coordinate on your unit circle what angle that's what we're finding is going to give me an x coordinate of negative square root of 3 over 2. let's find that but keep in mind where we are we have to be between 0 and pi for cosine inverse so from zero to pi on this part coordinates one and two where is our x coordinate negative square root of three over two well here's a negative square root of three over two that's five pi over six i really hope that that is making sense to you i hope that you're seeing that the reason why we cut this the reason why and you saw it first with with a graph saying yeah you had to be one to one for inverses to happen but now you're seeing the practicality of that if we do not make those restricted as far as the domains then we would get two outputs for every input on an inverse that would be a problem we couldn't do that you see you can't it can't be okay to say hey what angle gives you an x coordinate that's negative square root of three over two and you go oh this angle and this angle because they both have negative square root of three over two that's not okay because this would be a non-function one input would give us two different angles two different outputs that's a big problem that's why we restricted it but that also means that sine and sine inverse only work on quadrants four and one and tangent and tangent inverse only relate on four and one and cosine cosine inverse only work together on quadrants one and two that's how these inverses have to work so the things to remember as you move forward is that with a trig function you plug in angle you get out a point with inverses you plug in a point and you find the angle that gives you that point that's important and you must always follow that domain so let's practice a couple more and we're going to start working on these inverse relationships all right let's do a few more so how about sine inverse of negative square root of three over two what it's saying is that i want you to find the angle that has a y coordinate sine relates to y sine inverse relates to y it's saying this is your y coordinate now if i mean the angle that gives me that but keep in mind where sine behaves as far as its inverse is concerned where it creates an inverse from negative pi over two pi over two so but then your heads are thinking yeah sine and sine inverse will only work really on the fourth and first quadrants so negative square root 3 over 2 so that we don't avoid this non-function idea where one input gives me two outputs because if i do not restrict this right now then you could do this you could say hey it's uh well let's see it would be here and here that word and cannot work when we're finding outputs that's why we restricted we said okay we need to make a choice right we need to cut this domain somewhere where it's one to one and so what we chose to do was negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. we could have chosen other other domains but we didn't we chose negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 because it tends to be the easiest one for us to work with so it says finding the y coordinate i got it here and here but only one of those will work on that particular domain where we cut this to find our inverse so yeah i'm just going to ignore this one i'm just going to work on this formula so our y coordinates this the angle that creates that is be careful it's not five pi over three that goes all the way around here it's negative pi over three from negative pi over two to pi over two you cannot break that rule so what that says is the angle that causes us to get a y coordinate of negative square root 3 over 2 but on that interval is negative pi over 3. that's the truth now how about sine inverse of negative square root of two over two the same thing applies this says i want you to find me the angle that causes me to get a y coordinate of negative square root of two over two negative square root two over two is here this is on our unit part of the unit circle for which our inverse is defined that's going to be negative pi over 4 not 7 pi over 4 negative pi over 4. now tangent's a bit harder why well because tangent's a ratio one of the things to uh that helps us out a little bit with our with our signs is understanding that that tangent is positive on our first quadrant only so if you have a tan inverse of something positive you're looking right here just like if we had a sine that's negative you're looking right here no nowhere else uh if we never use this quadrant for any of our inverses so it's just four and one for sine of tangent one and two for cosine cosine inverse how about tan inverse of the square root of three i don't see that anywhere well that's because tangent relates to a ratio so we really have to think about this this says find me the angle that creates for me a ratio of y to x of square root of three here's the the way that i do this um if it has a square root of 3 in it and it's not square root of 3 over 3 what i would typically do is see what ratio causes me to cancel out something that's not a square root i know that sounds a little weird but i'm looking for square root of 3 on the numerator because i know i don't get a fraction and we're dividing by one half so how i'm thinking about it is and you can guess and check your way through it i'm thinking about it tangent is positive here my my coordinates are positive both positive here i know tangent is defined only here so i'm looking at quadrant number one and i'm thinking what ratio of y to x is going to give me square root of three it's not this one one half divided by square root of three over two is going to give me one over the square root of three but square root of three over two divided by one half that one half is going to cancel you're gonna get the square root of three might take a little bit of time and work but the angle that's needed is pi over three tangent of pi over three is going to give you the square root of three therefore tan inverse of square root of three is pi over 3. this is often times where one of those tables comes in handy you get a table of just your value common values it puts this on like a a chart and that is very nice to have so if you have that that's great you can also use that as well now how about tan inverse of square root of three over three you know that's that's even harder yeah that's right that's because it's been rationalized so we maybe guess our check gets to check our way through it but please keep this in mind tan inverse of square root of three over three says the ratio of your y to x has to be square root of 3 over 3. find me the angle that gives you that more than that this is positive so you must be in quadrant 1 right now satisfying that but in quadrant one because that's giving you positives so we'd say all right uh let's see square root of three over three one half divided by square root of three over two the twos are going to cancel you're gonna get one over the square root of three if you rationalize it it will end up giving you square root 3 over 3 and so our appropriate angle is pi over 6 here those might take you a bit of time but i'm hoping you understand the idea this is asking the reverse question of our original trig functions original trig said here's your angle find me a coordinate or a ratio of coordinates inverses say here's a ratio of coordinates find me the angle that makes that but you have to restrict your domain again sine is here and sine inverse works here cosine works 0 to pi and tangent inverse negative pi over 2 pi over 2 but not including those endpoints so hopefully this makes sense i hope that i've explained this a little bit to you right here what about the ones that don't work on the inner circle like sine inverse of 1 8 you go what in the world what's what's that mean now think about it sine inverse of 1 8 says your y coordinate would be 1 8. now is it on a unit circle yes it is yes it's somewhere but it's not in one of these common values so 1 8 a y coordinate 1 8 would be like right there so it's maybe right there not very high this would be a positive angle but not a very big one according to zero use your calculator for this but oh my goodness please make sure that you are in radians you have to be in radians so sine inverse of 1 8 you're going to get like 0.125 notice they're approximate these are not exact very few of them are actually exact unless you plug in something that's a very common angle like that uh cosine inverse of the square root of two over three now that's that's tempting you want to make you want to say oh it's this one it's not it's not that one it's square root of two over three not square root of three over two so don't jump to conclusions here what this would say is what where would your x coordinate be square root of two divided by three that's like oh man like 0.5 or something it's somewhere over here it is positive though right this is a positive x coordinate it's somewhere here it'll be somewhere between zero and pi over two is termed in terms of your radians it's 1.08 roughly lastly we can do the same thing with tangent inverse you'll also notice that we have met our domain this is somewhere between i'll look at it our domain had to be negative 1 to 1 negative 1 to 1 and anything for tan inverse so 1 8 is between there square root of 2 over 3 that's between negative 1 and 1 negative 3 that's between negative infinity infinity and if we use our calculator in terms of radians and say tan inverse of negative 3 we're going to get about negative 1.25 so i hope we've made it clear i hope it made clear that the inputs for inverse functions are coordinates or ratios coordinates their outputs are angles asking what angle gives me that coordinate so we're going to come back and then look at the composition so we talked about that a little bit but now we're going to focus on that so when can you do it what happens if you're outside of this domain what do you do then so we'll be back in just a second all right let's try a few compositions they're actually not that bad there's a couple cases where some weird things happen we have to change a couple things about it not a big deal but here's the main thing to understand when you compose a function and its inverse they will cancel provided you've met the appropriate domain so here's the only thing you have to check make sure you have an actual composition that works so sine inverse of sine or sine of sine inverse and and likewise for cosine and tangent and make sure the domain of the inside piece fits with what you're trying to cancel so let's let's take a look at it again this always works so function with an inverse composed or inverse of the function compose always cancel what's that mean is that take a look at cosine inverse of cosine this is going to cancel provided that is in the domain that we want for inside function or we can change it to something which is kind of prefaces or foreshadows where we're going with it so here's what we're going to do cos cosine inverse of cosine says as long as this is on the domain of cosine where we restricted this to find an inverse function we can cancel this right now so look at your inside function cosine okay check out the domain of cosine zero to pi so remember we restricted cosine so the inverses work but only on that domain well 4 pi over 5 it's between 0 and pi it's positive it's less than pi and how do we know that it's not on my unit circle it doesn't have to be this works all the time so i said that this works all the time doesn't even matter where that's at but if you think about four pi over five four pi over five five pi over five would be pi well it's positive and not yet pi so it's somewhere in here somewhere in quadrant two who cares does it really matter what matters is that cosine inverse of cosine you for your inside function of cosine this is on the domain that we restricted to find inverse function what that means is this is gonna cancel and give you exactly four fifths pi four fifths higher or four pi over five if you want and that's that's all we really are doing we're checking to make sure the domain fits of our inside function and then these inverses will cancel our functions if they match up so sine inverse of sine of negative three pi over seven check your inside function sine is restricted to negative pi over two to pi over 2. as long as this fits as long as this is somewhere on there you're going to cancel this that's what we really want to do so where is negative 3 pi over 7 well negative 3 pi over 7 is negative so it's this way three pi over seven well that's um that's three well three pi cut into seven parts or maybe think about it this way 3.5 of out of 7 would be this so we're somewhere in here 3.5 pi over seven if you if you kind of think about it weird like that would be somewhere right here it would be exactly there so negative three pi over seven is it's in that interval if you want to do some calculated work and estimate this here's the point is that this only works if that is on that check your inside function make sure your argument meets your domain it is negative 3 pi over 7 is somewhere between negative pi over two and pi over two if that's the case then the inverse works and you can cancel it so do compositions of functions the inverses always cancel out yes they do as long as the domain of the inside function is is legit basically um so this was on that that's the function that's the the restricted domain that we needed for cosine therefore you cancel this was on that that's a restricted domain we have for sign so you cancel them what happens when it's not for instance negative pi over 3 is clearly not on zero to pi hey cosine was restricted to zero pi so on your inside function you're trying to cancel out this has to be on the domain that you restricted to be able to find the inverse do you see why that why that has to be that way if you're not on that domain where you said an inverse exists the inverse doesn't exist for that so you have to change it somehow so what in the world do we do well we can do a couple fancy things with it number one thing we can do is use even an oddness so if we have cosine of negative pi over three cosine's an even function what that means is that cosine of negative pi over three and cosine of pi over three are exactly the same so here's what this is doing we're not doing magic what we're saying is cosine inverse of cosine of negative pi over 3 is going to be the same thing as cosine inverse of cosine of pi over 3. because these are equivalent you're making that change um here here's what we're going to do i know it seems almost like we're cheating like why should people do that if inverses didn't exist the inverse doesn't exist because if you if you don't have a restricted domain because you start doubling up outputs and therefore when you when you reverse this to an inverse an input gives you two outputs it's not even a function so what we're doing here is we're saying okay let's take a look at maybe taking the same output and saying it would fit here on this restricted domain remember they all repeat every so often the period and so that's basically what we're doing here is saying yeah you know what we're just took a look at the the excluded values and seeing what they would be on our interval that we restricted there's another way to do it here's another way to do it if you find out what your x coordinate is for something that's outside of your domain just find something on your domain with the same x coordinate for cosine i'm going to show you right now so the first thing i did was cosine is even you can basically change signs use that evenness and you're okay what about negative pi over 3 we did a different way negative pi over 3 is right here it has an x value or x coordinate of one half find another angle on the domain for what you restricted to get your inverse function that has that same value for the chord you're looking at so for cosine remember cosine's x so find the x coordinate for cosine of negative pi over 3 one half find me something on that interval with the same x coordinate so that interval is somewhere over here finding this x coordinate somewhere here well that's uh that's right here that's right wait a minute that's pi over 3. that's true cosine of negative pi over 3 and cosine of pi over 3 have the same x coordinate that's why they're equivalent cosine only relates to the x coordinate who cares what angle it is as long as it's on the interval and has the same x coordinate it will work out and so as long as we've made this somehow into that interval they're going to simplify and this will give you pi over 3. you just have to make it on the interval first that's the biggest deal how about cosine inverse of cosine of negative five pi over three but where's negative five pi over three oh my gosh well negative five pi over three is one two three that would be negative three pi over three four five wait a minute five so look at this negative five pi over three has an x coordinate of one half pi over three has an x coordinate of one half what does that mean well if negative five pi over 3 is a negative rotation well wait a minute our interval is from 0 pi you can't even have negative angles but that coterminates with pi over 3 find an angle with the same coordinate of what your what you have here that's outside of your domain and get what this does what this does is takes your oscillating function that we we looked at it goes back and forth and says if you have something outside of that domain that you restricted it's going to relate to something on that domain that you did restrict it's going to say yeah that that um that pi over three gives us an output of one half and a negative five pi over three is the output of one half you're just looking at where it fits on the interval that you restricted it's kind of like a phase shift uh really you're kind of moving it to that point and so we go negative five pi over three is this that has an x coordinate one half let's just take something on 0 to pi that has the same coordinate that's pi over 3. so this is identical to that we just need to make sure we fit the domain of the inside function as soon as that happens inverses are going to cancel your function and this is pi over 3 also i hope you see why it's important some students who don't get this just go oh they always cancel i'm going to get negative 5 pi over 3. how how can you do that when that's outside the domain that doesn't even make sense really so we need to make sure that we're fitting the domain of the inside function all right let's take a look at a couple more these ones really are tricky we're not going to be meeting our our domain over inside function we're going to have to change some things and one of the ways to do it is again just look at look at where your y coordinate would be for sine or your x for cosine or the ratio for tangent so let's take a look at sine inverse of sine sine of nine pi over eight oh my gosh that is not on the domain of negative pi over two pi over two hopefully you understand that's outside of it so let's see where this is 9 pi over 8 do you see that that's 1 pi over 8 past pi so what what pi is from here to here so this is pi 9 pi over 8 would divide pi of eight spots and go nine of them so it's one more than that so nine pi over eight is like one and one eighth pi one two three four five six and eight and then one more nine pi over eight would be somewhere in quadrant three let's say right there i'm not being exact but let's just say that hopefully that makes sense to you you cut this pie into eight eight pieces and you count nine of them so one two three four five six seven eight that would be nine pi over eight that's this angle right there nine five right now here's the deal whenever we did this with the actual unit circle like five minutes ago what we did is we found an angle with the same y value we found an angle with the same y value so what would that y value be that y value would be now again y y well that sign gives you the y so the y coordinate of 9 pi over 8 is going to be right here this height well if sine relates to the y let's find something on the domain of sine for where we found the inverse that negative pi over 2 pi over 2 that has the same y coordinate so here's what we're thinking if this is the y coordinate let's let's say that height i want something over here that has the same y value it's not going to be up here that would be positive y would be like that well what angle would that be on this interval of the unit circle well let's see if this is nine pi over eight that would be negative pi over eight remember that this was eight pi over 8 and this was 1 pi over 8 past pi that was 1 2 3 5 7 8 and then 1 1 pi over 8 after that these would have the same y value i hope you see that i hope you see that the height of this would be whatever this y coordinate is that would have the same thing if this angle is 9 pi over 8 then this would be negative pi rate and have the same exact y coordinate this is one way that we can not cheat but you use our our understanding of the this um kind of uh symmetric nature of the y-axis on that so sine inverse of sine of nine pi over 8 would be the same as sine inverse sine of negative pi over 8. why we had to do it was this is not on the domain this is on the domain that we restricted as soon as it happens as soon as you make it on your domain they will cancel and that would give you negative pi over 8. let's talk about tangent tan inverse of tangent of 4 pi over 5 firstly locate wherever this angle is so look at your look at your inside function locate where that is on the domain if it's in your domain you're good to go if it's not like we did just here this was outside the domain this was our domain that we needed for the inside function we were all the way over here uh what do you do about that well you have to figure out the same y coordinate on on your domain and this would be negative pi right that's why we did that for tangent tangent also says you need to be in here somewhere 4 pi over 5 is well let's see if we cut pi into 5 pieces remember we're not counting that one one two three four cuts makes one two three this is one piece four five four pi over five would be here 4 pi over 5 would be there that would be that that angle so what we need to do is figure out a ratio that's the same for the y according to the x well now our y value according to our x value would be well what would it be positive or negative think hard about that where is this point right now this angle is 4 pi over 3 but that point has a positive y and a negative x so if i wanted to find something that's on our domain this is outside of it i need to be from here to here that i'm going to have to pick something with a negative ratio positive y negative x this is positive y and a negative x for that point i'm going to need a positive x and negative y if i want to get the same sign but be on my domain that would be negative pi over 5. so negative pi over 5 is going to have the same exact ratio as 4 pi over 5 does when you're talking about tangent only this time negative pi over 5 is actually on that domain for the inside function that we need and because of that now we can allow that inverse to cancel the function so the whole long story condensing it a little bit is that your inverses only work if you meet the domain that's required of them for tangent sine and cosine you have a very specific domain for sine you must have negative pi over 2 pi over 2 you have to be somewhere on that part of your unit circle for cosine of 0 to pi you have to be somewhere on that unit circle we'll be able to change there tangent same thing negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 or be able to change a an equivalent relationship on that part of the unit circle so if your angle is outside of that you got to change to it somehow and it doesn't have to be easy this i don't think this is easy this takes a lot of thought to say nine power rates here the same y value would be reflected would be there that would be negative pi rate this ratio would be whatever this angle is the ratio would be reflect that you're going to have that exact same ratio it's negative pi over 5. you're going to like these so when we go backwards it's actually a lot easier why because if it does not fit the domain you just can't do it so when we're going to take a look at sine of sine inverse cosine cosine inverse so you'll see that switch the the switches now we're finding if they're both inverses of each other when you take that relationship but sine of sine inverse you must fit the domain of the inside function when we reversed it did sine inverse of sine if that was outside of the domain when we restricted we can move it because of the way that it oscillates because the way it cycles we can we can sort of adjust it and say what would a point be with the saint or what would an angle be with the same y uh coordinate or x coordinate or ratio but here we can't do that and you'll see why when we get to some that are not possible in this case all we have to do is check whether or not we fit the domain of the inside function if we do you can do it it will simplify remember either way you go a function simplifies with its inverse inverse simplifies with its root function so sine of sine numbers that's going to cancel as long as that is on the domain of what that needs to make it happen so side inverse says you got to be between negative 1 and 1 all right is 1 4 between negative 1 and 1. yeah so it fits these cancel and you get one four cosine of cosine inverse of negative two thirds the inside functions cosine inverse is this on the domain cosine number says you need to be between negative one and one is negative two thirds between negative one and one yeah so it fits the domain of the inside function cosine of cosine inverse therefore can cancel as long as you fit the domain it will simplify remember that whenever you do simplify you get whatever's on the inside so function of its inverse is you're going to get that x this is your inside step that is your argument so when a function cancels its inverse your inverse cancels a function you're going to get the argument whatever was in there how about tangent of tan inverse of negative two let's take a look at that domain for tan inverse so domain of inside function says you've got to be between negative infinity and infinity we're probably good to go yeah negative 2 is between there that means that this satisfies the domain that means the function and its inverse can relate to another on that domain and you're going to get negative 2. when they cancel they cancel for good this is also how we're going to solve some equations later involve trig functions or inverse trig functions now what happens when it doesn't work sine of sine inverse of negative 2 remember you must fit your domain of your inside function sine inverse says you have to be between negative one and one what if you're not then this is not defined you know why not because the the premise fails and here's the premise think about this for a second really think about it sine inverse of negative two says give me an angle that has a y coordinate of negative 2 on the unit circle and you go there is no coordinate of negative 2 on the unit circle i know that's why this fails if you pull out your inner circle right now and you look to say give me a white chord a negative two there's not one you can't get one and so this says there's no way to find this it's completely outside not not just the domain it's outside the range of sign you can't give me an angle that gives me an output of negative 2. it's impossible to do and therefore this fails and we say that's not defined i'm just going to do that but you can write undefined not defined whatever you want to do same thing would happen with cosine of cosine inverse of negative of 1.3 cosine inverse needs negative 1 to 1. 1.3 is outside of that so this says find me an angle that gives me an x coordinate on a unit circle of 1.3 you go wait the biggest x coordinates are one i know and so there's no angle that does that cosine needs an angle if there is no angle then you can't do it just like sine needed an angle this angle was impossible so it can't answer that question this is why it was so important to make sure that you meet your domain of your inside function whether we have an inverse for inside function or whether we had a normal trig function for the inside of that function the thing about what we did before is that with your unit circle because of the period of a normal trig function it oscillates and it repeats and so oftentimes we can manipulate that sort of massage that to work but you cannot do that for your inverse trig function so if it's in the domain great cancel out you're good if it's not then you're done it's undefined you can't go any further so i hope that made that make sense to you we don't do this very often what we do more often is um is use this to find inverses what you're going to do in the next video and then solve things with this and so i'm going to show you exactly how that happens but the biggest idea that i get across is whenever you have inverses being composed they cancel we're going to use that to our advantage to take inverses of both sides of an equation and they're going to cancel for us but you have to have the domain of your inside function match up with this if your inside function is one of your normal trig functions or this if it's an inverse function if this doesn't work it's not possible if it's outside of this you can change it using a period or using kevin the last two things that we did is find an appropriate y value on the part of the unit circle so if it's outside of your domain that you needed to restrict to make this inverse thing even possible you have to find the appropriate coordinate or ratio coordinates on the portion of the unit circle that is defined for your inverse that's a big deal hope that makes sense and i'll see you for another video when we start talking about how to find inverses of trig functions
