Transcript for: Introduction to Solving Logarithms and Exponentials (Precalculus - College Algebra 57)
welcome to another video in this video we're going to talk about just an introduction to how to solve logarithmic and exponential equations just a quick preview of what it takes when you can't find common bases we're going to explore a lot more in future future videos but right now i want the idea to get in your head of how to approach solving an equation when you have logarithms and when you have exponentials so here's the rundown number one thing whenever we see an equation with logarithms or exponentials the first thing we're going to check is if i can make it to have common bases with logarithms what that's going to mean for you is that you have a log on one side and a log in the other with the same exact base and we can just set the insights or the arguments equal to one another we're going to see that in a future video with exponentials that means that we might have to manipulate a little bit and we've done that before where we say hey this is an exponential equation let's get the same base and if we can then exponents are equal we're not going to talk about that because we've already done that in a previous video right now is if you don't have common bases what in the world do you do so here's what we're going to learn in this video if you have logarithms in your equation and you don't have two of them you just have one logarithm and a constant what we could know is that we can take any logarithm and change it into some exponential it's inverse and in doing so we're going to solve that logarithm so in your head i need you really thinking with the exception of common bases if i see a logarithm i'm using exponentials to solve it because that is the inverse just like addition is to subtraction exponentials are two logarithms they undo one another and so we're going to practice that when we get to exponentials with the exception of common bases if you have an exponential you're going to be using logarithms to solve it so when we see exponentials we're going to use a logarithm it's inverse and by writing an exponential in a logarithmic form we're going to be able to solve that exponential logarithms are two exponentials as subtraction is to addition they undo one another so let's practice that right now so i'm going to model this as we go through these are very very quick we're just getting a feel for it understanding that exponentials are going to solve logarithms and the next part of the video logarithms are going to solve exponentials so let's take a look at it log base 2 of 2x plus 1 equals 3. so here's the thought process going through number one thing we're going to check if we have common bases now for logarithms what that means is we need a log on one side and a log on the other we don't have that after that we're going to look for logs and if we have a log we're going to isolate so we have a log on one side nothing else around it and some sort of a constant on the other which is what we have here so we have a log base 2 of 2x plus 1 equals 3. once we have that log isolated we have our base identified what we know is that logarithms have separated the base from the exponent if we write this in exponential form it will put it back together so if our base is 2 and our exponent is 3 our exponential could be written as 2 to the third power equals 2 x plus 1. that in general is how exponentials work they look at a logarithm they take the base and the exponent that's a logarithmic separate of those two things and it puts it back together and notice that this is something that's pretty nice for us to solve we can take a look at and go oh well now that i have this in exponential form i know what two to the third is two thirds eight two x plus one it's really easy to solve we can subtract one and then divide by two so x equals seven halves as long as what you solve for does not create a negative inside your argument you need to remember that that our arguments have to be positive our domain for logarithms is strictly greater than zero so if we ever have a solution that causes zero or a negative when you plug it in that's an invalid solution typically it happens when you have a quadratic or higher but we always would want to check that so we check does that make this negative no in fact you plug this in uh 2 times 7 halves of 7 7 plus 1 is 8 and 2 to the third power would give you 8 that's exactly true and that's exactly what this is solved for that's what we're going to do to solve logarithms you check for common bases that takes two logarithms if you don't have that you're going to need to isolate your log we've got that one log one side constant and then use an exponential notation to solve that it's going to be pretty easy to solve in most of these cases let's move on to another one so we have another logarithm we check for common bases i don't have two logs i have one log there's one log on one side and a constant on the other exponential notation will solve your logarithm the exponential is an inverse of some logarithm and so we're going to use that inverse identify your base so our base here is 3 our exponent is on the other side a logarithm has stripped away the exponent and separate it on different sides of the equation so our base for an exponential is three the exponent is two and that's going to equal x squared plus one this is the exponential notation of the inverse of that particular logarithm the same base and the same exponent now we're going to solve for x so notice that we do sometimes have to rely on some techniques that we've had so when you set up your exponential you might have a quadratic you might have to factor this in this case we're just going to use the square root method because we can isolate that power too but you might have to factor it you might have to quadratic formula for it you have to do lots of things to solve this here's the main point the only thing i'm really trying to teach you in this video is that in order to solve a logarithm you're going to have to put it in exponential form also this video is very basic we have some other techniques with exponentials that i'm going to show you later but right now it's just the idea i need to just pound in your head that exponentials are what it takes to solve logarithms when we get to exponentials this means logarithms are what it takes to solve x answers because they're inverses of one another so solving this we know that three squared is nine if we subtract one and we take a square root remembering that when you take a square root you need to have a plus and minus we end up getting two solutions we get plus and minus the square root of eight because eight is four times two the square root of 4 is 2 and it leaves us a square root of 2 that's 2 root 2 and negative 2 or 2. now common question is wait a minute i thought you couldn't plug in negatives into a logarithm well you can't plug in values that make the inside of your logarithm negative but look at our argument here look at this x squared plus 1. there's nothing that you can plug in here that's going to cause that to be negative you can plug in positive numbers something squared plus 1 is going to be positive you can plug in negative numbers something negative squared plus one is going to be positive these are both valid solutions for you because they don't make the inside of your logarithm negative it's very common for students looking through oh i can't have negatives it's really easy to do that but that's not the idea the idea is you can't plug in values that make the inside of that logarithm negative neither of these actually do that therefore they're both valid solutions okay moving on do you remember that if i have a logarithm and i've checked for both side of both of them sorry i've checked for common bases now i don't have my i just have one logarithm and it's isolated do you remember that when you have an ln it stands for a logarithm but it has certain base so that base would be e ln stands for the logarithm of the natural number so that says it's an implied base of e here so this is a log logarithmic equation i check for common bases but i only have one logarithm i don't have two that's what you would need for common bases to work i have my logarithm isolated there's nothing being added subtracted or multiplied it's very basic here what we do when we see this if we go okay we've got a logarithm without common bases you're going to need to get an exponential from that so when we look at it all right our base is our base is e our exponent is eight remember a logarithm all of them have separated the base from the exponent put them on different sides of your equation so we're going to put it back together in something called exponential notation so our base is e our exponent is eight and that's going to equal the argument negative two x plus one looks a little weird but we can certainly solve this if we solve for x go through the same exact steps that you would with any other equation if that's our variable remember that's a number that's like 2.7 ish goes forever it's trends of known you can't really get to the end of it but it is a number sort of like pi if we're solving for x you're just going to subtract one and then we're going to divide by negative two do exactly the same thing here but don't approximate e to the eighth what we want is something called an exact solution so an exact solution hasn't used your calculator to say well e is about this therefore e to the eighth is about this and then we subtract once about this divided by name two it's about this that's a that's an approximation and those are valid sometimes when they ask you for it but if you need an exact solution this is the process you go through subtract 1 from both sides notice it's not subtracted from the exponent and subtracting from e to the eighth and then we would divide by negative two now we typically don't like to see negatives on the denominator so we can move that out front that's appropriate i don't like seam all denominator move them out front or you can run it through the numerator as well so negative e to the eighth and then plus one or we can reverse that one of these two two solutions is really what you should end with something with a negative e to the eighth minus one over two or one minus either just distributing that negative through your numerator over two this is what's called an exact solution we have not approximated now if you want to approximate what you can do on your calculator is put parentheses plug in 1 minus e to the 8th and that parentheses because you need to tell the calculator that that's my numerator and then divide by 2. it'll give you a decimal approximation and that's sometimes useful for us but if you're asked for exact that's what we do also when we're doing math and we need an approximation don't approximate until you get here so what i don't want to see i don't want to see it plugging in 2.7 or e and then getting e to the eighth and writing down a decimal and then subtracting one writing down a decimal then dividing by negative two and writing out a decimal you're starting to round your approximations and if we approximate approximations they get more and more error in them it's not really appropriate to do so don't do that now it seems kind of awkward to check but you still could check this answer if you plugged this in and you plugged it in right there well it's really weird but think about how this would take the place of x negative 2 over times something over 2 those 2's would cancel that negative would distribute here and give you negative 1 plus e to the 8th negative 1 plus 1 would give you 0 you would end with e to the 8th now wait a minute ln of e to the eighth we're going to see this right here but whenever you have an exponential composed on a logarithm or a logarithm composed of an exponential we're going to see in the properties of logarithms a very nice video these things cancel this right here says this is going to give you 8. so in other words it says e raised to what power gives you e to the 8th well e to the 8th power would give you e to the 8. oh hey look it's 8. it makes sense it actually works so that we can check and it becomes a little more awkward what you can't do you can't check an approximation it's not going to work out because you just approximated the decimal which is another reason why we want to leave it in exact exact answer form so moving on here a couple of special cases where you don't necessarily need to write an exponential but you still can't so i want to show you this so we check do i have two logarithms where i can make common bases no not really what am i going to need i want to need an exponential but i'm going to need a logarithm isolated we have that right here the base of this particular logarithm is e so notice what happened is just what we talked about if this has a base of b which we never really write here's what is actually going to happen once we learn about the professional logarithms you have now composed an exponential onto a logarithm you've composed two inverses the reason why we talked about compositions and inverses is so that you would learn that when i compose two inverses they cancel and you get x the x here in this case is 2x it's your exponent so what's going to happen i'm going to show you this i'll prove this to you with the exponential notation what's going to happen you're going to end up going that's going to be 2x equals 8. your solution is going to be 4. now can we see it a different way sure if you understand that that base is e and that this is a logarithm it's isolated can you write it in exponential form well yeah we can our base is e our exponent is 8. so base to the exponent equals our argument this is what happens every time you compose an exponential onto a logarithm with the same base this is the key the same base what would happen is that your exponential that you create will have the same base you can see it right here same base means same base that's why it's so trivial that's why it says well yeah you can just go 2x equals 8 because those things cancel out because these e's practically cancel out you know if my bases are the same then my exponents have to be equal and sure enough i get just four that's going to happen every single time you compose an exponential with a logarithm the basis will if the bases match then the bases will cancel and you're going to get the exponents equal and that's exactly what we have keep this mind this is a big deal this is an exponent right but this is also some exponent of an exponential that's what logarithms have done they separated the base from the exponent our exponents will get set equal if our bases are the same that's the reason why these inverses undo each other is because of that they have the same base they're going to know each other kind of cool all right last one's also a special case i'm going to show this to you you'll hopefully understand the same concept that you're seeing here with just a slightly different base and i'll show you the exponential notation so if you were to think of log base 6 of 36 equals 5 x plus 4 you're you're noticing right hopefully right right away that your variables over here wait a minute couldn't you just subtract 4 and divide by 5 yeah you could there's no variable over here which means this is already a constant in fact it's a constant that we can simplify think about this 6 raised to 2 what power will give you 36 2. this stands for two i promise you no matter what you do you're gonna end with five x plus four equals two a couple ways you can see that well what if we thought about it as log base 6 of 6 squared c squared is still 36 oh but what i've done is the same thing i've done here i've written this as an exponential and a logarithm with the same base well what's going to happen with that the bases will cancel you will end up getting 2 equals 5x plus 4. that's possible to do and we can show it just this way we can we can say hey that's going to cancel you get 2 equals 5x plus 4 or if you need the exponential we can think of this as if this is a logarithm it's isolated it has a base of 6 i know that if i were to write this in exponential form that's my base that's my exponent that's been separated so writing this back in exponential form let's say base of 6 to an exponent of 5x plus 4 must equal whatever's here in the argument 6 squared now it's really really clear that if your bases are the same here they're going to be the same in your exponential if your bases are the same here you're going to set your exponents equal if you're based the same here you're going to set your exponents equal this models a little more concisely what this is saying to you it's just saying you've composed a function with its inverse it's going to cancel out same basis it's going to cancel out so if we have those bases the same the exponents also have to be equal and then we can solve this is exactly what we thought would happen if we subtract two so sorry subtract four and we divide by five we get x equals negative two fifths negative two fifths times five would give you negative two plus four would give you two and sure enough six to the second power is 36. we can check our work on that i hope that makes sense to you i hope you're seeing the necessity of writing a lot of these in exponential form that's how we solve logarithms in general yes there are some shortcuts if we can find common bases somehow that's true we can simplify this a little bit easier but without that you are going to need an exponential for logarithms in general we'll come back we'll talk about exponentials and then we'll be done okay i guess i lied a little bit i want to do one more logarithm before we jump into these exponentials sometimes you get a little bit of awkwardness like hey can you solve for a base that would make this logarithm true and it's not that bad just remember that with your exponentials you check your common bases i do not have that because i don't have two logarithms what i do is i have one logarithm isolated equal to a constant this is the setup for solving with an exponential we look at this and say can i write this as an exponential well identify what your base is a base is x identify what your exponent is in this case 3 and that's going to be equal to your argument when you solve these just be careful remember that your argument has to be positive your domain for logarithm is positive numbers so whatever you plug in must keep that or make that positive but your base also has to be positive it can be fractions that's okay but it has to be positive so if you had a square root here and not a cube root when we took a plus and minus you would have to omit any negatives cube roots fine you can you can take this and take a cube root and not get any negatives here but you'd have to watch that just remember your bases can't be negative so take a cube root of both sides cube root of one is one and of eight is two so the base that makes this work is one half and sure enough one half to the third power is one eighth that's what this would say again last time just be careful that you don't allow any bases to be negative so this works um you still write this as exponentials that's how logarithms are solved in general is with its inverse of an exponential now let's move on and solve some exponential so the same logic applies it's just that we're going backwards you see logarithms and exponentials are inverses of one another it means it takes one to solve the other so we would check for common bases and here's what i mean by that you'd look at this and say can i write this as this base if that if you can then you do it because it's a little bit nicer you don't think using logarithms you'll get a more easy to understand solution but if we don't have that then we're going to find a logarithm and we're going to use that to solve our exponential so in each of these cases seven and eight you can't find a common base ten is your base not eight and not eighty ten and three you can't find a common base e and five definitely no convex e and seven no common bases so we would check that first step once we've determined there are there's no way to write these exponentials as a common base we're going to have to use a logarithmic form to solve the exponential it's not too bad when we get into a little bit more detail i'm going to give you at least three possibly if i feel like it four different ways to solve exponentials with logarithms so we've checked common bases and we don't have any common bases any of these problems and what i'm just i just need to know that if you do not have common bases with exponentials it is going to take logarithms to solve them we're going to isolate the exponential what that means is get the base raised to an exponent by itself and then we're going to solve as i was saying a little earlier i will teach you some other techniques when these become a little more difficult mike what do you do if you have two exponentials well then writing this as one logarithm is not going to work and so i'm going to show you that another video this is very basic just the introduction of hey if you have exponentials check for common bases if not write them as a logarithm and then we can solve that so let's practice that here so this is an exponential it's got a base of seven it's got an exponent of two x plus five now what a logarithm does a logarithm takes that exponential and breaks it apart it takes the base and says this is the base of some logarithm some inverse function of an exponential and then it's going to be equal to your exponent so we can take this and say all right so 7 to the 2x plus 5 equals 8 can be written as some inverse function a logarithm with the same base equal to the same exponent but just separated it just says the same thing a little bit weird it says seven to the two x plus five equals eight and it says in order to get from seven to eight you need an exponent of two x plus five now this allows us to solve for that variable x don't try to figure this out unless you have some sort of common base idea if you do then you can but in general you wouldn't need a logarithm to do that it would show up right here that you can get common bases just leave this this is going to be what's called exact answer if you if you approximate this on a calculator yeah we can get something out of it but it's you're going to lose a lot of the the exact as that would just be an approximation so when we solve for x a couple features to understand when we subtract five it is really important to not actually subtract the argument of your logarithm minus 5. this is inside a logarithm and this is not in order to get inside the logarithm you need properties of logs to do that and there's really only four of them so we cannot just subtract even though we want to it's best to put a parenthesis around that argument almost all the time that i can't think of a couple cases where you wouldn't want to do it and you can't really overuse the parentheses here with this logarithm it's going to show you this is log base 7 of 8 and then you subtract 5. it is not log base 7 of 8 minus 5. that's not appropriate you can't do that lastly if we divide by 2 the whole entire expression is divided by two this even though it's awkward that is an exact solution and it's also a constant this stands for one number it just has a weird logarithm in it your calculator will approximate this if you have the ability to plug in a base of 7. a lot of calculators don't most texas instruments don't do that they either have a log base 10 or a log base e that's the log and the ln on your calculator some of them do have have that base where you can plug it in but a lot of the ones i've seen don't have that so this is an exact solution for that exponential and we had to have logarithms to do it let's move on to this guy so when we move on and we take a look at five e to the point two x equals seven there's a lot going on but at its root at its heart it's an exponential now can you get a common base well the base here is e and the base here is 7. there no way to make a 7 into an e so we're going to need a logarithm to undo this exponential when you look at an exponential and you don't have common bases and you need a logarithm to solve it you need to get that exponential isolated what that means is get everything that's been added and subtracted and multiplied from that base to an exponent get that away so we're going to have to divide by 5 here this is how an exponential should look before you start using logarithms nothing added nothing subtracted nothing multiplied just like this now what we're going to do is say because i can write this as a logarithm we're going to identify the base the exponent and let the logarithm separate those things our base here is e and our exponent is 0.2 x the argument of our logarithm is going to be seven-fifths so with a base of e we'd say this can be written as a logarithm with a base of b i know this incorrect notation we're not going to use it i'm just showing you how this works that's going to separate our exponents so here's our base and our exponent written as a logarithm and this will equal seven-fifths i'm going to keep this in parentheses because that is appropriate to do we're showing that this fraction is inside the logarithm that's different than having a log of 7 over 5. we don't want to have that unless that's actually what the problem is representing the last thing i wanted to tell you about this before we divide by 0.2 is that log base e is always written as a natural log ln so when you see this we really should be going oh that's oh this is a logarithm of the base of e i would normally just go straight to the ln so this is log base e so i've separated my base in a logarithm equal to my exponent and then put the seven fifths inside that natural log and then when we divide by point two the reason why we want to put that fraction in parenthesis is you don't get confused on where you're dividing my point to you're dividing this entire thing by point two we can do a couple things to modify the look of that uh like multiply by 10 over 10 if you want to get rid of that decimal that's that's appropriate you can do that i wouldn't say it's super necessary but sometimes you're required to do it so multiply by 10 over 10 you get 10 line of seven fifths over two or you can reduce that five l and seven fifths so that might look a little bit nicer you could do something a little simpler i suppose i think i made that as hard as humanly possible if you think about that as one one divided by 0.2 1 divided by point two is five point two goes into one five times so you could do that as well but this is a nicer look then then that is so i hope that's making sense i hope you're seeing that hey exponential is gonna require a logarithm there another way to solve that besides using a logarithm with a base of e there's a couple ways we can get to that point but a logarithm is necessary to solve exponentials if you do not have common bases let's move on to the last two at this point i'm hoping that you could solve this on your own can you see that's a base of 10 that's a this is three there's no way to make this as a base of 10. can you see that with this exponential without common bases i'm going to need a logarithm can you also see that that logarithm is going to be a common log it's going to have a base of 10 in it but i need to get that 8 away before i write this in logarithmic notation so i'm going to have to divide both sides by 8. this is not 80 you're breaking order operations if we do that or operations say you have to deal with the exponent before you start multiplying if you start multiplying here you are really messing up that exponent we don't want to do that so we're going to divide both sides by 8. now that's how we like to see an exponential before we make it into logarithm we got a base we know it's 10. all by itself nothing added subtracted or multiplied onto that exponential this is okay because it's in the exponent but what we mean is multiplication here or added subtracted somewhere outside of that that base to an excellent idea now that we know the logarithm is going to be necessary for us if we have a base of 10 remember that a a log with a base of 10 equal to the exponent of 2x minus 7 that log should be written just log if we write log with no base it's implied that that base is 10. so i have a base of 10 an exponent of two x minus seven and a logarithm separates those i'm gonna make sure that my argument is in parentheses that's really good form to do that way you don't accidentally add subtract multiply and divide anything inside of that without meaning to by some sort of property of logarithms and then we solve for x because this is actually a constant this says 10 to what power gives me 3 8. that is a number it represents an exponent but i can solve by adding 7 and dividing by 2. where we add 7 is after that parenthesis and where we divide by 2 is that entire expression so divide the entire log of 3 8 we know it's a base 10 plus 7 and all divided by 2. that's as good as we can get for what's called an exact solution if you wanted to approximate your calculator will do this just press the log button on your calculator that is a log base 10 and sure enough it has parenthesis there doesn't it so when you press it goes log parenthesis plug in 3 8 and parentheses add 7. now if you do it correctly you might want to do your numerator parentheses first so parentheses log 3 8 close the first parenthesis plus 7 close the second parentheses and that will have the numerator for you and then divide by 2. and i'll give you an approximation for what this number represents okay last one you really need to do on your own uh it's an exponential for sure i'm gonna kind of just scream through this thing um it's an exponential without common bases if you have that a logarithm is necessary but you have to isolate your exponential first so when we divide by 4 we can easily see that that exponential is isolated this is certainly no not a common base we're going to write this in logarithmic notation so this exponential has a base of e i'm going to need a logarithm of the base of e this exponential has an exponent of x plus one logarithms separate the base in the form of a logarithm from an exponential and uses the argument logarithm whatever this exponential is equal to after that we can solve for the variable and solve our exponential so we subtract one we're done that's what's called an exact solution your calculator will also approximate this which is why i wanted to give these two to show you that your calculator that button that says log on it represents a common log that's what this is that ln represents a log of the base of e they're very very very common in our our math going on in the future we get so many elements so you you can approximate that by pressing ln you're going to see the parentheses put five fourths close the parentheses subtract one and i'll give you a decimal approximation for that exact solution i hope this video has made sense i hope that you understand like yeah we would we'd certainly go through this process every time with logarithms if you've got two logarithms of the same base it becomes pretty easy you set your your insides equal we're going to see that a little bit if you have two exponentials and you can write the same base we've already done that we modeled it with a couple examples a little bit earlier you set your exponents equal they're pretty easy to solve but without those two very special cases it is going to require you to use an exponential to solve logarithms you just take your logarithm isolate it and then use an exponential to represent the situation put your exponent and your base back together and equal it to your argument it'll solve very nicely if you have an exponential you're going to need a logarithm there's a few ways i can show you how to get there but in general you isolate your exponential and use logarithms somehow to represent the situation in this case we go directly to our logarithms by taking the base and separating the exponent and solving so hope the videos made sense i'm going to see you next time for when we start talking about the properties of logarithms just an overview of overview of what they are then we'll start combining logs we'll expand logs and then we'll be ready to solve some exponential and logarithmic equations in general so i'll see for those videos in just a bit
