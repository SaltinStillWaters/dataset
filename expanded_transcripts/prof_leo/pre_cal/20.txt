Transcript for: Using the Quadratic Formula (Precalculus - College Algebra 21)
hi welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the quadratic formula we're going to talk about how to use it I'll give you a very nice way to set up the formula that way you can do the same thing every time get a process for it and how our solutions would look when we when we finish up the B idea of the quadratic formula so we're going to continue we're working on quadratic equations we're setting them equal to 0 to find the x intercepts and that's exactly what the quadratic formula does it is the same thing that factoring does does the same thing that the square root method does does the same thing that completing the square does except that it works all the time you see the square root method only works some of the time if you can somehow find part of your function with all your XS raised to the second power and you can solve for a constant other side take a square root you're good to go factor it only works some of the time over integers well this the completing the square method works all the time but we found out the last video that and it can be brutal and so what we did is we learned that the quadratic formula is sort of completing the square universally all the time I proved it in the last video and that's what we got out of it so I'm going to show you exactly how to use it I'm not going to go through the proof again because we've already done that this is more just an explanation of how this stuff works and what we should be getting the end of the quadratic formula so let's take a look at our first function f of X equals 3x squared minus 5x plus 1 this is of course a quadratic it is a parabola we can tell it's upward-opening because our a is positive and it's a little bit narrower or has a vertical stretch to it because our a is 1 than 1 and so what we're going to do is we're going to look at this throughout the the lens of how do I find x-intercepts with this that's the only thing that the quadratic formula ever does is finds x-intercepts for you or forces it to factor then that's that's kind of what we think of this as so if we're gonna find x-intercepts the way we do that with every function ever is to set this thing equal to zero now there's one thing that you've heard me say over and over and over again is when we set up the quadratic is solving for x intercepts and we're going to use the screw that or we're going to use factory or we're going to use quadratic formula even completing the square we want everything on one side which is going to be if you have this set equal to zero in order which means that we want our exponents of our terms to decrease to be decreasing which it is and we want the first term positive let me be very specific here with the quadratic formula you don't necessarily have to have your first term positive but because you're dividing by a if that a is negative it leads a lot of students to not quite understand what to do with that negative expression that negative part of your your your fraction here your denominator and sometimes you get some sign errors so I'm going to tell you that because we use a twice in this formula and because sometimes it leads to sign errors I'm gonna have us avoid that so the idea behind solving any sort of quadratic for x-intercepts is set it equal to zero get everything on one side get it in order get your first term positive in trying the easiest things first see if the square root method will work it's not going to there's no way for us to isolate in power to with all of our X's inside and a constant on the other side we'd have to use completing the square to get that and I don't want to do that then we try to factor you spend about 10 seconds trying to factor these see if we can find two numbers an add negative five and multiply to 3 times one multiply to 3 that's not going to happen but we've checked it we've checked completing the square we've checked factoring if those don't work in general we just go directly to the quadratic formula I mentioned this a few videos ago when we did complain the square that it's very useful but for x-intercepts there's a better way to go about it because this is found by completing the square in general so here's how it works once we have this on one side in order first for positive we've checked the easy techniques the square method in factoring we identify an a of B and a C from our equation our a is always the number in front of x squared our B is the number in front of X's or coefficients and our C is the constant and they go with the sign so here's the way that I do the quadratic formula we're doing it this way for years it works really well I created pattern for myself so what I'm going to do just like Taylor Swift has a blank space we're gonna put blank spaces in for every single one of these variables and I have a pattern that I haven't made up for myself like you should to fill it out so but what the quadratic formula really looks like before we start filling things out it has some blank spaces for all of our coefficients and we just need to know what what to do with their numbers were to put our coefficients in our constant so this really is the quadratic formula without any numbers plugged into it why we use print the season why I like this technique is because hopefully we understand that parentheses maintain two things that maintain signs and they maintain operations so when I have four times a times C parentheses show that but it also lets me put the sign in there and not accidentally lose anything especially with our negative or negative B if that's a negative we want to make sure we have both of the signs so I start telling the quadratic formula by using parentheses for all of our letters all of our variables and then we go through so write what is our a what sort of evils our C or a is 3 our B is negative 5 and our C is 1 so how I do this you don't have to do my way but create a pattern for yourself here's what I do I put my beef first and so what I view as a say alright I know that might be is my first two spots might be my second two spots and C is only one spot a goes last so I fill this out by saying negative 5 negative 5 3 3 and 1 and I do it the same way every single time create for yourself a pattern on how you want to do it for me that works really well I know my B's are together in my 8th or second or my C is less work so well after that honestly it's just a matter of not making sign errors we have some simplification that we're gonna have to do occasionally but for the most part its plug the numbers in and just simplify so when we do that we know the opposite of negative 5 or negative negative 5 is 5 inside of our square root whenever you square a number whether it's positive or negative you are going to get a positive number so your first value inside your square root will always become positive and then just be careful right here with this there's red is where a lot of sign errors happen if you ever have a negative in here and if you follow my technique there should only be one negative because your a should be positive based on the fact you go to one side in order first term positive this should always be a positive number this one may or may not be so in this case it's positive which means you're subtracting a positive number that subtracting 12 I'm gonna write that I'm not gonna try to do in my head because it's what my mistakes come in so we've done that and now there's just a couple more steps what we're going to do is we're going to subtract 25 minus 12 is 13 and then we're going to write this as 2 solutions after we check to make sure that we can we have simplified it so what do I mean by simplified firstly you want to check to make sure that your square root can't be can't be simplified any more there's no perfect square just factors inside your radicand in there just in the in the quadratic formula we call that something specific we call this little piece the discriminant I'm going to mention it right now just so we get out of the way what the discriminant does it tells you whether you're going to have two real solutions one real solution or two complex solutions and here's how it does it are you don't watch this for the next five examples if the discriminant the inside part of your reticle if that's positive we're going to add it then we're going to subtract it from whatever our B is that's going to give us two solutions every time two real solutions if this number is positive if this number in here is zero so if you if your discriminant is zero well you would add zero and you'd subtract sir my gosh this is the time where we get the same solution twice we have 5 plus 0 5 minus 0 both divided by 6 you get 5 6 if it's discriminant was 0 so if your discriminants positive that gives you two real solutions if you discriminate is 0 that gives you one real solution notice there's no eyes no imaginary artists if this discriminant is negative square root with a negative inside of it gives you this I gives you an imaginary or a complex solution and so far discriminant is negative you add and you subtract this is this complex imaginary number and so you get two solutions but they be complex and that would signify that you don't have any x-intercepts so again discriminating if that's positive you got two real solutions to X intercepts if that's zero you have one real solution one x-intercept that's where the vertex would balance off the x axis if that is negative you're going to get an eye and says you've completely missed the x axis either above or below that so the discriminant means that's what we use it for just check what how many solutions we get and whether they're x-intercepts or not from here we can't simplify that square root the only thing that we can do is show that this is really two solutions so we'd say this is 5 plus the square root of 13 over 6 and also we get 5 minus the square of 13 over 6 if you watch that completing the square video these are the very familiar because that's almost exactly what we get with completing the square the same look they look so similar because the way I proved it this quadratic formula comes from completing the square on this piece right there and so that's why they look very very very similar I hope that makes sense I hope you're understanding the process the process is set your function your quadratic equal to zero try the square root method try complete let's try a factoring after you've got everything in order on one side first your positive and then those two things things don't work then try the quadratic formula we pretty much skip over completing the square and unless you have a really really easy one easy ones would be like any easy ones up here we'd have x squared plus N even the plus whatever constant that would be called an easy one they'd be fairly quick to do if he understanding through the square well if not let's go directly to quadratic formula okay let's try the next one so with our with our quadratics we know that what we do to find x-intercepts is we set this equal to zero so we're going to do that but at the same time we also want to make sure that this fits our model our model says we want things in order we want things to to have a first term positive it will always be on one side if you start with function notation like we have so when we're doing this really yeah you know what I know I'm going to have this equals zero but I'm also going to distribute because I want to be able to find an A to B to C and that only happens if we have our quadratic in standard form so we want things in order on one side first your positive so that we can identify our a RB and RC don't distribute to the minus one so in our case we distributed we have this on one side it's already an order that's fantastic and our first term is positive now we would check the square root method it doesn't look like it's going to work because we don't have something raised to the second power that contains all of our X's and a constant on the other side there's no way to make that without completing the square we don't want to spend the time to do it so we're gonna check factory it are there any numbers that add to 6 and multiply to negative 3 I'm not thinking of any so if I'm not thinking of any we're gonna go directly to the quadratic formula we need to identify our a our B in our seat and we just plug and plug it into the quadratic formula we evaluated so how they evaluate create for yourself some sort of a pattern on how you like to do this and do the same way every time so I've created some blank space and I'll write your name and then we're going to plug in our a intervener seat so what i do i plug in my beef first i know my a is 3 my B is 6 my C's negative 1 I'm gonna put the B's first A's second I'll see laughs as I mentioned before if you have this on one side it over first your positive there should only possibly be one negative in these two numbers right here a would be positive you followed like my technique so this is going to be the only negative we have if that numbers negative then you're going to ultimately be adding here be very careful that it's very common for students to go oh it's 36 minus 12 is not gonna - well it's gonna be plus 12 be very very careful so now it comes down to simplification we know that x equals negative 6 there's no sign change there we just have negative whatever that number is inside of our square root of this discriminant this is going to be 36 and then because we're subtracting a negative or subtracting negative 12 that really is an addition concept this is the one mistake that students make time time again is they go so fast they try to do everything their head that they they don't catch that be very careful it take if it takes you writing this out as 36 minus negative 12 to understand that you're gonna be adding here that's fine either way but just be very careful on that all over 6 so we can't we continue simplifying I know that the negative 6 that looks really good that's fine and then the square root of our discriminant is now 48 you know what you should tell right now whether this parabola and this parabola is firstly open opening and it is a little bit narrow it's got that coefficient of 3 out there for a whether this is going to cross the x axis or not I'm looking at your discriminate we to be able to lie can immediately identify that and say hey that that's 48 that's a positive number I'm not getting eyes in it but I'm going to be adding and subtracting it so that that is not zero it's going to be negative six plus some sort of real number and they used six minus some sort of real number that's gonna give me two real numbers two real solutions to X intercepts if your discriminant is positive you were across the x axis twice there's a little bit more work for us to do you see we can't leave the square root of 48 and if you if you give this as it as a solution it's not technically wrong is it but it's the same thing as like if you left a fraction two fourths well don't really like that like people even want this to be 1/2 2/4 is 1/2 the same thing happens here we need is simplifies we those simple forms so that people can identify a little bit better so how that works we take off our square root and we try to simplify simplify by finding and perfect square factors so and the biggest one that divides 48 so we think 48 I'm not thinking 4 even though square root 4 is 2 I'm thinking 16 so the square root of 16 is the biggest perfect square that divides 48 in fact it's 16 times 3 so when we simplify that the square root of 16 that's great we can simplify to 4 the square root of 3 yeah we can't simplify that so it stays as 4 square root 3 and so we have this X I showed this to you in another video that we can continue to simplify it was in the square root method if you want to check that out but here's the way that this this happens if you can factor these two numbers then you can end simplify with this then that's possible so the lines you can't then don't do it here's what you may never - don't ever just cross out these two numbers that doesn't work what actually does work is it these values 1 2 & 3 if they all have a common factor then you can simplify that the reason is if you can factor a number out of here like 2 if you can factor it Hey now these are connected by multiplication we know that we can simplify factors when they're connected by multiplication like that we would get negative 3 plus or minus 2 root 3 over 3 you can get the same thing but you've got to divide all three of them not this one but these 3 coefficient and factor and constant so if we divide all of these by 2 negative 6 divided by 2 is negative 3 4 divided by 2 is 2 6 divided by 2 is positive 3 and we get the same thing we get that this would be negative 3 plus or minus 2 root 3 over 3 either way you go I really don't care but you do need to understand that you can't simplify just one part of that that's not okay from here maybe to try this is two solutions we know they're real they're still imaginary no there's two of them there's not a zero here so we understand it these are x-intercepts and if we wanted to approximate on a calculator people tell us about where on the x axis this parabola is going to cross twice that's about all there is those are two x-intercepts and that is all the quadratic formula ever gives us it just tells us where this quadratic has x-intercepts if it does if you if your discriminants positive you're gonna have two x-intercepts if it's zero you can have one that's where the vertex is and it was negative this we're going to see in about three examples then you're not gonna have any x-intercepts at all you have complex solutions all right let's try this next one so I was talking to Taylor Swift on the phone the other day and and I said listen I really like my two favorite songs for math and she was like what favorite songs Matt I was like oh you know the ones you wrote about evaluation functions it's just like oh right blank space I was like yes that's absolutely right because this how you do quadratic formulas with a blank space you go I got a blank space baby Rajini except it's a main right we read our a B and C but she also has another one I don't know if you know it but it goes like this it's never ever ever ever plug in fractions to the quadratic formula ever I said that's that's brilliant she goes oh man that's that's the original way I wrote the song but I didn't think it would fly as like TS I know your musically inclined and all but I disagreed like I think that would have been awesome she was like totes I don't know that means personally but I think it was like agree with me and then and then I said yeah you should rerecord except I just I just can't it's like licensed now and they're this like it's like you know copyrighted or whatever but it's great for I understand the quadratic formula don't ever ever ever plug in fractions to the quadratic feels a little bit dramatic I'm sorry about that don't ever plug in fractions to the quadratic formula well mathematically possible it makes your work ten times harder don't do it instead we know something up fractions we know that if we multiply both sides of an equation by the same number it keeps this equation equal it keeps it exactly what it what it was we also know that we can multiply it by an LCD and we'll kill off while your fractions that's brilliant so while we can't do it we can't just get rid of that fraction that was the drawback of the completing the square method if you remember that we had lots of fractions and they were horrifying so instead of that instead I'm gonna do that why don't we just use the quadratic formula why don't we set this equal to zero like we would do for every finding x-intercepts technique we used to have this in order we have the first term positive but before we do anything with it before we even check for square method by the way it won't work here before we do factory it wouldn't work here anyway but we would check with a fraction anyhow before I even think about completing the square and we actually did that problem completely square we're gonna get rid of all our fractions especially new quadratic formula get rid of your fractions find your LCD in this case it's to multiply both sides by that two distribute it it's gonna get rid of all your fractions so move in 8 6 x squared + 2 X don't forget that minus 1/2 times negative 1/2 is negative 1 we write minus 1 on the right hand side you still have 0 because 0 times any sort of number is going to give you 0 this is so much easier to work with I don't care what you're doing do this first so if you're setting functions equal to 0 and solving them get rid of your fractions first multiply by the LCD this is way back to like intermediate algebra sort of stuff this is what we do all the time let's get rid of arc our denominators by using an LCD on both sides of an equation from here everything works nicer so if you wanted to do the square root method it worked better here even complain the square would work sort of work better here you didn't have one fraction for a while if you want to do factory and we definitely work better here if it was factorable now we would try it but there's no numbers that add to 2 and multiply to negative 6 we can't do that so we do quadratic formula this is even nicer don't ever ever plug in fractions to the quadratic form implicit ever so we know that this is one side in order first we positive we got rid of our fractions we have an A and a B and C well we're gonna plug these into the quadratic formula because that's really our last and best choice and so we're gonna find our a which is 6 our B which is 2 our C which is negative 1 are you gonna plug him in so B comes first I put 2 + 2 is next I put 6 + 6 C is last I put negative 1 I'm really careful here I understand my head that that's a negative so I'm going to be adding be very careful again if you do this if your first terms positive like I've told you to do then the only number that can be negative here is not like that we'll change this to an addition and not a subtraction problem that's why they come with a technique in it so we can do the same thing every time and not run into two mistakes when we don't expect them so negative 2 no problem plus or minus we got it 2 squared is 4 we already determined this what we're going to be subtracting and negative that's going to be adding 24 all over 12 we keep on simplifying that's 28 we're going to have to simplify the square root of 28 we're looking for it before the biggest perfect square that factors is a factor of that number so we can take the square root of it in this case the biggest perfect square the device when it is actually 4 so if we simplify that square root of 4 to 2 we can't simplify the service 7 stays there what we get is this negative 2 plus or minus 2 square root 7 over 12 you should be answering your head right now whether this parabola and is a parabola that's upward bumping a little bit narrow has one x-intercept two x-intercepts or no x-intercepts your discriminant will tell you that right here it will tell you that that number is positive this is going to give us two real solutions than therefore two x-intercepts wear this proudly bounces twice all we're gonna do now is simplify it two ways you can go if you want to factor out 2 and simplify 2 with 12 you're gonna get a big one plus some is 1 that's 4 over 7 over 6 or you can divide all three of these numbers by 2 2 divided by 2 is 1 & 1 & 6 we would never write one root 7 so I could write even one X it's implied that there's a factor of 1 and out in front of that so we know we don't really need that all we going to do now is understand these are two real solutions we're going to write both of them so our negative one plus skirt 706 and negative 1 minus root step number six if you need an approximation be careful on your calculator the best way if I'm going to do this is put a parenthesis put negative 1 plus square root of 7 and the parenthesis and then press divide by 6 and then same thing parenthesis negative 1 minus square root of 7 in parenthesis divided by 6 now give you a nice approximation all at one time let's go on to the last one again we see some fractions it is a quadratic it's quite wide isn't it because we have got 1/8 in there that 1/8 says you have a vertical compression its widened out this parabola we'd have a y-intercept with negative 2 and start talking about that I'm practicing in another section for us but let's go ahead let's see if we can set this equal to 0 if we can get everything on one side in order first compositive kill off our fractions and then see if we can use an appropriate technique right now you should be trying that so here we go whenever we want to find x-intercepts and that's what the quadratic formula does we're going to set the function equal to zero so in our case we've got that on one side we've got the in order can you see it can you see the importers x squared then exponet constant we have the first term positive which is great that's what we want we want to set that up even if you start off with a negative first term remember that once you set it equal to 0 it doesn't care whether you have negative first or you change all your signs x-intercepts don't change when you reflect the function about the x axis so we set this equal to zero and change all their signs yeah it's going to look like the parabola reflects itself but the x-intercepts don't care and that's one nice technique we can use to make sure the first term is always positive very nice okay so we have an order first you're positive no problem the French is gonna kill us man we don't want fractions here fractions aren't horrifying to plug into the quadratic formula we definitely don't want to do factoring we don't factor with fractions you don't do anything with fractions and equations for though and so we have this equation with zero on one side use your LCD in this case it is 8 multiplied both they distribute the 8 and then simplify your fractions so we would get x squared the 8 and 1/8 are going to give us 1 minus 2x 8 times 1/4 is 2 minus 16 do not forget that you need to distribute that 8 times negative 2 is negative 16 - right - and then 0 times 8 is 0 so we're showing that because that's valid right we need to make sure we multiply the same thing on both sides of our equation and that's how to use the LCD to get rid of your fractions but zero times any constant is going to see what times anything so you can give us this zero well now we're ready for it so the first thing we check man does a square root method work and it doesn't we can't get a power to isolate with all of our X's on one side and constants on the other without doing the special thing you give completing the square we don't want to do that second thing we try to factoring can we think of anything looks like it at first glance that adds negative two and multiplies in a you 16 remember that that's a different that have to be different signs there 16 and 1 no that is a mag native - 8 - no 4 and 4 no so there's nothing that's going to factor for us now is our time to use a quadratic formula so we're skipping completing the square even though it might actually be kind of easy here because the quadratic formula is like it's like a fail-safe just plug in another detail So Ra Ra is 1 don't forget that there is a coefficient in front of x squared our B's negative 2 and our C's negative 16 maths we're going to evaluate into our quadratic formula so we know that now when we do our our beef first Sorby is negative 2 negative 2 ra next that's 1 and 1 RC less that's negative 16 I'm noticing right now that's a negative number that's the only thing they can possibly negative here because we have our first trip possible a time that means we're going to add this yet again so I'm going to be very careful because you have some sign changes here opposite of negative 2 or negative negative 2 is positive 2 instead of our square root be careful negative 2 squared is 4 not negative 4 it's very easy for students and make little sign errors we're not going to be subtracting 64 we're gonna be adding 64 and lastly 2 times 1 is 2 kind of on a homestretch here we're gonna combine 4 with 64 man right now you gotta be seeing in the back right there is a positive number that's two real solutions two x-intercepts we're just gonna simplify them to make them a little bit easier so oh man what goes into 68 looks like 17 goes into 68 17 and 4 so 4 is a perfect square 4 times 17 is 68 let's simplify it so the square root of 4 is 2 square root of 17 yeah you can do it as a prime number there's no perfect square in there that we can even factor out that's why we chose the 4 and then we're gonna rewrite this a little bit and we are almost done all we've got to do is simple but so whether you factor the 2 out and then cross out the two that are in factor like that factor it out you have a one factor that you can have a 1 to simplifies of the 2 or you'd like the other technique of hey let's just survive three numbers by the same thing so divide them all by the greatest common factor they all three have common two divided by two is one and one and one whatever we're gonna do here we're going to end up with one plus or minus the square root of 17 we already talked about the discriminant but now we can really see it there's no I here we're adding and subtracting something that's nonzero so we are getting two distinct solutions they happen to be real and that is exactly where this parabola that's a very wide parabola is going to cross the x-axis those aren't your zeros or your roots one thing that I want to say is those are called exact solutions so even though they don't make a lot of sense to us as far as a decimal number because they're not a decimal number we have to approximate to get that this is called exact when you start evaluating on your calculator what one plus the square root of 17 is it gives you a decimal that is actually an approximation the square root of 17 goes forever it doesn't repeat for any length of time it's not a fraction it's an irrational number and so we can't write it as a decimal and contain all of its information the square root of 17 contains all of that information that's what's called exact the approximation when you say oh my calculator says this number around I do the decimal place we've just rounded it haven't you I mean you've cut off a big portion of that number today goes forever that's an approximation there so keep that in mind this would be an exact form of your solution also one more thing that this is another very strange but keep in mind these are x-intercepts so what this really is this is a point this gives you a point on the x axis X comma zero because you are on the x axis the same thing for all of these these are all points in the loop very strange to write but this point would be negative 3 plus 3 which you burned 3 over 3 comma 0 as a point on the x axis it's kind of weird but that's what this is giving you it is X intercepts nd that didn't ever leave your mind so we're gonna come back and just a second I'm gonna give you two more examples talking about when imaginary zeros happen how to change a sign if your first term is negative and then where your descriptive 0 would come in so we'll be right back alright last couple problems so we're looking at two more quadratics do some special things that I want to talk about we already know about the discriminant that if the discriminant the inside of that radical when you're doing the quadratic formula that's positive we need two real solutions I'm going to show you when you get one real solution I'm going to show you when you would get no real solutions and also on this one if your first term is negative how to deal with that and make the quadratic formula work just a little bit better so you don't have to divide by negative in either case we're going to set this equal to 0 like we do every time we're trying to find x-intercepts and we want to make sure it's on one side of course is going to be we set a equals zero in order it is an order with the first term positive and that's true then we would try the square method isn't working factory it actually wouldn't work it would work here factoring works very well if you have a discriminant of 0 most of the time it's fine and so sometimes you don't make it that far so I'm going to show you if we didn't see the factory or if we just didn't want to that the quadratic formula would give you the 0 indiscriminate and that's exactly what that means so our a would be 9 our B's negative 6 and our C is 1 let's plug that into the quadratic formula maybe we missed the factory or something so the first thing we're gonna do I'm gonna thank my aides be might see I'm sorry I'm an agent now in my B's negative six my becomes first my a is next my C is less right now I'm seeing that these are positive numbers I'm going to be subtracting 36 not adding opposite of negative 6 is 6 plus or minus the square root of will have a positive 36 minus 36 and we see the 0 right there so we end up getting 6 plus or minus 0 over 18 and here's what we were talking about a long time ago what happens with a double root or something that would factor as this expression squared it has what's called a multiplicity of 2 we talked about multiplicity a little bit later and that multiplicity is this I give a repeated root a repeated factor and it tells us something about this it tells us that on that particular x intercept that comes from that factor you're going to be bouncing or touching the x-axis we're not crossing it and this is what this says if the discriminant is 0 you will be bouncing or touching of the x axis in this case because we only have one turning point a Verta parabola can only turn one time that turning point that vertex is going to be touching by sitting on bouncing off of the x axis and exactly this value you see we get the same solution twice that 18 is the only number you can add subtract another number to get let's call the additive identity you get the same number back whether you added or subtracted that's one third and again one third this is the only real solution is one-third it's not imaginary there's no I in it there's not two of them so this is the only time that you would get one x-intercept and one solution from right there if you're just screaming it is zero that's what that tells you I just want to make sure everybody get rid of that one more time all right last one we have something that looks kind of nasty it's in order but when we set this equal to zero everything is negative and especially the only negative everything's negative but especially the first term is negative that really hurts for factoring that's not so great for the quadratic formula and so when that happens let's divide everything by negative let's make sure first term is positive the reason why it's because we're the a sits on your quadratic formula is on the denominator and also in here so this is negative it starts messing with our signs inside our discriminant can screw us up if this is negative it really starts to mess with our signs of a fraction so when we change our a from a negative to a positive we eliminate two negatives inside of our function and it sets about better for factoring if we can factor it that's why we do it so it helps us with sign in or sign errors of number one mistake in math in my experience we knew it fifteen years now and even through calculus three like 90% of the errors or sign errors just little teeny mistakes that were making so this is one way to avoid so we're going to do is we're going to imagine either factor and making it out no problem or add everything to the other side the problem or divided by negative 1 including the zero needs so get zero either any one of those things ultimately what's going to happen all of our signs change just make sure if you're changing the first sign you're changing all this nice that's important now we tried square root method at work we try factoring that's also not going to work there's nothing to adds to one multiply 16 4 times 4 but the quadratic formula always works we really wouldn't want to do completing the square here can you imagine that you definite this number back you divide by for you to find half of that this one succeeds in square that's one over 256 then added and then factor and then subtract and then divide and then take a square root plus a class and then subtract again Betim as a the quadrant from the desert forest automatically so with our a being for our baby being one in our sea being four we can plug this in very nicely there's no negatives there's no fractions that's great we don't want any of those things no negatives are for RA especially and we create some blank spaces for all of our coefficients and our constant we're going to plug these entities or whatever pattern you feel most confident with for me I like to look at my beam ideas run my a is for my C is also for and it goes last that's really quick that's really easy it's very efficient that's speed with accuracy then we start simplifying negative one no problem I know that's mean 81 plus or minus the square root of I know I'm going to be subtracting here because none of these numbers are negative so when I swear the one I get one I subtract four to the third power 64 over eight and I'm going to be very careful 1 minus 64 cannot be 63 its negative 63 that negative is very important it's the difference between your parabola which is actually downward opening crossing and completely missing now I sit something important that's got to sink in this parabola decidedly is downward opening and it's narrow because it has this vertical stretch the absolute value a is more than 1 it is being stretched out its downward opening but it's not going across the x-axis when we change your signs you might be thinking waiting that's upward opening you screwed it up I might have screwed up the look of the parabola if we were actually graphing this with Manama we understand that is our parabola this is just a way to use the quadratic formula better and what's the quadratic form of the giddy x-intercepts that's it so if that's the case when you take a parabola and you start reflecting it about the x axis the numbers on the x axis cannot change reflection about the x axis takes Y values and change well the y-value of an x intercept is zero changing the sign of the zero doesn't change the x intercept that's why we can do it we can change the sign of this right here and not affect the x intercepts and that's all we care about for the quadratic formula so I mean go so x equals this is gonna get of 1 plus or minus square root of negative 63 over maybe we got our sign right and right now we should understand what this is telling us the discriminant is negative you aren't going to get an eye man if you don't have an eye you're not seeing your problem very well you're welcome we have to be able to see that this is going to give us an eye right there if your question says how many real solutions you get you say zero there are no real solutions here how many x-intercepts are gonna have none this is not gonna cross the x-axis at all say me to touch it what we do need to do if you're asked for complex solutions we do need is simplify it so we're gonna think about this we're gonna pull out that negative 1 because that's the value that gives us I times Oh let's see here 9 has the largest number that we can take a square root of that divides 63 and so this is going to give us square root of 9 is 3 square root of negative 1 is I square root of 7 is the square root 7 that's how that simplifies so we're gonna have this x equals negative 1 plus or minus 3i square root of 7 all over 8 we cannot simplify that at all this is in the proper order we like coefficient then I then square root where appropriate but we are going to write this as 2 solutions to complex solutions to non x-intercepts now can you give me an approximation for it no no our our calculators we can't really find a value to approximate this as it on a number line because this isn't going on number line there are ways to to show cognitive graph complex numbers but not on XY axis because that is a real number line in both the vertical and horizontal directions so this is it's as good as we can get to represent that this parabola was just downward-opening completely misses our x-axis I hope that makes sense I hope I've Illustrated a nice way to do quadratic formula talk through the very specifics of what it is that you are doing and how the best approach that so well then I sense out I'll see you for the next video when we talk about intersections of functions had set them equal to find out where they cross each other which is kind of interesting see you for that you
