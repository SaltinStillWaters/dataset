Transcript for: Using Substitutions to Solve Equations (Precalculus - College Algebra 23)
hey there in this video we're gonna talk about how to solve some things and aren't quadratic with some quadratic techniques by using something called the substitution so I'm going to show you exactly what that's about when you're asked to do it typically it's something that is factorable in its nature but just doesn't look like it right away so we're going to talk about how to make a very simple substitution so that we can make something that's not quadratic into something that is so that we can normally factor it and then go backwards to find out the appropriate number of solutions for whatever polynomial we're dealing with so let's get right to it so when you're asked to solve something that's not quadratic or maybe it is but it's really wrapped up kind of funny one thing that we do to make these a little bit easier to do something called a substitution what we're looking for we're looking for a piece of our function when we set it equal to zero that is the same in the first term and the second term in the first term we want that piece to be raised to the second power and the middle term the second term we wanted to be raised to the first power and if that's the case our substitution is going to work let's take a look at the first example we're going to go right to it so here's how to approach a problem like this if we're supposed to find x-intercepts or solve this for roots or zeros the first thing we do like all the ways is written set this equal to zero now maybe our first like inclination is to distribute everything yeah the guy's mad distribute you could but it's gonna take a lot longer to do that here's what we're looking for and when a substitution will work if we can write this on one side and have a term that's being raised to the second power and some term that has a first power or a factor is more appropriate and we can have the same exact expression in some sort of parentheses like 3x plus 4 and 3x plus 4 this is what I want you to look for I want you to look at the middle term make sure that we have the same thing here in here this ratio to the first power mil turn same thing raising the second part of the first term this right here tells you what your show institution is if we substitute call this little piece and both of these expression both of these of these these terms call them something else like typically we use you but it doesn't really matter as long as it's some variable you don't already have we want to use something that's not X we're going to typically use you that kind of prepares you for doing something calling you so when you get to calculus 2 and then we can do that we call just a little little U and we substitute and all of a sudden we get back to it later and that's what we're gonna do here we're gonna call a piece of this you we're gonna make it into a quadratic that's easy to deal with with the stuff that we already know we're gonna solve it and then we're going to go back into the terms of X so this is kind of like like breadcrumbs so ever heard the story of Hansel and Gretel I never did personally so here's how Hansel and Gretel works handsome girl works in my head at least that you call something you all right let's call 3x plus for you this is like your breadcrumbs so the way that I was explaining Hansel and Gretel is Hansel and Gretel go in the forest or leave a trail of breadcrumbs they do some cool stuff and they follow the trail of breadcrumbs tapas are still there that's that's the way that works right so this is our trailer bread comes we're gonna use you to get away from 3x plus 4 so go what do you do Matt well if this is 3x plus 4 and this is 3 to the 4 which is why they have to be the same I can call both of these expressions you some sort of variable that I make up then instead of 3x plus 4 squared we have u squared we still have a minus we still have a 6 but then we can also call this U and we still the plus 9 and we still haven't equals 0 and here's the reason why I told you two things and you can see it now it was a little bit vague before because you really can't see it like we get to right here the reason why we need these two pieces to be the same in order for a substitution to change into a quadratic to work it's so that we can put the same variable both here and here we need them both of you the same so the same variable works of both spots we need this information first power and this to be raised to the second power so that we can change into a quadratic of our standard form you owe a on that thing squared you oh you have a thing to the first power this creates a quadratic for us like 99% of time this is going to be factorable if it's not factorable it is quite hard to deal with because you don't use the quadratic formula or the square root method and then we if we have radicals in there it's very difficult to get back to our original variables or at least it's it's kind of it's kind of weird-looking so most of them are factorable this one is and we know that we can use a shortcut / ur a it's already simplified and this gives us two factors and they're actually exactly the same we get and here's one of the major mistakes I see students make people oh yeah let's factor it great I'm used to this this is X minus 3 and X minus 3 and this is the one problem with our substitution if we changed from X's and to use menu is your variable that that is what you're dealing with right now it's a very common mistake you probably have seen people make this mistake if you can check and work with everybody else this is gonna happen sometimes because we're so used to deal with X's you go on done I've set this equal to 0 X is 3 it's not and if you claim in 3 up here is not gonna work what happens is that we have we have to get back to till our X's at some point but for right now we're still in the variable U we haven't used our breadcrumbs to get back out of this u forest for right now so when we get here again really really conscious the fact that we're still doing with the variable into U so this u squared minus 6t + 9 it does factor but it's u minus 3 + u minus 3 equals 0 and now we can write this as u minus 3 squared it doesn't really matter because what happens now is we're going to solve this we got this is it like on we got this equal to 0 we have everything in one side we have a the same exact expression one main squared one of the first power we do a substitution to get the same piece called a different variable it is a quadratic because we made sure that this exponent was two this one was one it forms a quadratic for is something that's fairly easy to factor and then we solve that in terms of U so if u minus 2 equals 0 then u equals positive 3 now we're not done our variable that we started with this in terms of X if we want to find x-intercepts haven't done that we found what you intercept we found a Euler set for this function sure but this is not the original so just like we use a substitution to get away from X's into you we're going to use the same exact substitution to get away from use and back into X's that's why it sounds like a trail of breadcrumbs you leave the breadcrumbs on the ground you go do something and you come back but you eventually have to use it to get back out of what you just travel into we've traveled in a new land when we made the substitution now we're going to try to travel back in the X land by using it again so u equals 3 great great but in the back of our head we know that you really means this so u equals 3 then 3x plus 4 also equals 3 this is one of those times when we're only going to get one solution even though we have a power to because we have a perfect square trinomial we have a double root a multiplicity 2 root or in toggle toggle identity videos that we're going to the same exact solution twice if we subtract 4 and divide by 3 we get x equals negative 1/3 if we check that here no it's not going to work if we check that here yes it actually is gonna work so if we do that if we check this this should plug into this expression and give us 0 and satisfy that equation let's try it so negative 1/3 is gonna be 3 times negative 1/3 let's see that's that's negative 1 negative 1 plus 4 that's 3 3 squared would be 9 plug it in here we're still going to get 3 but 6 times 3 is 18 9 minus 18 stay tonight plus 9 years is zero we know that this is a solution and the only solution to this equation and therefore this is a root 0 x intercept of this function that's what we're doing it's just one way to go about doing it that is it better than just distributing everything yeah I think so because at least spent a lot of time doing that to get the same exact answer so it's one way to sort of shortcut some other techniques and treat this as a very simple quadratic for the time being by using the substitution then at the very end once we've solved this in terms of that dummy variables let me just pick you or Y of whatever it's not the variable of your function we have to go back and solve in terms of the variable you've been given in general we're gonna get whatever that exponent is number of answers here we should have got 2 now we have the same thing twice because that devil root but in general that's what we're gonna get so we're gonna move on to the next example dealing with f of X we know throughout the bat this is not a quadratic organ huge the same idea though to make it into a quadratic with some other variable this is a substitution technique so we're facing as promised says find x-intercepts the first thing it wants you to realize is that we probably will have for for something for solutions somehow enough so it could be complex if there's one of them there's two of them it could be two complex there doesn't have to be but in general we're gonna try to find that many solutions of our of our polynomial and so what we're gonna do is we're going to set this equal to zero and when we look at it here's what to tell when a substitution is going to work look at your first exponent look at your second exponent if this exponent is two times this one your substitution is going to work the reason being if this is two times this one and we know the exponents raised to exponents is a multiplication concept so X cubed to the fourth section 212 well then this exponent is two times this one we can write the first term as the middle term raised the second power that's why we check that's why we check to make sure that our exponents work in that fashion so here's a deal one last time we're gonna look at this and say we want to find x-intercepts set it equal to zero then we check out our exponents if it's not a straight-up quadratic maybe we can change it they've been looking to go hey if that exponent for three terms is twice that exponent I can write this as x squared that that looks really good leave that one but then I can write the first one as x squared squared Y because this is exactly two times this that means I can write it as a square of whatever this middle term is that's what we're doing and this right here shows you what your substitution is we know that we can replace this same thing and yes they have to be the same you can't have two different expressions and call them the same variable that's what works so hard to make sure that these are exactly the same we wrote this as the middle term raised to the second power because this is still X to the fourth but it's represented as the same expression here that is where we get our substitution so our substitutions x squared looks pretty good we're just gonna call that u so we did this we said hey two times this one no problem that means they can write in this term as this this factor as this factor to the second power because it multiplied by two we can basically divide that to becomes a power power to for us x squared squared is still X to the fourth then we change it you know we're going to use that u equals x squared to do two things get us away from X's into use so this is replaced by you this gets replaced by u not the three not the power - not the - - not the - one that's the first thing and then later on it's going to allow us to get back into X's this should generally be something that you can factor and this one is of course factorable for us we have this negative two we have this negative three we're trying to add the native to multiply negative three I'm seeing the negative three and one however you want to do that whether you your head or whether you need a technique factor by grouping I've shown you that already I don't really care I like this shortcut that I showed a while back this right here tells you your factors it also tells you your solutions I know for a fact if I change those those are going to be my solution so we're gonna get you not xu u equals 1 and u equals negative 1/3 if you want to do that right now that's fine we're really looking for efficiency at this point I mean we do want to show work because that helps us but this efficiency is speed with accuracy and that's what we're going for a long we don't want to spend a whole lot of time on things that we understand when you're learning them yeah but once we have this down we know we should know back to it really well we should understand that that's what we're gonna get something in terms of U we can do that now if you want to go and show you -1 3 u plus 1 which it was still true 3 u squared plus u minus threes must to u minus 1 and then we set these equal to equal to 0 that's fine also now we subtract 1/3 and simply add 1 we're so close so this is the last step that we need to do so we've looked at this we said that's equal to 0 we understood hey this is three terms that's gonna make a nice quadratic for us if the first exponent is two times the second one after these things are in order we call this the same expression same factor one raise the second power and one not this is the reason why we had to have a this times two is that that's what we had to have it to write the first as a square of the second then we make our substitution we factor something real nice and now we gotta get back so now that we're in terms of u we don't want to end there we were given X's so since we use this to get away from X's and to use we're gonna use it to get away from use back into X's u is x squared like this in the back of our head we know that that's true so U is one but we also know that U is x squared x squared equals one and x squared equals negative third and now we use of other techniques they've already learned so because we understand the screwed method we know that hey x squared equals one means that I can take a square root and we practice it so much if you take a square root you need that plus and minus so the square root of one is one but we take positive and negative one those are two solutions now ask yourself are those real solutions are those x-intercepts or not yeah those are X intercepts because they're real numbers there's two of them their distinctive are the same number twice so these would be two actual x-intercepts of that quartic function that's a power for how they look it might do this up down up down up thing sometimes they just look like a blanket you soar like a parabola but often times would be this little dip in them and so this is what this thing looks like this is going to be two crossings one a negative one and one a positive one now let's check the other one so x squared equals negative one-third and we go hannes take the square root of both sides so when we take a square root and we do a plus and minus oh man we have dealt with the discriminant in the last video we understand that if you have negative square roots we have imaginary numbers which means you have complex solutions this is going to give us X and the right hand side that negative becomes I outside of our radical whether you rationalize or not I don't really care it's at that point right now the point does it understand that this is not giving you more x-intercepts what it does give you is and this is without rationalizing really what we should do is write this is 1 over the square root 3 x square root 3 over square root 3 and end up getting I root 3 over 3 and negative root 3 over 3 that's fine but that's not the point I'm trying right now the plant trying to make it is this number one in general you should get that many solutions but not necessarily that many x-intercepts so whatever the degree of your polynomial is we should be able to factor that over complex numbers into that many solutions and we've done that right now we have that we have four solutions we have one mated one I over three or three and negative either three or three we do need to understand that a negative so the square root gives us an imaginary number so what this shows is that we have two real solutions two x-intercepts and we have two complex solutions which don't give us X intercepts and that's pretty much it so we're we're finding out on set equal to zero make sure that the first term has a power twice the second term then make it written as second term to the second power making shows two should factor it and they get out of it so I made I made a comment a while back about what if this doesn't factor if this isn't factored we get things like this I'm gonna make yourself this come from nowhere with my head right now so let's say that we got let's say we got that as one of our new solutions so we wrote this out we made a substitutional it was a quadratic we had to use the quadratic formula and you had negative one plus and negative one minus square root of three over two and let's say that you was originally x squared like we have in this example but then we have this like okay use x squared U is what we got here we'd have to get back into X's and the only reason why this is not fun to do is because you have square roots inside of the square roots and looks really awkward but it's certainly possible you may run into this from time to time so if that's the case and notice you have another you like that one you do that same thing over here and then you'd still use a square root method we still take that of both sides we get x equals plus and minus this really awkward radical the square root of negative 1 plus square root 3 over 2 just keep in mind that on this example you will end up getting when you do a plus and minus potentially an imaginary number right here that's sort of part of finding because that's an 8 a minus 1 minus a square root of 3 well that's a negative number that's like negative 2 point 7 over 2 well that's still a negative number of square root of negative number this is going to have an eye in it one way we can deal with this is factor out a negative like this hey there's a negative 1 minus a 3 factor the negative then this becomes your eye and that would count for two solutions are they complex yes they are because they have an eye that would not be X intercepts this one over here these are real numbers negative 1 plus square root of 3 which is like 1.73 that's gonna give you point 7 3 and then we just divide like - it's still a positive number instead of square root which means that you would get plus or minus something awkward but something approximating oh and graph rule on an x axis so I know that this was coming from nowhere I don't have an example that would give you one of these right now and I don't really want to go through most of they're gonna be factored this is just if you run into the weird case where you've done this and this is not vegetable you've done this and this is not factorable go right to the quadratic formula you're going to need something that has these sort of solutions well if you have the power x squared equals this take a square root with a plus or minus just watch out one of these might be doesn't have to be but might be negatives instead of the square root fact on the negative : I and then you have to mention your solutions and one of them might be real solutions which we here so this is a this is a real number it's a positive so I have a square root we have two of them there's two x-intercepts I hope that's making sense generally we don't have to worry about this very often but and the problem is is that our textbooks don't give us that because they think it's too hard for us or something but I wanted to show you that that's possible this is not a limited technique it's a very powerful technique it takes things that aren't quadratic calls on something quadratic figure it out and then moves back into other variable that we originally had we can still do that here and so maybe maybe use maybe to practice that's to try to find something that isn't factorable that's a power for a power to and do the quadratic get more these solutions set X rating goes to a practice of square root with the plus and minus notice you still get 1 2 3 4 3 4 solutions which is to our imaginary I hope that makes sense I'm going to come back with three more channels we're gonna go to Fite quickly through and it'll be done all right let's conquer the last three problem just so to be complete on the lesson make sure we're seeing some things but kind of weird and then how to get back into X's and solve the solve for that X so that's we're going to do in every case we notice there's three time there's three terms it's great there's three terms are going to set each of them equal to zero to find X intercepts zeros or roots and we're to go through the process of making a substitution explain why that works and then replacing a part of this equation with you figuring that out so for you and then replace it back with an X so the resultant variable that's that's being questioned so number one we're going to find X intercepts and set our function equal to zero now the only time a substitution is going to work for us in this context of making it a quadratic is if this exponent the first one is 2 times the second X 5 and so we think about it is 2/3 2 times 1/3 yes and so how the maker substitutions is write these with the second expression a second factor just write the first fact the first term has that second factor to the second power what I mean is in is 2 times 1/3 that we can write this as X to the 1/3 power squared because we know that when we take an exponent to the exponent multiply that's why we always check to make sure this power is 2 times this one that says you can take the this excellent it can't break break it down bring it down into 1/3 times 2 so this term itself becomes X to the 1/3 to the 2nd power that gives us this middle term in this location but raised to the 2nd power that's exactly what we're looking for also I use those parentheses to show what I'm going to substitute for to make sure that but I'm seeing that correctly so I'm going to double check to make sure we represent represent the same thing and ready to substitute so I'm look at this thing and I said equals zero this is 2 times this one no problem that means I can write this as 1/3 squared the exponent power we've done that now I have the same exact factor inside my parentheses in both terms that's great and it shows what our substitution is we always want to show what we're doing so we always want to show that trail of breadcrumbs if you will that substitutions that we can go backwards and people who are following us know what we just did so Sentricon actually 1/3 this variable you we're gonna have X to the 1/3 no no rewrite as u minus 7x to 1/3 no that's you that's why it had to be the same so we could call them the same variable and now we're ready to factor we can do this as quickly as possible there's gonna be u minus 5 and u minus 2 we can do any sort of technique that that works for your factoring at this point so even from here if we were if we thought about and wrote that down we know that you would equal 5 and you would equal 2 and we're still in terms of U so we want to get back to X we use the same substitution twice we want to get away from X's into use once we've stalled that get away from yous back into exes so we know that since you equals x to the one-third that u equals five can be written as X to the one-third equals five and X to the one-third equals two now here's the situation a lot of students understand all this stuff get out of here and they get stuck because we feel they realize what we're dealing with so when we see X to the one-third man what in the world help how would I solve that how would an undo that that exponent there's a couple ways that I'd like you to think on it the first way is this remember that anytime we have a fractional exponent that this represents a radical so this is a cube root of x to the first power and I'm going to do the second one in a different way so the cube root of x to the third power sorry cube root of x to the first power equals five how do you undo a cube root well same way with that you'd under the square root except with a different exponent we'd say if we have a root three a power three is gonna undo that so that would be X we equaled 125 and that's true because the cube root of 125 is 5 the other way we can look at this is by leaving it as a 1/3 power and understanding that you can do anything you want to as long as you do the same thing to both sides in fact we took both sides of the 3rd power can't you do that here if we did one third to the third 1/3 times 3 we have an excellent range of X alone we're gonna multiply those powers 1/3 times 3 is 1 X to the first power equals 18 either way you go you're going to get precisely the same technique of solving they're both reasons their power just kinda depends on how that's what we're doing we're solving these is understanding what that really means and then I'm doing it I hope that makes sense I hope you understand the nature of hey whatever you have here is what you're going to use twice 1 to substitute 1 that substitute again to get back to original variables and that's what we have done both of those are actually solutions let's move on to the next one sometimes it looks a little awkward you know well say excellence at all but based on what we just did when we set this equal to zero and we look at and say that's three terms but I have no idea what to do with it I don't want to start solving for square roots here because then I'm gonna exit other side scaling you down a pretty dark brown when I do that instead maybe we can do a substitution if we think that if we think about how radicals are actually exponents and we understand that this is really X to the first power and this is X to those E power over root that's a power 1 over a square root of every 1/2 then we can see that the first exponent is exactly 2 times a second one so I'm going to encourage you to write your radicals as those fractional exponent X 1 so we can see it pretty clearly that's three terms it's in order to one side the first term is positive it's really good and then we say hey you know what that power is two times that one if that's the case I can write the first term as the second power squared because one-half times 2 is still 1 that's what makes this word you say hey that's 2 times that I can write it as one-half squared their problem I'm still gonna write this in parentheses to show what I'm substituting say hey you know what now the in the same exact thing in both of these terms let's make let's call this u or some other variable that way we get a u squared plus 1 u minus 20 equals zero we're gonna factor that as quick as we can again if it doesn't factor you're using quadratic formula you're gonna end with a sort of nasty u equals some sort of radicals but don't worry you can still undo some of these you just square both sides like we would here or cute both sides that we did here and you basically leave it the only problem that we run into and I'll talk about it here in just a little bit is that when we start squaring negative numbers and making them positive run into submission so it's that the same let's see that would be negative 4 positive 5 that adds to 1 multiplies the negative point I'm going to go right to it I know that U is going to equal positive 4 and you need to be U is going to equal negative 5 we plug that in we can check it and really need to 16 plus 4 is 20 21 2005 minus 5 plus 20 minus 20 is zero we know those are solutions in terms of U and now we're going to go back to our X's so because U is X to the 1/2 we need to really realize what X to the 1/2 power means it is a square root that's where it came from and so maybe that's a little bit help more helpful either way I don't really care but if we think about this square root of x equals 4 square root of x equals negative 5 huh how do we undo a square root well a second power would under a square root became should we do that yeah I think we should 20 back let's raise this to the second power this is 2nd power once you do one side view either we get x equals 16 done that's perfectly right that's an x-intercept that's where that function crosses the x-axis at x equals 16 comma zero so the points are at 16 comma 0 and we do the same thing right we go alright this let's square both sides squared this and we got x equals positive 25 because negative 5 squared equals 25 and that's true but it's basically false friends it's based on the fact that you can get the square root of x to equal negative 5 and you can't with real numbers and so what this is this is a non solution for us as far as x-intercepts this is a problem so right into this room kind of time we don't have polynomials some some of the fundamental things that we deal with like hey the exponent equals number roots that that works for polynomials but not some of the square root a and so we kind of fail some of that so we only have one solution this is a false solution that is not true you can't square both sides we need to really be thinkers we think that hey the square root of X can't equal negative five that that doesn't that doesn't work for us we have we have to have like we can't we can't do that a real at all and so that fails our finding real solutions sort of idea that we're dealing with here for X intercepts so just be careful on that one you can tell right it's really easy for students just to square everything here and cancel undoes the square root and then you get 25 and your kid you guys know you know why well because a square root can't equal a negative and that over real numbers and that's that's an issue so I hope that makes sense what I was talking about a little while ago imagine that you've had something very awkward I'm gonna deal with this weekend and imagine you said oh yeah U is X to the 1/2 or the square root of x because that's a little hard to visualize as a decimal and it is I mean that's negative 1 minus negative minus one point seven three is negative two point seven three divided by two so as a little it's negative one point something it's kind of hard to visualize and so you can see that when people get into the process of solving these it's very common for people to go out and square this square that and then I get this whole thing squared and then I'm good to go no because that still is a negative and you you have this square root of x equal to a negative number already that's the best based on something that's false for real numbers and so by squaring it you can't get a real solution from something's not impossible over numbers I know you thought I hope you follow me on that line that this premise is false under real numbers you can't have square root of x equals negative anyway squaring it ain't gonna make it better it's just you're based on some minutes fault so we can't allow that so this is a problem that watch out for so if you've done this and this is not factorable and you do quadratic formula be very careful on solving for your X's when you undo that substitution be very careful on that I've given you now three examples on that here you won't have a problem when you cube both sides you can have a cube root equal to negative tobe mine doesn't even matter even if that's a negative negative five grading to be negative 125 cube roots don't care keep it's okay to have negatives even roots not so much on roots are just fine and that's what I wanted you to see there this happens so rarely but it does happen I want you to be thinking about it thinking about it how hey look that's a square root that's a negative that's a problem just like this would not give us a solution neither with that one now the other one if this had been a plus would have been fun negative 1 plus 4 3 that's positive divided by 2 that's still positive and then when we took that square root it that'd be okay so if we would have had this and say hey yeah let's make the square root of x that's fine that's ok that something is possible in the real numbers so the squared of X could potentially be this positive number square both sides and that would be a valid solution just me just like that that's fine if you want to multiply it you certainly can but that's probably the most concise that we're going to get it so hope you follow me that he'll be very careful on substitution took me to number one and sent him up a right set but make sure you have the first term is the exponent 2 times a second one you make a nice little substitution hopefully you factor it if not then you do quadratic formula end with solutions that look like these under your dummy variable like you when you go back and re substitute you get your X's just be careful what you set those next is equal to if it's outside the domain of once you can bounce our outside the rain for your X function then you have to exclude that with cubics there's no exclusions it's fine this cube root of XC equal any number positive or negative so you just go with it cute little size you're good but when we have things like square roots when we have things like fourth roots sixth roots things to the fourth power if they equal negatives that gives us problems that gives us either imaginary numbers or things that aren't even possible well so be careful with that just check your work very carefully understand what you are doing that if we're trying to do things like squaring negatives that's no-go this gives us no solution if we're squaring positives even if they look funny that's okay you get a solution there so this quadratic would give us one solution for that cubic you could still get 2 because we can have negative sign cube roots that makes sense ok the last example in just a second so that one looks pretty nasty let's go ahead and handle it see if we can find any x-intercepts for this so we're gonna start my sentence equal to 0 like we do for all of our functions that we're trying to find zeros or x-intercepts and then we see what to do with it is everything on one side yes is the first term is it in order exponents are negative but sort of decreasing absolute value that's in order enough and it's but secondly is the first term positive answer is No so one thing we won't want to do all the time when we're trying to find x-intercepts is make your first term positive how we do that factor of the negative divide both by negative one multiply both sides by negative one change those signs understand they just change all the signs or add and subtract everything to the other side of our equation I'm gonna change all the signs right now so let's say when we're multiplying both sides by negative one what that's doing even though this has a negative for our function because these are finding x-intercepts it doesn't really matter whether we reflect or not the x-intercepts themselves or in this case y-intercepts that's the horizontal axis why though the horizontal axis why would they would not change so let's let's multiply by negative one change the signs of all of our coefficients and constants cannot legally tango that that still doesn't look much better dad's nasty what were we gonna do is it a quadratic no because polynomials include quadratics cannot have negative exponents can't we do it substitution to make a quadratic yes anytime your first power is 2 times your second power of an inorder polynomial or expression in this case we can make a substitution so we're looking to see oh hey that's make them to you this thing about like a negative 2 is 2 times negative 1 what that means is we can write this as the first term is the same as the second term but raised to the second power it's this to the second power that's exactly we have negative 1 times 2 is still a to the river to the same thing what we're trying to find this common piece that's the same with the first 1 raised to the second power second raised to the first power that's going to model a quadratic when we do a substitution so that's what we want if it's we've done before and now we're going to substitute we're going to say that u equals this inside in both of these terms it's got to be the same oh we got to use a different variable little bit using we're going to say it's not Y to the negative 2 is y to the negative 1 power and then we're going to substitute so 2 u squared plus 11 e minus 40 that's something looks a whole lot nicer it's something that hopefully expectable if not well then we'd have to do quadratic formula right now and I'm going to show you how that would look at the very end using my favorite negative 1 minus square root here with you unless my favorite but this is factorable madam like very fact we got 11 yet a negative 8 is 2 times negative 40 is negative ad you know it's gonna be is 16 and 5 so if we do negative 5 and 16 that adds to 11 that multiplies to negative 18 so what do we do we need to do factor by grouping or you do another technique or you use a shortcut thing I've done for you and we say this is negative 5 over a this is negative positive 16 over a we've simplified where we have two and left them as fractions this will read your factors to you or it will tell you the opposite sign of your solutions in terms of U so I know that using equal positive 5s and U is going to equal negative 8 we can find it here too this says to you - five for one factor that says 1 u + 8 for another if you want to distribute and check your work now's a great time to do that - u squared + C + 16 months 5 is positive lemon so plus 11 and then minus 40 sit on both equal 0x0 private property and we're really close to that the only thing we have to do is go back into the variable from where from chicane so this is kind of awkward because we had wise this would be like a Y horizontal axis and H of Y so something like is Z or something vertical axis so it's a little weird or finding y-intercepts right now so we have to put this back in terms of Y use what you've done so you mrs. Y to the negative 1 power if u is 5 halves and we accept why they do 1 power into is equal if I house but then we got to realize what that means why did the negative one power like having any negative exponent creates a fraction on that factor so Y to the negative one power is the same thing as if it 1 over Y essentially what that's telling you is that this is the reciprocal of the solution you want so if you just need to reciprocate this to find a why just reciprocate this one also to find the Y that's that's fine is exactly we're going to do so we're going to reciprocate that fraction so why is it equal two-fifths because 1 over y equals 5 halves same thing happens here don't change the sign though so because this is 1 over Y if one of our y equals negative 8y itself equals negative 1/8 the reciprocal of negative 8 over 1 and those are the two solutions we get I hope this making sense to you that we have the substitution should be made it should be kind of flowing well in your head right now that we're just making a quadratic hopefully we're factoring it and then we're undoing that substitution and solving one for whatever variable you have already been given based on substitution to be made now I didn't mention that I've got to talk about this what if this had been something really awkward like we got like u equals that negative 1 plus square root of 3 over 2 something like that and and another weird a weird solution for a substitution I'm just gonna do one of them this time but if you had Y to the negative 1 power equals this so you've got to here it was not factorable you did quadratic formula you got to nasty somethings this being one of them was something else another one and you realize that this is 1 over Y well this is the reciprocal of what you want then you can reciprocate besides the only problem with that is that that has a square root on the denominator and if you have to simplify it now you're certainly talk about rationalizing denominators you've multiplied by the conjugate negative 1 minus square root 3 and you have to distribute it's gonna kill off the square root of the denominator for me I'd say that's fine if we've ever had to make it that far you can still approximate that and get a decimal something you can find y-intercept in this case but if not you'd have to rationalize that to get that square root off the denominator the other one would just be a negative 1 minus the square root 3 over to you do the same thing your conjugate we make it 1 plus square root then you distribute so again you don't deal with that very often but I want to make sure you understand that this technique is robust it's not just it is specific right it's specific in the fact that you have two terms and you have to have the first power 2 times the second power you've got to make a substitution of the same thing in two terms then we hopefully factor do another technique get down to the variable that's your substitution variable your dummy variable and then we undo this whole trail of breadcrumbs by putting our X's back and solving it with every need like taking both sides of third power or a second power watching out for negatives here having a reciprocal of our solution and making sure that we need to rationalize it possible so that's how to deal with that if we have the quadratic other than that the same thing I hope you explained it well enough we use this from time to time to to make our lives a little bit easier and extend the concept of quadratic methods things that aren't quadratic and start alright we'll catch you for another video you
