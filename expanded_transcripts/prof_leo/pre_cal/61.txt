Transcript for: Solving Logarithms with Common Bases (Precalculus - College Algebra 62)
welcome to another video so in this video we finally get down to putting some things together and starting to solve some logarithms and then exponential equations in the next couple videos so when we're solving logarithms i want to say that this would be a special case much like we saw a special case of exponentials we're going to deal in this video with the special case of what would happen if you have an equation where every single term happens to be a logarithm and a logarithm of the same base can we solve it very very simply the answer is yes if we have an equation with all of our terms being logarithms and they're all the same base and we can combine them all and get one logarithm on one side equal to another logarithm on the other side with the same base then we can set the insides of those arguments equal to one another much like we do with exponentials that's what we're going to learn in this video i do want to say that this is not the general case so in the next video we're going to say well what happens if you can't do that well then we're going to need exponentials and in general if you ever want to solve a logarithmic equation you are going to need an exponential to solve that the only x exception of that is if you can have this situation where you have common bases so let's jump right into it what would happen if you have one logarithm equal to another logarithm with the same base well if that's true the only possible way these things could be equal is if their insides x and y or the arguments of these are also equal we saw something very very similar in solving exponentials with common bases we said hey if our bases are equal then our exponents also have to be equal to keep this equation true and that's the same situation we have so the notes i i have down here for you are the same thing as the notes that i just mentioned this only works if every term's a logarithm and only if you have the same bases because then and only then can you set the insides equal these were different bases you'd be done there's not really much we can do as far as a special case is concerned with that now we can do some things with exponentials but not if our bases are different and not if we have a constant so how do you tell this video from the next one if you have a constant up here being added or subtracted not all logarithms or different bases then then this does not work this is a very very special case and just gets our feet wet with how we start thinking about solving these and that we can do it without an exponential in some cases also i want to tell you just a reminder that when we start any sort of a logarithmic equation before we start combining things we really should be thinking of the domain and understanding that in logarithms the inside of your logarithm always has to be strictly greater than zero it can't even equal zero so we're going to do a lot of things up here like combine some logarithms oh yeah we need to know how to do that combine some logarithms with division and we'll be thinking well aren't we breaking an x a a domain rule by doing that no because all of the insides of our logarithms inherently have to be positive to make them work anyway positive means you can't even let them equal zero so anything that does is not okay anything that creates an inside negative is not okay what that means if you want to wrap everything in a nutshell is whatever our solutions are we need to check those to make sure that our insides of our logarithms are not becoming negative by putting them in what that doesn't mean you don't just go cross not every negative i know it's kind of fine but that's not the idea the idea is check your solutions make sure they are making the inside of your your logarithms positive so let's get into it log base 4 of x plus 2 equals log base 4 of 8. this is a very simple concept this is a very special case we notice that there's logarithms everywhere there's one on one side one on the other side and they have the same base when this happens you can set your insights equal that's plain and simply what all of this says and by doing that we get something that's very nice to solve subtracting 2 we get x equals 6. take the time check your work does this make that negative no it looks good and log base four of eight six plus two is eight equals log base four of a and then that's a true statement so that is our one and only one solution what we do from here is when we take a look at our equations and we we see that we have logarithms i want you to start categorizing them do i have all logs with the same base or do i have logs of different bases or some terms that aren't logarithms like constants or other variables well that would be a different category so we're going to take a look at it do i have in this equation all logarithms of the same base no other terms added or subtracted oh yeah that looks good okay i'm going to put this in my special category of i'm going to have logarithms with the same base i'm going to be able to set my insides equal to one another however in order to do that it really does have to look like that this is where all of our combining of logarithms comes in combining of logarithms means that if you have more than one of them with the same base and add or subtract it you can combine them to one logarithm if you have any coefficients in front including that negative you can move those as exponents and so we do that first we make it so that we literally have one logarithm equal to another one nothing added subtracted multiplied divided so that three being a coefficient means that i can move that as an exponent and get log base 2 of x to the third power on the right hand side because that negative really stands for negative 1 you can move that as an exponent and get log base 2 of 27 negative 1 power this is what we're looking for we say hey look at this we got we've got two logs the one on each side there's nothing added subtracted multiply divide it and they have the same base if these are going to be equal it can only be the case that our our insides our arguments are also equal so there's not really much work to show here uh like we don't we don't have to cross anything out we just need to understand that the only way this actually happens much like a common basis in exponentials is if x cubed equals 27 negative 1 power now are there ways to do this with exponentials and the answer is yes if we were really smart about it we could say you know i do anything i want to an equation pretty much as long as i do it to both sides could you treat both of these as an exponent of some other base yes we can now if you pick that base of 2 why a base of 2 why would i do that well the longer that's a base of 2. if i choose this as an exponent of some exponential with the base of two i've inherently matched a pow a um a function to its inverse i've composed them i have a base matching a base that would cancel base matching base that would cancel it would set x cubed equal to 27 negative 1 anyway that's exactly what we're doing we're just making it a little bit quicker so now comes the work usually this is where i stop really teaching and this is stuff that we've seen before so this could be some more basic algebra things like you know just remember that a negative one power means a fraction like 1 over 27 remember that when we have an x to the third power and its iso exiting power we can we can match the power to the root and take a radical of both sides things like a cube root also understanding that if we're doing this with a square root we'd have a plus and minus and we're probably gonna have to watch some of our solutions on that because we cannot let any of these solutions make any of our arguments where we started from negative we don't check our work down here we check our work up there in the original so taking the cube root we get x equals one third we're going to pause for just a second make sure we check this take this plug it into the arguments of your logarithm just evaluate that make sure that they are not zero and not negative so one third in here does not cause us to negative notice what i'm not doing i'm not checking it here why not if that were a 2 and that were a power 2 and this happened to be a negative it would make that look like it's positive but that's not where i'm checking it i'm checking it here where it originally came from so just be careful on that check in your original equations all right let's move on just a little bit we got three more this one's going to be pretty quick the other ones are also fairly quick but we want to make sure that we're seeing these appropriately so here's the way to categorize it we're taking a look at it saying i have logarithms of course am i going to need an exponential am i going to just use common bases if all of your terms and there's four here our logarithms with the same base we can combine them and we are looking to get one logarithm equal to another one with the same base now are there other ways to do this there are and they would involve some exponentials but we'd gather all of our logarithms on one side combine them and a constant on the other side even if it's zero however that combining is a lot more work than we really need if we have terms that are all logarithms just combine your sides individually combine the left side combine the right side and then set the insides equal most of the time that's easier so let's go ahead and do that i'm taking a look at and thinking it only works if i have one log in equal to one log so i'm going to combine my left hand side remember in all those properties we learned if we have two logs that are being subtracted it's going to create one logarithm with a quotient in it and the order is really important all the all the logarithms that were positive or added created factors on the numerator all the logarithms that were negative or subtracted created factors on the denominator we did the same thing over here now we had a base of a base of a i don't even know what that is it doesn't matter because it didn't really matter that was a base of two why not because what we did with it with our exponential is we put two we put two we just matched the base well if we have a base of a and base of a what would we do whatever that base is provided it's valid is we would put a base of a and a base of a it doesn't matter what that base is what matters is that you have the same base that's the key here two logarithms they're equal to another with the same base much like two exponentials equal to one another with the same base we set the exponents or the insides equal to one another here we have the same base that the insides of logarithms equal to one another so we have log base a equals log base a this is only true if our insides are equal and this is what i was saying a little bit earlier right now all that's going to happen is that we have some kind of old algebra remember we can do things like proportions if you have one fraction equal to another fraction you can certainly find a cross product so we're going to multiply these and i hope you remember if if you get a power two or higher your idea in general is unless you can isolate that power two or higher you're gonna get everything on one side you're gonna factor it or use one of those techniques that i've taught you in this class and solve it you're gonna get zero on one side because you're essentially gonna use a zero product property over and over again if you don't have that like we didn't we had that here we i we're able to isolate the power and take cube root we're going to have a power 2 and a power 2. we're going to have to see what happens with this now if we can cancel out the power 2 great but in general we get everything on one side if not if you can cancel the power 2 or if you just have a power 1 don't try to factor it try to solve it correctly we're going to see that right here so x squared plus and minus plus 3x and minus x is plus 2x minus 3. we get this x squared plus 4x minus 12. now right here what i was just saying is we have a power 2. in our head we're probably thinking we're going to factor this thing and that would be true if we didn't have a power 2 that was going to cancel out so we're going to simplify we're going to subtract x squared on the idea let's get everything on one side as soon as we get rid of it though that's no longer a factoring problem that's a linear and that means just subtract your smaller variable get rid of your constant and then divide adding 12. so we work that out we get if we add 12 we get 9 equals 2x divided by 2 we get 9 halves is it okay to get a fraction sure is it okay to get negative sure as long as it doesn't make any of my original arguments negative so we would plug this in there you don't check don't check it here check it here so nine halves minus one well nine halves is what four and a half so that would be like four and a half months old that's positive nine halves plus six that's positive minus two that's positive plus three that's positive none of them are zero none of them are negative this is a valid solution for us and you can you can work it out and make sure that it actually does work but that's going to be just fine really what we're looking for is make sure that does not cause any of your inside your logarithms to become negative or zero now i mentioned something a while ago i really wanna delve into a little bit more why are we able to divide this by this in one logarithm and i don't mean the property the property says we can do that and we can do that why are we able to from a domain standpoint because at this point you should be thinking well wait a minute uh i would have a big problem if x equals negative 6 well that's true because now you have this denominator that if you plugged in negative 6 you would have something over 0 something that's undefined that is true that's a problem but look isn't that the same problem that we have here anyway like if x plus six equals zero if you plugged in negative six you would get a logarithm with zero on the inside logarithms have a vertical asymptote there you can't even plug in zero you can't have zero so we have the same problem anyway in fact it's more restrictive than that we don't we don't just disallow zero this thing can't even be negative so this is strictly greater than zero anyway strictly greater than zero not equal to zero so because the natural domain of a logarithm is already not allowing zero it's okay to do things like make division and not worry about the domain because you're not creating anything additional you already knew that could equal zero can't even be a negative when we put it like this and have that on a denominator it's not it's not creating another you can't equal zero it already can't do that so we're not breaking any rules by doing it challenging to see that that we're not cheating the system it's already there we're just using this and not having to define it further hope that makes sense to you oh this whole thing makes sense you hope you're seeing that yeah if i have two logarithms equal with the same base i can just set the insides equal much like we can exponentials we're just combining on each side setting insights equal we're using all the stuff about combinations and if we don't have all logarithms this will not work we're going to come back with two more examples and move on to a different video let's move on a little bit so in our next example i'm going to start really kind of modeling my thinking about how exactly we differentiate between this and a general logarithmic equation so when we look at it you're just looking really for one thing are all of my terms logarithms with the same base if so combine both sides set the insides equal if not we're going to have to use an exponential we combine both sides as much well actually we get all the logarithms on one side combine as much as we can and have a constant on the other side so here we're looking at the same every single one of those terms is a logarithm of the same base looks really good let's combine all the logarithms that we have on each side could you give everything to one side and combine it yes you could and you would have a zero on the other side could you use an exponential yes and base to the zero power would give you one equal to the inside you can do that i might show that to you on one of these examples just to let you know as a preface for the next video but you don't have to do that so if we have this all we're really looking to do is one logarithm equal to another we have to move our coefficients as exponents first and then combine the logarithms into one so we see a coefficient of 2 that's going to become an exponent on that 5. the same thing is going to happen with this too also i hope that you remember that we don't have to move that negative just the two now you can move the negative and deal with a fraction uh like this one over 10 squared if you really want to but it's a little bit easier to use that minus as a way to create division inside of one logarithm as a fraction rather than use that negative to create a fraction in one logarithm then multiply and get the same fraction anyway that's a little bit more cumbersome to do mathematically so we typically leave the sign unless it's the only sound we saw in the second example if it's the only sign in front it becomes a negative that's okay but typically we'll leave that as a minus rather than choosing it to represent a negative now because we have more than one logarithm on each side we're going to have to combine this via addition or subtraction creating multiplication and division within one logarithm respectively so we look at okay log base 3 log base 3 a minus sign between two logarithms creates a division or a quotient within one same base though added or positive creates numerator factors minus or negative creates denominator factors added or positive creates numerator factors minus or negative crazy denominator factors i've also squared the 5 and square the 10. now now we're ready when we see these logarithms equal same base we know that the only way this happens is if the arguments of logarithms are also equal so we set them equal we get another proportion and we're still going to cross multiply we're not seeing any power twos no no exponent higher than one which means this is a linear and that means that we're not going to be factoring we're just going to be subtracting the smaller variable removing any constants around that variable if we have to we don't have here we don't have anything added or subtracted to that variable term and then dividing and we get one-third we're going to check that so one-third into here one-third into that argument does not make that negative or zero that's a good thing that's constant that's okay one-third plus one is one in the third that's not zero or negative we're okay here and that's ten that's gonna be a valid solution this is what we go through uh when we're when we're solving these now i told you that i was going to do something i'm just gonna do it on a whim uh to see if we can actually do it might be a little bit more cumbersome but i'll i'll show you just as a way to to transition um to the next to the next video but i'm going to do it after we finish up off the idea so i want to keep this cohesive i'm going to show you how to do this a different way with an exponential after i do this one so last example oh man now i'm seeing logarithms everywhere i'm seeing with the same base i'm not seeing any constant term or a logarithm with a different base i'm not seeing anything added over here that's a constant or subtracted that's what we're looking for to determine the difference between common bases and having to use exponentials so we don't have that all right so what are we going to do well we've got to combine all of these to get one logarithm on each side nothing added subtracted multiplied any of that stuff how we do it now you have choices here you can choose you can choose to distribute that 3 and get 3 log base 7 and 3 log base 7 and that 3 in both cases would move to an exponent and an exponent that's true or you can combine these first either way is fine either way is appropriate because we have subtraction of two logs of the same base we're going to create a quotient inside of one one logarithm that's going to be x over two we're also going to choose to move that exponent now i want you to notice what happens on the left hand side now that we really don't need this anymore and this is multiplication this is going to move on as an exponent but it's going to be an exponent on that entire argument so it's going to go right there and when we see that i hope that you're understanding this hope you see it that whether i distribute and then move it as an exponent so x cubed and then 2 cubed and then create a fraction i get x cubed over 2 cubed i'm going to get the same thing here we know that exponents distribute across multiplication division coefficients distribute across addition and subtraction but because that subtraction becomes division one logarithm you're basically distributing over the same things i said this a while back that as long as you're using an appropriate rule you really can't get it wrong whether you distribute the three and then move it as an exponent and then create that fraction or create the fraction then move the exponent then distribute the three either way you're going to get the same same exact result it doesn't really matter just make sure you're following the rules just don't make up your own math that's the most common thing so now now this looks like what we want we have two logarithms the same base we know the only way this is equal is if our arguments or insides are equal if we multiply both sides by 8 now we take a cube root of both sides remember cube roots do not need plus or minus the cube root of 128 you really need to simplify that so we're thinking what's the largest perfect cube that i have inside of there that mult that's a factor of 128. that'd be 64. so 64 times 2 the cube root of 64 is 4. the cube root of 2 is well really can't simplify simplify that anymore so we get 4 cube root of 2. that's a positive if i plug it in here that's positive that's a constant that's a constant this is not creating any sort of a domain issue for us it fits the bill for for what we need here that's our only valid solution so i hope this makes sense on the process of identifying firstly when you're going to be able to set your arguments equal if you have all terms there are logarithms with the same base combine it and set the insights equal now i mentioned to you that in the next video we're going to do some logarithms that require exponentials i'm going to preface that right now with this example so let's take a look at it under a slightly different lens now could we use an exponential right here like i mentioned before yeah you really could you can make these both exponents on a base of three base three log base three your you just compose a function on its inverse simplify base three log base three functions inverse you simplify remember what you do to one side you have to do to the other so if you have logarithms of the same base you'd have the same base of an exponential that's the only reason why this actually works i hope that you're getting that if you have different bases you could not apply the same exponential to both sides of your equation you have to have something else to do it wouldn't work that would be a big problem for us so same base is why you're able to do both a three and a three you have to do the same thing to both sides of your equation now here's a different lens what if instead of just combining these as two logs on each side we got all the logs on one side and we combine them to one logarithm and a constant on the other side this is where the next video is going to go with it i want you to see it now to see that we get the same thing so what if we did that well because all of our terms are logarithms if we got everything on one side what would we have another side well we have zero that's okay that is a constant so i'm going to subtract these we'll add that one over to the other side so so we've subtracted and added now hang on all this stuff only works if we really combine to one logarithm on one side otherwise we can't really use the process of changing to an exponential we can't really set insides equal if we have more than one logarithm on one side so we're still going to combine which means we're still going to move our coefficients as exponents first taking the liberty of squaring the 5 and squaring the 10 to get 25 and 100 respectively so that i can omit one step but check it out all that stuff about combining was really important because when we combine we should be able to do this all the time we should understand that all these algorithms are added or subtracted from one another they all have the same base you can create one logarithm not a logarithm over a logarithm that was change of base one logarithm with a fraction inside and i taught you my preferred technique my preferred technique was not doing each little piece at a time just take a look at the whole thing and saying all the positive logarithms and things being added are going to create factors on your numerator all your negative logarithms or logarithms being subtracted will create factors on your denominator just make one fraction so positive numerator minus denominator minus denominator plus numerator now we can clean it up a little bit and you really don't need to distribute this right now but you will be doing it eventually i probably should have done that i always tell you don't distribute denominators even wrote a song about it but i do want you to notice something please get this this is going to be the exact process for the next video when you see lots of logarithms and you have a constant that's not a logarithm like if we would have had seven there or something we are going to gather all our logarithms on one side the non-zero constant on the other now this happens to be a zero constant because we could have done it a different way but if you don't have this way available to you you just take that constant put over here on the on the right hand side or left side whatever one side get all your logarithms combine them to one all your logarithms into one get your constant on the right hand side and then take a look at it can you write this as an exponential because if you can then exponential is the inverse of a logarithm and it will solve this logarithm identify what your base is well logarithms have separated the base from the exponent the base is three the exponent is zero so our base raised to the exponent will have to equal whatever our inside of a logarithm is that's why we had to combine those because you can't set base equal to base to exponent equal to all these different logarithms at once does it make sense we need one logarithm to be able to do that so base exponent and exponential put those together and then sets it equal to the inside of your logarithm that's what exponentials do they are the inverse of some logarithm so this is the way that we really deal with a logarithmic equation in general well which way is easier i don't know there this one doesn't require an exponential this one's a pretty streamlined but it only works sometimes doesn't it only if you have two logs in the same base one on each side this one's going to work all the time and especially when we have a non-zero constant if you have a zero constant understand that you really don't have a constant you have all terms that are logarithms so now we think through it what's three to the zero power well i know that anything to the zero power is one oh how do we get rid of denominators we're going to multiply both sides our denominators simplify this you can distribute and we're seeing exactly the same math from right here same exact stuff we're still going to get one one-third so are there two ways to do it yes but special cases typically make things a little bit easier why i wanted to give that to you was because the next video we're going to start basically right here the idea that if you have a constant that is not any logarithm so that term that's not a logarithm just some constant we're going to gather our logarithms constant on the side combine and then use an exponential because in general it takes exponentials to solve logarithms there's only a special case if you don't have that constant and you have the same base i hope it makes sense i'm gonna see for the next video when we start solving general logarithmic equations have a good day you
