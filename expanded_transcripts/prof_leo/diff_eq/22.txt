Transcript for: Solving Differential Equations with a Composition (Obvious) Substitution (Differential Equations 22)
hey welcome to another video in this video we're going to continue talking about how to solve differential equations with usually separation of variables or our linear differential equation techniques but involve some substitutions so we're gonna we're gonna do that with something that that we like to call obvious substitutions and the first thing I want to say is that obvious does not always really mean obvious so kind of like in a textbook you read through it and say the rest of the prim is obvious you go that that's that's not obvious to me at least so I'm gonna show you what to look for when we deal with these other substitutions so this class of of equations differential equations might not perfectly fit homogeneous model or Bernoulli or a embedded derivative but maybe it's an obvious substitution so I'm going to show you what that means I'm going to show you three examples on how to approach these and hopefully that'll that'll make sense to you so if you remember our goal with substitutions it's put it in a proper form use some sort of a substitution to change it into either a separable equation or a linear equation and then we can use the techniques we've already learned or a basic integral so let's look at these obvious substitutions find out what they mean and then do a few examples so sometimes we can get some substitutions that are obvious here's what you're looking for here's what obvious means obvious means that what you're going to substitute is typically a composition so look in your differential equation for a composition what a composition means is you have one function inside of another form of a function and we're going to look at that right there in just a bit so you're looking for a composition like in this case well hey you have four X plus y inside this other function of something squared that's a composition of functions we're going to identify that as some V I wanted to tell you right now that this technique is very very very similar to the homogeneous equations that we just learned how to do so in that we made a certain type of substitution we did Y over X so okay that's going to be V every single time and then if we do that we'll solve for y every single time that we'll take a derivative every single time and it'll be the same every single time this is very similar only this time the derivative isn't always the same what you're substituting is always the same what you're substituting is just a composition just like homogeneous equations that was a composition that was Y over X and we changed that into B that would have been a composition something inside of another function so we chose a basic composition here we're doing the same thing it's just we're not always choosing Y over X we're choosing some composition and hoping that it works so we're gonna be looking for a composition something that you can solve for y why is that important well if we choose a composition and say that let's let's find a composition let's call it V okay if we solve that for y no problem then when we take a derivative we can make this I same idea homogeneous this double substitution idea call your composition V then if you take a derivative after solving for y you have something you can replace dydx with because you can't have that Y anymore so right our main idea very similar homogeneous you're looking for a composition we're solving for y we're gonna replace all of the Y's from the composition and the dydx by the derivative so just like homogeneous you can't have any wise left over let's see how that works we'll run through a few of them and then we'll call it good so let's take a look at this first order differential equation we're looking at and we're going to allow that that isn't separation of variables I really don't want to distribute anything doesn't look homogeneous or if it is it take a long time to get there it doesn't look linear I've got a power to so what in the world could I do here this is one of those cases when we have a composition of functions that wraps up all of our wise that's big all of the Y's inside that composition that's right here so that for X plus y we can consider that to be a composition so one of these obvious substitution technique or this obvious substitution technique says take that composition where we have a function of x and y or just a function of Y whatever it is inside something that's raised to a power or this grouped all together or that you can call it V let's try that so we're going to take our compositions say let's call that me why not one more time but that's exactly what you did with homogeneous it's just that the composition was always the same the composition was always Y over X then we solved for y we just said y equals VX well if it's time if we pick a composition that we can solve for y let's solve it for Y and the reason being is that we're about to change our differential equation sure everything that involves y's here is going to be called V and that's fine but also we need to change that Y so when we did homogeneous we said we've got to have all the Y's wrapped up in that V we also need a way to change dy DX into DV DX and that's exactly what this is gonna do for us so we've wrapped up our Y's in a composition no problem we have solved for y that's why this stuff is important we gotta have something softer Y and then we're gonna take a derivative so dy DX equals one big note you might want to write down before at least realize right here this is always going to involve a chain rule just like when we solved those homogeneous equations what I mean by the chain rule is that right there that's a function of X or Y so when we take this with respect to X so we're taking a derivative of Y with respect X well we have the derivative of B is 1 sure but there's a hidden function in there possibly so we're gonna have the derivative of e is 1 times DV DX because it's an implicit derivative just like from calc 1 we typically don't even write the 1 we just realize that that's a chain rule we're gonna write DV DX minus 4 because we're taking a derivative with respect to X we don't need to write DX DX that's just 1 so we don't really care about that so we're gonna make this substitution and now we have everything lined out really like homogeneous it's just it's not always Y over X so we're gonna start changing this we know that we called this inside function this for X plus y we're going to call that part of V so we're gonna get a V squared but because we wrapped up all the whys in that substitution we also needed to get rid of dy/dx all right that's why you pick something we can solve for y because if we can solve this substitution for y then we can take a derivative rap of that and get dy/dx equals some function in these and X's so we're going to make our substitution on the right hand side this part is V so we'll get V squared on the left hand side we also needed to replace dy/dx and it's right here so dy/dx says don't write dy DX I don't want dy DX because I have three variables right now and I can't integrate like that I can't solve like that so so instead of dy/dx let's use our second part of the substitution one substitution for the composition another substitution for the dy/dx in this case we had DV DX minus four now what's gonna happen just like on the homogeneous equations is you're going to get something that's that's a separable equation so we're gonna try to group our variables are these DV on the left are X's or constants DX on the right so if you notice that from homogeneous we were always getting the separable equations we were always separate or variables and integrating same thing is gonna happen here so one more time all the way through and then after this I'm not gonna really repeat that a whole bunch I probably will because I'm Leonard Leonard does that but the idea is look for a composition if we can't make it into a homogeneous look for a composition you solve for y no problem solving for y take a derivative and do a double substitution all the Y's have to be wrapped up in your B it has to be wrapped up in here otherwise we'd have three variables that does not work so wrap this up in a V no problem take a derivative of Y when you that's why we had to solve for y and then we can replace all of our Y terms with some sort of E and our dy/dx with whatever the derivative of your substitution when you solve for y actually is so let's take a look at that if these are going to be separable if these are going to be separable we're gonna have to add the four and divide remember separable equations are stuff that's multiplied together not added or subtracted so we're trying to get separable here alright hey you know what if I move this whole piece divide both sides by B squared plus four we can get 1 over V squared plus 4 DB equals 1 DX or just Y X and now that's great that that's the form of separable equation we've made this so we have these DV made this so that we have constants D X if we integrate both sides right sides easy right so it's going to be X plus C on the left hand side and you can do that a number well at least two ways I know of you can do that with the trig sub if you want to take a lot of time or you can do with an integration table at this point your math careers there's nothing wrong with these an integration table that's okay I would do it for sure when you think about this is it at an inverse if that was one you'd get tan inverse of just V so tan inverse would be when that number is not one you start doing stuff like this okay well I know it's gonna be tan inverse of V that would be if this number were one but you can think of it like this this is really a fraction with the square root right there so you go alright tan inverse if that was one then d square root of one both places if that was four then be square root of four both places so on the left hand side we do have 10 inverse that should look really really familiar with you we've done it several times even in this class we've done that but here it since it's not one usually you'd get one over the square root of one if this had been B squared plus one that's what you get but now it's one over before no problem that had to say 1/2 it gives us a tan inverse still it gives us V over 2 and then on the right hand side we just have this X plus c1 let me call that C sub 1 just because we might be changing it as a matter of fact we're going to right now we're going to multiply both sides by 2 just get rid of it I don't see anything else I'm going to multiply before I start doing the the tangent on both sides so I'm gonna call that M are we to find that we're gonna find 2 C sub 1 let's just call this C it's still a constant so no problem now you'll notice something this I did this a lot on the homogeneous equations also I've solved it as much as I could for V where it was reasonable and then I substituted back in that substitution we're gonna do the same thing so yeah we call the composition to be ya we solve for y because we need 2 ydx we'd find dy/dx we make ur substitution so all of our wise becomes some sort of V our dy/dx becomes some derivative that you just did from that substitution and then you solve it with the separable equation okay we got it we go all the way down to here well we're gonna have to get back to y's and x's those of these gotta go so we use a substitution one time to get away from wise we use it again to get back to wise so we're gonna have to do that but then we can do it anywhere you want but I like to do it as much as possible after I solve for V if that's reasonable to do so let's try to solve for V so right now I'm going to do tangent on both sides of tan inverse of V over 2 equals 2x plus C then V over 2 has to be tangent of 2x plus C you know what I can even multiply by 2 so V equals to tangent 2x plus C but now we're writing I mean obviously have suffered for V well we've got to solve for y and so let's go ahead we use the substitution one time a for X plus y to get away from why it's called V now we're going to say V is for X plus y are you seeing why we might want to wait to plug that in to wait to solve for B if we can't to plug that in I'd done it I did a lot on the homogeneous just as wait for a little bit let's solve it for me as much as we can it's reasonable and then plug it in because if we start putting it we could I mean we could have done it right there and right there right there right there but that's just a lot of extra writing that we really don't need so if we wait for a little while sometimes it's a lot nicer to deal with because right now instead of writing this whole time all you're going to do is subtract 4x and we've solved for y explicitly so we get this y equals two tangent 2x plus C minus 4x what I want you to ask yourself right now are you seeing that this is really similar to the idea of homogeneous you are making a substitution it's actually still a composition just like homogeneous was you're still solving for y you're still taking a derivative you're still using dy/dx as a substitution and you're still using the idea of wrap up all of your Y's in a V then make a separable equation and solve it it's pretty straightforward this word obvious is deceiving it does not have ahem sometimes they're not that obvious but what you're looking for you're looking for some sort of a function like a square root or something to a power or a denominator or something that you can take all of the pieces sorry that the inside has all of your wise call that V something you can solve for y and then this hopefully will work for it it's something that you should try we're going to do two more examples we're going increase the difficulty last one has some integration techniques that I want to show you adjust and remember we're gonna sort of refresh your memory on these things as we go let's try another one so we're looking at this we're trying to figure out if it's something that we can do directly with a basic technique something we can substitute homogeneous or something that we can do another substitution for so when we take a take a look at that differential equation it doesn't strike right off the bat something that's separable X's and Y's are grouped together and that factor doesn't look linear because if I start distributing I have dy/dx in both places that wouldn't work that great it doesn't look home ingenious because I don't want to start dividing by X's and Y's maybe I could but maybe there's an easier way so when we have this idea of what I'm trying to do is just getting way too hard like homogeneous might not be the best thing to do here maybe it would work I don't know but maybe there's an easier way and one of the obvious substitutions is look at your wise if your Y's are in some sort of a another function even if they're just a factor that contains everything try to one of these obvious substitutions so our Y is together with our X so X plus y sure but it's all wrapped up in one factor that's a composition right there that has all of our wise in it that's why I'm asking you to look for right now let's do a substitution let's call V equal to X plus y let's see what happens hey that's a good thing that mean that's something that we can solve for y and that's important why that's important you should know right now why it's important is because we need to do two things here we're gonna wrap up that composition as V otherwise have to be there but then we also have to change our dy/dx which means you're gonna have to solve for y to do that so we looked at it said doesn't look familiar to me that has all of our wise in it that is a composition let's call that V let's solve for y we know that we're going to replace this with me but we also have to replace dy/dx so let's find dy/dx so Y we solve for y so we do this writing here we know that we're gonna have a chain rule implicitly on V minus one because a derivative of X with respect to X is one and now we're ready for our substitution so we realize that this will be V so X plus y gives us V so right now V we're not gonna have to do Y the X anymore in fact we found that regular we're going to have DV DX minus 1 and then equals 1 so the substitutions can look at confusing if you're not getting it so I'm going to slow right now just so it makes sense where these things are coming from because this whole thing is going to change drastically the only thing it's gonna be here is 1 that's the only thing that that's from the original difference equation so right hand side we've got one left hand side we're gonna call this part V we're gonna call it dy/dx exactly what we found when we took the derivative of our substitution DV DX minus 1 also you don't get to just assume this is V times just DV DX the dy/dx is this whole expression you need parentheses there so let's try to let's try to go on when we made our substitutions we know that all this stuff is DVD X's and B's and exits there's no lies up there and that's what we want so we know that we're trying to get a separable equation let's try to make a separable equation out of this let's divide by V at least that way we've got DV DX minus 1 with no B's over there so remember if we're trying to get separable equations to separate our variables we need to first group everything together as a product or a quotient and that -1 screws us up right now and we can't just add it that's why it was important for you see the parentheses that it's all multiplied together so you either distribute that probably not a good idea well you could do that then you would add the V or sort of subtract the V divided by V that's that's fine too you can easily do but here I chose to divide by V I'm trying to get everything together as a product or a quotient that right there is not a product or quotient because I'm trying to get a separable equation so let's add one that's still not a product or quotient let's find a common denominator we know that 1 over V plus 1 is the same thing as 1 of the V Plus V over V V over V is 1 or we now have a quotient that's what we're looking for when you try to separate our variables we're looking for a D whatever d x equals some sort of product or quotient because then we can just multiply or divide to group our B's TVs in this case on one side our X's DX's with our constants on the other side so we're going to multiply by the reciprocal here or you think divided by X plus 1 multiplied by X however you want to think about it we need rvs on the left you know DX on the right that looks really well doesn't look great but it looks like something we can do so we have integral of V over V plus 1 DV with integral of X balanced easy this one is well we might have to think about that a little bit it looks deceitful it looks deceivingly easy it's not necessarily that easy we could try a substitution but what are you gonna do with that V so u equals V plus 1 we could do there's a couple ways we can think about this one way that you could do this you could do u equals V plus 1 D u equals DV you know well that doesn't help me at all right but if you solve for v v equals u minus 1 then you can create this V is U minus 1 V plus 1 is just you and it would still be you and then you can separate this into two fractions you over u minus one over u that's one minus one over u that would be u minus Ln U and you can totally do that that's one way to go that's the substitution technique I prefer doing that so this is fine if you like that do it cool I wanted to this idea because I want to show you it's possible I use it a lot if I can so what we did is absolutely fine let's check this out one I just force this to me that separable fraction already I mean how they separate that I can't separate the V plus one yeah you're right but watch what you could do for could you just add and that work could you just add one well no could you add one and subtract one verify that that's still V on the numerator yeah but now it's kind of interesting because I can choose to group this as V plus 1 over B plus 1 minus 1 over V plus 1 is there really any difference in doing that besides a substitution no not really it might save you a step because you have the not that you don't have to substitutions you got to go back from you but this is gonna look and should look exactly the same as what I just erased from the board V plus 1 over V Plus Ones 1 minus 1 over B plus 1 that's that's nice that's just like 1 minus 1 over u oh my god U is even that V plus 1 it's the same thing so either way you want to go with that cool just want to show you this technique because it's saves you a little bit of time and it's kind of interesting and we use in other place is so integral of one well that's a V minus integral of one over V plus one that's Ln absolute value V plus one divided by the derivative of B plus one which would still be one so just Ln absolute value V plus one here we could be here we get Ln that's a baby plus one I drew that cool on the right hand side we get X plus C we're looking pretty good so far so let's see what else we can do and would that be easy to solve for V well if I start solving for V I'd have to add an L and on both sides or subtractive V and that's going to separate my fees I can't factor out a V hmm this is not one that I'm gonna want to solve explicitly so this is about as good as we can make it without going crazy and without getting these just everywhere so right here this would be an appropriate time to plug in our substitution again so we substitute one time to get away from wise into these and now we're gonna substitute another time to get away from these in back into wise so since we can't solve this effectively or efficiently for V we're gonna plug in our r.v right now so we use it one time to get away now we're gonna say hey if that V was X plus y now we can substitute that back so we replaced X plus five with V now we're gonna place a V with X plus y so here we get X plus y minus Ln absolute value X plus y plus one don't forget that about that plus one this V is X plus y plus one equals x plus C there's only one more thing we can do we have an X here we have an X here we can subtract X so if we subtract X we get Y minus Ln absolute value st. equals C that's about as good as we can get we can't really solve for y that efficiently here so we're gonna leave it implicit and that's a solution to our first-order differential equations I'm hoping that you're seeing this substitution technique I'm hoping you're seeing on it's a lot like homogeneous where we just had a composition but now that composition is not the same thing all the time it can be wherever you have all of your wive's wrapped up into something you can substitute and solve for y that way you replace that composition and dydx stick around for one more we have a kind of a longer problem here that we'll go through kind of fine has some different integration on new all different things that we can do with integration on it alright let's wrap this up with another problem like again this the first part of it we're gonna look at this as a composition we're gonna make a substitution I'm doing this problem so you see another integration issue that we were gonna have so last example on the the obvious substitutions and hopefully by this time they're looking a little more obvious to you okay I see what you talk about a composition here I see that you have a square root I see that you have something that incorporates all of our wise in there that you could just wrap up as a V and take it out and that's exactly what we're gonna do so when we take a look at this differential equation yeah this is the good you know it doesn't look separable X's and Y's are both under the same function that's the point of a composition it doesn't look linear same reason does it look like a homogeneous maybe but maybe there's something nicer maybe there's something that we can say you know what all of those X's and Y's all those Y's in particular are wrapped up inside of a composition let's make a substitution and just get rid of it all so if we look at our composition we can solve it for Y that's an important piece so if you make that substitution you also need to be able to get rid of that dydx let's call that whole inside that whole composition wannabe we can solve it for y let's do it so we can find dy/dx to substitute for the other side of our equation let's find dy/dx we always get a chain rule so DV DX minus 1 derivative of 1 is 0 so now we're ready for a substitution you should try it right now you should see if you can take this substitute the to appropriate pieces and figure out what we have so for us we have the square root we didn't substitute for that it's the composition the compose or the inside part that we're actually substituting so on the right hand side we're still gonna have a square root inside that square root we no longer have X plus y plus 1 we wrap all of that all in that composition into V on the left hand side we actually no longer have dy/dx we solved for y we took a derivative dy/dx is this piece let's do that now in your head what I want to build there I want to build that when you do these substitutions based on composition that includes homogeneous that includes substitutions that might seem obvious and one other one you're trying to get separable equations which means this thing got to go we're gonna have to add one so that we can separate our variables in trying to get those that separable equation those separable variables we need to group everything on one side that's important because well if you're if you're trying to get a separable equation you need stuff that's multiplied or divided and this right here would become its own factor you go well how's that a factor you can think of as multiplying by one but for a separable equation to work you need to be able to get all of your stuff that's multiply and divide it that way you multiply everybody get your variables on one side with V you're beat on one side with V excellent other side with X with pluses and minuses we can't do that so if you're gonna try to make a separable equation you need if there's any pluses or minuses they have to be inside one factor that right there is your is your one big factor so we're gonna divide both sides by the square root of v plus one DV and then equals DX that's pretty good that's that's exactly we want we want to be able to group all of our bees as on one side DV as a product next to DV and then we want or a quotient next to DV and we want products next to DX that way we can go ahead and integrate both sides on the right hand side that's nice on the left hand side that that's kind of nasty so let's walk through it and think about what the world we might want to do with that is it a basic integral no not really today I separate my fraction I can't do that either because with two terms of the denominator can I do a basic u sub not really because we don't have anything to get rid of that square root of E is it let's see treat sub you know the screw doesn't go the way across there's no power to in it's a problem they have partial fractions not in the square root maybe I could do like a double so and this is going to look a lot like the last example so let's do a substitution let's see what we have and see if we can re substitute from a factor of B that that gets in there that we don't want so let's try that so if we have u equals square root of v plus one well we need to find EU that's one-half V to the negative one half DV and let's solve this for R DV so we have 1 over 2 square root of B DV and if we multiply both sides we get 2 square root of v d u equals V V so well then doesn't look good that's not what I have here yeah that's that's true that that's not what I really want I don't want to screw to the in there but I'm gonna have one maybe we can use this to get rid of that square root of these so let's see what happens here we have our integral here we got a 1 that's not a problem on the denominator we called all of this you but then our DV so we said square root of V plus 1 that's you so we got that but we solved for DV so DV is not gonna be DV anymore it's me too square root of the D you I had a one here but since I replaced the DV with two scurvy D you we can put that in place of our 1 1 x 2 square root of e is to square root of e now we always know in integrals that your variables have to match up with your ingredient variable so that square root of YZ gotta go well that's what we use this substitution to different times we say well you equal square root V plus 1 then square root of e equals u minus 1 oh well then we take our 2 out and we say the square root of V is U minus 1 over u now that's something that we can separate into two different fractions and this looks identical to the last example that we did go this is this pretty nice u over u is 1 minus 1 over u that looks pretty good do you and you go ahead and we can integrate one one thing here when you integrate and you get you - Ln absolute value of U that 2 is so important that 2 is really important for us I know I'm knitting the right-hand side it's just the integral of DX so we're gonna get X plus C wheel we all know that but the two I want you to focus on you cannot just forget the two you can't just put the two right there it's gonna screw everything up for you alright that to said you're gonna multiply that 2 by whatever you got for your integral it's going to distribute so we know that this is U minus Ln absolute value u we know it came from a substitution let's put that back so square root of V plus 1 looking pretty good - Ln absolute value square root of e plus 1 equals on the right hand side all of this was just equal to integral DX and integral DX and integral DX so that means we're going to the X plus C sub 1 some of you might be wondering why I do see sometimes and why do C sub 1 I'm looking at and I'm thinking am I gonna have to modify that arbitrary constant if I don't I just could see if I do like either I divide or I add or subtract constants I'm going to be changing that so I'm looking ahead seeing whether I'm going to change it or not in this case I'm going to now man that looks that does not look easy to solve for V so I'm gonna do one thing I'm going to distribute the two and I want to show you something here some of you you might be getting answers you get this looks man it's so close but something's wrong why would I get an exact answer sometimes things like this happen so this this is fine this is fine but that too that's a constant and if you were to subtract that constant that's a constant - if you subtract a constant from a constant you're still gonna get a constant and since it's an arbitrary constant and we don't care what it is a lot of times people will do this and say that's a consequence of tracted this constant over here that's still a constant let's call it an arbitrary constant system doesn't matter imagine this Savior well this to the infinity in the other person says this to the infinity plus one you go that plus one doesn't do anything exactly if you don't care what constant this is subtracting two is not going to make a difference so we don't care what constant that is as long as it's constant this happens quite a bit so if you're getting answers that have you have constants and they don't probably they're adding or subtracting and grouping that as one arbitrary constant so we have our two we have our square root of the - two Ln absolute value square root of e plus one equals x plus C that is just nasty to solve for B if it's even possible it would be very difficult to do I don't want to start dividing my twos that would be still a constant but that laughs I'm not gonna do that I can't really solve four V's here so the only thing that's left for us to do is use our substitution that it gave us bees to get back or X's and Y's so and sure enough when we look at it hey bees inside a square root we started with that's our composition let's just put X plus y plus one that's what V was defined as and even though it's not explicitly solved for y that still counts that's fine that's an implicit solution to our differential equation kind of nasty but I'm hoping that you see open that you see what this obvious substitution technique can do it's very similar to homogeneous in that you have a composition that you're calling V in that composition you have formulas solved for Y in that composition it has to include all of your instances of Y when you solve for y you can substitute for not only composition but also for the dy/dx that's great so all B in terms of V and X then we want a separable equation so we group our variables on one side as factors or as fractions we separator these DVS on one side X's D X's on the other side this constant doesn't count as a constant that you'd want to leave here on the exercise because it's added and we that's not the constant we're talking about when I said I said constant factors can be left there well if we're talking about several equations you need factors stuff that's multiplied we're all pluses and minuses are in those parentheses then we go ahead and move that to the other side after we get several equations hopefully it's an integral that doesn't have to be easy but hopefully it's interval we can do and then if we can we try to re substitute for X's and Y's and solve for y if we can't then we just reach substitute for Nexus and Y's and we leave it that's a balance see that's about as good as we get unless I make some mistake then we get this as an implicit solution for a differential equation I hope this making sense I'll see you for the next video when we talk about Bernoulli equations you
