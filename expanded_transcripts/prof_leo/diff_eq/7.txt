Transcript for: Problem Solving with Velocity and Acceleration (Differential Equations 8)
all right as promised we're gonna do a lot of examples right now they're just for practice you really already have a lot of the ideas down about differential equations and solving them with the most basic technique we have which is integration I get rid of plus C but now putting it in practice sometimes can be a little intimidating so I'm gonna do ten examples we're new ten word problems that come from a variety of textbooks or that I've kind of changed a little bit to fit our situation they're gonna go from the easiest to the hardest if you're if you're getting this don't be afraid to skip a couple going to the last ones those are the most difficult ones but if you stick through it and stick with me here I think they'll help you make a lot of sense out of this just the way that you approach of the way you think about them is important otherwise even though the math isn't all that hard it's stuck on the simple stuff but what is it even talking about so we're gonna go through about ten of them let's start right now so let's say you're you're sit on the ground and you decide for some reason just to shoot a slingshot right above you and then hopefully move because you're not idiot and you don't want to eat in the face with a slingshot because that hurts ask me how I know um so anyway you know that your slingshot shoots this ol projectile upward so positive at forty nine meters per second what's the maximum height you're going to get out of that assuming that you're on the ground well we need a little bit more information than that so we know what planet we're on now we're gonna certainly assume that we're on planet earth here so assuming that we know that acceleration is constant when we're talking about things flying acceleration is negative 9.8 meters per second or negative 32 feet per second squared and on each of those cases well then look at your problem or do you want the feet or meters since we're dealing with meters we're gonna take acceleration as a constant negative 9.8 meters per second squared also we're assuming that we're sitting on the ground so if we're on the ground so we kind of launched it maybe you're a little hole on your you launch it so it's leaving the slingshot at zero feet those are two really important these is information that we need to have to solve our problem here but it's stuff that you're inferring we're on planet Earth acceleration of gravity is negative 9.8 meters per second squared reason meter shouldn't start with meters and you're on the ground let's say that your height is zero let's start this from the last couple videos we know that acceleration is the second derivative of position we're going to start taking integrals so integral of acceleration in all these cases you're going to start with acceleration so keep that in mind every time accelerations first take an integral of that so if we integrate our constant acceleration we're going to get our velocity is 1/8 of 9.8 T plus c1 now we have an initial velocity we know that this projectile in our slingshot 49 meters per second that's something we can use at time zero we're going 49 so our velocity is 49 when our time is zero and that lets us solve for c1 just like before so we augment our equation with this that's negative 9.8 T plus 49 that's our velocity function now starts thinking ok well wait a second what's our what's our maximum height how in the world we're gonna find that do we need position to find that we do but think about what happens when you shoot stuff up in the air if you've ever done this if you shoot some of the air it's gonna have positive velocity and then it's going well it's going to have a positive position and it's going to reach a maximum height so you come back down have to use that word it's going to have a positive velocity and a negative velocity so it's going to come up it's going to come down at the top its velocity is zero so if we want to find the maximum height that's a height that's attained by this then we set this equal to zero it's gonna give us the time that we reached its max so so again if that made sense to you you shoot something up it's gonna have a positive velocity it's gonna stall out for the briefest of moments so you have a negative velocity at the very very top our velocity is zero so think critical points this is first derivative critical points that equals zero same sort of idea if we solve this ad 9.80 to both sides divide by 9.8 we get five so five seconds what that means to us is that our velocity is going to be zero after five seconds that's exactly what you get here's velocity here zero five seconds so we're going to reach the max the maximum distance away after five seconds now that's important information but we need a position function to plug that into to figure out what our max height is if we integrate this one more time we're going to have that position so our position function when we integrate this is going to be negative 4.19 squared so we add 1/2 X 1/2 plus 49 T plus c2 well in order to figure out our max height we need to figure out our initial position now we were still on the ground so we're assuming our height is 0 at time 0 so our C sub 2 is just gonna be it's gonna be 0 obviously we're still on the ground so our position function how far away we are with respect to our time here is negative 4 point 9 T squared plus 49 T plus 0 there's nothing there so here's our idea we start with the acceleration we inferred that we're dealing with the earth so we have negative 9.8 meters per second meters squared meters because we're given a unit of meters we do an integral we find velocity that's needs an initial velocity to figure out our C sub 1 which we have but then we think about how a maximum height is going to be obtained when our velocity is 0 when our velocity is 0 so that's five seconds away from when we shot it so shoot one two three four five ridge of the peak comes back down so when we integrate one more time we have our position we use our initial position to get our equation and now we can say oh hey our position our maximum diffs distance away happens after five seconds let's just plug in five so our position after five seconds we know that's the maximum distance away let's just click by them I've worked it out maybe you can work it on your own it's around 120 two point five meters so we sit on the ground we shoot a slingshot it has 49 meters per second as an initial velocity from a height of zero it's going to take five seconds to reach the peak here's our position function and we plug in those five seconds that's the peak that's how far away it is I hope that makes sense so let's keep on going to the next one we're gonna drop a brick obviously that's what you do when you're 400 feet up you just drop bricks off love you kind of fun to watch the women like you Center candies drop it watch I've done that with as a little kid see how long it takes to hit the ground well let's figure that out without having to drop the brick because you're probably not next to a canyon so if we are going to drop a brick from a height with 400 feet when is it going to hit the ground and what speed will it the ground at well we'll plan our way on probably on earth so let's pick acceleration to be constant and let's look at our units our units are given in two feet so I don't want to be using negative 9.8 I want to be using negative 32 because that's a feet and we're gonna be dealing with feet per second our initial velocity what we're dropping it so we're not throwing it we're not throwing it up let's assume that our initial velocity is zero these are all logical inferences we can make but are very important we also know that we're 400 feet up we're dropping the brake so our initial position is 400 this is basically how I try to start every single one of these problems I figure out what we know from the word problem that we're given so we know R on earth negative 9.8 if we're dealing with meters native 32 if we're dealing with the feet look for an initial velocity a lot of times it's given to you or if you're just dropping something you can assume that's zero so it's starting at zero from the moment you drop it at zero and then it's going to increase speed downward what speed is it going to hit well we're going to answer that later and then our initial is 400 feet up we can infer that from the problem let's get started let's do an integral of acceleration to give us our velocity so we know we're gonna get negative 32 T plus C we'll understand basic integration here but we do know in an interval asti we're dropping it's not starting with a throw or a downer up so we know that at time 0 we have a velocity of 0 hopefully you can see that your c1 is just going to be 0 at time equals 0 so that's gone we get 0 c1 is 0 so let's rewrite this our velocity function is just negative 32 T that's cool now that we have our velocity well that it's not really it is asking us for a speed when it hits the ground but we need to know a time that it's the ground for us to find our speed so it's sort of backwards of this problem here we need to find a position after a certain amount of time when the velocity was 0 when it reaches peak here we need to find the position first to figure out how long it's going to take to hit the ground there before we get backtrack and plug in the speed so it's a slightly different problem which is why we're doing it even though it seems similar let's find the position position is an integral of velocity so we're just going to integrate and but we do know our initial position at time of 0 we're at 400 feet so c2 is 400 we have a position function now let's answer the two questions so we start with 400 feet the initial position we dropped it velocity is 0 and we start it raishin work planet Earth native 32 feet per second squared because we are dealing with feet we did integral to get velocity we had miserable I say 0 c10 did another integral to get position we have c2 is 400 that's our initial position and now we think when is it going to hit the ground what's the T when our position is zero so if we start from 400 feet up the ground is at 0 so when when we get the ground it's going to be a height of 0 we need to solve 14 when our height is 0 so variety of ways you can do it you try to factor you can add 16 T squared divided by 16 take a square root that's what either to do so if we do that at 16 T squared to both sides divide by 16 then take a square root you don't need the negative we're dealing with time real-life time doesn't go backwards it would be kind of cool if you threw bricks moving back in time but that's that's not the case unfortunately the only time is the one dimension that you can't go backwards on it's called regrets no regrets so here we're going to divide by 16 take a square root we just get the square root of 400 over 16 if I did my math right that looks like it's is that also 5 probably 16 would be 25 okay so 5 just let you know not everything and cool happens after 5 seconds I know looks that way it doesn't so 5 seconds is what it's gonna take for this break to hit the ground so we're at 400 feet we just drop it we don't throw it we don't throw it we just drop it initial velocity is 0 it's going to hit the ground after 5 seconds so we answered question 1 when does it hit the ground 5 seconds after we drop it how fast is it going what's the speed having velocity function right there it's just negative 32 times whatever time you want so when it's hitting the ground it's at five seconds after we've dropped it so if we want to figure out the speed when it's hitting the ground it's the speed after five seconds exactly speed has the idea of being signless so even though the velocity would be negative whatever that's going to be looks like 160 so negative 160 feet per second a speed is the absolute value of velocity so the speed is 160 feet per second of course we know it's dropping so it'd be negative as far as velocity but positive for 160 so that's the idea with pretty much all of these try to find out the information that you can for from the problem don't make stuff up though okay find the information that you can infer use the appropriate units for acceleration do an integral see if you have an initial velocity see what question are asking are they asking for a maximum or when a maximum height that occurs or a maximum height you're gonna want to find out what the velocity is zero are they asking when it hits the ground you're going to want to find out when the position is zero and then typically we go one of two directions fill in a velocity first to find a position or find a position first to fill out a velocity I'm gonna put a few more up there we have like eight more problems to do so hang on that will be right back so our next two examples let's talk about a car cars going 100 kilometers an hour or 60 miles an hour that's this is the same thing there it breaks at a constant deceleration of ten meters per second squared how far is your car going to go one thing that's really important and where a lot of people just get mixed up or don't know why their numbers are coming out match your units that's a big deal for examples like this so if something's in kilometers per hour yet you have an acceleration of meters per second your going to want to find m/s m/s^2 year 1 5 m/s so km/h in munich ii don't really go together really really nice unless you convert one of them we typically convert the kilometres two hours to muse per second so let's convert this down to the acceleration units of meter that's million square meters per seconds can work great for us so 100 kilometers per hour remember you want units to cancel so put your hour as a cross a fraction numerator denominator cross a fraction 1 hour is the same thing as 60 minutes 1 minute the same as 60 seconds so if we get this at least will have kilometers per second well we also know that there's a thousand meters in a kilometer and if we do that we river kilometers we're gonna have meters as the unit on top seconds in the you on the bottom so basically multiply a hundred times a thousand divided by 60 squared and we're going to be it looks like I got twenty seven point eight meters per second so our car or whatever we're doing is going 100 kilometers per hour that's twenty seven point eight meters per second and then we slam on the brakes and we're going to assume that we have a constant deceleration of 9.8 meters per second squared a deceleration is negative acceleration so it's like falling to the earth or something we're not accelerating or decelerating so our acceleration is a constant negative ten me per second squared let's see if we can move with that elevate and our position what's our initial position well we're looking for how far do you go how far you go from what well call where you start breaking zero call that your initial position if we're only concerned with how far we're traveling from that point let's assume that when we start breaking word at some place in the ground we call zero we're going to measure from that spot so our initial position is just zero let's see what we can do start by taking an integral of acceleration we know that velocity is an integral of a lot of acceleration so in our case our velocity is negative 10 T plus c1 we also know that we have an initial velocity it's going to let us get rid of the arbitrary constant when our time is zero our velocity is twenty seven point eight meters per second that's going to be zero so c1 equals twenty seven point eight meters per second no problem let's let's put that back in there so for our velocity function is now negative ten T plus twenty seven point eight that's looking good so far now we're also looking for how far we go before we stop remember from like five minutes ago I said that a lot of times we when we want to find a maximum height what we do is we find out when the velocity is zero well if we want to find out how far we are traveling we're going to want to find out when our velocity is zero so we're gonna find that out first when's our velocity zero then find our position and then plug in that time to figure out how far we're going you see our position is never going to be zero again we started at zero we're going past it so it's not appropriate to solve for position first and set it equal to zero that does nothing you're gonna get at the time is zero that it isn't yeah okay we know we were zero we just went past that and started braking what we're concerned about is winds the velocity zero when have we stopped moving because if we find out when that it then we found our position function we can plug in that time and figure out how much distance has been traversed that's the idea so let's figure out when we hit a velocity of 0 so when velocity is zero that's up well that's when our velocity is zero looks like if we add 10 T divided by 10 we just get to about 2.8 seconds so again we knew our deceleration that's what that said constant deceleration we know that if we change this to meters per second it can work a lot better so we find our integral of acceleration gives us velocity but we're concerned with how far we're going before when we stop well we need to when we stop to find out how far we're going when we stop we stop when the velocity is zero that's after two point seven eight seconds now when we find our position function and we plug in to point seven eight seconds we'll find the distance that it takes us to stop of the vehicle I hope that's making sense sometimes you have to figure out something first in here to figure out the position that you want so let's go let's find our position now position is an integral of velocity so in our case we're gonna have this negative 5t squared plus 27 point BT plus c2 now we have an initial position we said that we're going long and we're gonna we're going to stop at this one point in the road so that's our time zero and that's our position zero and how far we go from there we're just measuring that distance how far how long it takes us to get there is a ton that we just found it says it's gonna take us to point seven eight seconds to go from hundred kilometers an hour or 27 20 meters per second to zero that's how how much time is going to pass but as far as our positions concern we know our initial position was zero so we can just make that zero you can think about it zero goes here zero goes here your c2 is going to be zero serve acceleration or deceleration it's negative take an integral use our initial velocity to figure out our arbitrary constant and then if we want to find out a maximum distance of travel that's usually done by setting your velocity equal to zero finding a time it takes you to stop and then plugging that time into the position that you find later so now we can plug in two point seven eight you plug it in here I did it you can check it on your own I get about thirty eight point six meters so we slam on a race we have constant deceleration and it's going to take us to point seven eight seconds of stop and as as that that two point seven eight seconds passes we're gonna have gone thirty eight point six meters so is this important information to know well of course of course it is it's important if you want to judge health how well you can stop how well your vehicle stops with it's a car truck or anything as a matter or a plane even so we'll want to know what our initial velocity is we'll want to know what our deceleration is we'll want to know all these things now we talked a little bit of at the beginning of this course about modeling and how there's a big trade-off between a perfect representation of a situation and ease of doing the math this is a very stripped down we don't have coefficients of friction in here we don't have wind resistance we're kind of stripping this way way way down but this is how we start okay the next one let's assume you got a paintball gun because I love paintball and so you're gonna kind of impress your friends don't do this because wind-resistant mess all this up but if you just be stood on 20 meter high building age go check this out guys and then you count say yeah once you're gonna it's gonna hit the top of the building up this far so after like how do you say time channel up and it's gonna go right by me and then get the crowd to be awesome it's so cool you're probably getting nailing right in the face it's gonna face before so let's assume that you do that though cuz you're a daredevil and you want to live on the edge building this 20 meter side and you shoot your paintball gun at 300 meters per second that's about right that's about 300 feet per second well our units match up that looks good so 20 meters hundred meter per second we're gonna find our maximum height think about right now your maximum height is going to be the height when your velocity is zero so we're gonna do the same kind of thing here we're gonna find out when our velocity is zero okay that's gonna give us the time when we achieve our are pink our maximum we're gonna plug that into the position when it's going to be at the top of the building once we find our position we'll set it equal to the height of the top of the building that's 20 solve for the time and when it hits the ground so we'll set this equal to zero and figure out the time when we get the ground so same idea like to figure out our Maxima here we're gonna have to find the velocity of when the velocity equals 0 first let's start with our acceleration if we're on planet earth our acceleration is we don't want to be using the feet that's that's not the idea here we're using meters so negative 9.8 our initial velocity we have 1 we're shooting this upward so we're up here on this little edge we're going and you're gonna be right here you're gonna go whoa move your head out of the way it's gonna hit the ground and go spike at least that's what you want so our initial velocity is 100 positive 100 because you're shooting this up meters per second our initial position you're at the top of the building so you're 20 meters up positive that's what we really need let's go ahead and let's do an integral of acceleration to give yourself some velocity now that we have that initial velocity we know that we are initial velocity is 100 meters per second so let's plug that in if we are going 100 meters per second at a time of zero our c1 is our initial velocity I told you that with polynomials with constants it's really easy because your seat one is 99% of times it's time it's going to be your initial velocity and your set your c2 is going to be your initial position so our velocity function here is negative 9.8 T plus 100 now we want to find out what the map height is maximum height occurs when our velocity is zero stop the stalls out falls back down so we want to know that so when our velocity is zero is the time it takes for us to achieve our maximum well that's gonna be let's see add 9.80 divide 100 by 9.8 looks like we get about ten point two seconds so we know it's going to take ten point two seconds for us to shoot this little paint ball up and it achieved its max its peak value that's going to be important when they find out our position so let's keep on going our position function ball it's just an integral of whatever little philosophy you just found so we're gonna have negative nine point eighty we add one to the X 1/2 is negative four point ninety squared plus 100 T plus c2 now I just mentioned this but that was a polynomial and when you're dealing with polynomials you're integrating you're just kind of manipulating the coefficients and the variant of the x one of your variables so when you plug in zero they're all going to disappear that means your C two is going to be your initial position our C two is going to be three now that gives us something that we can work with so there's three questions that we're gonna answer right now the first question is well what's the max what's our peak message since we were smart about it we knew that the maximum height is achieved when you change from a positive velocity to a negative velocity that's when a velocity is zero think critical point think first derivative since we're dealing with that happens at when two seconds so if we want to find out what our maximum height is what work a maximum position away is going to be it happens after ten point two seconds just plug in ten point two so max plugin ten point two I'm going to assume that you can do that take this number plug it in here and you should get looks like I got five hundred thirty point two meters now the next questions are win questions when is it going to hit the top of the vert wall pass the top of the building and when is it going to hit the ground those are position ideas but solving for time so when is it going to reach the top of the building again that's a when is the position going to be 20 when is it going to equal to height the building so let's call this number two and three for number two all we really want to know is when what's the time when our position is 20 if you see this man you're asking here's my position function though the time it takes to be at positions we want a position of 20 meters she'll subtract the 20 from both sides you can factor out your T so I'm going to let you do that you should be able to do that your own at least at this level subtract 20 from both sides factor out T you'll have time is 0 obviously when you start you're inside the building or time is factored like this set both was equal to 0 so x of 0 VI advisability or just take 100 divided by 4.9 and you're going to get the time that it takes to reach the top of that building I got that it's twenty point four one six now when does it hit the ground things hit the ground when their height is zero so here's our height or height our position and here's the time it takes to get to that position for number three we want our height to be zero use the quadratic formula use difference completing the squares I don't think any factor can it's not easy I think you have to have a quadratic formula so when I did that I got twenty point six one seconds so just point two seconds after you have stability so we're setting up with the knowledge that we can infer from the problems we're making sure our units match up that's important so so translate if you have to do conversions make sure you use an appropriate acceleration of gravity if you're dealing with that so you're given meters use negative f-18 give it two feet use feet per second then what we're doing is figuring out if we want to find a max height maximum how far we travel typically it's set the velocity equal to zero solve for time plug it in later if it's a when when we hit the ground when we reach a certain spot how far we go like braking braking why's that that's deal with position and that's using the law at the time or when your velocity equals zero in that in that position function or say in a position function equal to some value again we have a few more examples all right there's no - so your stay on the top of a building and you want to show all your friend just how movie where day you are she's gonna watermelon that's what WM is you're gonna toss some water that's right throw this thing so you stand up there throw up the watermelon at ten meters per second and it's gonna go up to come down it's gonna splat mmm waste a good watermelon but it probably would be pretty cool to see so you throw a watermelon up on the top of this building at ten meters per second it's gonna hit the ground at sixty meters per second the question is how tall is the building let's start with what we know so thing right now if you haven't done this think right now think about what you know can you put up an initial position can you put up an initial velocity can you put up acceleration can you do the right units let's start with the acceleration right now in your mind you should be thinking I'm doing with negative 9.8 because we're on earth Seward Lee that's one place we know there are buildings and this thing is going to be dropping so negative 9.8 meters per second so we're maximum units as meters per second squared or our meters per second initial velocity it's given to us we know that we're throwing this up now positive negative is important if we had taken this watermelon thrower down we'd have negative 60 meters per second certainly sorry negative 10 meters per second now we're we know that were throwing this up at negative a positive 10 meters per second initial position do you have that do you have an initial position well I hope I mean if we did our problem would be the answer because if we had an initial position we would know how tall the building is we don't know that so we're literally looking for our initial position something we don't know well dealing with what we we do know let's start with plugging all this stuff in oh you know what I think it did this wrong I think I told you just right now that we're throwing the watermelon up I did I put a negative on here on my note so let's assume we're throwing it so had we been throwing this thing up into the air I've misread my own bones my problem here if we thrown this up into the air we would have positive ten meters per second that's away from the ground so if our ground is our zero level that would be away from that so positive now it's we're not doing that we're taking it and we're throwing it to how many throws of watermelons that'd be any way I can do they just throw it down so we're gonna throw this down at ten meters per second so that's negative 10 meters per second let's start with this let's start with our acceleration let's see if we can use your initial velocity come over the velocity equation here well we know that our initial velocity is negative 10 can hopefully you can see that our RC one's gonna be negative 10 at a time of zero we have negative 10 so our velocity function is negative 9.8 t minus 10 now here's an interesting thought we don't we can't really care about the maximum height here how far it's out what we care about is how tall the building is well if we have how tall the building is and we're throwing something down from the top of it we know the time we can find the time it takes to go from where you threw it to where you hit the ground furthermore we know that we can think around 60 meters shame that's a velocity so if we hit the ground at 60 meters per second we can find the time it takes to hit sorry to achieve that speed or that velocity if we can find that the time it takes to achieve that velocity that velocity is is when we hit the ground and that time would be the exact same amount of time it takes first or third watermelon down there so we start with our acceleration we do an integral to find velocity we use our initial sure but this time of when we hit 60 meters per second it's precisely the time it takes for that watermelon to hit the ground so let's set this equal to 60 the velocity when we hit the ground and software time the time it takes to achieve that velocity when we hit the ground so since our velocity is downward you need to make sure that this 60 meters per second one is same the ground is not positive in something else you know it's the velocity is is making our position go downward it's a negative velocity so negative 60 equals negative nine point eighteen minus ten let's go ahead let's add ten divided by negative nine point eight five point one five point one seconds so here's what that means what that means is it is going to take five point one seconds for our watermelon to reach a velocity of negative 60 meters per second now we know that when it reaches the velocity of negative 60 meter second it's hitting the ground so that's the time it takes to hit the ground let's go ahead and find the position function and then backtrack if we know it takes five point one seconds in the ground we should be able to use that to figure out our our building or the height of our building so integral lower velocity yet we don't know we don't know an initial velocity what we know is that it takes five point one seconds to hit the ground so if it takes five point one seconds for us at the ground let's plug in a five point one for our time and it's put hitting the ground or a position of zero for our position so zero is achieved the zero position is achieved when we have five point one seconds so time that is as going on that will let us off that's in two so we know that a position of five point one seconds is zero that's what we know let's use that so zero so after five point one seconds point if we square five point one x negative forty four point nine multiply five point one times ten subtracted C sub two is going to equal one hundred seventy eight point four meters so do you want to look back at your position function C sub two is one hundred seventy eight point four but we know that's initial position so if you just want to find out time of zero okay sure plug in time of zero here you get to get C - C sub two is one or so maybe point four meters that's how tall this building is so you sit on top of this building up down to watermelon negative 10 meters per second it's been at the ground at sixty meters per second we use that fact to find a time when it achieves 60 meters per second downward we went backwards from position plugged in of the fact that's hitting the ground that's zero at five point one seconds that's time and that let us solve for C sub 2 which is our initial position that's kind of cool so we know how tall that building is now okay next one let's suppose you're in the truck and you're traveling 60 miles an hour so that's I'm gonna do the conversion for you right now that's 88 feet per second so we're going 88 feet per second and you start to slide under constant deceleration so you press on the brakes you're on some sort of service that may be the slippery or you just loose traction you start to the skin let's assume that we're constantly constant deceleration and you skate a total of 176 feet you could modify this problem and say okay you applied to brakes and a 2q 176 under 76 feet to actually stop that's fine there's lots of different ways to think about this how much time did it take for you to stop and what is the deceleration this is a weird problem this is where things start to get a little bit trickier because you're not given that acceleration or deceleration you're given that it's constant what you don't know what that is we're gonna try and solve for that so the first thing we're going to start with is how much we know so like what what do we know here well we know that acceleration is constant let's call it C sub one the next thing we know let's assume that our initial position is zero we just we start at zero because we're trying to figure out from that point we slid 176 feet let's just assume that we start at zero now the next thing well we don't we don't actually have a oh we did we do have an if it wasn't our initial velocity is 88 feet per second from that point so we're treating that as positive we're going away from our zero spot we're not going towards it we're going away from it so that's that's gonna be positive think about sliding upward if you will so our initial velocity is 88 feet per second so we thought about we go okay we have constant deceleration we don't know what that is it's part of a question we know that we slid 176 feet from somewhere so that was a total distance assume that we start at zero that's when we applied our brakes and we know that will right when we apply our brakes we're going 88 feet per second hope this is all making sense to you right now now let's slow down a bit and let's work from this cuz this really gets a lot of people so the constant I gonna find that well we're gonna have to make it to the very end before we find that so you're gonna have a c1 loading on pretty much the whole problem let's just start taking integrals so we know that our velocity is going to be the integral of our acceleration whatever that is in this case the constant is just C sub one so whatever that constant is we add a T to it and then we would get another constant Foxy's of - all right well we do have an intro velocity don't we so initial velocity is 88 feet per second that occurs at time zero so when we first start a situation we're going 88 feet per second at time 0 88 so 80 per second at time zero that actually lets us solve for our second arbitrary constant that's kind of cool so even though we don't know c1 we can still use our knowledge to figure out the initial velocity or at least put that into our problem so our velocity right now this C sub 1 T plus bu so good ok now one thing I'm going to show you show you what to do here is is this we're going to want to figure out the time it takes for bus to stop so in all the problems that we have done so far where it says how far have you skinned well we found out the time when we hit a velocity of zero now this is a how far you have skid problem or still going to want to find the time when our velocity is zero so this is going to look a little weird to you but we have a velocity function we're gonna want to find out how much time it took for us to skip okay that translates to you speed 176 feet how to find out how much time it took you to do that but when you end there your velocity should be zero you should have stopped at the end of your skin you stopped there so we want to find the time when our velocity is zero same idea in Reverse before we said okay what's the time it took you to date of loss is zero this much time and now go backwards a little later and use that in your position function now we're kind of a little different this is saying you slid 176 feet great alright that's a position idea how much time does it take you to get there well that's gonna happen when your velocity it's zero still so when the velocity is zero let's solve for the time so time is our win if we subtract 88 and divided by C sub 1 whenever we find C sub 1 we're gonna be able to find out the time that we skid for or decelerate for or came to a stop in so we're gonna find that later but this is important we they understand that the time it's gonna take us for for us to accomplish this slide is 88 divided by whatever that see what happens to B now let's continue so we're gonna take our velocity we're gonna find our position just like we did before we said the how what's the the maximum peak here well we found the time it took velocity wise and we plug that in that's the same thing we're going to do we're going to find our position function we found the time it takes for us to slide this we're going to plug that in it's gonna be a little strange but this is the idea behind it is that we're finding the time it takes to do something plug it into the position but now this time we actually have the position so we will work backwards so let's do one more integral if we start integrating our velocity we'll find our position and we know that our position function this would be well C sub 1 over 2 T squared take 1 at 1/2 then we've already used up a c2 even though we found it you really shouldn't put c2 again you see 3 we're in position I'm gonna pause right here because it's at this point students sometimes they go whoa what are you doing let's just go a little bit slowly let's think through this here's what's going on you're in the vehicle it doesn't matter what it is you you're going 88 feet per second or 60 miles an hour you hit the brake you slide or you stop in 176 feet so we know that the end of 176 feet our velocity is zero and you're assuming your acceleration is constant deceleration is constant we start there we know that our position we're gonna think of that as 0 because 176 feet from that spot to stop cool then our position initially is 0 we're also traveling 88 feet per second in a direction away from that so that's a positive velocity if we start taking an integral yeah we don't know what c1 is but we do know that at the end of our of our slide our velocity should be zero so it doesn't matter what this is our velocity is zero at the end of it that's going to be this time so this equals C sub 1 T plus 88 if we solve for T I don't know C 1 but when I find it out I'm gonna be able to plug it in and figure out how long it took me to slide or to complete that skid so we keep on going they just don't know C one yet yes but we do know that when we take an integral of velocity and we get our position we have a C 1 in there we also have an initial position that lets us solve for C sub 3 our last constant so we know that if I plug in 0 for T this is gone notice this is I don't care what C 1 is this is gone that's 0 this is gone that's gone we get C sub 3 equals 0 C 3 is 0 that's c3p0 c-3po c-3po I just have to throw it in there that's going to be 0 plus a 0 this is our position function based on whatever our acceleration is now here's the magic part about it sure we didn't know acceleration we did know initial position we did know initial velocity we're able to use that to find C sub 2 that was our initial velocity and C sub 3 that's our initial position but we do know one more thing we knew that the time it takes us for for us to complete the skin the time for us to take that then it takes to get from a velocity of 88 to velocity of 0 so when our velocity is 0 is 88 over C sub 1 but we have one more piece of information when that happens we will have slid 176 feet our position will be 176 when our team is 88 over C 1 we can use that to solve for C 1 so X of 88 over C 1 is 176 feet after this time we'll have gone that far it's gonna look bad oh man she goes for my real students he would stop we were 20 minutes ago when I did this did you notice like the small mistake I made there's a while back it didn't it didn't affect any of this stuff but it will mount I expected and I did not show that so that movie negative negative negative I hope you can attention to those little things that when I do this this math I make mistakes I don't ever really edit them out so every mistake I make you guys see but that's why I'm constantly checking so I'm always going back and always sign what's my cell what's my sign here and I noticed it looked a little funny and then I remembered that I subtracted but I did it in my head too fast and you will do that too it happen happens to me too can happen to you too you do the math to faster off by sign it's typically what happens when you're doing your head so I subtracted 88 divided by sequent one I should see someone that should be negative I have negative here none of this should have changed that didn't change but when I plug it in I have a negative and a negative so again you get us back on track here I know that it takes us that much time to stop this is how far we've gone when we stopped let's just plug in how how much time this progress or a trip that's taking place well if we Square C sub 1 and we have C sub 1 here then what this works out to be I'll have to erase this stuff will have 176 equals C sub 1 or 2 times negative 88 squared oh man well I don't have that down what I have down is if I take 88 I square it and I divide by 2 we get 3872 so I'm squaring negative 88 through a big number / - it's going to be 3072 over c1 squared this is going to get rid of that so you can have C sub 1 on the bottom - I guess I've been evading squared it's 77 44 I wish you said 1 so 77 44 divided by 2 should be that number let's take this this multiplied together is minus 77 44 and you have a common denominator now C sub 1 that's pretty cool so 176 equals make one fraction negative 388 72 over C sub 1 with fractions like this we can just invert these two things and we did negative 22 we have just answered the second question so we are decelerating at negative 22 negative 22 feet per second squared that's pretty cool if we plug it into this we get how long it takes the skin so after all this is said and done you've had a way to the very very very end before you think about C 1 C sub 1 was our deceleration we're decelerating at negative 22 feet per second squared we plug this into their time it took us 4 seconds to slide I hope this is making sense I have a few more problems I'll come back in just a second hope you're ready for another two examples so let's let's go on this one we're on certain planet and we're gonna use this for both of these these examples here and we drop a rock because that's obviously what you do on strange planets you just drop rocks and so we're dropping a rock from 20 feet and we know that it takes two seconds to hit the how long we've taken 200 feet and what speed wouldn't be going when he hits the ground so let's start with what we know now we're a different planet so we can't assume that gravity is negative 32 feet per second squared but we hopefully can sue it's constant now we also know that we're dropping the rock not throwing the rock or not to run it up or down so our initial velocity is also zero hopefully you're catching this this is important to get down finally we have two other pieces of information information not only are we dropping the rock from 20 feet so our initial position is 20 feet for our setup here it also takes 2 seconds to hit the ground so it takes 2 seconds to have a position of 0 those are two pieces of information so constantly sure Foss Israel obviously initial position is 20 feet but we also know that after 2 seconds so our position after 2 seconds is 0 when we drop the rock for 20 feet that's a big deal let's see where we can go from there we're going to start with acceleration like always we're going to integrate to get velocity we'll see if we can use our initial velocity to get rid of arbitrary constant we'll integrate again for position and we'll see what happens with this whole setup we're still gonna have a cease of one in there are ideas here in C sub 1 so our velocity is going to be the integral of our acceleration velocity therefore just going to be C sub 1 T plus C sub 2 we get e actually yeah C sub 2 that's fine now we know our initial velocity is 0 so when time is 0 we have a velocity of 0 you should be able to see the C sub 2 is 0 right now so our velocity function is simply C sub 1 T that's pretty easy now let's find our position a position function is always an integral of velocity so that's going to give us 1/2 C sub 1 T squared plus C sub real already used up C sub 2 it can use that again so add 1 to the exponent divided and then add your other constant so our position function C 1 over 2 T squared plus C 3 but we have an initial position we know that we start from 20 so we can go ahead and find our C sub 3 here so at time of 0 that 0 is this whole thing out we have 20 feet well we need that now comes the last piece and the piece that lets us solve for our C so once or our acceleration we know that it takes 2 seconds for us to drop to 20 feet where we start to a height of 0 so 2 seconds and gives us a height of 0 that's big so we know that X is 0 when T is 2 from a height of 20 feet so all this is now working together well if we just do a little bit of math on this we know that 0 would equal that's 4 divided by 2 is 2 2 C 1 plus 20 subtract the 20 divided by 2 C 1 equals negative 10 let's plug that back into our position function so now that we plug it back in here right where we start a red right where we just left off we'd have negative 10 over 2 that's negative 5t squared plus 1 this would be the position function if we started from a height of 20 feet now what we're concerned about is how long would it take for us to hit the ground if we start from a height of 200 feet this isn't change our acceleration is constant that's what that says sorry celebration is negative 10 feet per second squared on this planet so when we get there it's like this this particular planet our acceleration our acceleration here the effective gravity is negative 10 feet per second squared we're going to use that over there so keep that in mind our position function is of course half that T squared plus 20 now we want to find 200 feet well it's going to change isn't that gonna change no we're dropping the rock is a velocity gonna change no which is the position so from 200 feet the only thing that changes here is that we tack is 0-1 because now we're dropping the rock from 200 feet so let's go ahead and find out when we would hit the ground hitting the ground is a height of 0 that's after T seconds so zero would equal negative 5t squared plus 200 iPad 5 T squared divided by 5 you're going to get the square root of 40 or 2 root n again we don't take negatives you know go back in time view on strange minutes so we have to root 10 seconds that's how long it's going to take for us to drop this rock from 200 feet and hit the ground how fast it's going what its speed is well we're gonna need a velocity function for that fortunately we have one it's sorry back up here so velocity is C sub 1 times how much time you're taking well we know C sub 1 is negative 10 so if we just plug that back in velocity is negative 10 T we got C sub 1 that's negative 10 T if we plug in our time velocity of 2 root 10 seconds that's about looks like 63 to 40% of its life so we did no acceleration we knew it was constant but we're still don't look it down here the key I'm doing these things is find out where you can use all of your information and if you don't know acceleration you're always looking to figure out where that that's coming from typically you have to make it all the way down to a position function so that thing hangs on all through velocity all through position figure out your arbitrary constants with initial velocities and the initial positions if you can but then all the way down here when we finally get to use our position function when we know something else about it you know to two seconds to hit the ground well that that's a solve for C sub one then we can backtrack then we can say okay I now know C sub 1 let's plug it into my position now I can use it to figure out how long it's going to take for me to hit the ground from a different height 200 feet okay it's gonna take square root of 40 or 2 root 10 seconds then I can save a backtrack even further our velocity is a I know my C sub 1 our velocity is negative 10 T whatever that is we now know that that's 2 to 10 seconds it's going to be 2 10 seconds for us to drop from 200 feet to 0 and we're gonna be doing 60 3.25 feet per second when we hit the ground on this particular planet I hope that makes sense there's a lot going on here but I'm hoping that's becoming easier I'm hoping you're understanding okay this isn't such a big deal I can wait till later and then figure out you some information that I'm given somewhere to figure out what that cut that constant acceleration is and then we're good to go so let's assume that you can throw a rock 144 feet upwards on earth that's a long way how high could you throw it on this planet this obviously has less gravity because our gravity is negative 32 feet per second squared this is negative 10 feet per second squared that's what that C one was remember where it came from that's our acceleration here so let's write that down I know that our acceleration is negative 10 feet per second squared as far as our plan concerns Ricky that the back of our down one but the similar level but what we really need to know is on our planet what's your initial velocity that's the only thing we really need to know because well we know how high it goes on our planet that we're gonna backtrack the initial velocity we know our acceleration on our planet we know the acceleration on other planet we so we know acceleration of Earth we know acceleration of gravity on the other planet what we don't know is the initial velocity you see if you throw a rock on earth or you throw a rocket but I say let's assume as hard you can so as hard as you can here or as hard as you can on the planet you should have the same initial velocity but the way that acceleration is going to affect it it's different so you're still in stand on the ground you're still throwing the rock so here's what we're going to do the idea behind this problem is use what you know about earth to figure out an initial velocity take that initial velocity modify once you know about this planet so this planet this is acceleration on its planet you don't have to figure that out again you are going to have a initial starting point of zero not twenty so you get the ground but you're also going to have an initial velocity so all we need to do is augment this with initial velocity and lack of any other height and we're gonna be fine let's figure out this initial velocity that you can throw your rock that starts with on earth so on earth your acceleration is negative 32 feet per second squared I hope that at this point you're really okay with why we're using feet per second we're dealing with the situation our initial velocity that's what they're looking for our initial position you're assuming you're on the ground so we're gonna assume your height is is negative EE just throwing up there we're so you're on the ground level there so let's start with our integrals we know that velocity is an integral of acceleration the initial velocity laughs man we just we don't know but we do know something we know that at the maximum height of 144 feet what's our velocity v bosse to be zero so maybe we write this down at the maximum height at 144 feet velocity equals zero when's that happen and 144 feet our velocity is going to equal zero our velocity is going to equal zero so when we get down to it our C sub one is negative 32 T that's cool so we're going to be able to use that a little bit later so we know that our velocity is negative 32 T plus c1 at 144 feet we've reached our max our velocity will be zero at that that height that we can use to say hey C sub 1 is the name 32 feet now we can't it is positive 32 T we can't really plug that in here it's going to give us zero yeah it is because that's that's our starting philosophy that that's that's what that says like if you plug that in right now you'd have your starting velocity of zero so let's go on let's do our position so take an integral of velocity we always get our position from that and this is going to be negative 16t squared that started looking pretty familiar plus C 1 T plus C 2 another arbitrary constant but this one we do know we do know our initial starting spot we're on the we're throwing this up so we're assuming that our height is zero here so if T equals zero we get a height of zero zero zero zero C sub two is going to be zero here's what else we know this is where this comes in at 144 feet with a velocity of zero we have C sub 1 equals 32 T so if we put our position on height of 144 we can substitute C sub 1 equals 32 teen let's do that now so height of 144 feet when does that occur so how long does it take for that to happen C sub 1 is 32 T what do you do it different I wonder if you could solve that for T and find C sub want that you could I'll do it different way in just a minute so this is all going to give you a 16 T squared and we do that that's got to be three so you can backtrack now so you know that you achieve your maximum height of 144 feet in 3 seconds since you had this solved for C sub 1 that's 32 times T plug your 3 in you know that C sub 1 is 90 solicit 96 96 feet per second C sub 1 is 96 feet per second so C sub 1 remember 1 C supplement C sub 1 is also your initial velocity so we know right now that on this situation if you were gonna throw a rock 144 feet in the air from starting spot at 0 you had an initial velocity of 96 feet per second that's pretty cool it's gonna take you 3 seconds for you to throw the rock 1 2 3 reaches 144 the velocity is now 0 you had to have launched it at 96 feet per second does that make sense to you I hope that makes sense to you so we're using our knowledge of Earth's gravity we know that we don't have an initial velocity that's literally the only thing we're looking for we have an initial position we take our integral we know that at 144 feet our velocity is 0 well you can solve for C sub 1 cool we did so we have C sub 1 is 32 T we wait we wait for a position like just like before we know that our position of 144 feet allows us to substitute in season 1 equals 32 T then we're able to solve for 83 seconds takes 3 seconds for us to region 144 feet and our initial velocity in 1916 per second I mentioned also that you probably could use it 'we think you can so if we solve for T so add 32 T on one side and then divide by 32 right down here from this spot you should be able to plug in C sub 1 over 32 and C sub 1 over 32 as your teeth and so what that would give us here's C sub 1 squared here C sub 1 squared here's 32 times 32 and here's 32 so let's see okay we'll do it that way all right see if you get 96 I'm guessing you probably do in fact you probably believe in right now say once 96 divided by 32 so that would be 3 times 6 that's two yay yep so this would be if you plug in 96 here just to check to make sure it works if you plug in 96 here here here you get negative 144 plus 288 that's 144 so it does work and if you if you proceed to do it from here you'll get C sub 1 equals 96 so either way I've done it this way and then in the past it's just the numbers working they're harder to deal with so I showed you two ways here take one of them doesn't matter which one you do you're going to get either T equals 3 first and then backtrack 96 or using this method with solving for T this will give you C sub 1 equals 96 either way you've just found your initial velocity you're throwing that rock up there at 96 feet per second now let's go on to the different planner so knowing that we have 96 feet per seconds all we really need our initial velocity is 96 feet per second just notice what we ended with over here we know that the position function for this new planet whatever it is it's just negative 5t squared plus whatever your initial velocity is t plus whatever your position is x sub 0 but we know that we know that if you're throwing something up on the ground this is zero and we just found that so our position function we just augment this we know that the acceleration is based on negative 10 feet per second squared so we plug it into a positions negative 5 cut in half plus 96 T now that we know our initial velocity that's that's pretty neat so we move on and we see how high could you throw that on that planet well what's your velocity once your velocity on that planet come back over here our velocity is right here so our velocity is just C sub 1 T well I guess it's it's not we have to augment that don't wait plus your 96 feet per second so you could do that you can also be smart about it and say let her do velocity is always the first derivative of position take negative 10 T plus 96 oh my gosh it actually works when will you hit a maximum height you hit it when your velocity is zero so if we set our velocity equal to zero we're gonna figure out when we achieve that maximum height velocity 0 equals negative 10 plus 96 add 10 T divided by 10 to get nine point six seconds so we are going to hit our maximum height after nine point six seconds here look at meters earth was three seconds three seconds we didn't mention light that's why I did it that way first so you see the time difference why the difference gravity is much less here so on earth you go one two three you've just if the people here you throw the same exact hardness whatever you get nine point six seconds that's his peak this is gonna be much higher so yeah we had initial velocity we came back over here we said this is what our this order acceleration is let's see where I lost it this is where acceleration is this is what our position is from a height of 20 feet let's let's make a difference let's make it from zero feet okay well there's there's no initial position that it's going it's the height of zero we also have an initial velocity of 96 look we can come back here and say hey initial velocity is 96 not zero anymore that changes our initial position that changes our velocity functions but now we say how high does something go well it's going to reach a height when its velocity is zero that's nine point six seconds plug this back into your position and we get about 460 million now I'm really hoping this is making sense I'm hoping that you understand that once you have acceleration you're good to go you just do some intervals once you have initial velocity you're even better so you can solve a lot of these things by just understanding how the formulas work and if you need to change initial velocity v just added that's okay or just add it with a team here for your position so try it I would try these again make sure you're going through these a couple of times I think that's about it yeah I think that's about all we do I said ten we went through nine the rest of them are very very similar I don't wanna really waste your time I was going through him go man these are these are really really the same so the main idea is for all of these these examples are start with your acceleration and take an integral that's going to give you velocity plus a constant use your initial velocity to change that arbitrary constant take another integral position use your initial position to modify that position function if you can do that that's a straight board example if you have an acceleration that you don't know you are going to have to find the position function typically to solve that if you want to find the maximum height find out when the velocity is zero however long that takes is however long it takes to preview to achieve that maximum height we use that a lot once you find an initial velocity or if you need to find the initial velocity somewhere so like like this you can go ahead and modify the the formulas that you have from other other situations to make that work for you so that's about it we've done a ton of examples I'm tired you're probably tired of watching me do this stuff but I hope they were useful for you I know we over an hour doing this and that's a lot of examples but because these can take them in different shapes and forms I wanted to give you that the abundance of just hardcore math worked out so I hope it helped it did please let me know that that was that was helpful I appreciate it you guys have a have a good day and hopefully your stay is going well and I'm gonna come back with slope fields in the wall you
