Transcript for: Domain Restrictions In Differential Equations and Integrating Factors (Differential Equations 17)
hey now that you've mastered a few of these techniques of solving first order differential equations and and mainly we have just basic integration we we now have this the separable equations and we just mastered these linear first order differential equations we need to stop it start talking about something a little bit more specific and what I mean by that is that when we start manipulating these differential equations from where they start in to how they're fitting our technique sometimes we're running into some domain issues so I haven't mentioned it my videos have been more focused on the technique like how do you do it what's it mean what are we going for but now we need to start thinking about that and so for the next few videos at the very end I'm gonna have you go back and think well you know what what do we really do here so I'm gonna focus on technique first just like it did in the last two videos but then I'm gonna go back and say hey there's some pieces that we need to understand and I think that's best because you'll understand the technique and then you'll go ahead and go okay now that I understand what's really going on I can see that we might have some issues here and so I'm gonna walk you through a few examples of when we're gonna face some domain issues when we're rewriting our differential equations to fit a certain technique so a lot of times this happens on our linear first order differential equations so a couple things we want to we want to really nail down number one is that when we're doing our linear first order differential equations and we're coming up with that row that that piece that missing piece that's completing our product rule we call that an integrating factor so when you see that it's in the title last few videos but I never mention it again I was focused on the technique but now we need to start nailing down some specifics so what that's called look that row is called is an integrating factor and that's that missing piece that's creating the product rule for us so whenever you see that whenever you hear that once you start thinking okay integrating factor and from now on I'm going to start using that language when we get to it especially like Bernoulli equation so when we get there in a few videos I'm gonna be saying things like okay now we're fine our integrating factor or this is our integrating factor or we use that and so when we're dealing with our linear first order different equations we solve those by by implementing implementing this integrating factor that we multiply on both sides and allows us to integrate very easily by completing that product rule so the technique is there now we're just kind of naming stuff also not on every one of them but on a lot of these linear first-order difference of equations to get them in the right format we had to divide but we know something about dividing we know that we can't ever divide by zero you know wait a minute so if if I have to divide by zero to get from here to here and these two these four examples are in the last video that that we talked about so if I if I had to do buy to go from here to here whatever X is zero you go well that's a really good point what if that X is zero and so many times what you're gonna see a lot of people do myself included is in the back of it since we always should show it I should have I should be showing it I'm gonna show it now but I was more focused on the technique some people don't even show this and they need to because what's happening is when we're using a certain technique to solve a differential equation sometimes we have to place restrictions on the domain to make that technique work so for instance if we want to solve this by a linear differential equation for sort of differential equation we're gonna have to divide by X that X can't be 0 and so we're gonna start putting conditions on this so we begin ago okay that's divided by X I can't have the X be 0 but then pass that okay X can't be 0 I think we don't understand that you can't divide by 0 and for things like homogeneous equations what we get to in a few videos that's fine and that's what we're gonna stop at is okay well we just can't have 0 but especially for linear sometimes it's really nice to not have to deal with an absolute value and Y and one of the reasons why that is is because when you are dealing with these linear differential equations when we solve them they're always going to have some sort of X expression on the left-hand side and an X expression on the right-hand side and it's nice to be able to simplify them and so if one of them has an absolute value and the other one doesn't that's an issue and we can't simplify that very well now on homogeneous we sometimes run the same thing but typically it's Ln of an absolute value or if absolute value wrapped up into something where we wouldn't be able to simplify any way but with linear we can simplify a lot of these after we go ahead user an integrating factor after we go ahead and do our integration and then we go okay hey so there's an X here there's X here let's simplify it that's really hard to do if one of them has an absolute value in one of them doesn't and so many times when we're dealing with these linear many times things like every time we wouldn't we divide by this X what's what happens when we divide by this X you are going to get something that says oh yeah when I integrate that I'm gonna get an Ln absolute value X what's that we're down to e to the Ln says I'm gonna have just that absolute value of X but if I'm gonna get something on the right hand side that has X's I really don't want to be messing around an absolute value and so what a lot of times we do instead of just saying well X can't be equal to zero because I'm dividing by zero if I let that happen X can't be equal to zero I'm just gonna say this I'm gonna say let's make X greater than zero that way I'm not dividing by zero but then that way I'm also not having to deal with an absolute value on my integrating factor that's where that comes from out that makes sense and so when we're dealing with these sure our technique is hopefully now perfect we understand exactly what we're doing I spent a long time explain that now we have some finer points like why in the world are they saying X has to be greater than zero why we can't can we just divide yes but when we try to make these differential equations fit a certain technique sometimes we run into issues and so we have to place conditions on that domain and say this is gonna work as long as X is greater than zero then I can do things like divided by X family zero then I can do things like that's just going to be e to the Ln of X to the fifth instead of absolute value of x to the fifth then when I solve this difference equation have to use my integrating factor the X is on the right hands on the left hand side well they're not going to have absolute value but now the X is on the right hand side won't either and I'll be able to simplify them so that's where these conditions are coming from that's why we use them it makes first it makes our method possible we have to restrict that in order to bye-bye X and then it lets us simplify a little bit better some other reasons sometimes that we can not have that absolute value it's important for us and so we'll restrict it even more say not just not zero but let's just make it greater than zero that's one reason let me do that look at the next one maybe you can start seeing it now hey we're dividing by X you're gonna absolutely say okay X can be equal to zero you're never going to be able to divide by zero but you have to divide by X or make this technique work that's a linear first order differential equation we're going to use an integrating factor to take care of that oh wait if I divide by X I'm probably going to get this one over X inside that integral for the integrating factor I don't want to have to deal with the absolute value let's make it positive that way we understand that we're not going to have to mess around with that and on the right hand side will have some X's now on the left hand side we'll be able to take the x's without absolute value on both sides and simplify them that's the idea okay you're kind of the same idea that you can you can see it here too but same idea here we're dividing by X we have this I can't divide by zero but because of an integrating factor I'm going to be getting this Ln of X well I don't want to have the absolute value because e to the Ln absolute value of x if I were to simplify that I'd still have the absolute value of x and that wouldn't simplify with something later on so oftentimes we'll just say let's just let's make this grimming zero that way we can avoid we can avoid absolute value makes things really streamline and the same thing on this one if we divide by 2x well we're still divided by X we're still saying there's a 1 over X that's still I want to avoid the absolute value and so we'll say ok let's make X strictly greater than 0 and that's what you're going to see a lot of the times on these linear first order differential equations so just a recap of everything we've done right now not much really but the idea is number one your technique should be there the name of the thing that we're multiplying to let this technique work is called an integrating factor it's on the title just never mention it in that video I'm going to be using it from now on so whenever I say that the integrating factor that's what the role of X is as in every case that's what's completing the product rule force secondly we need to start thinking about domain and so for the next few videos what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do all the problems I'm gonna focus mostly on the technique that's gonna get you rolling on it and then what I'm gonna do is I'm say hey you need to think back on this look at some of these problems what's the problem in making the differential equation fit this particular technique in linear first-order differential equations a lot of times are dividing by a variable we need that variable to not be 0 then especially on linear not so much of homogeneous but we have this X greater than 0 so we avoid some absolute values there's there's another reason for that but most of it I would just want you to think of that that we're avoiding absolute value so I hope that helps you understand why we have X greater than 0 on a lot of these problems now so you were working out of a book or your teacher you know you need that why do we need that we need that because we're divided by a variable that can't be 0 we're going to use that in our integrating factor we don't want absolute value and some of the domain issues on these Linear's get a little crazy and so we restrict that to X greater than 0 to avoid some of those issues that's a second reason so I just want you to know that so we're referencing that at the end of our videos watch for those so after we doing technique we're gonna master the technique and talk about domain hope that helps I'll see you for the next video you
