Transcript for: Introduction to Initial Value Problems (Differential Equations 4)
now's our chance to start solving some differential equations with initial values so if you remember differential equations have derivatives in them we're going to have an equation that is a solution that equation generally usually typically has a c in it it's a family of equations that works as a solution or a family of solutions now if we want a specific or a particular solution we need an initial value I'm going to show you how to start using that so another thing at this time some of you might be wondering how how how do they get how do they get that where where do you get that that that's like the rest of this course on how to find that okay right now is we kind of start at the back end and go what do you what do you how do you check it we're start with checking it how do you find a particular solution we need initial value so I'm going to show you how to do those things and then after that we start the techniques on how to find the actual solution from the differential equation it's not that bad uh but we have to know what to do with it once we get there so let's start with this there there's really three steps on how to how to find some particular solutions to a differential equation step one find if you can your solution if it's given to you that just means you need to verify it so verify that this actually works there if not then none of this actually matters so verify that this works there next you're going to be given an initial condition so this starting spot use that to solve for C and then once you have all you have to do is replace the C right there so I'm going to show you how to do that on like six examples the first three I'm going to do completely for you the next three I would like to do for you to do on your own practice this stuff they're a little bit more advanced but you should have the hang of it by the time you finish these three so step number one let's verify it let's make sure that in this first order differential equation this is actually a solution what that does remember the last video we have to take the derivative thankfully only one of them and plug it in to see if it works so if we take the first derivative C is a constant it doesn't have any x's in it so it's just a number that means that we don't have a product rule here all we have to do is keep the C do this chain rule derivative of 2x is 2 just multiply in the front you're good to go now let's plug this in we're going to take our first derivative we'll see if that's equal to two times our original function yeah that's like immediately apparent that those are those are equal so we know for sure that that's an actual solution we've just verified that that's a solution to that differential equation step number two once you have verified that solve for C this is how you solve for C so we're going to take and plug in and Y of 0al 3 now what that means is that y of 0 what's y of 0 well y of the independent variable x equals this number so replace x with that number replace y with that number and see what happens so I'm going to start you off here let's replace X even shows us what this is it says if you put in 0 for X well it's going to be equal to 3 so if you put in 0 for X it's going to be equal to three that's what that means replace the X with this number replace the Y with this number that's exactly what that means to do and that's that allow us to solve for C we replace all the X's with zero and all the Y's with three C = 13 now man we're almost done all we got to do is replace the C in our original equation our solution equation that we verified with whatever C you found so we are going to have y = 1/3 e 2x let's walk through some terminology just to make sure you know what what's going on okay that's a differential equation it's a first order differential equation this is a solution because we verified it we know that that's a solution it's a general solution because it's got that arbitrary constant in there so this is a family of Curves every single value of C is going to satisfy that it's crazy what we're looking for is now that we know that this is a solution well what's the solution what's that curve that goes through that point is that a point yeah that's the point 03 so notice if you have a family of Curves Let's uh they look like this because they're exponentials if you have a family of curves or like this if that c is negative all those exponentials well then if you have all that what's the one of them that goes through three zero and that's what we're asking oh this one that goes through that point 3 comma 0 that's what we're doing differential equation solution to a differential equation a family of solutions a general solution here if we have an initial condition initial value problem that limits it that says you need to find the one of them that goes through that specific point and that's what we do we solve for C and now we have a particular solution to that first order differential equation that's got to make sense before you go any further that's got to make sense let's try this one so this says a we got a first order differential equation this one's different because it's got an X in it don't let that worry you all you're going to do is the same exact thing find the first derivative plug it in plug in the original um to make sure that it actually works so verify it and then use your initial condition to solve for C so we're finding the first derivative to use here just to verify it this is going to be reused in our equation that we're checking right now so the first derivative chain rule gives us C thex + 1 this goes to Zer we're going to check this with the original in our differential equation to verify that this works so on the left hand side we're taking our first derivative what we just found equal x minus our original equation that we just took the derivative of and we're going to simplify this to see if what they've given us is actually a solution it doesn't make sense to start plugging in initial values if that's not a solution because then you'd say oh this is a this is not a particular solution of that differential equation that is a waste of time so we're going to make sure this works if we distribute that that minus we get X's are gone these are gone 1al 1 we nailed it that is a solution to that first order differential equation now what we have to do is just solve for C so we're done with the differential equation part we're not even looking at that anymore we've we've determined that this is in fact a general solution to it it's got an arbitrary constant we only need one arbitrary constant with that it's a first order one arbitary constant all we have to do now is now that we verified it plug this initial condition in and solve for C so I'm going to rewrite what we're doing here our solution our general solution is this our initial condition we know that's a general solution the initial condition or the point that we need our solution to go through we have to have it satisfy that it's going to give us a a specific C all these are different curves they they look like a whole stream of Curves on a graph but only one of those is going to go through that point the C value is what gives us that one curve that goes that one point x is going to become hopefully you see it X is going to become zero Y is going to become 10 and we're going to solve for C so Y is 10 when X is zero usually these work out pretty nice e to the negative 0 who cares e z that's one uh C * 1 is C plus 0 - 1 if we add that one over Cal 11 let's just replace that and then we're done so our particular solution the the solution that satisfies our initial condition from our family of Curves here for General solution to our differential equation is YX needs to be 11 e x + x minus one that's the idea I hope that's making sense all right let's try one more together before I give you like three more to do on your own um and then I'll of course go through them with you so we do the same same exact process let's find the first derivative let's plug these both in to verify and then let's let's use our initial condition to solve for C so first comes the verification we need to take the first derivative to satisfy our differential equation the derivative of Ln of x + C is 1/ X+ C * the derivative of x plus C that's a chain rule since the derivative of x plus a constant is just one whenever constants go to zero we just get 1/x plus C let's plug that stuff in so we're gonna have e to the Ln X+ C that's e to the y y = Ln X+ C time the first derivative of y we just found that and that's got to equal one well if you remember identities e to Ln that sort of idea those are inverse functions those are an exponential and logarithm are always inverses if they have the same base that's all gone we're going to get X plus c and x + C * 1x + C that's certainly going to equal one so we know that that's a solution of that differential equation now we're going to use our initial condition so I'm going to rewrite it so we have our general solution it's got a c in there plug in your initial condition when X is z y is also zero so 0 has to equal Ln of 0 + C 0 has to equal Ln of 0 + C we have 0 for y we've get Zer for X that looks weird so 0 equal Ln C Let's do an exponential on both sides or just think about it what value of C does there need to be there in order for Ln equal Z Ln of what equals z we go one yeah C's going to be one if you need the exponential e to 0al C do a e on both sides or think about the inverse of Ln it's an exponential e 0al c c has to be one which means now we go back and we just replace our arbitrary constant with something that's not arbitrary anymore something that's particular something that says hey you're going through that point you don't need an arbitrary constant you have a specific constant that's going to let you go through that specific point that initial condition and that constant is one that's the way that we do it verify solve for C then just rewrite it I'm going to erace the board I'm going to put three more on the board for you I would really encourage you to try them see if you can verify Sol for C rewrite it's not that hard but the process of is important because we're always doing these two things when dealing with initial value problems uh later on the verified part well you're not going to verify anymore in a little while you're going to be actually solving this you go oh I solved it now solve for C now rewrite it that's the way it works so now that you have the hang of bit try these three problems yeah they're a little bit more more intimidating there there's there's more stuff going on but don't don't worry about it see if you can verify first take the appropriate derivative plug it in see that it works and then use the initial value problem some of you are probably thinking but I I trust you I I'm kind of yeah that's just just true I can just see it why don't I just plug that in there and find C you can do that you can do you can find c that way it's just good practice to verify it to make sure it actually works because if it doesn't work then that's irrelevant so try it even though we're it seems like we're kind of wasting time because you're like well that if they're telling me that's a solution they're not they're saying verify that it is first um trust me that's a lot easier than finding that yourself so finding that with the techniques later on take a lot more time so verifying is way quicker than actually finding a solution for yourself U so take the time to do it verify it's actually a solution then solve for C and then rewrite it so I'm going to start right now hopefully you'll take the time to do that on your own step number one we're going to find derivatives for everything because they're all first order differential equations that's kind of nice now what we're noticing here though is there's got to be a product rule when you're finding that first derivative here's a function of X here's a function that has X in it we're going to have a product rule so derivative of the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second now the derivative of the second derivative of constant that's zero so that it's not one it's not it's zero this gone the derivative of Ln X is 1x so that's what we're going to be plugging in here let's go ahead and do that so when we verify this we're going to take our first derivative put it here take our original function put it here and just see if it works notice how that's x s and notice how this is going to distribute to all of this this is all the first derivative it needs to be in Brackets let's distribute see what happens if we distribute this we're going to get 3 x Cub times some nasty stuff that we don't really want to look at plus X cubed but here when we distribute we get min -3 x cubed nasty stuff that looks exactly like the other nasty stuff I like that equals x cub and we can see just on some observation here that this and this are gone X Cub = XB and we we win so we know that this right here is a General solution to that differential equation now now it's appropriate to find C it might seem pedantic it might seem like a waste of time I know it would have when I first took it to think like well it's going to be a solution but it's important to verify that so when we plug in we know that when X is one Y is 17 well so 17 = 1 1 cubed is 1 Ln of 1 is z we just talked about a little while ago 0 + C is C so c equal 17 that's it now all we got to do is replace that with 17 and we're done we've taken a general solution with an initial condition and found a particular solution to that differential equation that's it okay next up we're going to take the first derivative to make sure that we verify that this is actually a solution here wow that's crazy do you remember the derivative of tangent hope you do derivative of tangent secant squar but then we have a chain rule involved in that so SEC squ of the original stuff times the derivative of the inside stuff the derivative of this this is 3x^2 + 0 dtive constant 0 so this is 3x2 and we're going to put that in front of secant s of this stuff so we would get secant squ leave the inside alone times the derivative of the inside that's 3x^2 that's it now plug that in 3x^2 2 x + Cal on the right hand side we have some more things going on here we're going to have let's see 3x2 so that's good we have Y 2 Y 2 so all of this squared so tangent squared why because that's y so y s take this stuff and square it Tang s of x + C + 1 that that that doesn't look the same well we have to remember some of our identities so some trig identities are that that works so see X = Tang x + 1 what that means is that this right here is really SEC s x that plus one disappears because of our identity which means that these things are identically the same this is 2 XB + C this is 2 x + C by that identity that I just showed you so that verifies that this is a solution to that first order differential equation now it's on us to find C and then rewrite our original solution as a particular solution so let's do it we got y of Z is one that means that every time x is zero Y is going to equal 1 so 1al tangent of 0 Cub + C okay what value what's it take what's C got to be for tangent of that value to equal one I'm thinking got to be Pi 4 so C is pi 4 because tangent of Pi 4 is 1 now we rewrite so we're here remember I rewrote it I always rewrite them I verify then I solve for C I always rewrite and then I at the end I just replac the C so that is a particular solution notice how solving for C gets rid of our arbitrary constant we're good to go that's what we're talking about that's a particular solution if you have it man I'm really going to just beg you to try that one on your own I'm going to erace a little bit give you some time to pause the video try it if you haven't already so here we are let's take our derivative let's plug it in let's verify first let's solve for C second let's rewrite it last again we have that product rule going on there's a function of x times another function of X the derivative of the first the derivative X plus C is 1 1 * cosine X and then we're going to take the first function X plus c times the derivative of the second well the derivative of cosine X is negative sinx so I'm going to put minus derivative of the first * the second plus the first * the derivative of the second which gives us that minus there so that's our first derivative thankfully we don't have to take a second derivative we just have to plug that in so if we do that it says take the first derivative that's all of the stuff we just did plus okay so this is our first derivative we're done with that plus take y That's your original multiply by tangent X and that should yeld cosine X and again this doesn't look quite right well nothing cancels Leonard what in the world are you doing to me here you need some identities because tangent is sin x over cosine X well the cosin are gone we're going to get cosine x minus x c x plus C sin x plus x + C sin x those cosiness are gone because that's part of tangent so if we get rid of those we get cosine equals cosine and that's all you have to do that that's verifying it's it's not fancy Dancy just making sure that when you plug in the derivative in the original function that you actually have a solution there it's a waste of time to do that do anything else if you haven't checked that now now that we've done that we're done with that differential equation we have our solution we know that that's it that's our general solution we just need to find C we can always do that with our initial condition we know that when X is pi that Y is zero oops when X is pi I guess I should replace all the X do you remember what cosine of pi is so s of Pi is 0 cosine 0 is one cos Pi is 1 so C is pi we can rewrite our our general solution with our C we get a particular solution to our differential equation I hope this is making sense that's about as much as I want to show you on how to how to find um particular Solutions given some initial conditions some initial value problems is what they they typically call those there's one more it's kind of a weird one sort of for fun sometimes you'll be asked to do something like um find all the values of a certain variable that make this a solution and we're going to try one of those right now I think the only reason why I'm doing this is because sometimes you get weird stuff you're not used to it you just don't know where to start not that it's really hard it's just you don't know where to start so how in the world do we find all the values of r that make this a solution of that well just follow the process that we just did okay um find derivative plug the stuff in and then you will eventually be able to solve for R I'm going to show you with one of them the rest of them are very similar if you have questions to ask of you like this let's find the second derivative the first derivative remember the chain rule the second derivative gives us R squar so first derivative we get the e to the RX back but the derivative of RX is R do that again we're just going to get r s plug that stuff in so 4 * the seconda equals the first derivative I'm sorry I'm I misspoke there 4 * the second equals the original function right but those are never zero right e to any any power is never never zero so we can divide both sides by e to the RX not worry about dividing by zero these are gone and if we divide we're going to get 4 R2 equal 1 but wait a minute couldn't we just um I do it a number of different ways I suppose could we divide by four take a square root by ways you could subtract the one difference of squares I don't care how you do it what we've just determined is that the only values of R which give us solutions to that differential equation are when R is 1 12 or negative one2 so hopefully you see what I mean by just just follow the the differential equation find the derivatives plug it in eventually the stuff is going to disappear you'll be able to solve for R these are the values that make that a solution of that differential equation man I hope that makes sense to you um so now we should have a pretty good idea about what it takes to solve for a particular solution it takes an initial value problem for a given solution so you have to have the solution first you have to find it or it's going to be given to you you verify it so you find it or verify it plug in the initial value it's going to give you a particular next time we're going to talk about a specific application of this so see you for the next video when we talk about some time rates of change
