Transcript for: Introduction to Time Rate of Change (Differential Equations 5)
welcome back one very important application of differential equations is the manner in which some quantity changes over time well that's that's really we're talking about right is derivatives are our rates of change and we live in time and so things are always changing something really dorky within the time and these are always changing as time goes forward well that's a time rate of change so a time rate of change it really is a look at how some quantity is changing as time changes one of them man biggest things we can talk about the population so populations are always in a state of change populations of bacteria popular human populations about insect populations where you want to talk about populations are almost always changing so we're gonna take just a brief look at how this works I know this is introduction we're gonna get really heavy into this in about 25 more videos okay so we'll get really deep into rates of change in population increase in decrease as it relates to time with death rates and birth rates and all of that wait I was just a brief look at it so here's what we can we can do so the first thing we're gonna do is if we have like key population and T time I want to talk about where these differential equations are even coming from so let's say that we want to determine the rate at which our population is increasing or decreasing not just a population because that's just a census you just count all the people you got it but how it's changing that's important that that's planning that's what's going to happen the feature are we increasing or decreasing how much are we increasing what's it look like so if we want to think about the rate of change of our population as it relates to time well that's a derivative isn't it the way that our population is changing as it relates to time is a derivative of the population function with respect to time so we want to look at that that right there that's a first derivative if I do that that's a differential equation I have nothing over there yeah a minute but that's a derivative of population with respect to time the way that populations changing with respect to time we need to get it in your head that a derivative is a rate of change we need to get in your head that differential equations deal with rates of change so that's why they deal with derivatives is they're looking at the way over how to model these huge math problems based on changing things that wouldn't would say this is the way the population is changing or the rate of increase or decrease of the population with respect to time so according to how time is progressing now it's been studied a lot that typically a lot of times most of the time populations are proportional as sorry let me rephrase the way a population changes the way that increase increases or decreases is proportional to the population itself so the more people you have sometimes the faster the population increases the fewer the people the slower it increases usually makes sense we're gonna for a very simple case we're gonna assume that the way the population changes the rate of change of the population with respect to time is proportional to the population itself when we deal with proportionalities if you want to look back at out direct variation inverse variation that would be like intermediate algebra level whenever we say varies directly or varies inversely we have a K this constant of variation same thing here so our population varies or the rate of change of our population with respect to time is proportional to the population that's some basic stuff that we've had so this is well it might look like where's that coming from it's it's not coming out of nowhere it's saying hey that's the way our population is changing and it's proportional to the population that's it now we've got to be able to solve that I'm gonna how much eat I'm gonna give you this solution because ever talk to you how to find the equation that would work here there's some techniques you're gonna get in the next few videos that show you how to do stuff like this right now everything's been given to you that's okay we're just learning what this stuff means essentially so what where we're at right now is that so now a differential equation look it's got a derivative what's it what's that you mean well this is the rate of change of our population as time goes on how what's it equal to well we understand that the rate of change of a population is proportional to the population itself so that's where that case come in in constant of variation it's a constant so I'm going to give you the general solution of this so our solution notice how this is a derivative of the population so our our population function is going to be our general solution here let's verify that it works remember that this could easily be written as T prime so I know used like Y prime Y double prime before now we're kind of switching over into the more light in his notation of dp/dt derivative population with respect to time I'm gonna use that pretty much throughout the course where I can I prefer it it's more expressive especially when dealing with times for me so let's verify that this right here is actually a solution to that first order first through the differential equation it's kind of derivative in it it's an equation let's see if it actually works so we're going to just like everything else we've done in the previous videos we're going to take the first derivative the derivative of the population with respect to time is well let's see that's a constant there's no product rule this is a chain rule so we have public became first we get back the function times the derivative of our exponent which is just K this is with respect to time let's plug it in so we're gonna put our first derivative we're first derivative goes equals K times the original function what I just gave you are so the thing I'm proposing is our solution and they're exactly the same what that means is that just like before in the last couple videos we did that is in fact a solution to that differential equation this is a general or family of solutions to that differential equation well what's it gonna take to find scene oh yeah we need an initial value so when we're doing this number one or showing we're showing that this is actually solution that we're verifying that number two we're going to solve for C we're going to use it so we're going to use our initial value problem and then we're going to utilize it so let's practice that so step one was coming up with this or that's given to you or understand that rates of change or proportional population a red change population is proportional to the population okay this you're kind of cheating right now I'm giving it to you I will show you how to find that later so given this we verify that that's actually true and now we need something more we need something to find that C to actually use it because if you haven't recognized right now we have two constants that's that that's a bad thing that's because we can't use anything here I tell you how about plug in five years you go okay five but there's nothing there and there's nothing there so you get C to the 5k and there's nothing for you we need to find out what C is we find out what K is so those are those two pieces are found by two different values usually a starting amount and how much you have after some time has passed we need two points here one for the C one for the K the initial value is almost always how you find the C so let me say this how about we start with a thousand buddies that's a lot of money so a thousand buddies at t equals zero we got a thousand bunnies in other words since that's a population function and it's based on T the population at time zero equals a thousand is that looking familiar if you watch the last video is that looking from that hope it's looking familiar because that's an initial value problem that says hey when T is zero population 2000 okie-dokie we can we can do that when T is zero populations a thousand notice we are done with the differential equation all we had to do was verify that's a solution now in future lessons we will be solving this for a solution then using it right now we just verify and you're done you're done with it all you're gonna do now is utilize it so I know but that's our general solution I further know that that's our initial condition let's plug it in it should let us solve for C initial values are what is used to solve for your arbitrary constant the C the proportional constant or the the constant of variation or constant of proportionality that's found by the next piece so differential equation solve it or it's given to you cool verify now we solve for C look if this says whenever T is 0 our population is 1,000 can you see why it's really helpful to have an initial value like T is 0 because at T equals 0 where you start that's important if T wasn't zero you'd still have a K here and you still have a need as some number that's not zero that wouldn't give you one that wouldn't let you solve for C so it's really important and why initial values are helping us solve for C especially in this case is that it zeros out the exponent and e to the zero power is 1 so 1,000 equals C times 1 or C equals 1,000 you man I hope this looks familiar to you like from your calculus 2 days where you'd have something exactly like that and they would say yeah well this is a piece of 0 e to the KT well here's some piece of zero coming from what that's that's the initial population but why are they getting that there for right here because the initial population of population at time 0 the population of time 0 is going to be exactly equal to C that's where that comes from so we know though we found T sorry that we found C is a thousand notice how that works for what I just talked about that's the initial population a thousand monies how do we know that well that's what we start with and we plug in time equals zero that's we start with a thousand bunnies and that's it now well we gotta find the K to really make this useful so we need something else let's say that the population of bunnies tripled in one year's time you know put that in numbers the population trips so what's the population if it tripled be 3000 population tripled in one year's time so T stands for years P at one equals 1,000 after one year we had 3000 because the population triple we can use this now so after we found C we can use this now to find our K our constant of variation so let's plug that in so this says that anytime T is 1 our piece can be 3000 three thousand three thousand one thousand stays he stays the K we're looking for T is 1 because that's after one year does it make sense to you that the first step we should do is goodbye and we'll get three it's triple it should be three hundred percent increases triple e to the K so now we're gonna have to solve for K and remember your logarithms memory your natural log this is 2 and natural log on both sides so k equals Ln 3 and we plug that back in to what we already had 1,000 a to the KT becomes 1000 E to the LM 3 times T because our Kahless natural log of 3 so let's go ahead and let's let's find out let's use this to find the population in a little while time so if you want a little recap we start with the difference of the places we solve it somehow or it's given to us we verify immediately verified after that we know we have a general solution it's going to take two pieces of information one is going to be well an initial population so at time 0 how much did you start with that's going to solve for C for you next we'll need what happens in a little while time so some definable amount of time like 1 year 2 years 1 month 1 minute whatever it is plug that in and it's going to let you find your K how we can use this for practically anything how many buddies are going to be around in 3 a half years probably probably a lot so let's find P of 3 point 5 one more thing you might want to do just to make this not as obnoxious here you can do some mathematical razzle-dazzle with that if you have Ln of 3t and exponent remember I'm gonna do a little little sub note here remember that X to the M times n is X to the M to the N you know what's that doing e to the ln 3 times T is e to the Ln 3 to the T power but because you have E and Ln composed on one another you have inverses in the composition these are gone you're gonna get 3 so you can rewrite a lot of these by just doing well this is going to be one of gravity 1000 times 3 to the T that makes things a lot more concise what where'd that come from well you have a multiplication of exponents that's an excellent race to an exponent e to the Ln 3 is just 3 so you have 3 to the team try it both ways if you'd like see if it actually works I'm just I'm begging you right now just he's still multiply those of you 3,000 bacon ok just bacon that breaks court operations excellence before multiplication you'll notice I have 3.5 sylheti because I want to see where it comes from now if I want to find out how many bunnies we got in 3.5 years just plug in 3.5 for that team oh my gosh if you did that yourself three to the 3.5 I hope I did my math right three and 3.5 is big times a thousand I have forty six thousand seven hundred sixty-six rabbits or there abouts if my math was ready to be quick but that's buddies in three years they're bunnies they guess they do stuff anyway so race to change that that's what differential equations are in the first place so these are just with respect to time populations things that grow over time that's that's what a time rate of change is it's a differential equation that's specifically geared towards time as the independent variable done exactly the same way as far as verifying done exactly the same way as far as you need an initial condition to find a particular solution in this case they eliminate your arbitrary constant that's exactly what we were doing last video the K part of it you need something else for that so you need where are you in a finite amount of time that will let you solve for K after you have used your initial condition use that first then once you've found the constant arbitrary constant and the constant of variation your K you can use for lots of things how many bunnies you're gonna have three and a half years lots of bunnies or your dog cute or whatever else you have how much you can have in 20 years if this holds up now later on we're gonna talk about stuff like a limiting factor on population there's there's a carrying capacity we don't just get to multiply forever and expect that the same areas gonna sit to sustain this population of bodies so there's going to be birth rates and death rates this would be the case if none of the bunnies died but we know that bunnies do die and more bunnies are born and things like that so we're gonna have some more robust examples later on this is just get your feet wet understand difference with collisions as they relate to time I hope that makes sense I hope that you guys stick around for the next ones we're gonna start learning how to actually solve some differential equations from scratch without being given the solution next time thanks for watching you
