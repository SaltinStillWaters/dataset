Transcript for: Separable Equations with Initial Values (Differential Equations 13)
hey there welcome to another video we're gonna stick with the same exact technique that we just learned this solving differential equations with separation of variables these so these separable equations or we can group Y and dy on one side X in the X on the other side only now we have initial value problems that list of this this video is very straightforward there's nothing more I'm gonna teach you besides the fact that you gotta plug that in to solve for your arbitrary constant the only the thing that I want to say about that is that sometimes it's really beneficial to plug it in as early as possible and sometimes it's not so depend on where the problem is we oftentimes want to plug in our initial value before we solve for y it helps us out occasionally especially when we have exponents so like e to the something so we want to group that either the C call that a constant and plug in our initial value right then so we're gonna explore that for about six examples we'll go through it not a whole lot of fancy stuff here again I'm sort of trying to review these ideas of integrals with you so so many great techniques but mostly when I would go about plugging in that initial value to get rid of arbitrary constants so we're using the same idea of separation of variables acceptable equations and then we're just plugging in because we want to get away from a general solution which has that arbitrary constant to a particular solution this one function that goes through this one point that satisfies that differential equation let's look at a few of them right now so we got a differential equation that's equal to dy DX equals y times e of X so we're noticing first write to that that we have derivative equal to product with X's and Y's that's exactly what we're looking for for separation separable equations so these separation of variables so we're gonna do that we want to group our Y and dy on one side X and DX on others just like that maybe / why leave the atd-x and move our DX over now we can take an integral we know that integrals undo derivatives so we can integrate both sides on the left-hand side we get this a lot this Ln absolute value of Y on the right hand side in the easiest integral or derivative ever thank you we just need the X but we also get an arbitrary constant how often we'll call this C sub 1 because we can change that now here's something you need to know even if we change that C sub 1 because we're about to get an exponential on this even if you get that to be like a plus or minus e to the C sub 1 and you call it C that's okay so sometimes it's beneficial for us to do all of that work and then plug in that initial value let me show you that right now so if we have Ln absolute value y equals all this garbage well we know that in order to get rid of natural log we need a base of e so e to this side will equal absolute value y that would be e to the e to the X plus C 1 that looks really awkward so let's fix just a little bit of it let's take this we know that if exponents are multiplied that they came from sorry if exponents are added they came from bases that are multiplied so absolute value of y equals e to the C sub 1 times e to the e to the X common bases being multiplied gives us X months that are being added I just switched the order also we know that absolute value Y would equal plus or minus e to the C sub 1 times e to the e to the X now I want to show you that this is possible this is why we didn't plug this in earlier we could have taken this initial value plugged it right there and solve for C that would have been fine we would have had 0 for X giving us 1 we would have had to e for our Ln giving us probably you're giving us Ln of 2 e and we can separate that we get Ln of 2 plus Ln of E which gave us 1 subtract 1 from both sides C would equal Ln of 2 you can totally do that and then this would be Ln 2 that would be Ln 2 we'd get e to the Ln 2 oh my gosh e to the Ln 2 is 2 so what we're gonna find out later is that this is going to be 2 you can do exactly the same thing later on so if we call all of this just C let's just call that Big C we've done that many times then y equals C e to the e to the X once you've got there we need to get rid of that that C and so how we go about doing that is by using our initial value we're saying this is a family of curves an infinite family of curves that don't intersect that means that only one of them is going to go through that point so let's find the C that makes that happen why is to e when x is 0 so e to the 0 is 1 which means that we have to e equals C times e let's divide both sides by e C is 2 so y equals to e to the e to the X that right there is no longer a general solution that's a particular solution to the one equation the one solution that goes through that point and still satisfies that differential equation that's what we're looking for now I mentioned to you before I said in words but what if you had gone ahead and plug in this even here I don't know if I would do that probably wait till here but it doesn't doesn't matter watch so if I plug in to e for Y and 0 for x well this right here is a product now Tullius positive so we can drop the absolute value but a product and logarithms can be split up by addition element of e you just compose two inverse functions so what that's going to give you is just one ones are gone if you subtract one from both sides and see 1 would equal an element 2 so look what happens here if we had this let's move all the way down to 2 Heat let's move down here so [Music] if we know that C sub 1 is ln2 it's all positive we don't get worried about the absolute value anymore but e to the element 2 would give us the same exact thing we found here question is which way sees you that's subjective which makes easier for you for me personally I liked wrapping all of this up as a gigantic C and then plug it in my initial value you can do that lots of times sometimes it is beneficial to plug it in earlier so that's really up to you does it really matter no but for some problems one way is a little bit easier so keep that in mind as you're going through this is still the same separate variables integrate but now at some point we're plugging in our initial value and we're going from our general solution to a specific particular solution using that initial value let's try a couple more so next up the first thing we're looking for we have a differential equation we see a big product in their group or Y is dy group or X is DX so 1 over Y squared plus 1 D by looks good on the right hand side 3x squared DX that's fine we know that we're going to integrate as soon as that happens so Y is group with dy x is group of DX on the left hand side user tables you can do a trick so if you really want to but if we're going to to integrate quickly and effectively it often times a difference with ways we're using tables that's tan inverse of y equals integral of 3x squared is X cubed so the derivative X cubed is 3x squared going backwards we get X cubed but we'd have to tack on a constant now this is one of those cases where I would almost certainly plug in my initial value right here because otherwise you'd have to undo a lot of work to solve for the C did you see if you go y equals tangent of x cubed plus C which we're about to do I mean we can sulfur if tan inverse of y equals sort of an expression that y equals tangent of that same expression if we start plugging in numbers here we're gonna have to do a tan inverse anyway do you guys get that so if we start plugging in things now we're gonna have to go backwards from exactly where we're at here so it benefits us to plug in our initial value before we solve for y in this case so you just have to be case-by-case specific is it going to benefit me to plug it in now well no too much work no too much work no too much work after this looked pretty good here it's too much work first to go backwards so at this point tan inverse of y equals x cubed plus C let's plug in our initial value and let's see if we can solve for C so Y is 0 equals 1 says that Y is 1 when x is 0 that's pretty nice because all we have to figure out is how much tan inverse of 1 is and that says what what angle when you take tangent of it gives you 1 so tangent of what angle gives you 1 in the first quadrant if you can well that's gonna be PI over 4 tangent of PI over 4 is 1 so tan inverse of 1 is PI over 4 PI over 4 equals C and now when we plug that back in so we're gonna get that tan inverse of y equals x cubed plus PI over 4 that's a little bit nicer for us to go from that at that point rather than get to y equals a tangent and then have to go backwards behind C anyway so if you find yourself going backwards a lot plug in your initial value sooner if you find yourself doing way too much work to solve for your seat plug in your initial value later in that problem so it really depends on what problem you're on whether you plug in addition value earlier later a lot of times it's plugged in before you solve for y sometimes it's not so tan inverse of y equals some expression that means y equals tangent of expression X cube plus we don't have a + anymore we use that you start our point to say this is this narrows it down instead of a general solution with a + C we have a specific solution that would go through that point and still satisfies our differential equation I hope this is making sense to you that you get that I'm not really teaching you anything new as far as a technique of integrating and or anything like that what I'm teaching you is where you should plug in your initial value and it depends on whether or not you'd have to go backwards what so if you solve only for white go backwards to find your C or not so sometimes it's easier at one way or another let's do this last one I'll give you three more that I would like you to pause and try on your own so here we have a derivative of y with respect to x equals y times cotangent X that looks pretty good because it's a project let's a group our X's DX on the right side our Y is dy on the other side so 1 over Y dy equals cotangent X DX we have an initial value we'll take care of it just a little bit now we're going to integrate on the left hand side we get natural log absolute value I get lots of times on the right hand side you of man cotangent X what in the world is that well let's use our integration tables so instead of reinventing the wheel here the these are all techniques from Cal 2 but we all have them kind of down so I look that up and say ok that's a natural log of sine X and we're gonna get some sort of a constant out of that so natural log of absolute value y equals natural log absolute value sign X plus C let's see what we can do with that now because we have a lot of we would have potentially a lot of work to do to solve for C right now I'm used to the same technique I had here so you're gonna find that plugging in after you wrap up all your e to the C garbage if you have LNS is a technique that we use a lot so I wait on those natural logarithms until I get that that arbitrary constant of C sub 1 and to be like a bigger expression where wrap it up do it into a bigger C and then I'll plug in my my initial value that works for me very well if I don't have that most time I plug it in as soon as possible so now we're kind of narrowing down when do i plug in that initial value well if we have a lot of Exponential's going on where I can start wrapping up a C in a bigger expression that saves me some work saves me going through that expression again if I don't have that well I can sell for plus C as soon as possible and then solve for y with an actual number instead of a seen let's see what I mean here so Ellen F sub n y equals ln f sub-l you sign x plus c1 well we know that we're gonna have erased on both sides so exponential 2 exponent equals argument so e to the Ln absolute value sign X let's see 1 you've done this many times now so I'm gonna separate this into a product of common bases and we know that when you compose two functions that are inverses they eliminate each other they undo each other so I'm going to do two things no absolute value of y I can write this as y equals 4 plus or minus e to the C sub 1 I can also eliminate my en el in and just get sine X next up what would you do here so if we had that we had this like on a test or something would you wrap this up or would you plug in your initial value you plug in your initial value now notice all the work you have to do to get to that see that's that's not very fun if I wait just a moment and say I'm gonna call all this stuff see yeah we'll have to go backwards a little bit but it's a lot easier to see what that Steve is because even here we have a lot of elements going on to unpack all that garbage you have to have Ln of some expression PI over 2 sine is sine of PI over 2 Ln of that now is that a big deal in this case you know they're both PI over 2 is you subtract them you can get what you what you want out of that but here would be a little bit nicer so this says that Y is PI over 2 people C times sine of PI over 2 you need know a sine of PI over 2 is so sine of cosine and sine and I'm sorry sine and cosine of our normal well typical angles are really important to have them having them right so sine of 0 0 cosine of 0 is 1 sine of PI over 2 is 1 cosine PI over 2 is 0 so I know that that's 1 which means that PI over 2 is equal to C that would have been oh that's a lot easier than plugging in first if we plugged in here we can spend a lot of time solving for C but with Exponential's oftentimes it's easiest to wrap up that e to the C sub 1 plus or minus as an arbitrary constant and then right after that plug in your initial value that'll save you some headaches so I know that it's hopefully it's not ambiguous system when you're plugging in right now with Exponential's if you can wrap up the plus C you know you're gonna be able to wrap up the plus C and in something like a seen won't either the C 1 an exponential or a plus and minus that or changing your signs and get rid of constants by wrapping it up into a bigger of arbitrary constant wait to plug in your initial value if you know you're not gonna be able to do that plug it in as soon as possible so that's that's how I approach these problems so here we're almost done all we need to do is write this as y equals PI over 2 sine X done that's it are you getting it are you understanding why I'm plugging in my initial value sometimes soon and sometimes not soon it all has to do with the form of our problem if we're able to wrap up our constant into something larger like that this becomes a bigger see if you will it's best to wait if you're not able to do that it's best to do your initial value sooner we have three more I'm gonna go through pretty quickly but and when I write them on the board I'd like you to pause the video and try them on your own see if you can work your way through think about when you would plug in that initial value okay so if you want a challenge I would say try these three there's some weird stuff going on which is why we're doing them and I'm sure you exactly how to go through and how to approach this sort of a problem but if you'd like to here's the hint some give you the hints and then I'll go through them pretty quickly but I'll be explaining everything for you so first one that can be rid of several separable as a separable equation but you've got to add the X and factor so see if you can factor that this one well that's an exponential with exponent that are subtracted see if you can separate the exponent last one actual essence pretty good so that's what's not not too bad it's already set up pretty well for you so if you want it if you want to challenge see if you can do these ones I'm gonna get started right about now so first first example can we write in a separable equation that's our primary goal right now because well honestly it's the only technique you know but other than that it's the easiest technique that we have it doesn't involve a lot of setup but some of the other techniques do involve so here let's see if we can if we have more than just two big fat tubing terms on one on each side we're going to need to group our terms and see if we can factor so in this case that involves adding Y and see if we can factor out an of course we can we can factor GCF of Y what that's doing with the ideas is you need products right so you need just factors that are multiplied together if you have more than that if you have so that's being added and subtracted you need to be able to factor in order for this technique to work that's looking pretty good we factor out our why'd we get 2 x squared plus 1 now we can leave this divided by X divided by Y and move our DX so we can write this as our variables group together 1 over d / 1 over yd y equals 2x squared plus 1 over X DX now we're ready to take that integral on the left hand side pretty straightforward on the right hand side notice that we can separate this if we separate these fractions we get 2x plus 1 over X DX we separate this we have 2x squared over X is 2x 1 over X is of course 1 or X so when we do our integrals element absolute value Y is pretty good this is just x squared this is Ln absolute value of X and then we get this plus c1 notice what's happening what's happening is I'm going to have e to all this side I'm gonna have an EC 1 I'm gonna have a plus a months I'm gonna wait to plug in my initial value now could you do it now absolutely but it gets a little tricky what you leave in terms of E and what you don't so right now I'm gonna either way you want to go and you'll be fine but I'm gonna wait just a little bit what I'm going to do is understand that exponential undoes logarithms I'm going to have e to the x squared + Ln absolute value of x plus C sub 1 I'm also going to split this up I know that exponents being added came from common bases being multiplied so I'm gonna put my e to the C sub 1 first I'm gonna have multiple we should be multiplied e to the x squared + e to the Ln absolute value of X well that that's great because we can take this absolute value of X which is going to have a plus and minus in it and a plus and minus right here and say let's just wrap all of that up with a plus and minus e to the C 1 we'll have an e to the x squared but e to the Ln X gives us just thanks that's great actually almost done so if we would write this what we're gonna do is we're gonna group all of this and say hey you know what that's still a constant C sub 1 is a constant e to the C sub 1 is a constant whether you have positive or negative you're still gonna have a constant let's call that Big C so y equals C times X e to the x squared I'm just moving my X into the front if you're wondering well what about the absolute value it's wrapped up in that plus and that positive negative so we can wrap both sides absolute value would just give us a positive negative whatever we have there so we wrap that up and now we can plug in our initial value so Y is 1 when X is 1 well what that means C times 1 times e to the first is just C times e if we solve for C we get want to read which changes our our solution here to 1 over e X to the x times e to the x squared you know that that's not what my SLM answer looks like in the back of the book or if this came out of book or if you're doing it on a test or whatever you doing that's not it looks like that's because of this many times if you have a constant with a base that's the same as some other exponential that you have we can rewrite this 1 over e is the same as either than they need 1 we do that if we put in the back it's pretty easy to see that we now have a common basis which is why have you wrote it as me to the negative one to show we have a common basis if we have common basis what do you do there exponents let's see multiplication of home bases we would add our exponents so y equals x e to the x squared minus 1 x squared plus negative 1 is x squared minus 1 that's the way to approach that problem so same ideas may be factored if you have more than just stuff being multiplied you're gonna have the fact to create those products so we factored we move our X's and Y's and the purpose side with dy DX the integral is pretty easy here and then I'm always gonna follow this pattern of if I have an Ln if I know I'm gonna have an exponential over here and it's all raised to an exponent or not just little pieces but all of it and I know I'm gonna get an e to the C sub when I normally get a plus and minus I'm gonna wait to plug in that initial value if not I'm gonna plug it in early let's check out the last unit so this next one looks really tricky one idea here is that if you have to separate your variables then you have to separate any Exponential's that contain both your variables which means if you have 6 e to the 2x times e to the negative Y if exponents are being added or subtracted we can split them up by positive or negative multiplication X those common bases to those exponents could you have also put e to the 2x over e to the Y absolutely that's fine in fact that might be a little bit easier for you to see of the next step so if I've got my X's here and I leave my constants remember that we leave our constants on the x side I'm gonna move this over here so we would have either 1 over e to the negative 1 dy equals 6 e to the 2x DX or if you really think about it that's just e to the Y which would be what you did if you divided by e to the Y here ya but I'm gonna get either why that would probably be an easier way to do it I improved my Y's and dy I've broke my xdx were ready to integrate it's looking really solid I love either the Y it's just going to give you either one on the right hand side six either 2x you you wanna think of the use up here for 2x so ii u equals 2x the derivative would be 2 DX so I'm going to be dividing by 2 but one of the easiest ways that I go through it is I think well what's the regular integral of this and I divide by the derivative of the inside so I'll get my six I'll get my either 2x I'm going to divide by the derivative of that because that's how those of you cells work I'm gonna divide by 2 how am I gonna + C so let's simplify et to the y equals 3 e to the 2x plus c1 now I've already got an exponent here so if I have an exponent here I'm not gonna be getting e to the C sub 1 I'm not gonna wait to plug this in I don't have any Ln s I'm not going to be getting that plus and minus e to the C sub 1 idea I'm gonna plug in my initial value now so I have an exponential but an exponential is not going to yield more Exponential's they would be able to deal bog rhythms which be harder to deal with so if you find yourself like I'm having to go backwards on this Y would be solved for but if I wanted to try and see if you wrapped up in a longer than that that's not created wrapped up an exponential sure you can call that C so as you call already to see also but it's it's just easier to plug it in now so if we plug in 0 for Y and 0 for X we'd have e to the 0 for y 3 times e to the 0 for X plus C sub 1 e to the 0 is 1 e to the 0 is 1 times 3 which means our C sub 1 equals negative 2 so subtract 3 from both sides we get negative 2 now let's plug that back in so we'll take our negative 2 and just change our equation from where we started plugging our initial value to having that constant of negative two so just minus 2 now when we solve for y we're not going to have to backtrack to plug in 4 for that constant you see if e to the y equals this expression over here if we do ln on both sides so e to the Y was this then y equals Ln of that done if you did it another way if you had y equals all this stuff plus c1 you would have to start undoing the logarithm to be able to figure out what that C would actually be now I want to avoid that for you that leads to a lot of mistakes makes it harder makes you students going whether I don't understand you that's why sometimes why it why not others if you know that you're gonna be getting et to something with it c1 wait if you're not it's best to plug it in as soon as possible it's the idea mm-hmm okay last one that we got that one set a pretty straightforward so we have some X's here against and Y's here we're just switching we're gonna make sure that we set this up as function of Y dy equals function of X DX then we integrate now when stuff doesn't look familiar to you or look good changing it so one over cosine squared Y doesn't look that great ago I had that's not on my table well yeah of course on your table because if secant is 1 over cosine one over cosine gives you secant and if 1 over cosine squared is what you have then you're gonna have secant squared so on the left hand side we have an integral of secant squared Y dy it's actually nice on the right-hand side we've got an integral of 1/2 X to the negative 1/2 which we had in the previous video well that is going to give us on the right-hand side we keep up 1/2 we always add to our exponent so it's 1/2 over 1/2 and our 1/2 sargon what's C sub 1 on the left-hand side well that this got nice the integral is secant squared Y dy is just tangent Y the derivative of the tangent Y gives you C and squared so then your old secant squared gives us tangent Y so we know that tangent line equals square root of x plus C sub 1 x to the 1/2 that's all we've got that the square root of x plus c1 now think in your head is this going to give you any exponents e to the c1 stuff like that if the answer's no then plug in your initial value now if the answer is yes then you wait until you wrap it up in that larger arbitrary constant then you plug in your initial value so right now I know that Y of 4 equals PI over 4 that means that Y is PI over 4 when X is 4 so tangent PI over 4 equals square root of 4 plus C sub 1 y becomes PI over 4 X becomes 4 and this is really nice because tangent of PI over 4 is 1 we got that square root of 4 is 2 plus C sub one that says C sub 1 equals negative 1 let's just plug that back in so from where we started plugging in our initial value from right here we have tangent of y equals the square root of x minus 1 if you did it to plug in the initial value now and you solved for y you'd have to be going backwards a lot to figure out what that constant is now if we have tangent of y equals our rushon we know if tangent y equals an expression y equals tan inverse of that expression that's a particular solution to that differential equation that goes through that point that's what we're looking at doing with initial values so not much of a difference besides understanding when to plug in that initial value that hopefully will help you a lot because that's really explained like when do you plug it in soon when you play it later do you plug it in the same place every time no you don't well at least not according to me I textbooks don't really explain that some teachers don't explain that very well like why they're plugging in certain times or places so hopefully that makes sense to the next video we're going to talk about we're going to talk about how we can solve a whole bunch of real-life sort of big problems differential equations with this technique so I'll see you over the next section when we do applications with separable equations by separating our variables every day you
