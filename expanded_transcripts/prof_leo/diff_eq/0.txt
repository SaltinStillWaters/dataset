Transcript for: The Plan for Differential Equations (Differential Equations 1)
Hey so welcome back now if you watch the update the August 2018 update you heard that I'm filming differential equations I'm really excited about it I've been waiting a long time to do this now who's going to do it years later after I finished all of my other videos to support it but I know you'd need it and so we're taking a break from some of the lower-level stuff and we're gonna get onto differential equations and it's gonna happen soon so I want to be specific on what you can expect so that I'm I don't want you expecting something I'm not able to give as I mentioned in that that update I'm doing this on my own time so it's I'm not filming this in front of any students which means I'm doing this after hours I'm kind of dropping some classes so that I can do this for you guys so with that being said it's going to take a little bit longer than a semester to film I'm starting in mid September at posting videos and what you can expect is at least one video a day on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays I'm going to keep that up until we're finished now the good news is that because I'm not constricted by time this is going to be a very very in-depth course so we're gonna do a tremendous amount of examples like crazy lots of examples because I want you to get the picture of what's going on well I might not be doing all the proofs some of them frankly above the level of the class and it's it wouldn't help you understand it I will absolutely make sure that you do understand what is going on why we're doing it and where we're going like I always do so that's what you can expect another thing that I want to say is just a word of encouragement when you start DIF with equations the first part of it you're going to put in the world as this because it's it's kind of intimidating frankly when you look at it you go wow there's a lot of word problems yeah there are it's that's a good thing because it shows you where we're actually using the math that you learned in all of calculus which is fantastic but it can be intimidating let me give you a word of encouragement if you're here and you take a calc 1 count 2 at least that and if you take a calculate that's awesome you're gonna be fine you're gonna understand stop follow the videos stick with me and you will do okay that it's not all that bad it just seems bad when you started okay so I'll make it understandable for you don't let let all the the textbook jargon and everyone else tell you that you can't do it you can certainly do it okay put your mind to it stick with it and put in the time and you can do this so that's gonna be awesome we're gonna have a great time it's gonna be a lot of fun it will be different because I'm not filming it in front of any students I'm gonna talk directly to the camera there won't be any distractions but there also won't be as many questions so there is a double-edged sword I think it's gonna go really well I really don't have any other alternatives so this is what you're gonna get from me I hope that that satisfies you I hope that you'll watch the video stick with them and I really hope that you make this stuff understandable for you thanks again for watching support me on patreon and visit me on Facebook if you would all right I'll see you soon you
